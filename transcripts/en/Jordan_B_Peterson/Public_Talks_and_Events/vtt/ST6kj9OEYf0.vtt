00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.060

<v Speaker 2>If you can't take away,</v>

4
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 3>mama has systematically rebuild the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust of the world in our willingness to</v>

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:43.810
<v Speaker 3>work through the Security Council and </v>
<v Speaker 3>other incidence rate.</v>

6

<v Speaker 3>You must not talk to anybody in the </v>

7
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 3>any of our allies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If whatever you want to call this system</v>

8
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:53.660
<v Speaker 3>a mafia state of feudal empire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a disaster for ordinary Russians,</v>

9
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.000
<v Speaker 1>brilliant minds.</v>

12
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 3>my has systematically rebuilt the trust </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world in our willingness to work </v>

13
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:26.060
<v Speaker 3>through the Security Council and other </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions.</v>

14
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.910
<v Speaker 3>You must not talk to anybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

15
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 3>any of our allies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if whatever you want to call this system</v>

16
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 3>a mafia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>state of feudal empire,</v>

17
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.130
<v Speaker 3>it's a disaster for ordinary Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the kind of hypocritical </v>

18
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.971
<v Speaker 3>argument that if I were Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find quite annoying for the Chinese </v>

19
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:46.520
<v Speaker 3>leg can be described.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The in management,</v>

20
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 3>science and religion are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>incompatible.</v>

21
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.440
<v Speaker 3>We're indigenous forces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice people to do unkind things.</v>

22
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obsolete and my conclusion to this </v>

23
00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.810
<v Speaker 3>question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

24
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.010
<v Speaker 3>I won't let you be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You show me your work pretext.</v>

25
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.020
<v Speaker 3>I quoted them saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show me how you can keep screaming and </v>

26
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't change the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do not want sympathy.</v>

27
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 3>We do not want pity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want opportunities.</v>

28
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 3>It's an appalling splenda to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Muslim religion.</v>

29
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.730
<v Speaker 3>I never said the word Muslim in my film </v>
<v Speaker 3>nation.</v>

30
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 3>It was a Muslim free foam in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that kind of restraint?</v>

31
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 3>It is that kind of sober minded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensible,</v>

32
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 3>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy that Obama represents.</v>

33
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 3>So I guess what I'm telling you is he </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a closet Canadian vote for him.</v>

34
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 3>For God.</v>

50
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.541

51
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 4>series in every aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was his passion for ideas,</v>

<v Speaker 4>his love for debate that inspired our </v>
<v Speaker 4>creation in 2008,</v>

53
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 4>and it was his energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his generosity and his drive that was so</v>

54
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:07.831
<v Speaker 4>important in allowing us to really win </v>
<v Speaker 4>international acclaim as one of the </v>

<v Speaker 4>Last fall,</v>

58
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:20.131

59
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:23.521
<v Speaker 4>health here in Toronto,</v>

<v Speaker 4>thousands.</v>

61
00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:25.490
<v Speaker 5>It's a million Canadians to come.</v>

<v Speaker 4>many more years to come.</v>

68
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.710
<v Speaker 4>Now knowing our benefactor as we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last thing he'd want is for us to </v>

69
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 4>mark his absence with a moment of </v>
<v Speaker 4>silence.</v>

70
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.410
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't his style,</v>

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 4>the next hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

122
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:11.721
<v Speaker 4>my favorite part aspect of this show </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was Peter's brilliance and </v>

123
00:10:11.721 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 4>creation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have our countdown clock.</v>

124
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 4>What this does is it keeps our debaters </v>
<v Speaker 4>on their toes and our debate on time.</v>

125
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 4>So when you see these clocks on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>screen,</v>

126
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:24.750
<v Speaker 4>go down to zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted you to join me in a warm round of</v>

127
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:29.751
<v Speaker 4>applause and we'll have a debate that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ends when it's supposed to end a.</v>

128
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see,</v>

129
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 4>we had our resolution tonight on the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

130
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:41.871
<v Speaker 4>We had this audience of roughly 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 4>people here in downtown Toronto vote on </v>

131
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 4>be it resolved or what you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>political correctness.</v>

132
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 4>I call progress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see the agree,</v>

133
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 4>disagree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number.</v>

134
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 4>Thirty six percent agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sixty four percent disagree.</v>

135
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:57.891
<v Speaker 4>So room and play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we asked you how many of you are </v>

136
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 4>open to changing your vote over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>course of debate?</v>

137
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Are you fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agree,</v>

138
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 4>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or could you potentially be convinced by</v>

139
00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:11.271
<v Speaker 4>one or other of these two teams to move </v>
<v Speaker 4>your vote over the next hour and a half?</v>

140
00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:14.700
<v Speaker 4>Let's see those numbers now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

141
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.800
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A pretty open minded crowd.</v>

142
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:21.801
<v Speaker 4>This debate is very much in play and as </v>
<v Speaker 4>per the agreed upon order of speakers.</v>

143
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to call and Michelle Goldberg </v>
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

144
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you like I said,</v>

145
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:26.640
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you gonna?</v>

146
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:29.100
<v Speaker 4>Have a sip of water before you start a </v>
<v Speaker 4>column.</v>

147
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 4>Michelle Goldberg first for her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six minutes of opening remarks.</v>

148
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you for having me.</v>

149
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 4>And as I initially bumped a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the resolution that we're debating </v>

150
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:46.190
<v Speaker 4>because there are a lot of things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fall under the rubric of political </v>

151
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.800
<v Speaker 4>correctness that I don't call a </v>
<v Speaker 4>progress.</v>

152
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't like no platforming or twitter </v>
<v Speaker 4>or trigger warnings.</v>

153
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like a lot of</v>

154
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.070
<v Speaker 6>middle aged liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are many aspects of students' </v>

155
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 6>social justice culture that I find off </v>
<v Speaker 6>putting,</v>

156
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 6>although I'm not sure that that </v>
<v Speaker 6>particular generation gap is anything,</v>

157
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.240
<v Speaker 6>is anything new.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm on the record about the toxicity of </v>

158
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:09.240
<v Speaker 6>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 6>call out culture,</v>

159
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 6>and I think it's good to debate people </v>
<v Speaker 6>whose ideas I don't like,</v>

160
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.610
<v Speaker 6>which is why I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

161
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 6>so if there are social justice warriors </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the audience,</v>

162
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I should apologize to you </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I'm probably not.</v>

163
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:24.760
<v Speaker 6>You're probably gonna feel like I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 6>adequately defending your ideas,</v>

164
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.720
<v Speaker 6>but the reason I'm on this side of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>stage is that political correctness </v>

165
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.640
<v Speaker 6>isn't just a term for left wing excesses</v>
<v Speaker 6>on college campuses or people being </v>

166
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 6>terrible on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially as deployed by Mr Peterson.</v>

167
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 6>I think it can be a way to diligence </v>
<v Speaker 6>itemize any attempt for women and racial</v>

168
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:50.011
<v Speaker 6>and sexual minorities to overcome </v>
<v Speaker 6>discrimination were even to argue that </v>

169
00:12:50.011 --> 00:12:52.510
<v Speaker 6>such discrimination is real in the New </v>
<v Speaker 6>York Times today.</v>

170
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.610
<v Speaker 6>Mr Peterson says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

171
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:01.290
<v Speaker 6>the people who hold that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that our culture isn't an oppressive </v>

172
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.171
<v Speaker 6>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't want to admit that the </v>

173
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:04.171
<v Speaker 6>current hierarchy might be predicated on</v>
<v Speaker 6>competence.</v>

174
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:09.330
<v Speaker 6>That sounds particularly insane to me </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I'm an American and our </v>

175
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:09.970
<v Speaker 6>president is Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but um,</v>

176
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.650
<v Speaker 6>but it's an assumption that I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>underlies a worldview in which any </v>

177
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 6>challenges to the current hierarchy are </v>
<v Speaker 6>written off as political correctness.</v>

178
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.860
<v Speaker 6>I also think we should be clear that </v>
<v Speaker 6>this isn't really a debate about free </v>

179
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:25.860
<v Speaker 6>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

180
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:31.050
<v Speaker 6>Mr Peterson once referred to what he </v>
<v Speaker 6>called quote that evil trinity of </v>

181
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 6>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>diversity and inclusivity,</v>

182
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:37.290
<v Speaker 6>and said those three words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you hear people mouth those three </v>

183
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:37.290
<v Speaker 6>words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>equity,</v>

184
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.410
<v Speaker 6>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and inclusivity,</v>

185
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.440
<v Speaker 6>you know who you're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you should step away from that </v>

186
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.931
<v Speaker 6>because it is not acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He argues that the movie frozen is </v>

187
00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:49.651
<v Speaker 6>politically correct propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And at one point he floated the idea of </v>

188
00:13:49.651 --> 00:13:54.421
<v Speaker 6>creating a database of university course</v>
<v Speaker 6>content so students could avoid </v>

189
00:13:54.421 --> 00:13:54.700
<v Speaker 6>postmodern critical theory.</v>

190
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 6>So in the criticism of political </v>
<v Speaker 6>correctness,</v>

191
00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:02.941
<v Speaker 6>I sometimes hear an urge or an attempt </v>
<v Speaker 6>to purge our thought of certain </v>

192
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:08.281
<v Speaker 6>analytical categories that mirrors,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the worst characatures of the </v>

193
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:13.501
<v Speaker 6>social justice left,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that wants to get rid of anything that </v>

194
00:14:13.501 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 6>smacks of colonialism or patriarchy or </v>
<v Speaker 6>white supremacy.</v>

195
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 6>I also don't really think we're debating</v>
<v Speaker 6>the value of the enlightenment,</v>

196
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.630
<v Speaker 6>at least not in the way that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 6>like Mr Frye.</v>

197
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think as a champion of enlightenment,</v>

198
00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:29.191
<v Speaker 6>values frames it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the efforts to expand rights and </v>

199
00:14:29.191 --> 00:14:32.341
<v Speaker 6>privileges once granted just to land </v>
<v Speaker 6>owning white heterosexual men is the </v>

200
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 6>enlightenment or is very much in keeping</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the enlightenment.</v>

201
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.870
<v Speaker 6>To quote a dead white man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>John Stuart Mill,</v>

202
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:45.930
<v Speaker 6>the despotism of custom is everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the standing hindrance to human </v>

203
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.190
<v Speaker 6>advancement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

204
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.200
<v Speaker 6>I think that some of our opponents by </v>
<v Speaker 6>contrast frame challenges to the </v>

205
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.430
<v Speaker 6>despotism of customs as politically </v>
<v Speaker 6>correct attacks on a transcendent </v>

206
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 6>natural order.</v>

207
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.240
<v Speaker 6>To quote Mr Peterson again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>each gender,</v>

208
00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 6>each sector has its own unfairness to </v>
<v Speaker 6>deal with.</v>

209
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.360
<v Speaker 6>But to think of it as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the shoulders of the social structure,</v>

210
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:11.270
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come on really what about nature itself?</v>

211
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.440
<v Speaker 6>But there is an exception to this </v>
<v Speaker 6>because he does believe in social </v>

212
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.860
<v Speaker 6>interventions to remedy some kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>unfairness,</v>

213
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.280
<v Speaker 6>which is why in the New York Times he </v>
<v Speaker 6>calls for quote enforcement Origami to </v>

214
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 6>remedy the woes of men who don't get </v>
<v Speaker 6>their equal distribution of sex.</v>

215
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to the political </v>

216
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.631
<v Speaker 6>correctness debate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've been exactly here before Alan </v>

217
00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:39.340
<v Speaker 6>Blum,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the author of the clothing of the </v>

218
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.691
<v Speaker 6>American mind compared the tyranny of </v>
<v Speaker 6>feminism in academia to the Khmer Rouge,</v>

219
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:46.210
<v Speaker 6>and he was writing at a time when women </v>
<v Speaker 6>accounted for 10 percent of all college </v>

220
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.921
<v Speaker 6>tenured faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's worth looking back at what was </v>

221
00:15:50.921 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 6>considered annoyingly outrageously </v>
<v Speaker 6>politically correct in the 19 eighties.</v>

222
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.450
<v Speaker 6>The last time we had this debate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

223
00:15:56.451 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 6>having to call or not being able to call</v>
<v Speaker 6>indigenous people,</v>

224
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.100
<v Speaker 6>quote Indians are having to use </v>
<v Speaker 6>hyphenated terms,</v>

225
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 6>at least in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have terms like African Americans,</v>

226
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.560
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>adding women or people of color to the </v>

227
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.331
<v Speaker 6>western Civ curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Making gay jokes or using retard is </v>

228
00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:16.190
<v Speaker 6>an epithet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I kind of get it right.</v>

229
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:21.220
<v Speaker 6>New concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>new words sort of sticking your throat </v>

230
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.770
<v Speaker 6>the way we're used to talking and </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking seem natural and normal,</v>

231
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by definition.</v>

232
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:32.370
<v Speaker 6>And then the new terms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>new concepts that have social utility </v>

233
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.110
<v Speaker 6>stick and those that don't fall away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you go back to the 19 seventies,</v>

234
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.180
<v Speaker 6>ms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

235
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:42.250
<v Speaker 6>ms as an alternative to Mr Mrs stuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>around and women with a y didn't.</v>

236
00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.140
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think that some day I hope that </v>

237
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.531
<v Speaker 6>someday we'll look back and marvel at </v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea that gender neutral pronouns </v>

238
00:16:50.531 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 6>ever seen like an existential threat to </v>
<v Speaker 6>anyone,</v>

239
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 6>but I also don't think it's clear that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

240
00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.170
<v Speaker 6>that might not happen because if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>look around the world right now,</v>

241
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:05.770
<v Speaker 6>there are plenty of places that have </v>
<v Speaker 6>indeed dialed back cosmopolitanism and </v>

242
00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 6>reinstated patriarchy in the name of </v>
<v Speaker 6>staving off chaos.</v>

243
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.840
<v Speaker 6>And they seem like terrible places to </v>
<v Speaker 6>live.</v>

244
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:12.920
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

245
00:17:12.921 --> 00:17:17.921
<v Speaker 6>I come to you from the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is currently undergoing a </v>

246
00:17:17.921 --> 00:17:22.511
<v Speaker 6>monumental attempt to roll back social </v>
<v Speaker 6>progress in the name of overcoming </v>

247
00:17:22.511 --> 00:17:24.710
<v Speaker 6>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And as someone who lives there,</v>

248
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:27.560
<v Speaker 6>I assure you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it feels nothing like progress.</v>

249
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

250
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:37.430
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

251
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.280
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Start to the debate,</v>

252
00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:40.060
<v Speaker 6>Michelle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

253
00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:42.720
<v Speaker 6>I'm now gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ask Jordan Peterson to speak for the con</v>

254
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.270
<v Speaker 6>team.</v>

255
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.530
<v Speaker 5>Hello.</v>

256
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 7>So we should first decide what we're </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about.</v>

257
00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.840
<v Speaker 7>We're not talking about my views of </v>
<v Speaker 7>political correctness despite what you </v>

258
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 7>might have inferred from the last </v>
<v Speaker 7>speaker's comments.</v>

259
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:10.370
<v Speaker 7>This is how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We essentially need something </v>

260
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.181
<v Speaker 7>approximating a low resolution grant </v>
<v Speaker 7>narrative to unitus and we did narrative</v>

261
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 7>to united because otherwise we don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>have peace.</v>

262
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.040
<v Speaker 7>What's playing out in the universities </v>
<v Speaker 7>and in broader society right now is a </v>

263
00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.940
<v Speaker 7>debate between two fundamental low </v>
<v Speaker 7>resolution narratives.</v>

264
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:32.210
<v Speaker 7>Neither of which can be completely </v>
<v Speaker 7>accurate because they can't encompass </v>

265
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.241
<v Speaker 7>all the details.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Obviously human beings have an </v>

266
00:18:35.241 --> 00:18:35.241
<v Speaker 7>individual element and a collect </v>
<v Speaker 7>development.</v>

267
00:18:35.241 --> 00:18:40.190
<v Speaker 7>A group element.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's say the question is what story </v>

268
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.491
<v Speaker 7>should be paramount,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and this is how it looks to me in the </v>

269
00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:46.680
<v Speaker 7>West.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have reasonably functional,</v>

270
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 7>reasonably free,</v>
<v Speaker 7>remarkably productive stable hierarchies</v>

271
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.750
<v Speaker 7>that are open to consideration of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>dispossessed that hierarchies generally </v>

272
00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:58.620
<v Speaker 7>create.</v>

273
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.520
<v Speaker 7>Our societies are freer and functioning </v>
<v Speaker 7>more effectively than any societies,</v>

274
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.040
<v Speaker 7>anywhere else in the world and that and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then any societies ever have and as far </v>

275
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.061
<v Speaker 7>as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I think there's good reason to </v>

276
00:19:14.061 --> 00:19:16.281
<v Speaker 7>assume this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's because the fundamental low </v>

277
00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.531
<v Speaker 7>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a grant narrative that we've oriented </v>

278
00:19:18.531 --> 00:19:22.401
<v Speaker 7>ourselves around in the West is one of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the sovereignty of the individual and </v>

279
00:19:22.401 --> 00:19:25.230
<v Speaker 7>it's predicated on the idea that all </v>
<v Speaker 7>things considered the best way for me to</v>

280
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:30.231
<v Speaker 7>interact with someone else's individual </v>
<v Speaker 7>to individual and to react to that </v>

281
00:19:30.231 --> 00:19:34.221
<v Speaker 7>person as if they are both a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>process because that's the right way of </v>

282
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:39.651
<v Speaker 7>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The psychological process by which </v>

283
00:19:39.651 --> 00:19:40.320
<v Speaker 7>things we don't understand can yet be </v>
<v Speaker 7>explored and buy.</v>

284
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:43.910
<v Speaker 7>Things that aren't properly organized in</v>
<v Speaker 7>our society can be yet set.</v>

285
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.920
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the reason we're valuable as </v>

286
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.991
<v Speaker 7>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 7>both with regards to our rights and </v>

287
00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 7>responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is because that's our essential purpose.</v>

288
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 7>Announce our nobility and that's our </v>
<v Speaker 7>function.</v>

289
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.840
<v Speaker 7>What's happening as far as I'm concerned</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the universities in particular and </v>

290
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840
<v Speaker 7>spreading very rapidly out into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>broader world,</v>

291
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:02.850
<v Speaker 7>including the corporate world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>much to.</v>

292
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:07.851
<v Speaker 7>It's a much to what should be its </v>
<v Speaker 7>chagrin is a collectivist narrative and </v>

293
00:20:08.971 --> 00:20:12.840
<v Speaker 7>of course there's some utility in a </v>
<v Speaker 7>collectivist narrative because we're all</v>

294
00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:17.841
<v Speaker 7>part of groups in different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the collectivist narrative that I </v>

295
00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:21.980
<v Speaker 7>regard as politically correct as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>pastiche of a strange pastiche of </v>

296
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.680
<v Speaker 7>postmodernism in neo Marxism in its </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamental claim is that no,</v>

297
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.890
<v Speaker 7>you're not essentially an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're essentially a member of a group </v>

298
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.980
<v Speaker 7>and that group might be your ethnicity </v>
<v Speaker 7>and it might be your sex and it might be</v>

299
00:20:34.981 --> 00:20:39.981
<v Speaker 7>a race and it might be any of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>endless numbers of other potential </v>

300
00:20:39.981 --> 00:20:43.971
<v Speaker 7>groups that you belong to because you </v>
<v Speaker 7>belong to many of them and that you </v>

301
00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:47.961
<v Speaker 7>should be essentially categorized along </v>
<v Speaker 7>with those who are like you on that </v>

302
00:20:47.961 --> 00:20:47.961
<v Speaker 7>dimension in that group.</v>

303
00:20:47.961 --> 00:20:52.590
<v Speaker 7>That's proposition number one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Proposition number two is that the </v>

304
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.891
<v Speaker 7>proper way to view the world is as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>battle ground between groups of </v>

305
00:20:55.891 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 7>different power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you defined the groups first and then</v>

306
00:20:58.241 --> 00:21:03.241
<v Speaker 7>you assume that you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you view the individual from the group </v>

307
00:21:03.241 --> 00:21:04.810
<v Speaker 7>context.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You viewed the battle between groups,</v>

308
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 7>from the group context and you view </v>
<v Speaker 7>history itself.</v>

309
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:12.630
<v Speaker 7>As a consequence of nothing but the </v>
<v Speaker 7>power maneuvers between different </v>

310
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.020
<v Speaker 7>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that eliminates any consideration of the</v>

311
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:19.021
<v Speaker 7>individual and at a very fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 7>level and also any idea,</v>

312
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:24.031
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of free speech because if you're </v>

313
00:21:24.031 --> 00:21:25.720
<v Speaker 7>collectivist had heart in this manner,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there is no such thing as free speech.</v>

314
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.320
<v Speaker 7>It isn't that it's debated by those on </v>
<v Speaker 7>the radical left and let's say the rest </v>

315
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.610
<v Speaker 7>of us so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's that in that formulation there's no</v>

316
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:36.920
<v Speaker 7>such thing as free speech because for an</v>
<v Speaker 7>individualist free speeches,</v>

317
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 7>how you make sense of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 7>reorganize society in a proper manner,</v>

318
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.470
<v Speaker 7>but for the radical left type </v>
<v Speaker 7>collectivist that's associated with this</v>

319
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 7>viewpoint of political correctness.</v>

320
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.640
<v Speaker 7>When you speak,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all you're doing is playing a power game</v>

321
00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:53.641
<v Speaker 7>on behalf of your group and there's </v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing else that you can do because </v>

322
00:21:53.641 --> 00:21:56.850
<v Speaker 7>that's all there is and not only is that</v>
<v Speaker 7>all there is in terms of who you are as </v>

323
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.990
<v Speaker 7>an individual now and how society should</v>
<v Speaker 7>be viewed.</v>

324
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 7>It's also the fundamental narrative of </v>
<v Speaker 7>history.</v>

325
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.200
<v Speaker 7>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's.</v>

326
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:08.240
<v Speaker 7>It's widely assumed in our universities </v>
<v Speaker 7>now that the best way to conceptualize </v>

327
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.870
<v Speaker 7>Western civilization is as an oppressive</v>
<v Speaker 7>male dominated patriarchy and that the </v>

328
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:17.791
<v Speaker 7>best way to construe relationships </v>
<v Speaker 7>between men and women across the </v>

329
00:22:17.791 --> 00:22:20.050
<v Speaker 7>centuries is one of oppression of women </v>
<v Speaker 7>by men as like,</v>

330
00:22:20.051 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

331
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 7>no hierarchy is without it's tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a.</v>

332
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.800
<v Speaker 7>that's an axiomatic truth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People have recognized that literally </v>

333
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.591
<v Speaker 7>for thousands of years and hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 7>do tend towards tyranny and they tend </v>

334
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 7>towards the use of patient by people </v>
<v Speaker 7>with power,</v>

335
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:42.570
<v Speaker 7>but that only happens when they become </v>
<v Speaker 7>corrupt and we have mechanisms in our </v>

336
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.790
<v Speaker 7>society to stop hierarchies from </v>
<v Speaker 7>becoming intolerable.</v>

337
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:49.790
<v Speaker 7>He corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They actually work pretty well and so </v>

338
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:49.790
<v Speaker 7>and so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would also.</v>

339
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.550
<v Speaker 7>I would also.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would also point this out,</v>

340
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:57.030
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't be thinking that this is a debate </v>

341
00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.461
<v Speaker 7>about whether empathy is useful or not </v>
<v Speaker 7>or that the people on the con side of </v>

342
00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:03.631
<v Speaker 7>the argument are not empathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know perfectly well as I as an </v>

343
00:23:03.631 --> 00:23:03.631
<v Speaker 7>insured,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mr Frye does that.</v>

344
00:23:03.631 --> 00:23:08.490
<v Speaker 7>Hierarchies tend to produce situations </v>
<v Speaker 7>where people stack up at the bottom and </v>

345
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.510
<v Speaker 7>that the dispossessed and hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 7>need a political voice,</v>

346
00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:15.511
<v Speaker 7>which is the proper voice of the left by</v>
<v Speaker 7>the way and the necessary voice of the </v>

347
00:23:15.511 --> 00:23:18.961
<v Speaker 7>left,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that is not the same as proclaiming </v>

348
00:23:18.961 --> 00:23:21.661
<v Speaker 7>that the right level of analysis for our</v>
<v Speaker 7>grand unifying narrative is that all of </v>

349
00:23:21.661 --> 00:23:26.071
<v Speaker 7>us are fundamentally to be identified by</v>
<v Speaker 7>the groups that we belong to and to </v>

350
00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:30.961
<v Speaker 7>construe the entire world has the </v>
<v Speaker 7>battleground between different forms of </v>

351
00:23:30.961 --> 00:23:35.491
<v Speaker 7>tyranny in consequence of that group </v>
<v Speaker 7>affiliation and to the degree that we </v>

352
00:23:35.491 --> 00:23:38.110
<v Speaker 7>play out that narrative that won't be </v>
<v Speaker 7>progress.</v>

353
00:23:38.111 --> 00:23:43.111
<v Speaker 7>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and we certainly haven't seen that </v>

354
00:23:43.111 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 7>progress in the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've seen situations like what happened</v>

355
00:23:44.051 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 7>at Wilfrid laurier.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Instead,</v>

356
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:51.250
<v Speaker 8>we won't see progress.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What will return to is exactly the same </v>

357
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 8>kind of tribalism to characterize the </v>
<v Speaker 8>left.</v>

358
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.960
<v Speaker 5>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jordan.</v>

359
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.680
<v Speaker 8>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Eric Dyson.</v>

360
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:08.270
<v Speaker 8>Your six minutes starts now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you very kindly.</v>

361
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.760
<v Speaker 8>Wonderful opportunity to be here in </v>
<v Speaker 8>Canada.</v>

362
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.400
<v Speaker 8>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to stand here at the podium.</v>

363
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:20.660
<v Speaker 8>I'm a preacher and I will ask for an </v>
<v Speaker 8>offering.</v>

364
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:25.661
<v Speaker 8>At the end of my presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is the swimsuit competition of the </v>

365
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:30.911
<v Speaker 8>intellectual beauty pageant,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so let me show you the curves of my </v>

366
00:24:30.911 --> 00:24:32.720
<v Speaker 8>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

367
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.090
<v Speaker 8>Was that a politically incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 8>statement I just made?</v>

368
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:40.950
<v Speaker 8>How did we get to the point where the </v>
<v Speaker 8>hijacking of the discourse on political </v>

369
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:45.671
<v Speaker 8>correctness has become a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>Mandakini distinction between us and </v>

370
00:24:45.671 --> 00:24:50.620
<v Speaker 8>them?</v>
<v Speaker 8>The abortive fantasy just presented is </v>

371
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:55.091
<v Speaker 8>remarkable for both its clarity and yet </v>
<v Speaker 8>the muddiness of the context from which </v>

372
00:24:55.091 --> 00:24:58.850
<v Speaker 8>it has emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's interesting to me is that when we</v>

373
00:24:58.851 --> 00:25:03.851
<v Speaker 8>look at the radical left,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm saying where they I want to join </v>

374
00:25:03.851 --> 00:25:03.950
<v Speaker 8>them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They didn't run enough,</v>

375
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:08.951
<v Speaker 8>and I'm from a country where a man </v>
<v Speaker 8>stands up everyday to suite the moral </v>

376
00:25:08.951 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 8>mendacity of his viciousness into a </v>
<v Speaker 8>nation.</v>

377
00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:13.630
<v Speaker 8>He has turned into his psychic commode.</v>

378
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.870
<v Speaker 8>Y'All got Justin?</v>
<v Speaker 8>We got Donald.</v>

379
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:29.210
<v Speaker 8>So what's interesting then is that </v>
<v Speaker 8>political correctness as transmogrified </v>

380
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.180
<v Speaker 8>into a caricature of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The left came up with the term political</v>

381
00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:33.070
<v Speaker 8>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Shall I remind you,</v>

382
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.390
<v Speaker 8>we were tired of our excuses in our </v>
<v Speaker 8>excesses and are exaggerations.</v>

383
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.110
<v Speaker 8>We were willing to be so critical in a </v>
<v Speaker 8>way that I fear my confreres.</v>

384
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.730
<v Speaker 8>My compatriots are not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't take yourself too seriously.</v>

385
00:25:45.731 --> 00:25:49.690
<v Speaker 8>Smiles.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Take yourself seriously at all,</v>

386
00:25:49.691 --> 00:25:53.770
<v Speaker 8>but what you do with deadly seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 8>now it is transmogrified into an attempt</v>

387
00:25:53.771 --> 00:25:58.510
<v Speaker 8>to characterize the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The radical left is a metaphor.</v>

388
00:25:58.511 --> 00:26:01.390
<v Speaker 8>It's a symbol as an articulation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They don't exist.</v>

389
00:26:01.391 --> 00:26:04.600
<v Speaker 8>They're numbers are too small.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm on college campuses.</v>

390
00:26:04.601 --> 00:26:08.020
<v Speaker 8>I don't see much of them coming.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When I hear about identity politics,</v>

391
00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:12.010
<v Speaker 8>that amazes me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The collectivist identity politics,</v>

392
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.960
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>last time I checked white folk have been</v>

393
00:26:13.961 --> 00:26:18.961
<v Speaker 8>at race.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That was an invention from a dominant </v>

394
00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:19.720
<v Speaker 8>culture that wanted groups to at their </v>
<v Speaker 8>behest,</v>

395
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:25.080
<v Speaker 8>the invention of race was driven by the </v>
<v Speaker 8>demand of a dominant culture to </v>

396
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.380
<v Speaker 8>subordinate others.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Patriarchy,</v>

397
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:33.190
<v Speaker 8>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Patriarchy was the demand of men to have</v>

398
00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:37.460
<v Speaker 8>their exclusive vision presented.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The beauty of feminism is it's not going</v>

399
00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:39.700
<v Speaker 8>to resolve differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 8>women.</v>

400
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.400
<v Speaker 8>It just sends me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't automatically get the last word.</v>

401
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:49.490
<v Speaker 8>Of course they never did.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so identity politics has been </v>

402
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:54.261
<v Speaker 8>generated as a bet noir of the right and</v>
<v Speaker 8>yet the right doesn't understand the </v>

403
00:26:54.261 --> 00:26:58.791
<v Speaker 8>degree to which identity has been </v>
<v Speaker 8>foisted upon black people and Brown </v>

404
00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 8>people and people of color from the very</v>
<v Speaker 8>beginning on women and Trans People.</v>

405
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.960
<v Speaker 8>You think that I want to be part of a </v>
<v Speaker 8>group that is constantly at port by </v>

406
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.371
<v Speaker 8>people at starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm minding my own business,</v>

407
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 8>walking down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have group identity thrust upon me.</v>

408
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:16.600
<v Speaker 8>They don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

409
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 8>there goes a negro.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Highly intelligent,</v>

410
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 8>articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 8>verbose,</v>

411
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.370
<v Speaker 8>capable of rhetorical fury at the drop </v>
<v Speaker 8>of a hat.</v>

412
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 8>We should not interrogate him as to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>bone of the days of his legal sentence.</v>

413
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they treat me as part of a group.</v>

414
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:39.650
<v Speaker 8>And the problem is that our friends </v>
<v Speaker 8>don't want to acknowledge is that the </v>

415
00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.450
<v Speaker 8>head Gemini,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that dominance of that group has been so</v>

416
00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:46.650
<v Speaker 8>vicious that it is denied us the </v>
<v Speaker 8>opportunity to exist as individuals.</v>

417
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:50.250
<v Speaker 8>Individualism is the characteristic </v>
<v Speaker 8>moment in modernity.</v>

418
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.850
<v Speaker 8>Ms Dot Peterson is right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The development of the individual.</v>

419
00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:58.851
<v Speaker 8>However,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's predicated upon notions of </v>

420
00:27:58.851 --> 00:27:58.851
<v Speaker 8>intelligence in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You a continent,</v>

421
00:27:58.851 --> 00:27:58.851
<v Speaker 8>David,</v>
<v Speaker 8>human,</v>

422
00:27:58.851 --> 00:28:03.171
<v Speaker 8>others philosophically cart descartes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>comes along introducing knowledge into </v>

423
00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:08.151
<v Speaker 8>the to the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to the phrase saying that knowledge is </v>

424
00:28:08.151 --> 00:28:10.590
<v Speaker 8>based upon the kind of reference to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>golden intelligence,</v>

425
00:28:10.591 --> 00:28:15.591
<v Speaker 8>the reflective glass at one possesses,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and yet they get rooted in the very </v>

426
00:28:15.591 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 8>ground of our existence,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so now it has fleshly basis and what I'm</v>

427
00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:23.331
<v Speaker 8>saying to you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the knowledge that I bring as a person </v>

428
00:28:23.331 --> 00:28:25.851
<v Speaker 8>of color makes a difference in my body </v>
<v Speaker 8>because I know what people think of me </v>

429
00:28:25.851 --> 00:28:30.350
<v Speaker 8>and I know how they respond to me and </v>
<v Speaker 8>that ain't no theory am I am I mad at </v>

430
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.410
<v Speaker 8>trigger warnings?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Only trigger warning.</v>

431
00:28:31.411 --> 00:28:33.720
<v Speaker 8>Got One is from a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Are you about to shoot me?</v>

432
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.930
<v Speaker 8>Not Funny in America where young black </v>
<v Speaker 8>people die repeatedly,</v>

433
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.680
<v Speaker 8>unarmed without provocation,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and so for me,</v>

434
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.960
<v Speaker 8>identity politics is something very </v>
<v Speaker 8>serious.</v>

435
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 8>And what's interesting about safe </v>
<v Speaker 8>spaces,</v>

436
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 8>I hear about the university,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I teach there.</v>

437
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.450
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you in a safe space in your body,</v>

438
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:57.510
<v Speaker 8>you don't need a safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Some of that is overblown.</v>

439
00:28:57.511 --> 00:28:59.190
<v Speaker 8>Some of it is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I understand.</v>

440
00:28:59.191 --> 00:29:02.460
<v Speaker 8>I believe that the classroom was a </v>
<v Speaker 8>robust place for serious learning.</v>

441
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:07.670
<v Speaker 8>I believe in the interrogation of </v>
<v Speaker 8>knowledge based upon our understanding </v>

442
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.290
<v Speaker 8>mutually edifying proposition of </v>
<v Speaker 8>enlightenment.</v>

443
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 8>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some people ain't as equal as others,</v>

444
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.840
<v Speaker 8>so we have to understand the conditions </v>
<v Speaker 8>under which they have emerged and in </v>

445
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.070
<v Speaker 8>which they have been benighted and </v>
<v Speaker 8>attacked by their own culture,</v>

446
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 8>and I ain't seen nobody be a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 8>snowflake than white men who complain.</v>

447
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:30.440
<v Speaker 8>Mommy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Mommy won't let us play and have </v>

448
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.250
<v Speaker 8>everything we used to have under the old</v>
<v Speaker 8>regime where we were right,</v>

449
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.960
<v Speaker 8>racist in some premises and dominant and</v>
<v Speaker 8>patriarchs and hated gays and lesbians.</v>

450
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 8>Transsexuals that a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

451
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 8>you gotta share this Angel World or </v>
<v Speaker 8>about his world,</v>

452
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.700
<v Speaker 8>and let me hear it by saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You remember that story from David </v>

453
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.690
<v Speaker 8>Foster Wallace fish going down to fish </v>
<v Speaker 8>or going into an older fish comes in the</v>

454
00:29:49.691 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 8>opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>

455
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 8>hello boys.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How's the water?</v>

456
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.520
<v Speaker 8>They swim on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They turn each other.</v>

457
00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:57.100
<v Speaker 8>What the Hell is water?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because when you're in it,</v>

458
00:29:57.101 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 8>you don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you're dominant,</v>

459
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 8>you don't know nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Keyser soze he said is more interesting,</v>

460
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:04.940
<v Speaker 8>but the devil did then to make people </v>
<v Speaker 8>believe he did</v>

461
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.140
<v Speaker 5>exist.</v>

462
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.750
<v Speaker 9>Thank you Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Steven Europe.</v>

463
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.730
<v Speaker 9>So we're going to put six minutes on the</v>
<v Speaker 9>clock and please start again.</v>

464
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.850
<v Speaker 9>I'll try and be as quick as possible </v>
<v Speaker 9>because if I miss that plane to London,</v>

465
00:30:28.851 --> 00:30:33.851
<v Speaker 9>I went half here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the end of it from the bridegroom's </v>

466
00:30:33.851 --> 00:30:36.230
<v Speaker 9>groom's mother.</v>
<v Speaker 9>In agreeing to participate in this </v>

467
00:30:38.871 --> 00:30:41.810
<v Speaker 9>debate and stand on this side of the </v>
<v Speaker 9>argument,</v>

468
00:30:41.811 --> 00:30:46.811
<v Speaker 9>I'm fully aware that many people who </v>
<v Speaker 9>choose incorrectly in my view to to see </v>

469
00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:51.010
<v Speaker 9>this issue in terms of left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 9>devalued unexploded terms.</v>

470
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:56.020
<v Speaker 9>I think they will believe that I am </v>
<v Speaker 9>portraying myself in such causes and </v>

471
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.490
<v Speaker 9>values that I have espoused over the </v>
<v Speaker 9>years.</v>

472
00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:03.170
<v Speaker 9>I've been given a huge grief already </v>
<v Speaker 9>simply because I'm standing here next to</v>

473
00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:08.410
<v Speaker 9>Professor Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is the very reason that I am </v>

474
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.741
<v Speaker 9>standing here in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm standing next to someone with whom I</v>

475
00:31:12.111 --> 00:31:17.111
<v Speaker 9>have no differences,</v>
<v Speaker 9>shall we say in terms of politics and </v>

476
00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:18.140
<v Speaker 9>all kinds of other things.</v>

477
00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:23.210
<v Speaker 9>Precisely because I think all this has </v>
<v Speaker 9>got to stop this rage,</v>

478
00:31:23.211 --> 00:31:24.530
<v Speaker 9>resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 9>hostility,</v>

479
00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.870
<v Speaker 9>hostility,</v>
<v Speaker 9>intolerance,</v>

480
00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.380
<v Speaker 9>above all this,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

481
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.700
<v Speaker 9>with us or against us.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Certainty at Grand Canyon has opened up </v>

482
00:31:34.461 --> 00:31:35.710
<v Speaker 9>in our world.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The fishier,</v>

483
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 9>the crack grows wider every day.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Neither on each side can hear a word </v>

484
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.780
<v Speaker 9>that the other shrieks and nor do they </v>
<v Speaker 9>want to.</v>

485
00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:50.890
<v Speaker 9>While these armies and propagandists in </v>
<v Speaker 9>the culture wars clash down below in the</v>

486
00:31:51.021 --> 00:31:56.021
<v Speaker 9>enormous space between the two sides,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the people of the world tried to get on </v>

487
00:31:56.021 --> 00:32:00.581
<v Speaker 9>with their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Alternative baffled board and betrayed </v>

488
00:32:00.581 --> 00:32:03.350
<v Speaker 9>by the horrible noises and explosions </v>
<v Speaker 9>that echo all around.</v>

489
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:08.710
<v Speaker 9>I think it's time for this toxic binary,</v>
<v Speaker 9>zero some madness to stop before we </v>

490
00:32:10.041 --> 00:32:11.210
<v Speaker 9>destroy ourselves.</v>

491
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.900
<v Speaker 9>The nail my colors to the mast before I </v>
<v Speaker 9>get any further than this.</v>

492
00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:21.810
<v Speaker 9>It's only polite to give you a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 9>where I come from.</v>

493
00:32:21.811 --> 00:32:25.210
<v Speaker 9>I all my adult life,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I have been what you might call the left</v>

494
00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:30.220
<v Speaker 9>ear,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a soft left liberal of the most hand </v>

495
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:30.220
<v Speaker 9>wringing milk soap,</v>
<v Speaker 9>milk,</v>

496
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.270
<v Speaker 9>toast,</v>
<v Speaker 9>variety.</v>

497
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:35.290
<v Speaker 9>Not a burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The barricades socialist,</v>

498
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.690
<v Speaker 9>not even really a progressive with the </v>
<v Speaker 9>name.</v>

499
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:43.050
<v Speaker 9>I've been on marches,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I've never quite dead wave placards </v>

500
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:43.160
<v Speaker 9>or banners.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

501
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 9>am I alluded member of that band,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

502
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 9>an Sjw,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a social justice warrior.</v>

503
00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:53.810
<v Speaker 9>I don't think highly of social injustice</v>
<v Speaker 9>I have to say,</v>

504
00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:58.490
<v Speaker 9>but I characterize myself mostly as a </v>
<v Speaker 9>social justice warrior.</v>

505
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:03.970
<v Speaker 9>My intellectual heroes growing up were </v>
<v Speaker 9>Bertrand Russell and Ge.</v>

506
00:33:04.191 --> 00:33:05.990
<v Speaker 9>More liberal thinkers,</v>
<v Speaker 9>people like that.</v>

507
00:33:05.991 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 9>Writers like am forced to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I believed,</v>

508
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:11.690
<v Speaker 9>and I think I still do believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>sanctity of human relations,</v>

509
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.470
<v Speaker 9>of the primacy,</v>
<v Speaker 9>of the heart and friendship and love and</v>

510
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 9>common interest.</v>

511
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.760
<v Speaker 9>These are more personal interior beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 9>than they are political exterior </v>

512
00:33:22.731 --> 00:33:27.731
<v Speaker 9>convictions,</v>
<v Speaker 9>more humanistic version of a religious </v>

513
00:33:27.731 --> 00:33:28.040
<v Speaker 9>impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I suppose.</v>

514
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.530
<v Speaker 9>I trust in humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I believe in humanity.</v>

515
00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:35.531
<v Speaker 9>I think I do,</v>
<v Speaker 9>despite all that has happened in the 40 </v>

516
00:33:35.531 --> 00:33:37.370
<v Speaker 9>years of my adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I am soft and I can easily be swept away</v>

517
00:33:37.371 --> 00:33:42.371
<v Speaker 9>by heart to hearts and harder intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm sometimes surprised to be described </v>

518
00:33:42.371 --> 00:33:47.171
<v Speaker 9>as an activist,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but overtime I have energetically </v>

519
00:33:47.171 --> 00:33:47.750
<v Speaker 9>involved myself with what you might call</v>
<v Speaker 9>causes.</v>

520
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 9>I grew up knowing that I was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

521
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 9>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 9>from the very first I knew I was gay.</v>

522
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:54.110
<v Speaker 9>I remember when I was born looking up </v>
<v Speaker 9>and saying,</v>

523
00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.360
<v Speaker 9>that's the last time I'm going up.</v>
<v Speaker 9>One of those.</v>

524
00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.420
<v Speaker 10>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm</v>

525
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.110
<v Speaker 9>Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm Jewish.</v>

526
00:34:04.111 --> 00:34:05.390
<v Speaker 9>So I have a natural.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was horror,</v>

527
00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.800
<v Speaker 9>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

528
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.990
<v Speaker 9>I naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I want racism,</v>

529
00:34:09.991 --> 00:34:11.340
<v Speaker 9>misogyny,</v>
<v Speaker 9>homophobia,</v>

530
00:34:11.341 --> 00:34:13.410
<v Speaker 9>transphobia,</v>
<v Speaker 9>xenophobia,</v>

531
00:34:13.411 --> 00:34:14.710
<v Speaker 9>bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>bigotry,</v>

532
00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Speaker 9>intolerance of all humankind to end that</v>
<v Speaker 9>surely a given amongst all of us.</v>

533
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.370
<v Speaker 9>The question is how such a golden aim is</v>
<v Speaker 9>to be achieved.</v>

534
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.640
<v Speaker 9>My ultimate objection to political </v>
<v Speaker 9>correctness is not that it combines so </v>

535
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.111
<v Speaker 9>much of what I've spent a lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 9>losing and opposing preachiness with </v>

536
00:34:33.111 --> 00:34:38.030
<v Speaker 9>great respect,</v>
<v Speaker 9>piety a self righteousness heresy,</v>

537
00:34:39.781 --> 00:34:41.600
<v Speaker 9>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 9>denunciation,</v>

538
00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.800
<v Speaker 9>shaming,</v>
<v Speaker 9>assertion without evidence,</v>

539
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.850
<v Speaker 9>accusation,</v>
<v Speaker 9>inquisition censoring.</v>

540
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:52.370
<v Speaker 9>That's not why I'm incurring the wrath </v>
<v Speaker 9>of my fellow liberals by standing on </v>

541
00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:56.301
<v Speaker 9>this side of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 9>My real objection is that I don't think </v>

542
00:34:56.301 --> 00:34:59.310
<v Speaker 9>political correctness works.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I want to achieve,</v>

543
00:34:59.311 --> 00:35:04.311
<v Speaker 9>I want to get to the Golden Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I don't think that's the way to get </v>

544
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:05.200
<v Speaker 9>there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

545
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:10.700
<v Speaker 9>I believe one of the greatest human </v>
<v Speaker 9>failings is to prefer to be right,</v>

546
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.840
<v Speaker 9>than to be effective.</v>

547
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:17.990
<v Speaker 10>Political correctness</v>

548
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:23.590
<v Speaker 9>is always obsessed with how right it is </v>
<v Speaker 9>without thinking of how effective it </v>

549
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:23.590
<v Speaker 9>might,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it might be,</v>

550
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.600
<v Speaker 9>I wouldn't trust myself as a classical </v>
<v Speaker 9>libertarian,</v>

551
00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:32.210
<v Speaker 9>but I do relish transgression,</v>
<v Speaker 9>dive deeply and instinctively distrust </v>

552
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.600
<v Speaker 9>conformity and orthodoxy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Progress is not achieved by preachers </v>

553
00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 9>and guardians of morality,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but to paraphrase,</v>

554
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:44.880
<v Speaker 9>you have Guinea Zim,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yachting by madmen hermits,</v>

555
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.410
<v Speaker 9>heretics,</v>
<v Speaker 9>dreamers,</v>

556
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.480
<v Speaker 9>rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and skeptics.</v>

557
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:56.100
<v Speaker 9>I may be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I hope to learn this evening.</v>

558
00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:01.190
<v Speaker 9>I really do think I may be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I'm prepared to entertain the </v>

559
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:05.781
<v Speaker 9>possibility that political correctness </v>
<v Speaker 9>will bring us more tolerance and a </v>

560
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:11.180
<v Speaker 9>better world,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I'm not sure and I would like this </v>

561
00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.141
<v Speaker 9>quotation from my hair,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a Bertrand Russell to hover over the </v>

562
00:36:15.141 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 9>evening.</v>
<v Speaker 9>One of the painful things about our time</v>

563
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.040
<v Speaker 9>is that those who feel certainty are </v>
<v Speaker 9>stupid and those within the imagination </v>

564
00:36:22.271 --> 00:36:25.740
<v Speaker 9>and understanding are filled with doubt </v>
<v Speaker 9>and indecision.</v>

565
00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:34.060
<v Speaker 5>Thank</v>

566
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.330
<v Speaker 9>great set of opening statements to set </v>
<v Speaker 9>the scene.</v>

567
00:36:41.331 --> 00:36:46.331
<v Speaker 9>We're now going to go into a round of </v>
<v Speaker 9>rebuttals to allow each of our </v>

568
00:36:46.331 --> 00:36:49.661
<v Speaker 9>presenters three minutes to reflect on </v>
<v Speaker 9>what they've heard and to make some </v>

569
00:36:49.821 --> 00:36:52.130
<v Speaker 9>additional points.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're going to do that in the same order</v>

570
00:36:52.131 --> 00:36:53.390
<v Speaker 9>that we had,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the opening statements.</v>

571
00:36:53.391 --> 00:36:55.100
<v Speaker 9>So Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're up first.</v>

572
00:36:55.101 --> 00:36:56.720
<v Speaker 9>We'll put three minutes on the clock for</v>
<v Speaker 9>you.</v>

573
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:03.230
<v Speaker 6>So first I would say that I think that </v>
<v Speaker 6>the attempt to draw a dichotomy between </v>

574
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:10.330
<v Speaker 6>individual rights and group rights is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit misleading.</v>

575
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 6>I'm traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there has been large groups of people </v>

576
00:37:15.701 --> 00:37:20.701
<v Speaker 6>who have not been able to exercise their</v>
<v Speaker 6>individual rights and I think that a lot</v>

577
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:26.780
<v Speaker 6>that the claims that are being made on </v>
<v Speaker 6>behalf of what we politically correct </v>

578
00:37:27.251 --> 00:37:32.251
<v Speaker 6>types call marginalized groups are </v>
<v Speaker 6>claims that people who,</v>

579
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:37.400
<v Speaker 6>you know have identities that have not </v>
<v Speaker 6>traditionally been at the center of our </v>

580
00:37:38.351 --> 00:37:43.351
<v Speaker 6>culture or been at the top of our </v>
<v Speaker 6>hierarchies have as much right to </v>

581
00:37:43.351 --> 00:37:47.821
<v Speaker 6>exercise their individual talents and </v>
<v Speaker 6>realize their individual ambitions.</v>

582
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:53.700
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When we say that we want more women in </v>

583
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.311
<v Speaker 6>power or more people of color's voices </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the Canon or in the curriculum or you</v>

584
00:37:57.891 --> 00:37:59.290
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pete directing movies.</v>

585
00:37:59.291 --> 00:38:02.470
<v Speaker 6>All of these things or not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because at least on my part,</v>

586
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.560
<v Speaker 6>I'm interested in some sort of very </v>
<v Speaker 6>crude equity,</v>

587
00:38:05.561 --> 00:38:10.561
<v Speaker 6>but because there are a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>who have not traditionally been able to </v>

588
00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:17.290
<v Speaker 6>realize themselves as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what the women's movement was.</v>

589
00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:19.210
<v Speaker 6>That's what the civil rights movement </v>
<v Speaker 6>was.</v>

590
00:38:19.211 --> 00:38:24.211
<v Speaker 6>That's what the gay rights movement was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's in some ways what the Trans </v>

591
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:24.211
<v Speaker 6>Rights movement was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

592
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:28.750
<v Speaker 6>far from a collectivist movement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is kind of liberalism.</v>

593
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.440
<v Speaker 6>Classical liberalism pushed to its </v>
<v Speaker 6>extreme right.</v>

594
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:37.470
<v Speaker 6>These are people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have the to define my identity against</v>

595
00:38:38.591 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 6>the one that was collectively assigned </v>
<v Speaker 6>to me.</v>

596
00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.700
<v Speaker 6>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say,</v>

597
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:47.701
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of the things that Stephen Fry </v>

598
00:38:47.701 --> 00:38:47.701
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

599
00:38:47.701 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 6>in particularly his temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're probably in agreement,</v>

600
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 6>but this inquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this censorious snus.</v>

601
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.840
<v Speaker 6>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sort of,</v>

602
00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.790
<v Speaker 6>I see where he's coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's a little bit virtual,</v>

603
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.730
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

604
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.990
<v Speaker 6>no know who's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's really censoring you.</v>

605
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:10.080
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I understand what it feels like to feel </v>

606
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:10.080
<v Speaker 6>censored.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I understand what it feels like to be on</v>

607
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 6>the wrong side of a twitter mob or get a</v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of nasty comments,</v>

608
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.930
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's a bad feeling,</v>

609
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.570
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's a counterproductive tactic,</v>

610
00:39:19.571 --> 00:39:21.720
<v Speaker 6>but that's not censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

611
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>

612
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:27.690
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's especially strange coming from a </v>

613
00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:28.970
<v Speaker 6>country where,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

614
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.080
<v Speaker 6>the president of the United States is </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to levy additional postal rates </v>

615
00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:36.860
<v Speaker 6>on the owner of the Washington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

616
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:41.880
<v Speaker 6>in revenge for its reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And people who have kneeled to protest </v>

617
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.741
<v Speaker 6>police brutality at football games have </v>
<v Speaker 6>seen their careers explode,</v>

618
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:52.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or people who have women who have </v>

619
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.811
<v Speaker 6>challenged Mr Peterson has been hounded </v>
<v Speaker 6>by threats and trolls and misogynists </v>

620
00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.510
<v Speaker 6>invective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

621
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:05.950
<v Speaker 5>thank you Jordan.</v>

622
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.440
<v Speaker 7>We're going to have three minutes up on </v>
<v Speaker 7>the screen there.</v>

623
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:13.090
<v Speaker 7>Please respond to what you've heard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

624
00:40:13.091 --> 00:40:16.950
<v Speaker 7>I guess I would like to set out a </v>
<v Speaker 7>challenge in,</v>

625
00:40:16.951 --> 00:40:21.520
<v Speaker 7>in somewhat the same format as Mr Frye </v>
<v Speaker 7>did to people on the moderate left.</v>

626
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:25.600
<v Speaker 7>I mean I've studied totalitarianism for </v>
<v Speaker 7>a very long time,</v>

627
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.930
<v Speaker 7>both on the left and on the right in </v>
<v Speaker 7>various forms.</v>

628
00:40:28.931 --> 00:40:33.931
<v Speaker 7>And I think we've done a pretty decent </v>
<v Speaker 7>job of determining when right wing </v>

629
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:39.931
<v Speaker 7>beliefs become dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that they become dangerous when </v>

630
00:40:39.931 --> 00:40:44.280
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the people who stand on the right </v>

631
00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.700
<v Speaker 7>evoke notions of of racial superiority,</v>
<v Speaker 7>superiority or ethnic superiority,</v>

632
00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:50.701
<v Speaker 7>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's fairly easy to draw a box around </v>

633
00:40:50.701 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 7>them and place them to one side and </v>
<v Speaker 7>necessary.</v>

634
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:52.900
<v Speaker 7>And I think we've done a pretty good job</v>
<v Speaker 7>of that.</v>

635
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.300
<v Speaker 7>What I failed to see happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>left,</v>

636
00:40:55.301 --> 00:40:58.720
<v Speaker 7>and this is with regards to the sensible</v>
<v Speaker 7>left because such a thing exists,</v>

637
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.380
<v Speaker 7>is for the same thing to happen with </v>
<v Speaker 7>regards to the radical leftists.</v>

638
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So here's an open question.</v>

639
00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:09.690
<v Speaker 7>If it's not diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>inclusivity and equity as a triumvirate </v>

640
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:16.510
<v Speaker 7>that mark out the to excessive left and </v>
<v Speaker 7>with equity defined by the way,</v>

641
00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:19.750
<v Speaker 7>not as equality of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is an absolutely laudable goal,</v>

642
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:24.960
<v Speaker 7>but as equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is how it's defined then exactly </v>

643
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.160
<v Speaker 7>how do we demarcate the two extreme </v>
<v Speaker 7>left,</v>

644
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.630
<v Speaker 7>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And we say,</v>

645
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:31.090
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no such thing as the two extreme</v>

646
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:32.290
<v Speaker 7>left.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

647
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:37.320
<v Speaker 7>that's certainly something that </v>
<v Speaker 7>characterizes much of intellectual </v>

648
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.330
<v Speaker 7>thinking for the 20th century as our </v>
<v Speaker 7>high order intellectuals,</v>

649
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 7>especially in place like places like </v>
<v Speaker 7>France did,</v>

650
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:46.031
<v Speaker 7>everything they could to bend over </v>
<v Speaker 7>backwards to ignore absolutely </v>

651
00:41:46.031 --> 00:41:48.881
<v Speaker 7>everything that was happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>catastrophic left world in the Soviet </v>

652
00:41:48.881 --> 00:41:51.830
<v Speaker 7>Union and China not least.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've done a terrible job of determining</v>

653
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.350
<v Speaker 7>how to demarcate what's useful from the </v>
<v Speaker 7>left,</v>

654
00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:59.351
<v Speaker 7>from what's pathological and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>perfectly okay for someone to criticize </v>

655
00:41:59.351 --> 00:42:01.850
<v Speaker 7>my attempts to identify something like a</v>
<v Speaker 7>boundary.</v>

656
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 7>We could say diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>inclusivity and equity,</v>

657
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 7>especially equity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is in fact equality of outcome,</v>

658
00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:11.450
<v Speaker 7>which is an absolutely a boren notion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you know anything about history,</v>

659
00:42:11.451 --> 00:42:15.620
<v Speaker 7>you know that and I'm perfectly willing </v>
<v Speaker 7>to hear some reasonable alternatives,</v>

660
00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:18.380
<v Speaker 7>but what I hear continually from people </v>
<v Speaker 7>on the left,</v>

661
00:42:18.381 --> 00:42:20.270
<v Speaker 7>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as my opponents did,</v>

662
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.300
<v Speaker 7>to construe every argument that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>possibly able to be construed on the </v>

663
00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 7>axis of group identification and it </v>
<v Speaker 7>failed to defer to,</v>

664
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:32.330
<v Speaker 7>to fail to help the rest of us </v>
<v Speaker 7>differentiate the reasonable left,</v>

665
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:38.470
<v Speaker 7>which stands for the oppressed </v>
<v Speaker 7>necessarily from the pathological left </v>

666
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:39.980
<v Speaker 7>that's capable of unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 7>destruction.</v>

667
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:45.370
<v Speaker 7>And what I see happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>university campuses in particular where </v>

668
00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:48.050
<v Speaker 7>the left is absolutely predominate and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's certainly not my imagination.</v>

669
00:42:48.051 --> 00:42:53.051
<v Speaker 7>That's that's well documented by </v>
<v Speaker 7>perfectly reasonable people like </v>

670
00:42:53.051 --> 00:42:54.770
<v Speaker 7>Jonathan Haidt is an absolute failure to</v>
<v Speaker 7>make precisely that distinction.</v>

671
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.010
<v Speaker 7>And I see the same thing tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>

672
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:03.960
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

673
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.820
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>give us your rebuttal.</v>

674
00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.490
<v Speaker 8>Let me step out here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And Peterson land.</v>

675
00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:16.070
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I feel free already.</v>

676
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:24.550
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what mythological </v>
<v Speaker 8>collective Mr Peterson refers to.</v>

677
00:43:26.211 --> 00:43:31.211
<v Speaker 8>I'm part of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Their content garous when they have a </v>

678
00:43:31.211 --> 00:43:33.080
<v Speaker 8>firing squad,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is usually in a semicircle.</v>

679
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:41.050
<v Speaker 8>Part of the skepticism of rationality </v>
<v Speaker 8>was predicated upon the enlightenment </v>

680
00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:41.050
<v Speaker 8>project,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which says,</v>

681
00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:45.080
<v Speaker 8>we're no longer going to be subordinate </v>
<v Speaker 8>to skepticism to superstition.</v>

682
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.090
<v Speaker 8>We're going to think and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 8>think,</v>

683
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:52.150
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thomas Jefferson was one of the great </v>

684
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.971
<v Speaker 8>arbiters of rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he was also a man who was a slave </v>

685
00:43:54.971 --> 00:43:55.850
<v Speaker 8>owner.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How do you reconcile that?</v>

686
00:43:55.851 --> 00:43:57.650
<v Speaker 8>That's the complication I'm speaking </v>
<v Speaker 8>about.</v>

687
00:43:57.651 --> 00:44:00.320
<v Speaker 8>That's not either or.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's not a collective identity.</v>

688
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.930
<v Speaker 8>Thomas Jefferson believed in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>collective identity.</v>

689
00:44:02.931 --> 00:44:07.250
<v Speaker 8>That is during the day at night,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he got some luther vandross songs,</v>

690
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:14.050
<v Speaker 8>went out to the slave quarter and </v>
<v Speaker 8>engaged in sexual relations and had many</v>

691
00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:19.571
<v Speaker 8>children with sally hemings his lines.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Trump is logic and when he hit talks </v>

692
00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 8>about postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know who he's talking about.</v>

693
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:26.390
<v Speaker 8>I teach.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Postmodernism is Kinda fun.</v>

694
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.600
<v Speaker 8>Jacques Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just to say his name is beautiful.</v>

695
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.750
<v Speaker 8>Michelle Michel.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Foucault talks about the insurrection of</v>

696
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:36.060
<v Speaker 8>subjugated knowledge is people who had </v>
<v Speaker 8>been marginalized.</v>

697
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.820
<v Speaker 8>Now begin to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The subaltern is gaietry.</v>

698
00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:40.860
<v Speaker 8>Speeback talks about it in postcolonial </v>
<v Speaker 8>theory.</v>

699
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:46.130
<v Speaker 8>The reason these people grew up and grew</v>
<v Speaker 8>into existence and had a voice is </v>

700
00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 8>because they were denied.</v>
<v Speaker 8>As Ms Dot Goldberg said,</v>

701
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 8>our group identity was foisted upon us.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We were not seen as individuals.</v>

702
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:56.900
<v Speaker 8>Babe Ruth,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when he broke the home run home run </v>

703
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.331
<v Speaker 8>record.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He didn't bat against all basketball </v>

704
00:44:59.331 --> 00:45:01.741
<v Speaker 8>players.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He batted against the best white </v>

705
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:01.741
<v Speaker 8>ballplayers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When it's been rigged in your favor from</v>

706
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 8>the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's hard for you to understand how much</v>

707
00:45:03.181 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 8>you've been.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Rick,</v>

708
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:04.920
<v Speaker 8>you're born on third base.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you.</v>

709
00:45:04.921 --> 00:45:09.570
<v Speaker 8>Hit a triple at the Toronto Blue Jays </v>
<v Speaker 8>game,</v>

710
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.640
<v Speaker 8>and here we are deriving our sense of </v>
<v Speaker 8>identity from the very culture that we </v>

711
00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.451
<v Speaker 8>ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look at the indigenous names and the </v>

712
00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:20.451
<v Speaker 8>first nation names,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Toronto,</v>

713
00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:21.810
<v Speaker 8>Saskatchewan,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Winnipeg,</v>

714
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.740
<v Speaker 8>Tim Horton's,</v>

715
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:31.930
<v Speaker 8>but I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's an envy of the kind of freedom </v>

716
00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:36.251
<v Speaker 8>and liberty that people of color and </v>
<v Speaker 8>other minorities bring because we bring </v>

717
00:45:36.251 --> 00:45:40.211
<v Speaker 8>the depth of knowledge in our body.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a kind of jealousy event as the </v>

718
00:45:40.211 --> 00:45:42.830
<v Speaker 8>greatest living Canadian philosopher </v>
<v Speaker 8>Aubrey Drake Graham says,</v>

719
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.040
<v Speaker 8>jealousy is just love and hate at the </v>
<v Speaker 8>same time,</v>

720
00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.550
<v Speaker 8>and so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it's necessary.</v>

721
00:45:49.551 --> 00:45:54.551
<v Speaker 8>I agree with Mr Frye.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We shouldn't be nasty and combative and </v>

722
00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:55.430
<v Speaker 8>yet I don't see nastiness and </v>
<v Speaker 8>combativeness from people.</v>

723
00:45:55.431 --> 00:46:00.431
<v Speaker 8>I see them making a desire to have their</v>
<v Speaker 8>individual identities respected.</v>

724
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.800
<v Speaker 8>When I get shot down,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for no other reason that I'm black,</v>

725
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.680
<v Speaker 8>when I get categorized for no other </v>
<v Speaker 8>reason than my color,</v>

726
00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:10.370
<v Speaker 8>I am living in a culture that refuses to</v>
<v Speaker 8>see me as a great individual.</v>

727
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:22.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

728
00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:31.660
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's interesting to hear that there </v>

729
00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.050
<v Speaker 9>doesn't seem to be a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but yet I think we all instinctively </v>

730
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:35.800
<v Speaker 9>know that there is some kind of problem.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There isn't sentence censorship ship,</v>

731
00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:38.560
<v Speaker 9>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Not In the way that there is in Russia.</v>

732
00:46:38.561 --> 00:46:41.390
<v Speaker 9>I've been to Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've faced off with the,</v>

733
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:46.730
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>deeply homophobic as unpleasant man and </v>

734
00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.081
<v Speaker 9>there's political correctness in Russia </v>
<v Speaker 9>is just political correctness on the </v>

735
00:46:49.081 --> 00:46:49.330
<v Speaker 9>right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's what I grew up with,</v>

736
00:46:49.331 --> 00:46:54.331
<v Speaker 9>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which meant that you couldn't say </v>

737
00:46:54.331 --> 00:46:54.430
<v Speaker 9>certain things on television,</v>
<v Speaker 9>couldn't say fuck,</v>

738
00:46:54.431 --> 00:46:59.431
<v Speaker 9>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 9>on television because it was incorrect </v>

739
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:02.790
<v Speaker 9>to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And there's always the same reason was </v>

740
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:03.550
<v Speaker 9>that someone would appear and say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not shocked.</v>

741
00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:04.120
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>of course.</v>

742
00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:04.980
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not shocked.</v>

743
00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:08.230
<v Speaker 9>I'm not offended.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm offended on behalf of others.</v>

744
00:47:08.231 --> 00:47:10.990
<v Speaker 9>Young,</v>
<v Speaker 9>impressionable plastic minds,</v>

745
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.630
<v Speaker 9>the vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's not good enough.</v>

746
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:14.350
<v Speaker 9>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's.</v>

747
00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:16.600
<v Speaker 9>So often people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>see,</v>

748
00:47:16.601 --> 00:47:19.000
<v Speaker 9>I don't mind being called a faggot or a </v>
<v Speaker 9>cake or whatever,</v>

749
00:47:19.001 --> 00:47:21.610
<v Speaker 9>blue or mad person because they've got </v>
<v Speaker 9>mental health issues.</v>

750
00:47:21.611 --> 00:47:23.620
<v Speaker 9>I don't mind people insulting me and </v>
<v Speaker 9>people say,</v>

751
00:47:23.621 --> 00:47:24.610
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's all right for you,</v>

752
00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.620
<v Speaker 9>Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 9>because you're new.</v>

753
00:47:26.621 --> 00:47:31.621
<v Speaker 9>You're strong like I don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 9>particularly strong and I don't know </v>

754
00:47:31.621 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 9>that I like being called a faggot and </v>
<v Speaker 9>the kite particularly,</v>

755
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:38.160
<v Speaker 9>but I don't believe that the advances in</v>
<v Speaker 9>my culture that have allowed me to marry</v>

756
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 9>as I have now been for three years to </v>
<v Speaker 9>someone of my gender.</v>

757
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:47.820
<v Speaker 9>I don't believe they are a result of </v>
<v Speaker 9>political correctness and maybe </v>

758
00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.271
<v Speaker 9>political correctness is actually just </v>
<v Speaker 9>some sort of live trout that the harder </v>

759
00:47:51.271 --> 00:47:53.530
<v Speaker 9>we squeeze it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the further it goes away and you will be</v>

760
00:47:53.531 --> 00:47:55.330
<v Speaker 9>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not talking about physical retinas.</v>

761
00:47:55.331 --> 00:48:00.331
<v Speaker 9>You're talking about social justice with</v>
<v Speaker 9>which I agree with where they want to </v>

762
00:48:00.331 --> 00:48:00.980
<v Speaker 9>call it identity politics or the history</v>
<v Speaker 9>of your people.</v>

763
00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.430
<v Speaker 9>In the history of my people,</v>
<v Speaker 9>my people were slaves as well.</v>

764
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:08.550
<v Speaker 9>Both the British were slaves of Romans </v>
<v Speaker 9>and the Jews were slaves to the </v>

765
00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:11.311
<v Speaker 9>Egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 9>All human beings have been slaves at </v>

766
00:48:11.311 --> 00:48:13.840
<v Speaker 9>some point and we all in that sense </v>
<v Speaker 9>share that knowledge of how important it</v>

767
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:18.841
<v Speaker 9>is to speak up,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but Russell means who was a friend of </v>

768
00:48:18.841 --> 00:48:19.060
<v Speaker 9>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who was the one who founded the American</v>

769
00:48:19.061 --> 00:48:20.320
<v Speaker 9>Indian movement.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He said,</v>

770
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:25.520
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I forgot to call me an Indian or a </v>

771
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:25.520
<v Speaker 9>Lakota Sioux or Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't care what you call me.</v>

772
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.890
<v Speaker 9>It's how we're treated.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That matters,</v>

773
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:30.190
<v Speaker 9>and so I'm really addressing a more </v>
<v Speaker 9>popular idea.</v>

774
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:36.270
<v Speaker 9>Also actually in Barrow,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Alaska and Inupiaq said,</v>

775
00:48:36.271 --> 00:48:41.271
<v Speaker 9>call me an Eskimo.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's obviously easier for you because </v>

776
00:48:41.271 --> 00:48:44.271
<v Speaker 9>you keep mispronouncing Inupiaq in a </v>
<v Speaker 9>words do matter.</v>

777
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:50.130
<v Speaker 9>I'll just end with a quick story.</v>
<v Speaker 9>A gay rights came about in England </v>

778
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:53.340
<v Speaker 9>because we slowly in persistently </v>
<v Speaker 9>knocked on the door of people in power.</v>

779
00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.990
<v Speaker 9>We didn't shout.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We didn't scream.</v>

780
00:48:55.230 --> 00:49:00.230
<v Speaker 9>People like Ian mckellen eventually got </v>
<v Speaker 9>to see the prime minister and when the </v>

781
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:03.561
<v Speaker 9>Queen signed in the royal assent,</v>
<v Speaker 9>she has to for the bill allowing </v>

782
00:49:03.561 --> 00:49:05.340
<v Speaker 9>equality of marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 9>She said,</v>

783
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:06.420
<v Speaker 9>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

784
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:12.650
<v Speaker 9>I couldn't imagine this in 1953.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Really is extraordinary,</v>

785
00:49:13.411 --> 00:49:16.800
<v Speaker 9>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just wonderful and handed it over.</v>

786
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.200
<v Speaker 9>Now that's a nice story and I hope it's </v>
<v Speaker 9>true,</v>

787
00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:21.660
<v Speaker 9>but it's nothing to do with political </v>
<v Speaker 9>correctness.</v>

788
00:49:21.661 --> 00:49:24.180
<v Speaker 9>It's to do with human decency.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's that simple.</v>

789
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:29.960
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great</v>

790
00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.540
<v Speaker 4>rebuttals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're strong opening statements.</v>

791
00:49:36.541 --> 00:49:38.000
<v Speaker 4>Let's move now into the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

792
00:49:38.001 --> 00:49:43.001
<v Speaker 4>the moderated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cross examination portion of this </v>

793
00:49:43.001 --> 00:49:46.191
<v Speaker 4>debate and get both sides engaging on </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the key issues here.</v>

794
00:49:47.041 --> 00:49:49.700
<v Speaker 4>And I think what we've heard here is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit of a attention.</v>

795
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:52.620
<v Speaker 4>Let's draw it out a bit more between,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

796
00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.530
<v Speaker 4>the rights of groups to feel included,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have,</v>

797
00:49:55.531 --> 00:49:56.430
<v Speaker 4>in your words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michelle,</v>

798
00:49:56.431 --> 00:50:00.900
<v Speaker 4>the opportunity for individuality and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>belief on the other side that,</v>

799
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something,</v>

800
00:50:02.131 --> 00:50:07.131
<v Speaker 4>a threat here when these groups are </v>
<v Speaker 4>overly privileged through affirmative </v>

801
00:50:07.131 --> 00:50:10.260
<v Speaker 4>action or other outcome oriented </v>
<v Speaker 4>processes.</v>

802
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.300
<v Speaker 4>So Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to start with you,</v>

803
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:17.670
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why isn't there just harm that's done to</v>

804
00:50:17.671 --> 00:50:21.300
<v Speaker 4>groups by privileging their group </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity,</v>

805
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:26.990
<v Speaker 4>whether it be a group identity of race </v>
<v Speaker 4>or gender and not immediately treating </v>

806
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 4>them as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the way that</v>

807
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.710
<v Speaker 8>Jordan and Steven would like to see you </v>
<v Speaker 8>see them.</v>

808
00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:32.630
<v Speaker 8>First will,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a couple of things.</v>

809
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:37.631
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there was no arbitrary and random </v>

810
00:50:37.631 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 8>distinction that people of color and </v>
<v Speaker 8>other minority groups made when I talked</v>

811
00:50:40.581 --> 00:50:43.250
<v Speaker 8>about the invention of race,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the invention of gender,</v>

812
00:50:43.251 --> 00:50:48.251
<v Speaker 8>the invention of group think that was </v>
<v Speaker 8>not done by those groups that have been </v>

813
00:50:48.251 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 8>so named as Ms Dot Goldberg said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so first of all,</v>

814
00:50:50.841 --> 00:50:55.841
<v Speaker 8>you've got to acknowledge the historical</v>
<v Speaker 8>evolution of that reality and the </v>

815
00:50:55.841 --> 00:50:57.890
<v Speaker 8>concept of group identity did not begin </v>
<v Speaker 8>with them.</v>

816
00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:01.040
<v Speaker 8>It began with a group that didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 8>to announce its identity.</v>

817
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:06.370
<v Speaker 8>When you are in control,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't have to announce who you are </v>

818
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:09.550
<v Speaker 8>so that many white brothers and sisters </v>
<v Speaker 8>don't see themselves as one among many </v>

819
00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:10.550
<v Speaker 8>other ethnicities or groups.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What they see themselves as,</v>

820
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.050
<v Speaker 8>I'm just American,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm Canadian.</v>

821
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 8>Can't you be like us?</v>

822
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:18.310
<v Speaker 8>Can't you transcend those narrow group </v>
<v Speaker 8>identifications and yet those group </v>

823
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:22.511
<v Speaker 8>identifications have been imprinted upon</v>
<v Speaker 8>them by the very people who now because </v>

824
00:51:22.641 --> 00:51:25.040
<v Speaker 8>they are their group power has been </v>
<v Speaker 8>challenged.</v>

825
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 8>Let's make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There is a challenge.</v>

826
00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:29.270
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I agree with Mr.</v>

827
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:34.270
<v Speaker 8>Fry in a kind of neverland of how sweet </v>
<v Speaker 8>it would be to have a kingly and cleanly</v>

828
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:37.760
<v Speaker 8>a metaphor about how it got resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That ain't the real deal,</v>

829
00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:41.990
<v Speaker 8>homie and in the real world and it and </v>
<v Speaker 8>in the real world,</v>

830
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 8>there's stuff at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's at stake or bodies?</v>

831
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:46.960
<v Speaker 8>What's at stake or people's lives?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's a sake?</v>

832
00:51:46.961 --> 00:51:49.070
<v Speaker 8>People are still being lynched,</v>
<v Speaker 8>killed what's at stake.</v>

833
00:51:49.071 --> 00:51:54.071
<v Speaker 8>People because of their sexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 8>their racial identity are still being </v>

834
00:51:54.071 --> 00:51:54.200
<v Speaker 8>harmed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I'm suggesting to you,</v>

835
00:51:54.201 --> 00:51:57.830
<v Speaker 8>it's not that we are against being </v>
<v Speaker 8>treated as individuals.</v>

836
00:51:57.831 --> 00:52:02.831
<v Speaker 8>That's what we're crying for.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Please don't see me as a member of a </v>

837
00:52:02.831 --> 00:52:03.260
<v Speaker 8>group that you think is a thug,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a nigger,</v>

838
00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.960
<v Speaker 8>a nihilist,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a pathological person.</v>

839
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.780
<v Speaker 8>See me as an individual who embodies the</v>
<v Speaker 8>reality is if you are,</v>

840
00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:14.790
<v Speaker 8>but I'll end by saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What Michelle said is extremely </v>

841
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.591
<v Speaker 8>important.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The people who have individual rights </v>

842
00:52:17.591 --> 00:52:21.420
<v Speaker 8>didn't have to fight for them in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>same manner that people of color and </v>

843
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 8>others have had to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When Mr Fried talked about enslavement,</v>

844
00:52:24.801 --> 00:52:29.300
<v Speaker 8>he named them read Orlando Patterson's </v>
<v Speaker 8>comparative history of race and slavery.</v>

845
00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:33.260
<v Speaker 8>Over 28 civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the Greeks did not have the same kind of</v>

846
00:52:33.261 --> 00:52:36.890
<v Speaker 8>slavery that Americans said it was </v>
<v Speaker 8>chattel slavery in Greece.</v>

847
00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:38.840
<v Speaker 8>You could buy back your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your your freedom.</v>

848
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:44.110
<v Speaker 8>You could teach the children of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>people who enslaved you and because of </v>

849
00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:47.060
<v Speaker 8>your display of prodigious intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you could secure your freedom.</v>

850
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:52.120
<v Speaker 8>That was not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You were punished and killed for </v>

851
00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.360
<v Speaker 8>literacy in America,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so my point simply is this,</v>

852
00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:58.720
<v Speaker 8>is that I am all for the celebration of </v>
<v Speaker 8>broader identities and I think that </v>

853
00:52:59.151 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 8>often those who are minorities and </v>
<v Speaker 8>others are not celebrated for the degree</v>

854
00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:04.220
<v Speaker 8>that we are out in.</v>

855
00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.030
<v Speaker 8>By saying this in America,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we have the confederate flag.</v>

856
00:53:08.031 --> 00:53:09.410
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if y'all are familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

857
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.660
<v Speaker 8>We have a confederate flag.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have white guys mostly in the south,</v>

858
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:19.690
<v Speaker 8>but others as well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>flagging those confederate flags that </v>

859
00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 8>are part of the south that refuse to </v>
<v Speaker 8>seed.</v>

860
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:24.800
<v Speaker 8>It's legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A conquest at the hands of the.</v>

861
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:30.560
<v Speaker 8>There has been a politics of resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Every you talking about politics of </v>

862
00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.440
<v Speaker 8>identity wearing that flag,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not the American flag.</v>

863
00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:34.620
<v Speaker 8>They are not American.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They are celebrating a succession.</v>

864
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.920
<v Speaker 8>A move away from America and a man named</v>
<v Speaker 8>Colin Kaepernick who was a football </v>

865
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.811
<v Speaker 8>player saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to bring beauty to that flag has </v>

866
00:53:44.811 --> 00:53:49.011
<v Speaker 8>been denied opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so we have to really set the terms of </v>

867
00:53:49.011 --> 00:53:49.410
<v Speaker 8>debate in order.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Before we.</v>

868
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:50.920
<v Speaker 8>We proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you.</v>

869
00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:57.300
<v Speaker 10>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Let's have you jump in on this idea of,</v>

870
00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:57.850
<v Speaker 10>of</v>

871
00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 7>what you see as the pernicious danger of</v>
<v Speaker 7>group think when it comes to ethnicity,</v>

872
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.360
<v Speaker 7>when it comes to gender.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why do you think that that's one of the </v>

873
00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.690
<v Speaker 7>primal sins in your view of of political</v>
<v Speaker 7>correctness?</v>

874
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:15.230
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's one of the primal sins of </v>

875
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.230
<v Speaker 7>identity politics players on the left </v>
<v Speaker 7>and the right.</v>

876
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 7>Just to be clear about that personally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>since this has got personal at times,</v>

877
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:23.860
<v Speaker 7>I'm no fan of the identitarian right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that anybody who plays a game of</v>

878
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.990
<v Speaker 7>conceptual game where group identity </v>
<v Speaker 7>comes first and foremost,</v>

879
00:54:27.991 --> 00:54:32.991
<v Speaker 7>risks and exacerbation of tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't matter whether it's on the </v>

880
00:54:32.991 --> 00:54:35.280
<v Speaker 7>left or the right with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>idea of group.</v>

881
00:54:35.281 --> 00:54:36.140
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

882
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:41.180
<v Speaker 7>there's a fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and this is something we've fallen into </v>

883
00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:41.880
<v Speaker 7>terribly in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not least because we had to contend with</v>

884
00:54:41.881 --> 00:54:46.881
<v Speaker 7>the threat of Quebec separatism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the idea of group writes is </v>

885
00:54:46.881 --> 00:54:50.631
<v Speaker 7>extraordinarily problematic because the </v>
<v Speaker 7>the verse of the coin of individual </v>

886
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:56.751
<v Speaker 7>rights as individual responsibilities </v>
<v Speaker 7>and you can hold an individual </v>

887
00:54:56.751 --> 00:55:00.051
<v Speaker 7>responsible and an individual can be </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsible and so that's partly why </v>

888
00:55:00.051 --> 00:55:02.940
<v Speaker 7>individuals have rights,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but groups.</v>

889
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.230
<v Speaker 7>How do you hold a group responsible?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean the whole idea is not.</v>

890
00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:10.800
<v Speaker 7>It's not a good idea to hold a group </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsible if first of all,</v>

891
00:55:10.801 --> 00:55:15.801
<v Speaker 7>it flies in the face of the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>sort of justice systems that we've laid </v>

892
00:55:15.801 --> 00:55:19.581
<v Speaker 7>out in the West that are essentially </v>
<v Speaker 7>predicated first on the assumption of </v>

893
00:55:19.581 --> 00:55:22.821
<v Speaker 7>individual innocence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but also on the possibility of </v>

894
00:55:22.821 --> 00:55:22.821
<v Speaker 7>individual guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not group guilt.</v>

895
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:25.140
<v Speaker 7>We saw what happened in the 20th century</v>
<v Speaker 7>many,</v>

896
00:55:25.141 --> 00:55:28.390
<v Speaker 7>many times when the idea of group guilt </v>
<v Speaker 7>was it was it.</v>

897
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.960
<v Speaker 7>It was enabled to get a foothold,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>

898
00:55:30.961 --> 00:55:34.650
<v Speaker 7>in the policy and in the justice system </v>
<v Speaker 7>was absolutely catastrophic and so,</v>

899
00:55:34.651 --> 00:55:36.480
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fine group rights,</v>

900
00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:37.620
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what are you gonna?</v>

901
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:39.570
<v Speaker 7>How are you going to contend with the </v>
<v Speaker 7>alternative to that,</v>

902
00:55:39.571 --> 00:55:44.571
<v Speaker 7>the opposite of that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or where's the group responsibility and </v>

903
00:55:44.571 --> 00:55:48.810
<v Speaker 7>how are you going to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how are we going to hold your group's </v>

904
00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:48.810
<v Speaker 7>responsible?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

905
00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:52.041
<v Speaker 7>we don't have to talk about that because</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're too concerned with rectifying </v>

906
00:55:52.041 --> 00:55:54.450
<v Speaker 7>hypothetical rep rectifying historical </v>
<v Speaker 7>injustices,</v>

907
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:59.451
<v Speaker 7>hypothetical and otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's certainly not to say that </v>

908
00:55:59.451 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 7>there weren't any shortage of absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 7>catastrophic historical injustices.</v>

909
00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:07.220
<v Speaker 7>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The point is how you view the situation </v>

910
00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:11.331
<v Speaker 7>at the most fundamental level and group </v>
<v Speaker 7>rights are absolute catastrophe in my </v>

911
00:56:11.331 --> 00:56:11.580
<v Speaker 7>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Come on,</v>

912
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.290
<v Speaker 7>Michelle</v>

913
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.710
<v Speaker 10>point.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Is this something you've written about?</v>

914
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 7>The idea that in identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the identity of the group is absolutely </v>

915
00:56:24.281 --> 00:56:29.281
<v Speaker 7>a valid part of the discourse and and </v>
<v Speaker 7>individuals could and should be seen and</v>

916
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:32.500
<v Speaker 7>participate in groups as they enter into</v>
<v Speaker 7>the civic space.</v>

917
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:34.110
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure for</v>

918
00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:39.110
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We necessarily have to analogize from </v>

919
00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:39.110
<v Speaker 6>individual the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

920
00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.970
<v Speaker 6>the opposite of individual rights is </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual responsibility.</v>

921
00:56:41.971 --> 00:56:45.840
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure that that analogy </v>
<v Speaker 6>necessarily holds for the groups.</v>

922
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:46.770
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

923
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:51.950
<v Speaker 6>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and one of the things that I think is </v>

924
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:53.691
<v Speaker 6>complicated about this discussion is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that we're talking about three very </v>

925
00:56:53.691 --> 00:56:54.630
<v Speaker 6>different cultural context,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three different histories,</v>

926
00:56:54.631 --> 00:56:59.250
<v Speaker 6>three different kinds of legal regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But in the United States,</v>

927
00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:04.340
<v Speaker 6>I'm a great,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a huge part of our politics has been </v>

928
00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:09.860
<v Speaker 6>groups struggling for rights for their </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual members.</v>

929
00:57:10.381 --> 00:57:10.980
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

930
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.460
<v Speaker 6>so women in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

931
00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:17.790
<v Speaker 6>seeking the right to reproductive </v>
<v Speaker 6>control of their body,</v>

932
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:19.020
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

933
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:24.200
<v Speaker 6>African Americans in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 6>seeking redress from police brutality or</v>

934
00:57:26.491 --> 00:57:31.491
<v Speaker 6>discrimination or simply the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>tendency in America of white people to </v>

935
00:57:32.311 --> 00:57:37.311
<v Speaker 6>call the police whenever they see an </v>
<v Speaker 6>African American in a place where they </v>

936
00:57:37.311 --> 00:57:37.311
<v Speaker 6>don't think that they're supposed to be.</v>

937
00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:41.160
<v Speaker 6>And you simply.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't see how you can contend with any</v>

938
00:57:41.161 --> 00:57:46.161
<v Speaker 6>of those social problems if you see </v>
<v Speaker 6>society as just an ocean of atomized </v>

939
00:57:46.561 --> 00:57:47.630
<v Speaker 6>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

940
00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:49.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>

941
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:50.440
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

942
00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:56.690
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's anything </v>

943
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:58.521
<v Speaker 6>pernicious about people banding together</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the basis of their common identity to</v>

944
00:58:01.621 --> 00:58:05.760
<v Speaker 6>seek redress for discrimination and </v>
<v Speaker 6>exclusion.</v>

945
00:58:05.761 --> 00:58:10.761
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that that is everything that's </v>

946
00:58:10.761 --> 00:58:12.681
<v Speaker 6>best about our democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is the definition of progress.</v>

947
00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.340
<v Speaker 6>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

948
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:20.390
<v Speaker 6>I keep stumbling with the idea that this</v>
<v Speaker 6>is somehow tyrannical or that way lies </v>

949
00:58:21.391 --> 00:58:23.050
<v Speaker 6>stolen ism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

950
00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.850
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of times people who are opposed to</v>

951
00:58:26.851 --> 00:58:31.150
<v Speaker 6>political correctness talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>concept of category creep or is it,</v>

952
00:58:31.151 --> 00:58:32.020
<v Speaker 6>is it kept not?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

953
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:34.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Category Creek,</v>

954
00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:39.060
<v Speaker 6>which is a concept that was originated </v>
<v Speaker 6>by a believer in Australian academic and</v>

955
00:58:39.061 --> 00:58:42.180
<v Speaker 6>it's basically kind of a failure to draw</v>
<v Speaker 6>distinctions,</v>

956
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:42.660
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

957
00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:47.660
<v Speaker 6>So that you kind of can't see the </v>
<v Speaker 6>difference between say a KKK grand </v>

958
00:58:48.601 --> 00:58:52.770
<v Speaker 6>wizard and a conservative like say Ben </v>
<v Speaker 6>Shapiro or you know,</v>

959
00:58:52.771 --> 00:58:57.070
<v Speaker 6>that you kind of see everybody to your </v>
<v Speaker 6>right as you know,</v>

960
00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.760
<v Speaker 6>fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sexist to Tala,</v>

961
00:58:59.761 --> 00:59:04.761
<v Speaker 6>Terry and intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that that is a real thing </v>

962
00:59:04.761 --> 00:59:05.760
<v Speaker 6>that happens in part because,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

963
00:59:05.761 --> 00:59:10.761
<v Speaker 6>undergraduates often thinking broad and </v>
<v Speaker 6>slightly overwrought categories.</v>

964
00:59:11.941 --> 00:59:14.190
<v Speaker 6>I know I did when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I was a kid.</v>

965
00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:15.180
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

966
00:59:15.181 --> 00:59:16.200
<v Speaker 6>maybe they'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

967
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.030
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hear a lot of category creep in,</v>

968
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:26.080
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the argument against political </v>

969
00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.791
<v Speaker 6>correctness or against seeking group </v>
<v Speaker 6>redress the idea that kind of that way </v>

970
00:59:27.791 --> 00:59:30.500
<v Speaker 6>lies dehumanization or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're kind of one minute,</v>

971
00:59:30.501 --> 00:59:30.880
<v Speaker 6>you're asking</v>

972
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:31.620
<v Speaker 9>what's up,</v>
<v Speaker 9>steven?</v>

973
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:33.640
<v Speaker 9>Come in on this part of your opening </v>
<v Speaker 9>remarks.</v>

974
00:59:33.641 --> 00:59:35.050
<v Speaker 9>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're a category creep.</v>

975
00:59:35.051 --> 00:59:37.470
<v Speaker 9>Steven didn't respond to that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's a nice.</v>

976
00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:42.590
<v Speaker 9>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm still very lost about why we aren't </v>

977
00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:43.230
<v Speaker 9>talking about political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're talking about politics and the.</v>

978
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:44.520
<v Speaker 10>That's fine.</v>

979
00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:53.780
<v Speaker 9>Shared exactly what you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not an enemy of identity politics </v>

980
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:58.191
<v Speaker 9>per se.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I can obviously see where it goes wrong </v>

981
00:59:58.191 --> 00:59:58.500
<v Speaker 9>and where it's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let's be empirical about this.</v>

982
00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:01.320
<v Speaker 9>How well is it working for you in </v>
<v Speaker 9>America at the moment?</v>

983
01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:02.760
<v Speaker 9>Not well at all.</v>

984
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:06.230
<v Speaker 10>Really isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can ask me in a moment.</v>

985
01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 9>The reason,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the reason that trump and brexit in </v>

986
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.321
<v Speaker 9>Britain and all kinds of nativist all </v>
<v Speaker 9>over Europe and succeeding is not the </v>

987
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:18.951
<v Speaker 9>time for the right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's the catastrophic failure of the </v>

988
01:00:18.951 --> 01:00:18.951
<v Speaker 9>left.</v>

989
01:00:18.951 --> 01:00:22.800
<v Speaker 10>It's our fault.</v>
<v Speaker 10>My point is</v>

990
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:30.250
<v Speaker 9>that I turned to the right or anything </v>
<v Speaker 9>like that or that I'm nice and fluffy </v>

991
01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 9>and want everybody to be decent.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm saying,</v>

992
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.420
<v Speaker 9>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 9>political correctness.</v>

993
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:36.290
<v Speaker 9>Resist fight.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you have a point of view,</v>

994
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.330
<v Speaker 9>fight it in the proper manner.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Using democracy shouldn't be not channel</v>

995
01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:42.330
<v Speaker 10>of education,</v>
<v Speaker 10>not language.</v>

996
01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:44.970
<v Speaker 10>It's so silly.</v>

997
01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:51.110
<v Speaker 9>There's a rule you know in chess,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the best move to playing chess is not </v>

998
01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:55.500
<v Speaker 9>the best chess move.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's the move your opponent least wants </v>

999
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.970
<v Speaker 9>you to play at the moment you're being </v>
<v Speaker 9>recruiting sergeant for the right,</v>

1000
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.880
<v Speaker 8>annoying and upsetting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and instead of fighting either fighting </v>

1001
01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:08.080
<v Speaker 8>or persuading,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but political correctness is a middle </v>

1002
01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:08.440
<v Speaker 8>course that simply doesn't work well.</v>
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>

1003
01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:10.430
<v Speaker 8>be empirical,</v>
<v Speaker 8>empirical,</v>

1004
01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.520
<v Speaker 8>as far as I know the word means that </v>
<v Speaker 8>which can be verified and falsified </v>

1005
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 8>through the sense executive,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so if we look at it in an objective way,</v>

1006
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:23.770
<v Speaker 8>the reality is that people don't have </v>
<v Speaker 8>equal access to the means to articulate </v>

1007
01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:24.840
<v Speaker 8>that very moment.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're talking about,</v>

1008
01:01:24.841 --> 01:01:28.130
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking about the empirical results </v>
<v Speaker 8>of this political attitudes.</v>

1009
01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.410
<v Speaker 8>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but my point is simply this,</v>

1010
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.890
<v Speaker 8>I'm suggesting to you that people use </v>
<v Speaker 8>the weapons at hand.</v>

1011
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:37.040
<v Speaker 8>Now it was apprehend Joshua Heschel,</v>
<v Speaker 8>rabbi,</v>

1012
01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:40.250
<v Speaker 8>who said everybody's not guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but everybody's responsible,</v>

1013
01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.050
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's a distinction there.</v>

1014
01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.500
<v Speaker 8>Everybody clearly is not guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but what's interesting,</v>

1015
01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.520
<v Speaker 8>look at the flip side.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you have benefited from 300 years of </v>

1016
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.310
<v Speaker 8>holding people in servitude thinking </v>
<v Speaker 8>that you did it all on your own,</v>

1017
01:01:52.311 --> 01:01:53.560
<v Speaker 8>why can't these people work harder?</v>

1018
01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.060
<v Speaker 8>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 8>For 300 years you ain't had no job.</v>

1019
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.450
<v Speaker 8>So the reality is for 300 years you old </v>
<v Speaker 8>people in the bands,</v>

1020
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.690
<v Speaker 8>you hold them insubordination,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you refuse to give them rights.</v>

1021
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:06.260
<v Speaker 8>Then all of a sudden you free them and </v>
<v Speaker 8>say you're now individuals.</v>

1022
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:11.410
<v Speaker 8>Not having the skills reflect,</v>
<v Speaker 8>literally not having skills receptive </v>

1023
01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.160
<v Speaker 8>about America.</v>
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>

1024
01:02:13.161 --> 01:02:14.870
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking about American society.</v>
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>

1025
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:16.460
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking about the northern </v>
<v Speaker 8>hemisphere.</v>

1026
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:19.500
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking about every society where </v>
<v Speaker 8>enslavement has existed,</v>

1027
01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:24.501
<v Speaker 8>but I'm speaking specifically of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>repudiation of individual rights among </v>

1028
01:02:24.501 --> 01:02:29.301
<v Speaker 8>people of Color in America who were </v>
<v Speaker 8>denied the opportunity to be </v>

1029
01:02:29.301 --> 01:02:30.000
<v Speaker 8>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I see.</v>

1030
01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:34.590
<v Speaker 8>I obviously and ideally that Michelle </v>
<v Speaker 8>Goldberg does to agree with the emphasis</v>

1031
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:37.350
<v Speaker 8>on individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What we're saying to you is that we have</v>

1032
01:02:37.351 --> 01:02:42.351
<v Speaker 8>not been permitted to be individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have not been permitted to exercise </v>

1033
01:02:42.351 --> 01:02:45.450
<v Speaker 8>our individual autonomy and authority </v>
<v Speaker 8>and the refusal to do so.</v>

1034
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:49.170
<v Speaker 8>To recognize me as an individual means </v>
<v Speaker 8>when you roll up on me and I'm a 12 year</v>

1035
01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:54.171
<v Speaker 8>old boy in a park and you shoot first in</v>
<v Speaker 8>ways you do the black kids that you </v>

1036
01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:58.731
<v Speaker 8>don't do the white kids.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You are not treating that person as an </v>

1037
01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:00.060
<v Speaker 8>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If we're living in a society where women</v>

1038
01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:05.210
<v Speaker 8>are subject to abberant forms of horrid </v>
<v Speaker 8>to patriarchal,</v>

1039
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 8>sexist and massaged his behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You are not acknowledging the centrality</v>

1040
01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:13.850
<v Speaker 8>of the individuality of women.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You are treating them according to eight</v>

1041
01:03:13.851 --> 01:03:18.851
<v Speaker 8>group dynamic and if we.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If we get beyond the ability of people </v>

1042
01:03:18.851 --> 01:03:23.421
<v Speaker 8>on the right to understand the degree to</v>
<v Speaker 8>which they have operated from the basis </v>

1043
01:03:23.421 --> 01:03:26.450
<v Speaker 8>of benefit from group identity without </v>
<v Speaker 8>having said it,</v>

1044
01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 8>by saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the great American philosopher,</v>

1045
01:03:28.591 --> 01:03:33.591
<v Speaker 8>beyonce knowles say it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that it has been said that racism is so </v>

1046
01:03:34.021 --> 01:03:36.990
<v Speaker 8>American.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That if you challenge racism,</v>

1047
01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.150
<v Speaker 8>you look like you're challenging </v>
<v Speaker 8>America.</v>

1048
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:44.040
<v Speaker 8>We are challenging inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we are challenging the refusal to see me</v>

1049
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:46.830
<v Speaker 8>as an individual when we overcome that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Have added.</v>

1050
01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:47.430
<v Speaker 8>We're all on here.</v>

1051
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:52.970
<v Speaker 7>Just getting started here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A couple of questions.</v>

1052
01:03:52.971 --> 01:03:57.971
<v Speaker 7>So let's let her sites folks are going </v>
<v Speaker 7>to go to Jordan then to us assume for a </v>

1053
01:03:57.971 --> 01:03:59.900
<v Speaker 7>moment that I benefited from my white </v>
<v Speaker 7>privilege.</v>

1054
01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.570
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So let's assume that that's fine.</v>

1055
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:04.610
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well that's what you would say.</v>

1056
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.970
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1057
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.990
<v Speaker 7>so let's</v>

1058
01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:09.750
<v Speaker 8>here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's get precise this.</v>

1059
01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:14.751
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Was that into very individual you let's </v>

1060
01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:14.830
<v Speaker 8>get precise about this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1061
01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.470
<v Speaker 8>He's good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Precise</v>

1062
01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:20.740
<v Speaker 7>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is My present present level of </v>

1063
01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.190
<v Speaker 7>attainment or achievement?</v>
<v Speaker 7>A consequence of my white privilege.</v>

1064
01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:25.640
<v Speaker 7>And I don't mean sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean do you mean five percent?</v>

1065
01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:28.940
<v Speaker 7>Do you mean 15 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you mean 25 percent?</v>

1066
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.640
<v Speaker 7>Do you mean 75 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And what do you propose?</v>

1067
01:04:31.641 --> 01:04:33.830
<v Speaker 7>I do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How about a tax?</v>

1068
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:38.540
<v Speaker 7>How about a tax that's like specialized </v>
<v Speaker 7>for me so that I can account for my damn</v>

1069
01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:39.480
<v Speaker 7>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You said that.</v>

1070
01:04:39.481 --> 01:04:40.910
<v Speaker 7>I thought about it.</v>

1071
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:44.380
<v Speaker 11>Now let's get precise about one other </v>
<v Speaker 11>thing.</v>

1072
01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.240
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We'll get precise.</v>

1073
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:48.950
<v Speaker 7>How about one other thing?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Their sites?</v>

1074
01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.220
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Precise.</v>

1075
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.930
<v Speaker 7>Precise,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yes.</v>

1076
01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:55.370
<v Speaker 7>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if we can agree and we haven't,</v>

1077
01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.000
<v Speaker 7>that the left can go too far,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which it clearly can't.</v>

1078
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:04.340
<v Speaker 7>Then how would my worthy opponents </v>
<v Speaker 7>precisely defined when the left that </v>

1079
01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.580
<v Speaker 7>they stand for has gone too far.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You didn't like equity,</v>

1080
01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.830
<v Speaker 7>equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's a great marker.</v>

1081
01:05:09.831 --> 01:05:13.520
<v Speaker 7>But if you have a better suggestion and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and won't sidestep the question.</v>

1082
01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:18.690
<v Speaker 7>So let's figure out how I can dispense </v>
<v Speaker 7>with my white privilege and so that you </v>

1083
01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:18.690
<v Speaker 7>can tell</v>

1084
01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:20.710
<v Speaker 6>me when the left has gone too far since </v>
<v Speaker 6>they clearly can.</v>

1085
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:23.530
<v Speaker 6>And that's what this debate is about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>about political correctness.</v>

1086
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 6>It's about the left going too far and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>think it's gone too far in many ways and</v>

1087
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to figure out exactly how and </v>
<v Speaker 6>when.</v>

1088
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:34.981
<v Speaker 6>So the reasonable left could make it's a</v>
<v Speaker 6>sentence again and we could quit all </v>

1089
01:05:34.981 --> 01:05:34.981
<v Speaker 6>this nonsense.</v>

1090
01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:35.760
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1091
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:47.470
<v Speaker 6>I will answer you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I just want to answer first because </v>

1092
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.470
<v Speaker 6>you talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1093
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:48.990
<v Speaker 6>this is how we got trump and this is the</v>
<v Speaker 6>failure of the left.</v>

1094
01:05:48.991 --> 01:05:53.991
<v Speaker 6>And so I know I'm a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to a ton of trump rallies during </v>

1095
01:05:53.991 --> 01:05:57.180
<v Speaker 6>the campaign in different parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>country and you're right,</v>

1096
01:05:57.210 --> 01:06:02.210
<v Speaker 6>everywhere I went,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard complaints about political </v>

1097
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.210
<v Speaker 6>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1098
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:03.810
<v Speaker 6>far more than I heard complaints about </v>
<v Speaker 6>say Nafta.</v>

1099
01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:09.840
<v Speaker 6>But when you asked people what they </v>
<v Speaker 6>meant by political correctness,</v>

1100
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:14.990
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they call it a woman that worked with </v>

1101
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:14.990
<v Speaker 6>girl and she got mad at them and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

1102
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:15.650
<v Speaker 6>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1103
01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:20.660
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't in public wonder aloud </v>
<v Speaker 6>whether the president of the United </v>

1104
01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:20.980
<v Speaker 6>States was really a Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1105
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:22.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they didn't like that they couldn't make</v>

1106
01:06:22.861 --> 01:06:25.230
<v Speaker 6>gay jokes anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so on the one hand,</v>

1107
01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:26.550
<v Speaker 6>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I've written about this.</v>

1108
01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:30.530
<v Speaker 6>I think that when you try to suppress </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1109
01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:35.540
<v Speaker 6>when people have these prejudices and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you try to suppress them,</v>

1110
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:40.020
<v Speaker 6>it can create a kind of dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 6>counter reaction.</v>

1111
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.370
<v Speaker 6>But I also think that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1112
01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:44.580
<v Speaker 6>what they were reacting to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

1113
01:06:44.581 --> 01:06:46.260
<v Speaker 6>to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go back to the title of this debate,</v>

1114
01:06:46.261 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 6>what they called political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1115
01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:52.970
<v Speaker 6>the fact that they had to have this </v>
<v Speaker 6>urbain black president who they felt </v>

1116
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:54.750
<v Speaker 6>talked down to that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is really what they meant.</v>

1117
01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:58.590
<v Speaker 6>I don't see a way around that because </v>
<v Speaker 6>that is,</v>

1118
01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.240
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's progress.</v>

1119
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.060
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so to go to the,</v>

1120
01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:05.130
<v Speaker 6>to the question of when the left goes </v>
<v Speaker 6>too far,</v>

1121
01:07:05.131 --> 01:07:10.131
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to me it's pretty easy violence and </v>

1122
01:07:10.131 --> 01:07:10.131
<v Speaker 6>censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1123
01:07:10.131 --> 01:07:14.641
<v Speaker 6>I'm big against violence and I'm against</v>
<v Speaker 6>censorship the.</v>

1124
01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:19.820
<v Speaker 6>But I also looking around the world </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now when the idea that there is </v>

1125
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.330
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I understand again,</v>

1126
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:28.860
<v Speaker 6>there is like a problem of kind of left </v>
<v Speaker 6>wing annoyance,</v>

1127
01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:29.190
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1128
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:32.160
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of things that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

1129
01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:37.220
<v Speaker 6>random people on the internet in </v>
<v Speaker 6>particular are able to swarm individuals</v>

1130
01:07:39.451 --> 01:07:43.320
<v Speaker 6>and turn kind of stray remarks and just </v>
<v Speaker 6>social media campaigns.</v>

1131
01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:48.410
<v Speaker 6>And this is often conflated with </v>
<v Speaker 6>political correctness and it's a bad </v>

1132
01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:52.161
<v Speaker 6>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish there was a way to put an end to </v>

1133
01:07:52.161 --> 01:07:54.591
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there is no way to put an </v>

1134
01:07:54.591 --> 01:07:55.740
<v Speaker 6>end to it simply by having kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>reasonable liberals are reasonable.</v>

1135
01:07:55.741 --> 01:08:00.741
<v Speaker 6>Socialists denounce it because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 6>a kind of awful phenomenon of modern </v>

1136
01:08:01.141 --> 01:08:06.141
<v Speaker 6>life and if you want to have a debate </v>
<v Speaker 6>about whether social media is terrible </v>

1137
01:08:06.141 --> 01:08:07.740
<v Speaker 6>for democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will be on the gay side.</v>

1138
01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:12.940
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but right now what we're really </v>

1139
01:08:13.351 --> 01:08:14.120
<v Speaker 6>disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1140
01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.900
<v Speaker 6>a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a couple I really disagreed,</v>

1141
01:08:15.901 --> 01:08:20.480
<v Speaker 6>but I'm going to go to Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the idea that the radical left poses</v>

1142
01:08:20.481 --> 01:08:23.340
<v Speaker 6>a greater threat than the radical right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you see fat,</v>

1143
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:28.390
<v Speaker 6>like actual fascism ascendant all over </v>
<v Speaker 6>the world strikes me as something that </v>

1144
01:08:29.031 --> 01:08:32.300
<v Speaker 6>you can literally only believe if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>spend your life on college campuses.</v>

1145
01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:38.330
<v Speaker 8>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to come to you on those on </v>

1146
01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:41.570
<v Speaker 8>Jordan's point about how does he in a </v>
<v Speaker 8>sense get an equal voice in this debate </v>

1147
01:08:42.331 --> 01:08:47.331
<v Speaker 8>back if it is implied that his </v>
<v Speaker 8>participation brings with it this </v>

1148
01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:52.101
<v Speaker 8>baggage of white privilege that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>allow him to see clearly the issues that</v>

1149
01:08:53.221 --> 01:08:56.300
<v Speaker 8>are before us with veterans to be </v>
<v Speaker 8>complicit in the problem itself.</v>

1150
01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.380
<v Speaker 8>Terminal logically,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're beginning at a point,</v>

1151
01:08:58.381 --> 01:09:01.530
<v Speaker 8>this is already a productive and </v>
<v Speaker 8>controversial.</v>

1152
01:09:01.531 --> 01:09:03.780
<v Speaker 8>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how can he get his equality?</v>

1153
01:09:03.781 --> 01:09:05.160
<v Speaker 8>Beck,</v>
<v Speaker 8>who you talking about?</v>

1154
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.880
<v Speaker 8>Jordan Peterson trending number one on </v>
<v Speaker 8>twitter.</v>

1155
01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.410
<v Speaker 8>Jordan Peterson internationals in an </v>
<v Speaker 8>international best seller.</v>

1156
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:16.140
<v Speaker 8>I want them to tweet something out about</v>
<v Speaker 8>me and my book.</v>

1157
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.200
<v Speaker 8>Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1158
01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:21.690
<v Speaker 8>This is what I'm saying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why the rage,</v>

1159
01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:25.780
<v Speaker 8>Bruh you you're doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you're a mean man.</v>

1160
01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:30.830
<v Speaker 8>White man and you're going to get us </v>
<v Speaker 8>right and I have never seen so much wine</v>

1161
01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:35.220
<v Speaker 8>and snow flaking.</v>

1162
01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 8>There's enough light in here to start a </v>
<v Speaker 8>vineyard and what I'm saying to you </v>

1163
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.670
<v Speaker 8>empirically and precisely when you ask </v>
<v Speaker 8>the question about white privilege,</v>

1164
01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:46.860
<v Speaker 8>the fact that you ask it in the way you </v>
<v Speaker 8>did,</v>

1165
01:09:46.861 --> 01:09:51.861
<v Speaker 8>dismissive pseudoscientific,</v>
<v Speaker 8>non empirical and without justification </v>

1166
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:56.780
<v Speaker 8>a day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The truth is that white privilege </v>

1167
01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.780
<v Speaker 8>doesn't act according to a quantifiable </v>
<v Speaker 8>segments.</v>

1168
01:09:57.930 --> 01:10:02.130
<v Speaker 8>It's about the degree to which we are </v>
<v Speaker 8>willing as a society to grapple with the</v>

1169
01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:05.130
<v Speaker 8>ideals of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 8>justice,</v>

1170
01:10:05.131 --> 01:10:08.520
<v Speaker 8>and equality upon which is based.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Number two was interesting to me.</v>

1171
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.860
<v Speaker 8>You're talking about not having a </v>
<v Speaker 8>collective identity.</v>

1172
01:10:10.861 --> 01:10:13.350
<v Speaker 8>What do you call a nation?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Are you Canadian?</v>

1173
01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.430
<v Speaker 8>Are you Canadian by yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Are you an individual or are you part of</v>

1174
01:10:17.431 --> 01:10:21.270
<v Speaker 8>a group?</v>
<v Speaker 8>When America have formed it's union,</v>

1175
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:24.960
<v Speaker 8>it did so in opposition to another </v>
<v Speaker 8>group,</v>

1176
01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:30.260
<v Speaker 8>so the reality is is that those who were</v>
<v Speaker 8>part of group identities and politics </v>

1177
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.960
<v Speaker 8>denied the legitimacy and validity of </v>
<v Speaker 8>those groups and the fact that they have</v>

1178
01:10:33.961 --> 01:10:38.910
<v Speaker 8>been created thusly and ben have </v>
<v Speaker 8>resentment against others.</v>

1179
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:44.060
<v Speaker 8>All I'm asking for is the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 8>that this quotation you talk about the </v>

1180
01:10:44.251 --> 01:10:47.760
<v Speaker 8>difference between quality of outcome </v>
<v Speaker 8>and equality of opportunity.</v>

1181
01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:52.850
<v Speaker 8>That's a state and retried argument.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hackneyed phrase derive from the halcyon</v>

1182
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:54.510
<v Speaker 8>days of the debate over affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 8>action.</v>

1183
01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.720
<v Speaker 8>Are you looking for outcomes that can be</v>
<v Speaker 8>determined equally or are you looking </v>

1184
01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.071
<v Speaker 8>for opportunity?</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you free a person after a whole long </v>

1185
01:11:04.071 --> 01:11:06.660
<v Speaker 8>time of oppression and say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>now you are free to survive.</v>

1186
01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:11.780
<v Speaker 8>If you have no skills,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you have no quantifiable means of </v>

1187
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.901
<v Speaker 8>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what you have done is liberated them </v>

1188
01:11:14.901 --> 01:11:16.680
<v Speaker 8>into and all I'm suggesting to you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Lyndon Baines Johnson,</v>

1189
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:19.920
<v Speaker 8>one of our great presidents said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you start a man in a race,</v>

1190
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:24.150
<v Speaker 8>100 years behind,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it is awfully difficult to catch up,</v>

1191
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:29.270
<v Speaker 8>so I don't think Jordan Peterson is </v>
<v Speaker 8>suffering from anything except an </v>

1192
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:32.961
<v Speaker 8>exaggerated sense of entitlement and </v>
<v Speaker 8>resentment and his own privilege is </v>

1193
01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:37.860
<v Speaker 8>invisible to him and it's manifest with </v>
<v Speaker 8>lethal intensity and ferocity right here</v>

1194
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:38.270
<v Speaker 8>on stage.</v>

1195
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:42.470
<v Speaker 5>Let me respond to that.</v>

1196
01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:53.230
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what I derived from that series of </v>

1197
01:11:53.230 --> 01:11:53.600
<v Speaker 7>rebuttals,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say is twofold.</v>

1198
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:58.930
<v Speaker 7>The first is that saying that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>radical left goes too far when they </v>

1199
01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:03.521
<v Speaker 7>engage in violence is not a sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 7>response by any stretch of the </v>

1200
01:12:03.521 --> 01:12:07.991
<v Speaker 7>imagination because there are sets of </v>
<v Speaker 7>ideas and radical leftist thinking that </v>

1201
01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:12.191
<v Speaker 7>led to the catastrophes of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 7>century and that was at the level of </v>

1202
01:12:12.191 --> 01:12:13.520
<v Speaker 7>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not at the level of violent action.</v>

1203
01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.250
<v Speaker 7>It's a very straightforward thing to say</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're against violence.</v>

1204
01:12:16.251 --> 01:12:18.020
<v Speaker 7>It's like being against poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1205
01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.220
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>gender,</v>

1206
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:24.280
<v Speaker 7>generically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>decent people are against poverty and </v>

1207
01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.541
<v Speaker 7>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't address the issue in the </v>

1208
01:12:28.541 --> 01:12:29.770
<v Speaker 7>least with regards to my privilege or </v>
<v Speaker 7>lack thereof.</v>

1209
01:12:29.771 --> 01:12:34.771
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not making the case that I haven't </v>

1210
01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:36.050
<v Speaker 7>had advantages in my life and </v>
<v Speaker 7>disadvantages in my life.</v>

1211
01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:41.051
<v Speaker 7>Like most people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't know anything about my </v>

1212
01:12:41.051 --> 01:12:41.051
<v Speaker 7>background or where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It,</v>

1213
01:12:41.051 --> 01:12:43.010
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't matter to you because </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamentally I'm a mean white man.</v>

1214
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:44.510
<v Speaker 7>That's a hell of a thing to say.</v>

1215
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:53.410
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>

1216
01:12:56.300 --> 01:13:01.300
<v Speaker 8>Let me just say very,</v>
<v Speaker 8>very brief because I want to move on to </v>

1217
01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:04.211
<v Speaker 8>men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Mad White comment was not predicated </v>

1218
01:13:04.211 --> 01:13:08.651
<v Speaker 8>upon my historical excavation of your </v>
<v Speaker 8>pay as it's based upon the evidence </v>

1219
01:13:08.651 --> 01:13:13.151
<v Speaker 8>vitriol with which you speak and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>denial of a sense of equanimity among </v>

1220
01:13:13.151 --> 01:13:15.950
<v Speaker 8>the combatants in an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So thing again,</v>

1221
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:18.640
<v Speaker 8>you're a mean man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>White man and the viciousness.</v>

1222
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.780
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1223
01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.930
<v Speaker 8>It's recently changed the decks here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's talk about,</v>

1224
01:13:28.090 --> 01:13:33.090
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>another big factor of the so called </v>

1225
01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:33.090
<v Speaker 7>politically correct movement right now,</v>

1226
01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:37.790
<v Speaker 4>which is the me too movement and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>extent to which we've seen this </v>

1227
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:41.690
<v Speaker 4>resurgence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this awakening around would have been a </v>

1228
01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:45.210
<v Speaker 4>horrible series of systemic abuses and </v>
<v Speaker 4>injustices towards women.</v>

1229
01:13:45.690 --> 01:13:49.380
<v Speaker 4>Some people though Michelle would say </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're in a cultural panic now,</v>

1230
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:54.430
<v Speaker 4>that the pendulum has swung too far and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there is a dangerous overreaction </v>

1231
01:13:55.141 --> 01:14:00.141
<v Speaker 4>going on where people's rights </v>
<v Speaker 4>reputations due process has been thrown </v>

1232
01:14:00.331 --> 01:14:02.370
<v Speaker 4>to the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you respond to that?</v>

1233
01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:03.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first,</v>

1234
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:08.500
<v Speaker 4>when people started seeing that within </v>
<v Speaker 4>like two weeks of the Harvey Weinstein </v>

1235
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.840
<v Speaker 4>story is breaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1236
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 4>The Minute Harvey Weinstein's and</v>

1237
01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:16.420
<v Speaker 6>people actually act started actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>losing their jobs over this,</v>

1238
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:21.421
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which was something quite new that men </v>

1239
01:14:21.421 --> 01:14:22.870
<v Speaker 6>with histories of really serious </v>
<v Speaker 6>predatory behavior where suddenly losing</v>

1240
01:14:22.871 --> 01:14:27.871
<v Speaker 6>their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody had known about it for a long </v>

1241
01:14:27.871 --> 01:14:30.781
<v Speaker 6>time and there had been a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>implicit impunity and suddenly that was </v>

1242
01:14:30.781 --> 01:14:32.290
<v Speaker 6>taken away and it created this cultural </v>
<v Speaker 6>earthquake.</v>

1243
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:34.570
<v Speaker 6>And as soon as it did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it created a lot of anxiety.</v>

1244
01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:37.540
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what if this goes too far?</v>

1245
01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.540
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1246
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:43.620
<v Speaker 6>I mean the me too movement was only a </v>
<v Speaker 6>couple months old when my newspaper </v>

1247
01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:47.801
<v Speaker 6>started running columns from people </v>
<v Speaker 6>saying why can't I criticized me to </v>

1248
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.460
<v Speaker 6>which they were doing in my newspaper?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1249
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:56.050
<v Speaker 6>so on the one hand guest of course is </v>
<v Speaker 6>due process important.</v>

1250
01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.200
<v Speaker 6>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that when you look at who has </v>

1251
01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.370
<v Speaker 6>actually lost their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's actually lost their livelihoods,</v>

1252
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.170
<v Speaker 6>I mean look around.</v>

1253
01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:09.780
<v Speaker 6>It's people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not people in general on a mccarthy</v>

1254
01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:14.850
<v Speaker 6>is rumor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's people who took their dicks out at </v>

1255
01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:14.850
<v Speaker 6>work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's people who,</v>

1256
01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:17.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was,</v>

1257
01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:23.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tens of millions of dollars of </v>

1258
01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.771
<v Speaker 6>settlements and they lost their dog for </v>
<v Speaker 6>four months and now they're staging </v>

1259
01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:25.771
<v Speaker 6>comebacks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1260
01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:28.060
<v Speaker 6>Bill O'reilly is about to get a TV show </v>
<v Speaker 6>on a new network.</v>

1261
01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:33.210
<v Speaker 6>So the idea that again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this idea that kind of like men </v>

1262
01:15:33.251 --> 01:15:38.251
<v Speaker 6>everywhere feel like they can't talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore and everybody's walking on </v>

1263
01:15:38.251 --> 01:15:38.251
<v Speaker 6>eggshells.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I don't know,</v>

1264
01:15:38.251 --> 01:15:42.570
<v Speaker 6>maybe that's true in your offices.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not true where,</v>

1265
01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:43.690
<v Speaker 6>where I live,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1266
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:48.780
<v Speaker 6>and the me too movement has been </v>
<v Speaker 6>particularly active in,</v>

1267
01:15:49.651 --> 01:15:50.540
<v Speaker 6>in media,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1268
01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.480
<v Speaker 6>there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this thing,</v>

1269
01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:55.230
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how many of you guys read </v>
<v Speaker 6>about the shitty media mentalist,</v>

1270
01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:57.790
<v Speaker 6>I'm a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wrote about,</v>

1271
01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:03.060
<v Speaker 6>she started this sort of open source </v>
<v Speaker 6>document where women could list men in </v>

1272
01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.580
<v Speaker 6>media that everybody knew about but </v>
<v Speaker 6>nobody had ever done anything about.</v>

1273
01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:11.940
<v Speaker 6>And it very quickly went public and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there was something sort of disturbing </v>

1274
01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:11.940
<v Speaker 6>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1275
01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.590
<v Speaker 6>You don't like these anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 6>accusations floating around.</v>

1276
01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:17.350
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most feminists I know including myself,</v>

1277
01:16:17.351 --> 01:16:22.351
<v Speaker 6>were kind of freaked out by it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>thought it was unfair to have people's </v>

1278
01:16:23.081 --> 01:16:28.081
<v Speaker 6>reputations held up like this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you look at what happened to the </v>

1279
01:16:28.081 --> 01:16:29.560
<v Speaker 6>men on the list,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing,</v>

1280
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:31.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they still have their jobs.</v>

1281
01:16:31.541 --> 01:16:34.270
<v Speaker 6>I know men on that list.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I work with men on that list.</v>

1282
01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:39.450
<v Speaker 6>The people who actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people have only buying as far as I can </v>

1283
01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:44.191
<v Speaker 6>think in media.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The people who have lost their jobs and </v>

1284
01:16:44.191 --> 01:16:46.591
<v Speaker 6>lost their careers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's been for extremely serious </v>

1285
01:16:46.591 --> 01:16:50.551
<v Speaker 6>misbehavior,</v>
<v Speaker 6>documented by multiple women who had </v>

1286
01:16:50.551 --> 01:16:53.110
<v Speaker 6>corroborating witnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so again,</v>

1287
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:57.190
<v Speaker 6>I understand this anxiety that relations</v>
<v Speaker 6>between men and women are changing.</v>

1288
01:16:57.191 --> 01:16:59.470
<v Speaker 6>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that causes a lot of cultural anxiety,</v>

1289
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:03.280
<v Speaker 6>but I don't know that it's rooted in </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything real get his view on this.</v>

1290
01:17:03.281 --> 01:17:08.281
<v Speaker 6>Are we intercultural panic is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>response Michelle says commensurate with</v>

1291
01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 6>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm very confused</v>

1292
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:10.980
<v Speaker 9>by this.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>

1293
01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:16.770
<v Speaker 9>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I recognize the best attitude Weinstein </v>

1294
01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:19.070
<v Speaker 9>in the monstrosity of his behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

1295
01:17:19.071 --> 01:17:24.071
<v Speaker 9>and it was shocking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I actually worked for him the script </v>

1296
01:17:24.071 --> 01:17:27.911
<v Speaker 9>doctoring as it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I never had the bathroom pto for </v>

1297
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:31.350
<v Speaker 9>pretty obvious reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

1298
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:36.580
<v Speaker 9>but it's grotesque and I can't imagine </v>
<v Speaker 9>how violent must be for such a powerful </v>

1299
01:17:36.591 --> 01:17:37.310
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He was,</v>

1300
01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:42.110
<v Speaker 9>I used to play a game at the Cannes film</v>
<v Speaker 9>festival where it is.</v>

1301
01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.020
<v Speaker 9>Here's a power.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're walking from one hotel,</v>

1302
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.600
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1303
01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:46.840
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>at the end of the,</v>

1304
01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:52.140
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>all the way up to the palliative </v>

1305
01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:53.700
<v Speaker 9>festival.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You will get 10 points every time you </v>

1306
01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:53.980
<v Speaker 9>heard the word harvey.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

1307
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:58.990
<v Speaker 9>I'm usually a 10 minute walk.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You'd have a 300 points because it was a</v>

1308
01:17:59.080 --> 01:17:59.870
<v Speaker 9>hobbies.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Got The script.</v>

1309
01:17:59.871 --> 01:18:00.570
<v Speaker 9>Harvey's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1310
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:05.630
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've got a meeting with Harvey at the </v>

1311
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.630
<v Speaker 9>majestic,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1312
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.630
<v Speaker 9>in the afternoon.</v>

1313
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:08.830
<v Speaker 9>He was immensely powerful and I think </v>
<v Speaker 9>that's obvious that someone in that </v>

1314
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:09.850
<v Speaker 9>position,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1315
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:14.980
<v Speaker 9>abusing him,</v>
<v Speaker 9>threatening and a hindering the </v>

1316
01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:16.580
<v Speaker 9>livelihood of women is grotesque and in </v>
<v Speaker 9>the extreme,</v>

1317
01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:21.760
<v Speaker 9>but I have to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there is genuine feeling amongst many </v>

1318
01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.130
<v Speaker 9>people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I know that we can't speak our minds.</v>

1319
01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:28.570
<v Speaker 9>We can't actually speak to the true New </v>
<v Speaker 9>Orleans,</v>

1320
01:18:28.730 --> 01:18:33.650
<v Speaker 9>the true depth of sexual romantic </v>
<v Speaker 9>feeling between men and women.</v>

1321
01:18:33.651 --> 01:18:36.110
<v Speaker 9>That's not a subject don't absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 9>expert on,</v>

1322
01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:38.660
<v Speaker 9>but it comes between men and men as </v>
<v Speaker 9>well.</v>

1323
01:18:38.661 --> 01:18:40.970
<v Speaker 9>Though I know when it's men and men,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you might say,</v>

1324
01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:45.971
<v Speaker 9>well that's different because they are </v>
<v Speaker 9>women who have had a different </v>

1325
01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:47.510
<v Speaker 9>experience in history and I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 9>to enter that particular field,</v>

1326
01:18:47.511 --> 01:18:52.511
<v Speaker 9>but I would say that that is real fear </v>
<v Speaker 9>in my business,</v>

1327
01:18:53.111 --> 01:18:55.790
<v Speaker 9>which is where this all started.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Showbiz does acting and so on.</v>

1328
01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:01.420
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>People are rather afraid to speak about </v>

1329
01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 9>a piece of very no publicity that's come</v>
<v Speaker 9>out or a statement that's been made.</v>

1330
01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.260
<v Speaker 9>You just go,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yup,</v>

1331
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:11.350
<v Speaker 9>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And wait for the people to leave the </v>

1332
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:12.050
<v Speaker 9>room before you can speak honestly with </v>
<v Speaker 9>your friends.</v>

1333
01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.530
<v Speaker 9>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've never experienced that in my entire</v>

1334
01:19:15.531 --> 01:19:18.590
<v Speaker 9>60 years on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's this feeling that,</v>

1335
01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.920
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I'd not characterizing feminists as </v>

1336
01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.300
<v Speaker 9>an east German,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's like that the stars you're </v>

1337
01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 9>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you better be careful that listening.</v>

1338
01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.860
<v Speaker 9>And that's genuine feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm saying that my hand on my heart,</v>

1339
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:36.100
<v Speaker 9>I'm not saying it to make a point other </v>
<v Speaker 9>than the fact that it's true and it's </v>

1340
01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:40.150
<v Speaker 9>worrying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but the sexual misadventures in horror </v>

1341
01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:42.470
<v Speaker 9>experiences worrying too.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So the two words and they're not solved.</v>

1342
01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:47.500
<v Speaker 9>Let's bring Jordan in on this because </v>
<v Speaker 9>you've written and commented about a </v>

1343
01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:47.500
<v Speaker 9>lot.</v>

1344
01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:47.500
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1345
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:55.930
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think I'm going to point out two </v>

1346
01:19:55.930 --> 01:19:56.900
<v Speaker 9>things again.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The first is that my question about when</v>

1347
01:19:56.901 --> 01:19:58.520
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when the left goes too far,</v>

1348
01:19:58.521 --> 01:20:03.521
<v Speaker 9>still hasn't been answered.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And then the second thing I'm going to </v>

1349
01:20:03.521 --> 01:20:03.521
<v Speaker 9>point out is that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1350
01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:07.680
<v Speaker 9>it's conceivable that I am a mean man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1351
01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 9>I mean</v>

1352
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:11.130
<v Speaker 7>maybe I'm meaner than some people are </v>
<v Speaker 7>not as mean as others.</v>

1353
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:16.131
<v Speaker 7>I think that's probably more the case,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I would say the fact that race got </v>

1354
01:20:16.131 --> 01:20:20.391
<v Speaker 7>dragged into that particular comment is </v>
<v Speaker 7>a better exemplar of what the hell I </v>

1355
01:20:20.391 --> 01:20:24.551
<v Speaker 7>think is wrong with the politically </v>
<v Speaker 7>correct left than anything else that </v>

1356
01:20:24.551 --> 01:20:24.551
<v Speaker 7>could have possibly happened.</v>

1357
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:37.070
<v Speaker 8>Imagine the hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the anxiety,</v>

1358
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.960
<v Speaker 8>the insult that you might genuinely feel</v>
<v Speaker 8>according to what I felt was an </v>

1359
01:20:47.461 --> 01:20:51.750
<v Speaker 8>appropriate comment of description at </v>
<v Speaker 8>the moment of its expression.</v>

1360
01:20:51.751 --> 01:20:56.751
<v Speaker 8>But imagine now those hurt feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 8>wow,</v>

1361
01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.230
<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You feel great.</v>

1362
01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.020
<v Speaker 8>You feel great about really different.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not a victim.</v>

1363
01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:06.700
<v Speaker 8>I'm not hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're hurt.</v>

1364
01:21:06.701 --> 01:21:07.900
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You wouldn't be a victim.</v>

1365
01:21:07.901 --> 01:21:12.901
<v Speaker 8>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's interesting is that whatever a </v>

1366
01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:15.190
<v Speaker 8>non traditional feelings of empathy you </v>
<v Speaker 8>endure at this particular point,</v>

1367
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:22.130
<v Speaker 8>the point is imagined then the horrors </v>
<v Speaker 8>that so many of the others have had to </v>

1368
01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:30.460
<v Speaker 8>put up with for so long when they are </v>
<v Speaker 8>refused to acknowledge their humanity.</v>

1369
01:21:30.461 --> 01:21:33.310
<v Speaker 8>Now I take your point seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so you're.</v>

1370
01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.300
<v Speaker 8>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let me finish.</v>

1371
01:21:34.301 --> 01:21:35.980
<v Speaker 8>Let me finish.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let me finish.</v>

1372
01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.770
<v Speaker 8>Let me finish up figuring out my </v>
<v Speaker 8>acquisition or.</v>

1373
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:43.800
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What I'm saying to you is that when you </v>

1374
01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.220
<v Speaker 8>said you were upset that I added the </v>
<v Speaker 8>element of race there,</v>

1375
01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:47.830
<v Speaker 8>right when I said mean Matt White Man.</v>

1376
01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:53.340
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's interesting is that you may have </v>

1377
01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:57.331
<v Speaker 8>felt that you were being ascribed the </v>
<v Speaker 8>group identity to which you do not </v>

1378
01:21:57.331 --> 01:22:00.780
<v Speaker 8>subscribe.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You may have felt that you were being </v>

1379
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:01.090
<v Speaker 8>unfairly judged according to your </v>
<v Speaker 8>particular race.</v>

1380
01:22:01.091 --> 01:22:06.091
<v Speaker 8>You may have felt that your individual </v>
<v Speaker 8>identity was being the smurfs by my </v>

1381
01:22:06.091 --> 01:22:09.811
<v Speaker 8>rather careless characterization of you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all of which qualifies for a legitimate </v>

1382
01:22:11.710 --> 01:22:16.710
<v Speaker 8>response to me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but also the point we've been trying to </v>

1383
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:19.540
<v Speaker 8>make about the refusal to see our </v>
<v Speaker 8>individual existence as women,</v>

1384
01:22:19.541 --> 01:22:21.760
<v Speaker 8>as people of Color,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as first nation people in the light.</v>

1385
01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:27.210
<v Speaker 8>My point simply has been the reason I </v>
<v Speaker 8>talked about race and that particular </v>

1386
01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:31.390
<v Speaker 8>characterization because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 8>particular way in which I have come to a</v>

1387
01:22:31.391 --> 01:22:33.580
<v Speaker 8>city.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if there are a lot of black</v>

1388
01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.920
<v Speaker 8>people out here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not sure,</v>

1389
01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:41.160
<v Speaker 8>but I constantly come to places and </v>
<v Speaker 8>spaces that are not my natural habitat </v>

1390
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:46.510
<v Speaker 8>other than intellectual engagement and </v>
<v Speaker 8>the love in the fury of rhetorical </v>

1391
01:22:46.691 --> 01:22:47.260
<v Speaker 8>engagement.</v>

1392
01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:50.350
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I often go into hostile spaces where</v>

1393
01:22:50.351 --> 01:22:55.351
<v Speaker 8>people will not vote in favor for my </v>
<v Speaker 8>particular viewpoint because I'm </v>

1394
01:22:55.351 --> 01:22:58.920
<v Speaker 8>interested as an individual of breaking </v>
<v Speaker 8>down barriers so that people can </v>

1395
01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.781
<v Speaker 8>understand just how complicated it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So what I'm saying to you is that I </v>

1396
01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:07.300
<v Speaker 8>would invite you in of the surrender of </v>
<v Speaker 8>your privilege to give you a specific,</v>

1397
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.750
<v Speaker 8>a specific response.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Come with me to a black Baptist church,</v>

1398
01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.660
<v Speaker 8>come with me to a historically black </v>
<v Speaker 8>college.</v>

1399
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:18.840
<v Speaker 8>Come to me to an to an indigenous first </v>
<v Speaker 8>nations community where we're able to </v>

1400
01:23:19.031 --> 01:23:24.031
<v Speaker 8>engage in some of the lovely </v>
<v Speaker 8>conversation but also to listen and hear</v>

1401
01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.680
<v Speaker 8>and when I added race to that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was talking about the historical </v>

1402
01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:32.530
<v Speaker 8>events,</v>
<v Speaker 8>inability to acknowledge others,</v>

1403
01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.700
<v Speaker 8>pains equally to the one that they are </v>
<v Speaker 8>presently enduring.</v>

1404
01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:36.310
<v Speaker 8>So</v>

1405
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:41.340
<v Speaker 10>human being being loved,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I stand by my comments.</v>

1406
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.530
<v Speaker 8>Seeing the sorts of things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>talking about.</v>

1407
01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:47.710
<v Speaker 8>I happened to be an honorary member of </v>
<v Speaker 8>an indigenous family,</v>

1408
01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:51.160
<v Speaker 8>so don't tell me about what I should go </v>
<v Speaker 8>see with regards to depression.</v>

1409
01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:54.040
<v Speaker 8>You don't know anything about me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You asked me a question,</v>

1410
01:23:54.041 --> 01:23:57.600
<v Speaker 8>I gave you a response.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You gave me a generic response.</v>

1411
01:23:57.601 --> 01:24:00.850
<v Speaker 8>Is Generic race pace or sports Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 8>Peterson?</v>

1412
01:24:00.851 --> 01:24:02.530
<v Speaker 8>I would like for you to come with me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Michael,</v>

1413
01:24:02.531 --> 01:24:04.890
<v Speaker 8>Eric Dyson to a black Baptist church.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You've been.</v>

1414
01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:06.940
<v Speaker 8>I would be happy to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but.</v>

1415
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:07.520
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Alright.</v>

1416
01:24:07.570 --> 01:24:08.200
<v Speaker 8>I'm gonna Hook you up.</v>

1417
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:13.210
<v Speaker 10>You have one more question.</v>

1418
01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:18.300
<v Speaker 4>Brandon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to go to closing statements </v>

1419
01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.771
<v Speaker 4>and Stephen for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get your response to why you </v>

1420
01:24:19.771 --> 01:24:21.130
<v Speaker 4>know a generation from now looking back </v>
<v Speaker 4>on this debate,</v>

1421
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:26.430
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to see this quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so-called politically correct movement </v>

1422
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:30.211
<v Speaker 4>in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say that we now understand the </v>

1423
01:24:30.211 --> 01:24:30.211
<v Speaker 4>positive contributions of the civil </v>
<v Speaker 4>rights movement,</v>

1424
01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:35.130
<v Speaker 4>that that was a movement that advanced a</v>
<v Speaker 4>series of,</v>

1425
01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.860
<v Speaker 4>of ideas about human dignity to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who previously didn't have that dignity.</v>

1426
01:24:38.861 --> 01:24:43.861
<v Speaker 4>We're now having another debate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>other social debate about different </v>

1427
01:24:43.861 --> 01:24:47.710
<v Speaker 4>groups and communities that are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to convey a sense of,</v>

1428
01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.400
<v Speaker 4>of new dignity to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1429
01:24:49.401 --> 01:24:54.401
<v Speaker 4>Why won't this be be in a sense looked </v>
<v Speaker 4>back upon as something positive a </v>

1430
01:24:54.401 --> 01:24:55.090
<v Speaker 4>generation from now.</v>

1431
01:24:55.180 --> 01:25:00.180
<v Speaker 9>I think people will look back on this </v>
<v Speaker 9>debate and wonder why political </v>

1432
01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:00.640
<v Speaker 9>correctness wasn't discussed.</v>

1433
01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:07.110
<v Speaker 10>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Slippery.</v>

1434
01:25:11.211 --> 01:25:11.800
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I</v>

1435
01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:17.020
<v Speaker 9>interesting to hear talk about race and </v>
<v Speaker 9>about gender and about to be quality and</v>

1436
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:22.040
<v Speaker 9>it's something that I've thought about a</v>
<v Speaker 9>lot and I can learn a great deal about.</v>

1437
01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:25.480
<v Speaker 9>But that's not why I came to this debate</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was interested in,</v>

1438
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:30.750
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what I've always been interested in the </v>

1439
01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:32.821
<v Speaker 9>suppression of language and thought the </v>
<v Speaker 9>closing down the rationalist idea that </v>

1440
01:25:32.821 --> 01:25:36.400
<v Speaker 9>seems beguiling,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that if you limit people's language,</v>

1441
01:25:36.401 --> 01:25:39.280
<v Speaker 9>it made somehow teach them a different </v>
<v Speaker 9>way of thinking.</v>

1442
01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:44.880
<v Speaker 9>Something that would have delighted the </v>
<v Speaker 9>inventors of George Orwell's newspeak </v>

1443
01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:48.960
<v Speaker 9>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And it seems to me it's just </v>

1444
01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:48.960
<v Speaker 9>implausible.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't,</v>

1445
01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:52.850
<v Speaker 9>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's what I mean by empirical.</v>

1446
01:25:52.851 --> 01:25:57.851
<v Speaker 9>He doesn't stand an empirical test.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Disney experientially validated as we </v>

1447
01:25:59.171 --> 01:26:03.950
<v Speaker 9>see from the political landscape now.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I worry that we may in the future.</v>

1448
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:04.980
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1449
01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:09.990
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm so disappointed that the subject is </v>

1450
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:11.750
<v Speaker 9>just revolved around academia,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which was predictable because that's the</v>

1451
01:26:11.751 --> 01:26:14.540
<v Speaker 9>sort of crucible in which these elements</v>
<v Speaker 9>of mixed,</v>

1452
01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:20.520
<v Speaker 9>but even more disappointed that really I</v>
<v Speaker 9>haven't heard from Michelle or from </v>

1453
01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:25.480
<v Speaker 9>professor docent as to what they think </v>
<v Speaker 9>political greatness is because what </v>

1454
01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:25.990
<v Speaker 9>they've talked about is basically saying</v>
<v Speaker 9>progress in,</v>

1455
01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.620
<v Speaker 9>in our view is progress.</v>

1456
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.550
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I agree.</v>

1457
01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:29.630
<v Speaker 9>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know.</v>

1458
01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.930
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So it is true and good on progress,</v>

1459
01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.780
<v Speaker 5>but how is it</v>

1460
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:40.910
<v Speaker 9>you're saying political that what we </v>
<v Speaker 9>call the digital greatness you call </v>

1461
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:45.041
<v Speaker 9>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's what you're supposed to be </v>

1462
01:26:45.041 --> 01:26:47.010
<v Speaker 9>arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I want to know what you mean by </v>

1463
01:26:47.010 --> 01:26:47.010
<v Speaker 9>political correctness.</v>

1464
01:26:47.010 --> 01:26:50.630
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said though,</v>

1465
01:26:51.650 --> 01:26:53.120
<v Speaker 6>the reason a few months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

1466
01:26:53.121 --> 01:26:54.020
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you contacted me,</v>

1467
01:26:54.021 --> 01:26:57.410
<v Speaker 6>asked if I wanted to do a debate about </v>
<v Speaker 6>identity politics and then you presented</v>

1468
01:26:57.411 --> 01:26:59.030
<v Speaker 6>me with this resolution and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1469
01:26:59.031 --> 01:27:02.060
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of things that people call</v>
<v Speaker 6>political correctness that I'm not going</v>

1470
01:27:02.061 --> 01:27:07.061
<v Speaker 6>to defend.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then I realized who I was debating </v>

1471
01:27:07.061 --> 01:27:10.880
<v Speaker 6>and saw that there was a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you,</v>

1472
01:27:10.881 --> 01:27:13.880
<v Speaker 6>Jordan Peterson called political </v>
<v Speaker 6>correctness that I call progress.</v>

1473
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:14.600
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1474
01:27:14.601 --> 01:27:17.420
<v Speaker 6>and to some extent you to Stephen Fry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1475
01:27:17.421 --> 01:27:21.300
<v Speaker 6>when you talk about it being outrageous </v>
<v Speaker 6>to tear it out or not outrageous,</v>

1476
01:27:21.301 --> 01:27:26.301
<v Speaker 6>so I won't put words in your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that we shouldn't be tearing down </v>

1477
01:27:26.301 --> 01:27:28.901
<v Speaker 6>statues of kind of notorious racist that</v>
<v Speaker 6>we should just instead be throwing exit </v>

1478
01:27:28.901 --> 01:27:31.560
<v Speaker 6>then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1479
01:27:31.570 --> 01:27:35.120
<v Speaker 6>so those sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you call them political correctness,</v>

1480
01:27:35.121 --> 01:27:38.270
<v Speaker 6>like call them progress now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this feeling of being silenced,</v>

1481
01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:41.360
<v Speaker 6>which I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>although it seems very vague,</v>

1482
01:27:41.361 --> 01:27:46.361
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You kind of are not quite putting your </v>

1483
01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:48.251
<v Speaker 6>finger on who was silencing you except </v>
<v Speaker 6>for a vague fear that if you say </v>

1484
01:27:48.251 --> 01:27:50.930
<v Speaker 6>something untoward,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be the subject of,</v>

1485
01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.610
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure shaming biker who but by,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by what?</v>

1486
01:27:55.611 --> 01:27:56.300
<v Speaker 6>By the Internet.</v>

1487
01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:02.200
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean there's that element of it</v>

1488
01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:10.450
<v Speaker 6>hear what I'm saying is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a feeling.</v>

1489
01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:15.660
<v Speaker 6>It's a feeling that is this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>intangible result of on nearly</v>

1490
01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:20.760
<v Speaker 9>Goldstein the sort of show trial thing </v>
<v Speaker 9>where the person that apologizes,</v>

1491
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:23.280
<v Speaker 9>I have so much to learn about sexual </v>
<v Speaker 9>politics.</v>

1492
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:25.640
<v Speaker 9>I am really sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Signed a lawyer,</v>

1493
01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:26.790
<v Speaker 9>crossed out the name of the</v>

1494
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:30.210
<v Speaker 5>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's do you think</v>

1495
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:35.390
<v Speaker 9>the real mistake of our left is that we </v>
<v Speaker 9>underestimate the right,</v>

1496
01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:41.060
<v Speaker 9>the right season to stupid as we'd like </v>
<v Speaker 9>them to be if only they were only there </v>

1497
01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:43.290
<v Speaker 9>went to coming to slide,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so smart,</v>

1498
01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.980
<v Speaker 9>so aware of our shortcomings and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

1499
01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:51.120
<v Speaker 9>and I just fear that political </v>
<v Speaker 9>correctness is a weapon that they value.</v>

1500
01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:57.300
<v Speaker 9>The more,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the more we tell the world how people </v>

1501
01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.710
<v Speaker 9>should be treated,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how language should be treated,</v>

1502
01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:00.930
<v Speaker 9>what words are acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what attitudes are,</v>

1503
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:06.390
<v Speaker 9>what hr meeting is going to tell you in </v>
<v Speaker 9>a long bullet pointed list about how you</v>

1504
01:29:06.391 --> 01:29:11.391
<v Speaker 9>look at people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>All of this is meat and drink too bad </v>

1505
01:29:11.391 --> 01:29:15.660
<v Speaker 9>people to malefactors the bad actors are</v>
<v Speaker 9>not counting myself as one of those,</v>

1506
01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:18.940
<v Speaker 10>but does in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean bad actors in the other set.</v>

1507
01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:29.130
<v Speaker 10>Thank you.</v>

1508
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:30.600
<v Speaker 6>So there are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

1509
01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:33.030
<v Speaker 6>there are a lot of ways in which I agree</v>
<v Speaker 6>with you,</v>

1510
01:29:33.031 --> 01:29:34.370
<v Speaker 6>although I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1511
01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.600
<v Speaker 6>I would like to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I need to turn it back on you.</v>

1512
01:29:36.610 --> 01:29:40.020
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to hear you say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1513
01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:45.050
<v Speaker 6>what are the words that have fallen into</v>
<v Speaker 6>disrepute that we think that you think </v>

1514
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.050
<v Speaker 6>we should be resurrecting?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1515
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:49.850
<v Speaker 6>A new to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is this area of like hotly </v>

1516
01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:51.760
<v Speaker 6>contested social change right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're a lot of people feel</v>

1517
01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:55.150
<v Speaker 9>but words that have gone into disuse.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's very often phrases,</v>

1518
01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:59.300
<v Speaker 9>jargonistic slogans,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Hetero normative cisgendered,</v>

1519
01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:02.210
<v Speaker 9>those kinds of things that they're just </v>
<v Speaker 9>an insult.</v>

1520
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:07.390
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>imagine you're a young student arriving </v>

1521
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:09.430
<v Speaker 9>university and someone's bombarding him </v>
<v Speaker 9>with this preposterous hermeneutical </v>

1522
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.860
<v Speaker 9>nonsense from,</v>
<v Speaker 9>from,</v>

1523
01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:15.300
<v Speaker 9>from misread textbooks.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So Ms Dot red food code and they say </v>

1524
01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:16.790
<v Speaker 9>Derrida and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and so on because.</v>

1525
01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:17.320
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

1526
01:30:17.410 --> 01:30:19.900
<v Speaker 9>I know I was in Cambridge,</v>
<v Speaker 9>England doing it.</v>

1527
01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.380
<v Speaker 9>We had a French phase</v>

1528
01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:23.880
<v Speaker 10>value in that.</v>

1529
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:27.870
<v Speaker 9>It's an interesting game and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's a place to,</v>

1530
01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:29.110
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>

1531
01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:33.610
<v Speaker 9>I think I just really say that the ghost</v>
<v Speaker 9>hovering over me is,</v>

1532
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.380
<v Speaker 9>it's a letter Oscar Wilde roads and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he,</v>

1533
01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:41.450
<v Speaker 9>he said [inaudible] love.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You said the fact that you didn't get </v>

1534
01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:43.821
<v Speaker 9>the degrees is nothing but you never </v>
<v Speaker 9>acquired what is sometimes called the </v>

1535
01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:45.120
<v Speaker 9>Oxford Manor.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I'll say for that,</v>

1536
01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.880
<v Speaker 9>the university manner,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he said,</v>

1537
01:30:48.630 --> 01:30:53.630
<v Speaker 9>Oscar said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I take that to mean the ability to play </v>

1538
01:30:53.630 --> 01:30:56.841
<v Speaker 9>gracefully with ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that's disappearing from our </v>

1539
01:30:56.841 --> 01:30:56.841
<v Speaker 9>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I think it's an</v>

1540
01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:06.220
<v Speaker 10>thank you.</v>

1541
01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:10.070
<v Speaker 8>It's hard to beat a self deprecating </v>
<v Speaker 8>English minutes.</v>

1542
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:15.630
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

1543
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:17.880
<v Speaker 10>no.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've got a pretty good idea here today.</v>

1544
01:31:18.190 --> 01:31:22.240
<v Speaker 8>But what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't recall in all of you,</v>

1545
01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:27.300
<v Speaker 8>all of us have studied history.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't recall these debates about </v>

1546
01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:31.321
<v Speaker 8>political correctness happening when </v>
<v Speaker 8>people who were in power in absolute </v>

1547
01:31:31.321 --> 01:31:32.530
<v Speaker 8>power,</v>
<v Speaker 8>unquestioned power,</v>

1548
01:31:33.010 --> 01:31:38.010
<v Speaker 8>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 8>political correctness becomes an issue.</v>

1549
01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:42.460
<v Speaker 8>And what I mean by that is people who </v>
<v Speaker 8>used to have power,</v>

1550
01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:44.560
<v Speaker 8>who,</v>
<v Speaker 8>who still have power,</v>

1551
01:31:44.561 --> 01:31:48.670
<v Speaker 8>but they don't who gets challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'll just a little bit of what they have</v>

1552
01:31:48.671 --> 01:31:51.070
<v Speaker 8>and don't want to share toys in the sand</v>
<v Speaker 8>lot of life.</v>

1553
01:31:51.370 --> 01:31:55.240
<v Speaker 8>So all of a sudden it becomes a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>exaggerated grievance.</v>

1554
01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:59.270
<v Speaker 8>Now the things you named the bullet </v>
<v Speaker 8>points and the CIS gender,</v>

1555
01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:02.050
<v Speaker 8>the Hetero normativity and the Hetero </v>
<v Speaker 8>patriarchy,</v>

1556
01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:07.320
<v Speaker 8>and the capitalist resurgence and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>insurrection of subjugated knowledge is </v>

1557
01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.370
<v Speaker 8>to give some more love or the iridium </v>
<v Speaker 8>deconstruction.</v>

1558
01:32:09.371 --> 01:32:14.371
<v Speaker 8>All that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the French phase is still going on with </v>

1559
01:32:14.371 --> 01:32:14.680
<v Speaker 8>the French fries in America.</v>

1560
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:20.040
<v Speaker 8>What's interesting is that I didn't hear</v>
<v Speaker 8>many complaints of political </v>

1561
01:32:20.441 --> 01:32:25.441
<v Speaker 8>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm at the height of the dominance of </v>

1562
01:32:25.441 --> 01:32:28.570
<v Speaker 8>one group or another,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but when Martin Luther King Jr,</v>

1563
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:33.870
<v Speaker 8>who argued for group identity as a black</v>
<v Speaker 8>person to provide an opportunity for </v>

1564
01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:38.350
<v Speaker 8>individual black people to come to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>fore,</v>

1565
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:41.320
<v Speaker 8>they began to make that claim.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

1566
01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:43.030
<v Speaker 8>that didn't call it political </v>
<v Speaker 8>correctness.</v>

1567
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:46.660
<v Speaker 8>You're siding with those who are against</v>
<v Speaker 8>free speech.</v>

1568
01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:51.460
<v Speaker 8>You're siding with those who don't want </v>
<v Speaker 8>me as a white person to be recognized in</v>

1569
01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:54.550
<v Speaker 8>my humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and what I mean by political correctness</v>

1570
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:59.790
<v Speaker 8>is the kind of politics of resentment </v>
<v Speaker 8>that are articulated by various holders </v>

1571
01:32:59.921 --> 01:33:02.800
<v Speaker 8>of power at certain levels,</v>
<v Speaker 8>at various levels.</v>

1572
01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:08.250
<v Speaker 8>That one of the beautiful things about </v>
<v Speaker 8>co that I take as opposed to Max Faber </v>

1573
01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.780
<v Speaker 8>is that full said power breaks out </v>
<v Speaker 8>everywhere.</v>

1574
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:15.870
<v Speaker 8>I would think a person who's critical </v>
<v Speaker 8>political correctness like you would </v>

1575
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:18.841
<v Speaker 8>appreciate this as opposed to Max Faber </v>
<v Speaker 8>who said power is over there in a </v>

1576
01:33:18.841 --> 01:33:21.370
<v Speaker 8>hierarchical structure where </v>
<v Speaker 8>subordination is the demand for coset.</v>

1577
01:33:21.450 --> 01:33:26.450
<v Speaker 8>No power brakes out,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even among people who are in </v>

1578
01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:27.190
<v Speaker 8>disempowered so you can hurt somebody in</v>
<v Speaker 8>your own community.</v>

1579
01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:30.730
<v Speaker 8>What's more politically incorrect than a</v>
<v Speaker 8>black baptist preacher?</v>

1580
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:35.790
<v Speaker 8>Identifying with a first century </v>
<v Speaker 8>Palestinian Jew and still loving </v>

1581
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:39.511
<v Speaker 8>atheist?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's more politically incorrect in a </v>

1582
01:33:39.511 --> 01:33:41.701
<v Speaker 8>black intellectual going on Bill Maher </v>
<v Speaker 8>and offending his ability to continue to</v>

1583
01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:47.791
<v Speaker 8>have this show despite using the inward.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I serve believe in a politically </v>

1584
01:33:48.431 --> 01:33:53.431
<v Speaker 8>incorrect version when I go into the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Black Baptist preacher to chastise my </v>

1585
01:33:53.431 --> 01:33:56.680
<v Speaker 8>fellow believers about their homophobia </v>
<v Speaker 8>that goes over like a brick cloud.</v>

1586
01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:01.920
<v Speaker 8>When I come into arenas like this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I understand that my back is up against </v>

1587
01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.120
<v Speaker 8>the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I think</v>

1588
01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 10>sit over here.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Let's say I want to sit on your lap,</v>

1589
01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:14.740
<v Speaker 10>but what I say get excited,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but what I'm saying does that he goes </v>

1590
01:34:17.370 --> 01:34:22.370
<v Speaker 10>out and looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What's interesting</v>

1591
01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:31.120
<v Speaker 8>is that when we look at the way in which</v>
<v Speaker 8>we have societies in a free,</v>

1592
01:34:31.690 --> 01:34:34.280
<v Speaker 8>a Canadian society and the free American</v>
<v Speaker 8>society,</v>

1593
01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:36.980
<v Speaker 8>when I look at what is seen as political</v>
<v Speaker 8>correctness,</v>

1594
01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.160
<v Speaker 8>it to me has been a mass of jumble that </v>
<v Speaker 8>has been carved together out of the </v>

1595
01:34:42.741 --> 01:34:45.740
<v Speaker 8>politics of resentment that powers once </v>
<v Speaker 8>held,</v>

1596
01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:50.770
<v Speaker 8>no longer are held.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Freedoms once exercise absolutely must </v>

1597
01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:51.960
<v Speaker 8>now be shared.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I,</v>

1598
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:55.700
<v Speaker 8>I am in agreeance with both of my,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my gentleman to my right,</v>

1599
01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:59.600
<v Speaker 8>who believe that political correctness </v>
<v Speaker 8>has been a scourge,</v>

1600
01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:04.630
<v Speaker 8>but not necessarily the way you think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I think has been a scourge because </v>

1601
01:35:04.630 --> 01:35:07.610
<v Speaker 8>those who have been the deployers of </v>
<v Speaker 8>power and the beneficiaries of privilege</v>

1602
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:12.790
<v Speaker 8>have failed to recognize their </v>
<v Speaker 8>particular way and at the end of the </v>

1603
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:16.630
<v Speaker 8>day,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that those of us who are free </v>

1604
01:35:16.630 --> 01:35:19.661
<v Speaker 8>citizens of this country and of America </v>
<v Speaker 8>should figure out ways to respect the </v>

1605
01:35:20.001 --> 01:35:25.001
<v Speaker 8>humanity of the other,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to respect the individual existence of </v>

1606
01:35:25.001 --> 01:35:28.661
<v Speaker 8>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but also respect the fact that there </v>

1607
01:35:28.661 --> 01:35:31.241
<v Speaker 8>have been barriers placed upon </v>
<v Speaker 8>particular groups that have prevented </v>

1608
01:35:31.241 --> 01:35:32.180
<v Speaker 8>them from flourishing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's all I mean by political,</v>

1609
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:34.160
<v Speaker 8>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well said.</v>

1610
01:35:34.190 --> 01:35:38.510
<v Speaker 8>I got to give before we get to closing </v>
<v Speaker 8>statements and final words on this topic</v>

1611
01:35:38.511 --> 01:35:39.930
<v Speaker 8>to Michelle and then,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1612
01:35:39.931 --> 01:35:40.550
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jordan.</v>

1613
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:45.870
<v Speaker 6>So I think part of the frustration here </v>
<v Speaker 6>is that I think that both of you have </v>

1614
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:49.890
<v Speaker 6>radically different ideas of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about when we talk about </v>

1615
01:35:49.890 --> 01:35:50.530
<v Speaker 6>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems to me that you're talking about</v>

1616
01:35:50.531 --> 01:35:53.830
<v Speaker 6>politically correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You mean this kind of feeling of anxiety</v>

1617
01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:58.831
<v Speaker 6>that a lot of people feel because we all</v>
<v Speaker 6>live now in this terrible crowdsource </v>

1618
01:35:58.831 --> 01:36:03.040
<v Speaker 6>panopticon when you worried that any </v>
<v Speaker 6>straight phrase that you use will be any</v>

1619
01:36:03.041 --> 01:36:05.440
<v Speaker 6>stray phrase you utter might be used to </v>
<v Speaker 6>define you.</v>

1620
01:36:05.650 --> 01:36:10.650
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that a lot of people feel </v>

1621
01:36:10.650 --> 01:36:10.650
<v Speaker 6>that anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1622
01:36:10.650 --> 01:36:12.460
<v Speaker 6>I disagree that that is something that </v>
<v Speaker 6>is being solely,</v>

1623
01:36:12.461 --> 01:36:15.160
<v Speaker 6>kind of perpetrated against,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1624
01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:20.900
<v Speaker 6>institution to kind of Oscar Wilde and </v>
<v Speaker 6>figures by a sensory and sensory is left</v>

1625
01:36:21.491 --> 01:36:24.730
<v Speaker 6>wing chord because it's coming from all </v>
<v Speaker 6>directions,</v>

1626
01:36:24.731 --> 01:36:26.140
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This phenomenon,</v>

1627
01:36:26.141 --> 01:36:29.410
<v Speaker 6>which sucks is all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1628
01:36:29.411 --> 01:36:34.411
<v Speaker 6>I get it when I write something critical</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the way that the IDF behaved in Gaza,</v>

1629
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.800
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1630
01:36:37.801 --> 01:36:40.600
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's coming at everyone and I think that</v>

1631
01:36:40.601 --> 01:36:45.601
<v Speaker 6>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a way in which when it comes at </v>

1632
01:36:45.641 --> 01:36:50.641
<v Speaker 6>a certain sort of figure and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>certain set of complaints and you feel </v>

1633
01:36:50.921 --> 01:36:55.921
<v Speaker 6>unjustly criticized and feel silenced,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which again I think is really different </v>

1634
01:36:55.921 --> 01:36:56.980
<v Speaker 6>than being silenced.</v>

1635
01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:02.400
<v Speaker 6>You call it political correctness and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>would like the culture also to be more </v>

1636
01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:06.070
<v Speaker 6>freewheeling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think one solution,</v>

1637
01:37:06.071 --> 01:37:08.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to kind of get the left</v>

1638
01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:11.230
<v Speaker 6>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1639
01:37:11.231 --> 01:37:16.231
<v Speaker 6>They can't kind of put an end to this </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it is much more of a mob social </v>

1640
01:37:16.231 --> 01:37:19.120
<v Speaker 6>media phenomenon than it is kind of some</v>
<v Speaker 6>diktat coming up from on high.</v>

1641
01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:24.450
<v Speaker 6>And so one really the only way to break </v>
<v Speaker 6>through it is to say what you are,</v>

1642
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:27.130
<v Speaker 6>what you say that you're afraid to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1643
01:37:27.131 --> 01:37:32.131
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's the only way to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>pop this bubble or kind of end this end,</v>

1644
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:37.450
<v Speaker 6>this anxiety or at least diffuse it a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit.</v>

1645
01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:42.130
<v Speaker 6>Whereas again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I hear Mr Peterson talking about as</v>

1646
01:37:42.131 --> 01:37:47.131
<v Speaker 6>political correctness is something much </v>
<v Speaker 6>more broad and much more,</v>

1647
01:37:48.311 --> 01:37:50.740
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of funded,</v>

1648
01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:56.640
<v Speaker 6>much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much more fundamental to social change </v>

1649
01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:56.640
<v Speaker 6>and you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1650
01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:56.640
<v Speaker 6>you want</v>

1651
01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.420
<v Speaker 7>me to define or one of us to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 7>when the left goes too far and if I'm,</v>

1652
01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:05.480
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I certainly don't want to be a woman </v>

1653
01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:05.480
<v Speaker 7>putting words in your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if I'm,</v>

1654
01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.800
<v Speaker 7>if I hear you correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what you're saying is that you want me </v>

1655
01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.570
<v Speaker 7>to kind of renounce Marxist categories </v>
<v Speaker 7>or to.</v>

1656
01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:18.660
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want you to define with the left goes </v>

1657
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:18.660
<v Speaker 7>too far.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can do it any way you want.</v>

1658
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I said,</v>

1659
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:24.261
<v Speaker 7>I think that the left goes too far into </v>
<v Speaker 7>when it is violent or censorious when it</v>

1660
01:38:25.441 --> 01:38:30.441
<v Speaker 7>tries to shut people down or no platform</v>
<v Speaker 7>them or when it asked violently I,</v>

1661
01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:34.830
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure what you expect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Something beyond that.</v>

1662
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:40.070
<v Speaker 7>Something deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How like you to contend with the set of </v>

1663
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:44.661
<v Speaker 7>left wing ideas that produced all the </v>
<v Speaker 7>lift wing pathologies of the 20th </v>

1664
01:38:44.661 --> 01:38:48.450
<v Speaker 7>century and to define how you think </v>
<v Speaker 7>standard left wing thinking,</v>

1665
01:38:48.451 --> 01:38:53.451
<v Speaker 7>which has a place where it goes too far </v>
<v Speaker 7>since it obviously does gone too far.</v>

1666
01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:57.960
<v Speaker 7>Of course the right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tell us how well.</v>

1667
01:38:57.961 --> 01:39:02.961
<v Speaker 7>How about Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 7>about justice center?</v>

1668
01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.540
<v Speaker 7>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 7>More recently,</v>

1669
01:39:06.541 --> 01:39:07.710
<v Speaker 7>what has gone wrong with the right?</v>

1670
01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:13.980
<v Speaker 7>Don't like identity politics players at </v>
<v Speaker 7>all.</v>

1671
01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:15.810
<v Speaker 7>I don't care whether they're on the left</v>
<v Speaker 7>or the right.</v>

1672
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:18.930
<v Speaker 7>I'd be lecturing about right wing </v>
<v Speaker 7>extremism for 30 years.</v>

1673
01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:24.020
<v Speaker 7>I'm no fan of the right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Despite the fact that the left would </v>

1674
01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:26.901
<v Speaker 7>like to paint me that way because it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>more convenient for reasonably well </v>

1675
01:39:26.901 --> 01:39:30.720
<v Speaker 7>where it's threatening to go to foreign </v>
<v Speaker 7>identitarian Europe,</v>

1676
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:34.080
<v Speaker 7>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's gone too far in Charlottesville.</v>

1677
01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:39.170
<v Speaker 7>It went too far in Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how long the list do you want and </v>

1678
01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:41.390
<v Speaker 7>why am I required to produce that to </v>
<v Speaker 7>show you that I don't like the terrios</v>

1679
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:46.870
<v Speaker 10>thought I'd ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I was actually asking you what your </v>

1680
01:39:47.011 --> 01:39:47.760
<v Speaker 10>assumption is.</v>

1681
01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:50.720
<v Speaker 7>How that I must be on the site.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If the right,</v>

1682
01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:51.920
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

1683
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:56.180
<v Speaker 7>the right has an occupied the humanities</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the social sciences.</v>

1684
01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.520
<v Speaker 7>It's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For me,</v>

1685
01:39:58.730 --> 01:40:00.800
<v Speaker 7>if they had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd be objecting to them.</v>

1686
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:03.290
<v Speaker 7>Say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't have the right.</v>

1687
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:08.530
<v Speaker 7>Has not occupied the social sciences and</v>
<v Speaker 7>the humanities and the left clearly has </v>

1688
01:40:08.781 --> 01:40:10.940
<v Speaker 7>the statistical evidence for that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>overwhelming.</v>

1689
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.600
<v Speaker 7>So what about Iq testing in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 7>genetic inheritance.</v>

1690
01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:19.190
<v Speaker 7>We're here to talk about political,</v>
<v Speaker 7>correct?</v>

1691
01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:21.000
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And we've done a damn thing.</v>

1692
01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:26.210
<v Speaker 9>I gave you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Can Redeem ourselves with our closing </v>

1693
01:40:26.210 --> 01:40:27.770
<v Speaker 9>statements are going to put three </v>
<v Speaker 9>minutes on the clock.</v>

1694
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:29.720
<v Speaker 9>We're going to go in the reverse order </v>
<v Speaker 9>of the opening.</v>

1695
01:40:29.721 --> 01:40:31.640
<v Speaker 9>So Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Europe first.</v>

1696
01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:32.680
<v Speaker 9>Oh Lordy,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Lordy,</v>

1697
01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:36.800
<v Speaker 9>hide behind the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And in that case,</v>

1698
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:42.140
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've been fascinated by this </v>

1699
01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:43.991
<v Speaker 9>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's been an enormous clash of </v>

1700
01:40:43.991 --> 01:40:43.991
<v Speaker 9>cultures in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in the conversation we've had,</v>

1701
01:40:43.991 --> 01:40:44.240
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>classic,</v>

1702
01:40:44.241 --> 01:40:47.660
<v Speaker 9>if I can call it huckstering snake oil </v>
<v Speaker 9>pulpit talk.</v>

1703
01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:53.990
<v Speaker 10>It's a motive</v>

1704
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:59.010
<v Speaker 9>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's a rhetorical style that I find </v>

1705
01:40:59.010 --> 01:40:59.010
<v Speaker 9>endlessly refreshing vivifying.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

1706
01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:04.080
<v Speaker 9>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not sure that we actually focused </v>

1707
01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:04.080
<v Speaker 9>on,</v>
<v Speaker 9>on the point in question.</v>

1708
01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:06.710
<v Speaker 9>And my objection has always been towards</v>
<v Speaker 9>orthodoxy.</v>

1709
01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:11.760
<v Speaker 9>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm a heterodox and a contrarian and I </v>

1710
01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:15.001
<v Speaker 9>can't help myself.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I think there's been an </v>

1711
01:41:15.001 --> 01:41:16.921
<v Speaker 9>underestimation of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 9>language does affect people.</v>

1712
01:41:17.111 --> 01:41:22.111
<v Speaker 9>It does make the young in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is this starting out on their </v>

1713
01:41:22.111 --> 01:41:23.770
<v Speaker 9>educational or their work careers.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It makes them,</v>

1714
01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:25.960
<v Speaker 9>it makes them very anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It makes them very angry,</v>

1715
01:41:25.961 --> 01:41:30.961
<v Speaker 9>very upset,</v>
<v Speaker 9>very alienated to feel that they don't </v>

1716
01:41:30.961 --> 01:41:34.090
<v Speaker 9>know anymore how to operate in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>world,</v>

1717
01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.840
<v Speaker 9>how to engage in relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how to think honestly.</v>

1718
01:41:37.841 --> 01:41:42.841
<v Speaker 9>So they they create more and more to </v>
<v Speaker 9>their own mini groups and I think that's</v>

1719
01:41:43.451 --> 01:41:48.451
<v Speaker 9>dangerous and unhappy for society.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think it's reflected in the paucity of</v>

1720
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000
<v Speaker 9>cinema and literature and art and the </v>
<v Speaker 9>culture generally is that there's a fear</v>

1721
01:41:54.431 --> 01:41:59.431
<v Speaker 9>that's pervading it and while people can</v>
<v Speaker 9>talk to academia and so you should come </v>

1722
01:41:59.431 --> 01:42:01.870
<v Speaker 9>see our lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Our lectures are open and free and ideas</v>

1723
01:42:01.871 --> 01:42:03.640
<v Speaker 9>are exchanged.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm sure that's true.</v>

1724
01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:08.820
<v Speaker 9>I'm sure it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I don't think we should </v>

1725
01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:11.251
<v Speaker 9>underestimate how much this feeling is </v>
<v Speaker 9>prevalent in the culture of this strange</v>

1726
01:42:16.031 --> 01:42:21.031
<v Speaker 9>paradox that the liberals are liberal in</v>
<v Speaker 9>the demand for liberality.</v>

1727
01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:25.420
<v Speaker 9>They are exclusive in that demand for </v>
<v Speaker 9>inclusivity.</v>

1728
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:30.840
<v Speaker 9>They are homogenous in their demand for </v>
<v Speaker 9>heterogeneity.</v>

1729
01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:36.360
<v Speaker 9>They are somehow and diverse in the call</v>
<v Speaker 9>for diversity.</v>

1730
01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:42.300
<v Speaker 9>You can be diverse but not diverse in </v>
<v Speaker 9>your opinions and in your language and </v>

1731
01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:43.370
<v Speaker 9>then your behavior and that's okay.</v>

1732
01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:44.170
<v Speaker 5>Terrible pity.</v>

1733
01:42:49.290 --> 01:42:49.720
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>

1734
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:52.810
<v Speaker 9>I would say that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm sorry that it got a bit heated,</v>

1735
01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:57.860
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in places because I was hoping it </v>

1736
01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:00.571
<v Speaker 9>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was hoping would be a shining example </v>

1737
01:43:00.571 --> 01:43:02.821
<v Speaker 9>of how people of all different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 9>political outlooks can speak with humor </v>

1738
01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:07.810
<v Speaker 9>and wit and a lightness of touch.</v>
<v Speaker 9>As gk Chesterton said,</v>

1739
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:11.020
<v Speaker 9>angels can fly because they take </v>
<v Speaker 9>themselves lightly.</v>

1740
01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:14.470
<v Speaker 9>And I think it's very important for us </v>
<v Speaker 9>who are privileged.</v>

1741
01:43:14.471 --> 01:43:16.240
<v Speaker 9>All four of us are privileged to be </v>
<v Speaker 9>here,</v>

1742
01:43:16.241 --> 01:43:21.241
<v Speaker 9>to be asked to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to take ourselves a little bit more </v>

1743
01:43:21.241 --> 01:43:23.701
<v Speaker 9>likely not to be too earnest,</v>
<v Speaker 9>too pompous to serious a and not to be </v>

1744
01:43:23.701 --> 01:43:25.630
<v Speaker 9>too certain.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

1745
01:43:25.850 --> 01:43:27.580
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's a time,</v>

1746
01:43:27.581 --> 01:43:31.480
<v Speaker 9>I think for really engaging,</v>
<v Speaker 9>emotionally fulfilling,</v>

1747
01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.290
<v Speaker 9>passionate and positive doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's what I would.</v>

1748
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:43.030
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to put minutes on the clock </v>

1749
01:43:51.891 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 5>for</v>

1750
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.920
<v Speaker 8>you please.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1751
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.670
<v Speaker 8>your closing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you so much for that compliment.</v>

1752
01:43:57.590 --> 01:44:02.590
<v Speaker 8>I'm used to not exclusively white men </v>
<v Speaker 8>who see black intelligence articulated </v>

1753
01:44:02.991 --> 01:44:07.390
<v Speaker 8>at a certain level of feeling a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>condescension if I came up here,</v>

1754
01:44:07.410 --> 01:44:10.250
<v Speaker 8>ms.dot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was saying the other day,</v>

1755
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:15.910
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but a kind of verbal facility </v>

1756
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:17.150
<v Speaker 8>automatically assumed to be a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>hucksterism and snake oil salesmen.</v>

1757
01:44:17.151 --> 01:44:18.170
<v Speaker 8>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I get it.</v>

1758
01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:21.740
<v Speaker 8>I get hate letters every day from white </v>
<v Speaker 8>brothers and sisters who were mad.</v>

1759
01:44:21.741 --> 01:44:26.741
<v Speaker 8>I'm teaching their children.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're just trying to coopt our </v>

1760
01:44:26.741 --> 01:44:26.810
<v Speaker 8>children.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're trying to corrupt them.</v>

1761
01:44:26.811 --> 01:44:31.811
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying to corrupt them so they will </v>

1762
01:44:31.811 --> 01:44:34.031
<v Speaker 8>be uncorrupted by the corruptibility </v>
<v Speaker 8>that they've inherited from a society </v>

1763
01:44:34.031 --> 01:44:36.890
<v Speaker 8>that refuses to see all people as human </v>
<v Speaker 8>beings.</v>

1764
01:44:37.670 --> 01:44:41.150
<v Speaker 8>The death threats I've received </v>
<v Speaker 8>constantly for simply trying to speak my</v>

1765
01:44:41.151 --> 01:44:46.151
<v Speaker 8>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not about a politically correct </v>

1766
01:44:46.151 --> 01:44:46.151
<v Speaker 8>society that is open minded.</v>

1767
01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:48.830
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and that has some consternation about my</v>

1768
01:44:48.831 --> 01:44:51.500
<v Speaker 8>ability to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm getting real live.</v>

1769
01:44:51.501 --> 01:44:55.220
<v Speaker 8>You want empirical death threats that </v>
<v Speaker 8>talk about killing me,</v>

1770
01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:00.140
<v Speaker 8>setting up to hurt me and harm me simply</v>
<v Speaker 8>because I choose to speak my mind.</v>

1771
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:04.310
<v Speaker 8>I agree with my confreres in my </v>
<v Speaker 8>compatriots that we should argue against</v>

1772
01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:07.280
<v Speaker 8>the vicious limitation and recursions </v>
<v Speaker 8>against speech.</v>

1773
01:45:07.610 --> 01:45:12.610
<v Speaker 8>I believe that everybody has the right </v>
<v Speaker 8>to be able to articulate themselves and </v>

1774
01:45:12.610 --> 01:45:16.271
<v Speaker 8>the enormous privilege we have to come </v>
<v Speaker 8>to a spot in a space like this means </v>

1775
01:45:16.271 --> 01:45:18.980
<v Speaker 8>that we have that privilege and we </v>
<v Speaker 8>should be responsible for it.</v>

1776
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:24.280
<v Speaker 8>No matter where we go from here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>me and brother Peterson will go to a </v>

1777
01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:24.380
<v Speaker 8>black Baptist church.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm gonna.</v>

1778
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:26.600
<v Speaker 8>Hold him to that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He said it on national TV.</v>

1779
01:45:26.601 --> 01:45:31.601
<v Speaker 8>We're going to go to a black Baptist </v>
<v Speaker 8>church and have an enlightening </v>

1780
01:45:31.601 --> 01:45:35.771
<v Speaker 8>conversation about the need for us to </v>
<v Speaker 8>engage in not only reciprocal and mutual</v>

1781
01:45:36.321 --> 01:45:38.180
<v Speaker 8>edification,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but criticism,</v>

1782
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:43.270
<v Speaker 8>even hard and tough criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but in a way that speaks to the needs </v>

1783
01:45:44.121 --> 01:45:46.910
<v Speaker 8>and interests of those who don't usually</v>
<v Speaker 8>get on TV,</v>

1784
01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:52.060
<v Speaker 8>who's voices are not usually amplified,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whose ideas are not usually taken </v>

1785
01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:56.501
<v Speaker 8>seriously and when they get to the upper</v>
<v Speaker 8>echelons of the ability of a society to </v>

1786
01:45:56.781 --> 01:46:01.781
<v Speaker 8>express themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they are equally subject too vicious </v>

1787
01:46:01.781 --> 01:46:03.530
<v Speaker 8>recrimination and hurtful resistance.</v>

1788
01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:08.920
<v Speaker 8>There's old story about the pig and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>pig and the chicken going down the </v>

1789
01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:09.200
<v Speaker 8>street and said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let's have breakfast.</v>

1790
01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:19.060
<v Speaker 8>The chicken just has to give up an egg.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The pig has to give up his ass in order </v>

1791
01:46:19.461 --> 01:46:24.461
<v Speaker 8>to make breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have often been the pigs giving up </v>

1792
01:46:24.461 --> 01:46:25.400
<v Speaker 8>our assets to make breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's start sharing them.</v>

1793
01:46:25.401 --> 01:46:27.240
<v Speaker 8>Asses what everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you.</v>

1794
01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:35.700
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>

1795
01:46:38.190 --> 01:46:43.190
<v Speaker 8>So I'm not here to claim that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 8>such thing as oppression,</v>

1796
01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:49.530
<v Speaker 8>unfairness brutality,</v>
<v Speaker 8>discrimination,</v>

1797
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:50.400
<v Speaker 8>unfair</v>

1798
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.410
<v Speaker 7>use of power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All of those.</v>

1799
01:46:52.411 --> 01:46:57.411
<v Speaker 7>Anyone with any sense knows that </v>
<v Speaker 7>hierarchical structures tilt towards </v>

1800
01:46:57.411 --> 01:47:02.271
<v Speaker 7>tyranny and that we have to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>constantly wakeful to ensure that all </v>

1801
01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:08.740
<v Speaker 7>they are isn't power in tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting to see here food foodco</v>

1802
01:47:08.741 --> 01:47:10.560
<v Speaker 7>referred to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's unfortunate,</v>

1803
01:47:10.561 --> 01:47:15.561
<v Speaker 7>but it's interesting because coal like </v>
<v Speaker 7>is French intellectual confreres </v>

1804
01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:22.010
<v Speaker 7>essentially believed that the only basis</v>
<v Speaker 7>upon which hierarchies were established </v>

1805
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:25.821
<v Speaker 7>his power,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's part of this pernicious </v>

1806
01:47:25.821 --> 01:47:26.640
<v Speaker 7>politically correct doctrine that I've </v>
<v Speaker 7>been speaking about.</v>

1807
01:47:27.170 --> 01:47:32.170
<v Speaker 7>When a hierarchy becomes corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then the only way to ascend it is to </v>

1808
01:47:32.170 --> 01:47:36.051
<v Speaker 7>exercise power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's essentially the definition of a </v>

1809
01:47:36.051 --> 01:47:36.330
<v Speaker 7>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that doesn't mean that the imperfect</v>

1810
01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:39.900
<v Speaker 7>hierarchies that we have constructed in </v>
<v Speaker 7>our relatively free countries,</v>

1811
01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:45.170
<v Speaker 7>which at least tilt somewhat towards </v>
<v Speaker 7>competence and ability as evidenced by </v>

1812
01:47:45.691 --> 01:47:50.691
<v Speaker 7>the staggering achievements of </v>
<v Speaker 7>civilization that we've managed to </v>

1813
01:47:50.691 --> 01:47:51.840
<v Speaker 7>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean that the appropriate way</v>

1814
01:47:51.841 --> 01:47:56.841
<v Speaker 7>of diagnosing them as to assume without </v>
<v Speaker 7>reservation unit dimensionally that </v>

1815
01:47:56.841 --> 01:47:58.200
<v Speaker 7>they're all about power and as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>consequence,</v>

1816
01:47:58.201 --> 01:48:03.000
<v Speaker 7>everyone who occupies any position </v>
<v Speaker 7>within them is a tyrant or tyrant in the</v>

1817
01:48:03.001 --> 01:48:03.540
<v Speaker 7>making.</v>

1818
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.720
<v Speaker 7>And that is certainly the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 7>claim of someone like food co and it's </v>

1819
01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.500
<v Speaker 7>part and parcel of this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What would you call it?</v>

1820
01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:14.640
<v Speaker 7>This ideological catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's political correctness.</v>

1821
01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:19.820
<v Speaker 7>I'm not here to argue against progress.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not here to argue against equality </v>

1822
01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:24.261
<v Speaker 7>of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anyone with any sense understands that </v>

1823
01:48:24.261 --> 01:48:27.500
<v Speaker 7>even if you're selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're best served by allowing yourself </v>

1824
01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:31.881
<v Speaker 7>access to the multiplicitous talents of </v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone and to discriminate against </v>

1825
01:48:31.881 --> 01:48:34.200
<v Speaker 7>them for arbitrary reasons unrelated to </v>
<v Speaker 7>their competencies.</v>

1826
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:37.710
<v Speaker 7>It's a board that has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 7>the issue at hand.</v>

1827
01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:40.140
<v Speaker 7>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It isn't that good.</v>

1828
01:48:40.141 --> 01:48:43.620
<v Speaker 7>Things haven't happened in the past and </v>
<v Speaker 7>should continue to happen.</v>

1829
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:48.800
<v Speaker 7>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The point is the point my compatriot </v>

1830
01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.921
<v Speaker 7>fried made,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is what we can agree on the </v>

1831
01:48:51.921 --> 01:48:53.790
<v Speaker 7>catastrophe and we can agree on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>historical inequity,</v>

1832
01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:59.060
<v Speaker 7>but there's no way I'm going to agree </v>
<v Speaker 7>that political correctness is the way to</v>

1833
01:48:59.401 --> 01:49:02.670
<v Speaker 7>address any of that and there's plenty </v>
<v Speaker 7>of evidence to the contrary.</v>

1834
01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:05.670
<v Speaker 7>Some of which I would say was displayed </v>
<v Speaker 7>quite clearly tonight.</v>

1835
01:49:08.210 --> 01:49:13.210
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1836
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:22.790
<v Speaker 6>So I think one of the irresolvable </v>
<v Speaker 6>issues that we're all coming up against </v>

1837
01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:26.400
<v Speaker 6>is the role of feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1838
01:49:26.401 --> 01:49:31.401
<v Speaker 6>Stephen Fry is kind of asked us to </v>
<v Speaker 6>recognize and empathize with this </v>

1839
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:37.070
<v Speaker 6>feeling of being silenced.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of being threatened and I do and I get </v>

1840
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:37.980
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1841
01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel it sometimes too in my columns.</v>

1842
01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:45.980
<v Speaker 6>I hate it when I write something that </v>
<v Speaker 6>then gets that kind of irate twitter mob</v>

1843
01:49:46.710 --> 01:49:51.710
<v Speaker 6>after me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if say I stood up here and said,</v>

1844
01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:58.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>recognize how threatened so many women </v>

1845
01:49:58.050 --> 01:49:59.530
<v Speaker 6>feel when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

1846
01:49:59.531 --> 01:50:00.370
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the kind of,</v>

1847
01:50:00.610 --> 01:50:05.610
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the best selling and most </v>

1848
01:50:05.610 --> 01:50:07.531
<v Speaker 6>prominent intellectuals in the world </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now says in an interview that </v>

1849
01:50:07.531 --> 01:50:12.031
<v Speaker 6>maybe the me too movement has shown that</v>
<v Speaker 6>this whole experiment of men and women </v>

1850
01:50:12.031 --> 01:50:13.630
<v Speaker 6>working together,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just not working.</v>

1851
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:16.870
<v Speaker 6>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe if women don't want to be.</v>

1852
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:19.060
<v Speaker 6>I don't want the workplace to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>sexualized.</v>

1853
01:50:19.090 --> 01:50:20.950
<v Speaker 6>They shouldn't be allowed to wear </v>
<v Speaker 6>makeup.</v>

1854
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.660
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry,</v>

1855
01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.630
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1856
01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:24.670
<v Speaker 6>google it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Google it.</v>

1857
01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:25.810
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

1858
01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:27.550
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1859
01:50:27.551 --> 01:50:29.380
<v Speaker 6>If I say like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1860
01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.990
<v Speaker 6>I feel threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1861
01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:35.080
<v Speaker 6>Then I'm being kind of politically </v>
<v Speaker 6>correct and hysterical.</v>

1862
01:50:35.081 --> 01:50:38.470
<v Speaker 6>So much of the debate about political.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Correct.</v>

1863
01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:44.770
<v Speaker 6>But there's one group that really does </v>
<v Speaker 6>think it's feeling should be </v>

1864
01:50:44.770 --> 01:50:49.061
<v Speaker 6>accommodated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that is what we keep coming up </v>

1865
01:50:49.061 --> 01:50:49.220
<v Speaker 6>against is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1866
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:53.330
<v Speaker 6>there's a group of people and to some </v>
<v Speaker 6>extent I'm part of it,</v>

1867
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:58.570
<v Speaker 6>that feels uniquely that our feelings of</v>
<v Speaker 6>being silenced or marginalized,</v>

1868
01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:05.200
<v Speaker 6>censored.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That those feelings need to take </v>

1869
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:05.870
<v Speaker 6>primacy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we can kind of,</v>

1870
01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:07.300
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1871
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:12.310
<v Speaker 6>sneer when these other groups for us to </v>
<v Speaker 6>take seriously their feelings of being </v>

1872
01:51:15.201 --> 01:51:18.980
<v Speaker 6>threatened or their feelings of being </v>
<v Speaker 6>marginalized.</v>

1873
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:24.010
<v Speaker 6>Then we call it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we call that we call those demands </v>

1874
01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:24.020
<v Speaker 6>political correctness.</v>

1875
01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:29.500
<v Speaker 6>And I would finally say that I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>there is a fair amount of research that </v>

1876
01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:33.911
<v Speaker 6>people become more closed minded,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more tribal when they feel threatened,</v>

1877
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:38.750
<v Speaker 6>when they feel that their group identity</v>
<v Speaker 6>is at stake.</v>

1878
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:43.810
<v Speaker 6>And so as much as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you want to blame the left for the rise </v>

1879
01:51:44.601 --> 01:51:49.601
<v Speaker 6>of the right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that when you kind of bet the </v>

1880
01:51:49.601 --> 01:51:53.411
<v Speaker 6>rise of the right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the rise of people who are questioning </v>

1881
01:51:53.411 --> 01:51:56.780
<v Speaker 6>the fundamental ideals of pluralistic </v>
<v Speaker 6>liberal democracy,</v>

1882
01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:59.600
<v Speaker 6>the more of those views are </v>
<v Speaker 6>mainstreamed.</v>

1883
01:51:59.750 --> 01:52:04.010
<v Speaker 6>The more people I think are going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>shut down in response because people are</v>

1884
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:05.270
<v Speaker 6>really scared.</v>

1885
01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:11.220
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1886
01:52:14.591 --> 01:52:14.860
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

1887
01:52:15.330 --> 01:52:19.790
<v Speaker 4>all the debaters I think we want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>thank the audience you were engaged were</v>

1888
01:52:19.791 --> 01:52:24.080
<v Speaker 4>mostly civil and lots of civil in ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that we enjoy it,</v>

1889
01:52:24.081 --> 01:52:26.030
<v Speaker 4>so I think on behalf of the debaters </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

1890
01:52:26.031 --> 01:52:28.490
<v Speaker 4>Thank you audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was a challenging topic.</v>

1891
01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:34.200
<v Speaker 5>Great job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You</v>

1892
01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:36.930
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our debaters know it's one thing.</v>

1893
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:41.990
<v Speaker 4>All of these four give regular speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a very different thing to come </v>

1894
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:44.040
<v Speaker 4>on and into stage in front of a live </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience,</v>

1895
01:52:44.041 --> 01:52:49.041
<v Speaker 4>a large television,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and have your ideas a contested in real </v>

1896
01:52:49.341 --> 01:52:50.480
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

01:56:21.711 --> 01:56:23.430
<v Speaker 9>good tactical move and I stand by what I</v>
<v Speaker 9>said.</v>

1944
01:56:23.431 --> 01:56:28.431
<v Speaker 9>I don't see any reason at all that my </v>
<v Speaker 9>racial identity needed to be dragged </v>

1945
01:56:28.431 --> 01:56:32.451
<v Speaker 9>into the discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the independent of my personality </v>

1946
01:56:32.451 --> 01:56:35.180
<v Speaker 9>proclivity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would say what I just said to Mr Frye </v>

1947
01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:35.370
<v Speaker 9>here is that it was a pleasure sharing </v>
<v Speaker 9>the stage with him.</v>

1948
01:56:35.370 --> 01:56:40.370
<v Speaker 9>I've rarely heard anyone ever deliver </v>
<v Speaker 9>their convictions with such a remarkable</v>

1949
01:56:41.581 --> 01:56:46.581
<v Speaker 9>sense of passion.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And we have 10 forbearance and </v>

1950
01:56:46.581 --> 01:56:46.581
<v Speaker 9>erudition.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was,</v>

1951
01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:48.870
<v Speaker 9>it was really something.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And Steven,</v>

1952
01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:51.990
<v Speaker 9>the challenging debate because in a </v>
<v Speaker 9>sense we're trying to mesh two different</v>

1953
01:56:51.991 --> 01:56:53.610
<v Speaker 9>views here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>two different worldviews,</v>

1954
01:56:53.611 --> 01:56:55.920
<v Speaker 9>one very focused more on identity </v>
<v Speaker 9>politics,</v>

1955
01:56:55.921 --> 01:56:58.830
<v Speaker 9>group identity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You in a sense having an argument really</v>

1956
01:56:58.831 --> 01:57:03.831
<v Speaker 9>more about the larger culture itself and</v>
<v Speaker 9>the tenor and tone of the conversation </v>

1957
01:57:03.831 --> 01:57:06.720
<v Speaker 9>with the DM is being a little kind of </v>
<v Speaker 9>scuffled gum really in the.</v>

1958
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:12.270
<v Speaker 9>It's got the gun and two specific that I</v>
<v Speaker 9>just taken very literally the popular </v>

1959
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:16.581
<v Speaker 9>idea that greatness as being a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 9>control of language and the shutting </v>

1960
01:57:16.711 --> 01:57:21.711
<v Speaker 9>down and phrases or an introduction of </v>
<v Speaker 9>others and the kind of day to day as </v>

1961
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:28.270
<v Speaker 9>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>human resource departments of </v>

1962
01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:28.270
<v Speaker 9>corporations and that sort of thing.</v>

1963
01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:32.300
<v Speaker 9>And so I was slightly disappointed that </v>
<v Speaker 9>it just became a debate about race and </v>

1964
01:57:33.241 --> 01:57:36.240
<v Speaker 9>about gender and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But that was,</v>

1965
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:38.080
<v Speaker 9>I guess not true and I still didn't </v>
<v Speaker 9>know.</v>

1966
01:57:38.081 --> 01:57:39.960
<v Speaker 9>The fact is I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>

1967
01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:45.260
<v Speaker 9>I'm still a lefty but a software.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm just don't have to soft squishy in </v>

1968
01:57:47.701 --> 01:57:52.701
<v Speaker 9>every sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I realized that that's not a </v>

1969
01:57:52.701 --> 01:57:55.941
<v Speaker 9>political point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It is a personal and the gap between the</v>

1970
01:57:56.461 --> 01:58:01.461
<v Speaker 9>personal and the political,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is space you obviously very </v>

1971
01:58:01.461 --> 01:58:04.041
<v Speaker 9>interested in is as a psychologist is </v>
<v Speaker 9>one that is rarely explored a few people</v>

1972
01:58:05.401 --> 01:58:10.401
<v Speaker 9>that are either so personal that it has </v>
<v Speaker 9>no application in the outside world and </v>

1973
01:58:10.401 --> 01:58:13.650
<v Speaker 9>the Organization of Human Affairs or the</v>
<v Speaker 9>soap or the decal and so much to do with</v>

1974
01:58:13.651 --> 01:58:18.651
<v Speaker 9>structure and distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 9>hierarchies and networks and so on that </v>

1975
01:58:18.651 --> 01:58:22.730
<v Speaker 9>they forget the individual and that's </v>
<v Speaker 9>the space in which the impassionate </v>

1976
01:58:22.911 --> 01:58:27.911
<v Speaker 9>liberal lives and it's not easy to do it</v>
<v Speaker 9>because you often do sound rather wet </v>

1977
01:58:27.911 --> 01:58:29.850
<v Speaker 9>and I'm aware that I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I enjoyed it.</v>

1978
01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 9>Thank you for coming.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You just finally,</v>

1979
01:58:31.471 --> 01:58:36.471
<v Speaker 9>before I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>for you to both to a well earned drank </v>

1980
01:58:36.471 --> 01:58:36.471
<v Speaker 9>a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>anything left unsaid.</v>

1981
01:58:36.471 --> 01:58:36.890
<v Speaker 9>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 9>any,</v>

1982
01:58:36.891 --> 01:58:39.420
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>any point that you wanted to make that,</v>

1983
01:58:39.421 --> 01:58:44.421
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you didn't feel you had the time or the </v>

1984
01:58:44.421 --> 01:58:44.421
<v Speaker 9>opportunity?</v>

1985
01:58:44.421 --> 01:58:44.421
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

1986
01:58:44.421 --> 01:58:44.480
<v Speaker 4>I said my piece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1987
01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:46.380
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same question to you is do you know,</v>

1988
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:51.390
<v Speaker 4>I think I heard got across,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's so much you can talk </v>

1989
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.390
<v Speaker 4>about in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1990
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:54.930
<v Speaker 4>in that field,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just wanted to leave with the </v>

1991
01:58:54.930 --> 01:58:54.930
<v Speaker 4>point that I do want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everybody,</v>

1992
01:58:54.930 --> 01:58:54.930
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1993
01:58:54.930 --> 01:58:56.860
<v Speaker 4>it's a no brainer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want the world to be fairer,</v>

1994
01:58:57.110 --> 01:58:58.570
<v Speaker 4>Justa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweeter kinder.</v>

1995
01:58:58.770 --> 01:59:02.290
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's how you get the a and m.</v>

1996
01:59:02.650 --> 01:59:04.660
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I wasn't really addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1997
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:07.390
<v Speaker 4>Well gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you both very much from our online</v>

1998
01:59:07.391 --> 01:59:08.830
<v Speaker 4>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A big thank you.</v>

1999
01:59:08.831 --> 01:59:13.831
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know Jordan Peterson and Stephen Fry </v>

2000
01:59:13.831 --> 01:59:13.831
<v Speaker 4>for participating in A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2001
01:59:13.831 --> 01:59:15.070
<v Speaker 4>in a debate with some steaks on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>table for sure.</v>

2002
01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:17.230
<v Speaker 4>Thank you gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See seeing the reception you,</v>

2003
01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:20.710
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>online viewers.</v>

2004
01:59:20.770 --> 01:59:25.770
<v Speaker 4>We've now have Michael Eric dyson coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the camera range here with Michelle</v>

2005
01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:28.840
<v Speaker 4>Goldberg to get their reactions to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>debate.</v>

2006
01:59:28.841 --> 01:59:31.510
<v Speaker 4>So guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you for being part of this.</v>

2007
01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:32.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

2008
01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:37.860
<v Speaker 4>it's a complicated subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got a lot of different moving </v>

2009
01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:40.921
<v Speaker 4>pieces and elements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we addressed some of the </v>

2010
01:59:40.921 --> 01:59:40.921
<v Speaker 4>constituent parts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe start with you,</v>

2011
01:59:40.921 --> 01:59:45.541
<v Speaker 4>Michelle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was there something on stage that you </v>

2012
01:59:45.541 --> 01:59:49.020
<v Speaker 4>wanted to say that maybe we didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time or you didn't have the </v>

2013
01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:49.020
<v Speaker 4>opportunity?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2014
01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:49.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now's your chance.</v>

2015
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.970
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2016
01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:56.100
<v Speaker 6>I guess I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the only thing I can think of is that </v>

2017
01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:58.291
<v Speaker 6>maybe I wished that we could have </v>
<v Speaker 6>drilled down a little bit more into the </v>

2018
01:59:58.291 --> 02:00:00.120
<v Speaker 6>gender piece of this and again too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2019
02:00:00.130 --> 02:00:02.580
<v Speaker 6>what we're really arguing about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2020
02:00:02.590 --> 02:00:07.590
<v Speaker 6>particularly with Mr Peterson and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of range of progress,</v>

2021
02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:12.740
<v Speaker 6>the range of feminist progress that he </v>
<v Speaker 6>considers political correctness.</v>

2022
02:00:13.301 --> 02:00:18.280
<v Speaker 6>I think part of the frustration is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>him and Steven Fry are talking about and</v>

2023
02:00:18.281 --> 02:00:23.281
<v Speaker 6>defending,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a fairly discrete set of ideas </v>

2024
02:00:23.281 --> 02:00:23.281
<v Speaker 6>with some overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2025
02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:23.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

2026
02:00:23.711 --> 02:00:27.520
<v Speaker 6>one of the difficult things about </v>
<v Speaker 6>political correctness is it's a slippery</v>

2027
02:00:27.521 --> 02:00:32.490
<v Speaker 6>term that's deployed to talk about a </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole range of phenomenon and</v>

2028
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:35.150
<v Speaker 4>closed down conversation and open up </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

2029
02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:38.330
<v Speaker 4>How did you feel a Michael?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were some points.</v>

2030
02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:42.080
<v Speaker 4>There are some points of sharp exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We appreciate that at the munk debates.</v>

2031
02:00:42.081 --> 02:00:43.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not a place for,</v>

2032
02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:46.880
<v Speaker 4>for a shrinking wallflowers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2033
02:00:46.890 --> 02:00:48.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any unsaid thoughts,</v>

2034
02:00:48.981 --> 02:00:52.460
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that you want to put a point on</v>

2035
02:00:52.461 --> 02:00:53.710
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you have to hold people</v>

2036
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:58.950
<v Speaker 8>intellectually accountable and to deny </v>
<v Speaker 8>some of the things to Michelle that he </v>

2037
02:00:58.961 --> 02:01:03.961
<v Speaker 8>said and to present himself Mr Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 8>in a certain way without seeing some of </v>

2038
02:01:03.961 --> 02:01:08.731
<v Speaker 8>the important things he said about women</v>
<v Speaker 8>and other minorities I think demands an </v>

2039
02:01:09.911 --> 02:01:14.560
<v Speaker 8>engaged response to him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I think that the idea itself,</v>

2040
02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:19.860
<v Speaker 8>as Michelle stated repeatedly and,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and Mr Fried talked about his </v>

2041
02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:19.860
<v Speaker 8>frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>

2042
02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:21.100
<v Speaker 8>we've talked about everything but </v>
<v Speaker 8>political correctness.</v>

2043
02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:26.580
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the reality is political correctness </v>

2044
02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:27.280
<v Speaker 8>resides.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean rests upon some serious political</v>

2045
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:29.830
<v Speaker 8>work in this culture in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Canada,</v>

2046
02:01:29.831 --> 02:01:32.560
<v Speaker 8>and in America that needs to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And what I tried to,</v>

2047
02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:37.620
<v Speaker 8>in terms of giving a brief genealogy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we didn't have political correctness as </v>

2048
02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:37.930
<v Speaker 8>long as white,</v>
<v Speaker 8>straight men were in charge.</v>

2049
02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:41.360
<v Speaker 8>There was no argument about let's get </v>
<v Speaker 8>this right.</v>

2050
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:46.100
<v Speaker 8>But when people who exercise power,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no longer exercise,</v>

2051
02:01:46.190 --> 02:01:48.440
<v Speaker 8>absolute power,</v>
<v Speaker 8>still predominant power,</v>

2052
02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:53.060
<v Speaker 8>then there's an argument and I think </v>
<v Speaker 8>Michelle's point about gender,</v>

2053
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:55.490
<v Speaker 8>about the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 8>about race,</v>

2054
02:01:55.491 --> 02:02:00.491
<v Speaker 8>about sexuality and the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just think that it was a necessarily </v>

2055
02:02:00.491 --> 02:02:03.300
<v Speaker 8>vigorous and sometimes sharply worded a </v>
<v Speaker 8>debate between the.</v>

2056
02:02:03.301 --> 02:02:04.520
<v Speaker 8>So Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 8>final word to you.</v>

2057
02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:11.260
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you are curious about the quote that </v>

2058
02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:13.730
<v Speaker 6>I mentioned about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2059
02:02:13.731 --> 02:02:16.400
<v Speaker 6>maybe this experiment with women and men</v>
<v Speaker 6>working together.</v>

2060
02:02:16.401 --> 02:02:18.380
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean please do Google it.</v>

2061
02:02:18.381 --> 02:02:21.980
<v Speaker 6>It's an interview with vice columns for </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing one of your colleagues.</v>

2062
02:02:22.570 --> 02:02:26.930
<v Speaker 6>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know me and Steven,</v>

2063
02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:31.960
<v Speaker 6>me and Stephen Fry probably could have </v>
<v Speaker 6>sat on the same side of another debate.</v>

2064
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:37.390
<v Speaker 6>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like the phrase political </v>

2065
02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:40.061
<v Speaker 6>correctness has expanded to cover a </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole range of challenges too.</v>

2066
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:46.810
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was really interesting how </v>
<v Speaker 6>much people were talking about their </v>

2067
02:02:46.810 --> 02:02:48.710
<v Speaker 6>feelings because when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when women talk about their feelings,</v>

2068
02:02:48.711 --> 02:02:51.020
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is politically correct.</v>

2069
02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:53.630
<v Speaker 6>Excess.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when,</v>

2070
02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:59.170
<v Speaker 6>when men talk about this feeling that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they can't empirically define,</v>

2071
02:02:59.270 --> 02:03:00.650
<v Speaker 6>we should all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess,</v>

2072
02:03:00.651 --> 02:03:02.210
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>change,</v>

2073
02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:03.530
<v Speaker 6>change in deference to that.</v>

2074
02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:05.340
<v Speaker 4>Okay guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great thoughts.</v>

2075
02:03:05.370 --> 02:03:06.940

<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
