7
00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>personal impact on me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after making derogatory remarks about </v>

27

<v Speaker 1>Stalin in a letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was arrested and summarily sentenced </v>

36
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.330

<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn as grand master work.</v>

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>stolen and for whom the key to survival </v>
<v Speaker 1>lay,</v>

41
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>not in hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in despair,</v>

42
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.600
<v Speaker 1>a thoroughly research document and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet of literary and imaginative power.</v>

43

<v Speaker 1>Doris lessing 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 to 2013,</v>

46
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>a British novelist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playwright,</v>

47
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.600
<v Speaker 1>librettist biographer and short story </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer and winner of the 2007 Nobel </v>

48
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Prize for Literature says of the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 1>Archipelago.</v>

49
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 1>It helped to bring down an empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Its importance can hardly be </v>

50
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.121
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Solzhenitsyn's own forward to </v>

51
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:59.451
<v Speaker 1>the original abridgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dedicate this to all those who did not</v>

52
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:04.921
<v Speaker 1>live to tell it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and may they please forgive me for not </v>

53
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:08.521
<v Speaker 1>having seen it all nor remembered at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>for not having defined at all.</v>

54
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.510
<v Speaker 1>If it were possible for any nation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fathom another people's bitter </v>

55
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.961
<v Speaker 1>experience through a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much easier it's future fate would </v>

56
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>become and how many calamities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes could avoid,</v>

57
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>but it is very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There always is this fallacious belief.</v>

58
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.850
<v Speaker 1>It would not be the same here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here such things are impossible.</v>

59
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Alas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the evil of the 20th century is </v>

60
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.111
<v Speaker 1>possible everywhere on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet I have not given up all hope that </v>

61
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:47.401
<v Speaker 1>human beings in nations may be able in </v>
<v Speaker 1>spite of all to learn from the </v>

62
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>experience of other people without </v>
<v Speaker 1>having to live through it personally.</v>

63
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gratefully accept Professor Erickson </v>

64
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>suggestion to create a one volume </v>
<v Speaker 1>abridgement of my three volume work,</v>

65
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag archipelago in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate it's reading for those who do</v>

66
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>not have much time in this hectic </v>
<v Speaker 1>century of ours.</v>

67
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I think Professor Erickson for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>generous initiative as well as for the </v>

68
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 1>tactfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the literary taste and the understanding</v>

69
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:19.711
<v Speaker 1>of western readers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he displayed during the work on </v>

70
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:22.921
<v Speaker 1>the abridgment Edward III Erickson </v>
<v Speaker 1>Junior,</v>

71
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>1939 to 2017 who served as the editor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Abridge single volume version of the</v>

72
00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:35.231
<v Speaker 1>gulag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archipelago was professor emeritus of </v>

73
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:37.040
<v Speaker 1>English at Calvin College and the author</v>
<v Speaker 1>of many other books,</v>

74
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 1>including the soldier knits and reader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The apocalyptic vision of Mikhail </v>

75
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Bulgakov is the master and Margarita and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soul and barbed wire and </v>

76
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.211
<v Speaker 1>introduction to social units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what he had to say when he </v>

77
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:53.600
<v Speaker 1>introduced the abridged version</v>

78
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>in 1994 after years of forced exile in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the West,</v>

79
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn returned to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia at one town meeting,</v>

80
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:09.101
<v Speaker 1>held on his Trans Siberian whistle stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour to reacquaint himself with his </v>

81
00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 1>homeland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was confronted by this rebuke.</v>

82
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.760
<v Speaker 1>It is you and your writing that started </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all and brought our country to the </v>

83
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 1>verge of collapse and devastation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia doesn't need you,</v>

84
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.300
<v Speaker 1>so go back to your blessing America </v>
<v Speaker 1>units and instantly replied that to his </v>

85
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:32.711
<v Speaker 1>dying day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would keep fighting against the evil </v>

86
00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>ideology that was capable of slaying one</v>
<v Speaker 1>third of his country's population.</v>

87
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.480
<v Speaker 1>The meeting erupted in applause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of exchange was unimaginable </v>

88
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:46.361
<v Speaker 1>when the president abridgment of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago first appeared in </v>

89
00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:49.631
<v Speaker 1>1985.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost no one expected then that within </v>

90
00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:53.441
<v Speaker 1>a few years the Soviet Union would </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse and almost in a day like the </v>

91
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>legendary one horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shay.</v>

92
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the dramatic events that put the </v>

93
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.191
<v Speaker 1>closing punctuation mark on the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>parentheses in Russian history have </v>

94
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may say,</v>

95
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.030
<v Speaker 1>brought an end to what the great Russian</v>
<v Speaker 1>poet Anna Akhmatova called the true 20th</v>

96
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

97
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.570
<v Speaker 1>This for short and century running from </v>
<v Speaker 1>1914 to 1917 to 1989,</v>

98
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:22.960
<v Speaker 1>1991 was the era when Utopian dreams </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted in lightened,</v>

99
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:27.961
<v Speaker 1>meant optimism came to rely on brute </v>
<v Speaker 1>force to make ideological schemes </v>

100
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:33.011
<v Speaker 1>prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 20th century is proven in </v>

101
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:37.421
<v Speaker 1>quantitative terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the most murderous in human </v>

102
00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:40.661
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As governments killed their subjects at </v>

103
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:43.211
<v Speaker 1>record rates for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word Holocaust served as shorthand </v>

104
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:48.431
<v Speaker 1>for modern man's inhumanity demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one lone man added a second such </v>

105
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:54.611
<v Speaker 1>term Ghoulag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which now appears in dictionaries as a </v>

106
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:58.181
<v Speaker 1>common noun social units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was one of the precious few who did </v>

107
00:07:58.181 --> 00:08:01.820
<v Speaker 1>anticipate the demise of the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment and he thought his book would</v>

108
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

109
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Ghoulag was destined to affect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of history.</v>

110
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I was sure of that on one of his darkest</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

111
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 1>February twelfth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>

112
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:17.651
<v Speaker 1>74 the day before he was forced into </v>
<v Speaker 1>exile and precisely because the Gulag </v>

113
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 1>had appeared in the West.</v>

114
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.040
<v Speaker 1>He mused you Bolsheviks are finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no two ways about it,</v>

115
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.730
<v Speaker 1>what satisfaction he felt then when some</v>
<v Speaker 1>early reviews such as one from the </v>

116
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Frankfurter Allgemeine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a leading German newspaper,</v>

117
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.530
<v Speaker 1>caught his intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The time may come when we date the </v>

118
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.080
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the collapse of the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>system from the appearance of ghoulag.</v>

119
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 1>American diplomat and scholar George </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennan hailed the work as the greatest </v>

120
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.931
<v Speaker 1>and most powerful single indictment of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>political regime ever to be leveled in </v>

121
00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:57.281
<v Speaker 1>modern times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One sure to stick in the craw of the </v>

122
00:08:57.281 --> 00:09:02.271
<v Speaker 1>Soviet propaganda machine with </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing discomfort until it is done </v>

123
00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:07.191
<v Speaker 1>its work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soldier units and has proven prescient </v>

124
00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:12.140
<v Speaker 1>on other matters as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only did he reiterated in the teeth </v>

125
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>of the prevailing opinion of Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialists on Soviet affairs,</v>

126
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 1>that he was absolutely convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>communism will go.</v>

127
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.600
<v Speaker 1>He also insisted most resolutely and </v>
<v Speaker 1>against all seeming reason that he </v>

128
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 1>expected to be reunited with his beloved</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>

129
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 1>In a strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I not only hope,</v>

130
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm inwardly convinced that I shall go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

131
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean my physical return,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just my books,</v>

132
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>and that contradicts all rationality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>improbable.</v>

133
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Prerequisites were that his citizenship </v>
<v Speaker 1>be restored,</v>

134
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:49.850
<v Speaker 1>that the charge of treason against him </v>
<v Speaker 1>be dropped and that all of his books be </v>

135
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 1>published in his homeland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After his prophecies were fulfilled.</v>

136
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.110
<v Speaker 1>A friend of his reminisced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed crazy to me at the time,</v>

137
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 1>but it was a real conviction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poet's knowledge.</v>

138
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 1>He sees the man sees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

139
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:11.511
<v Speaker 1>historians ultimately apportion the </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit for ending the Cold War soldier </v>

140
00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:15.981
<v Speaker 1>units and Dubai notably played a part in</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing the Soviet edifice down to </v>

141
00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:20.511
<v Speaker 1>rubble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His writings de legitimize communism in </v>

142
00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:24.681
<v Speaker 1>his homeland and discredited it abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was much too modest in depicting </v>

143
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:29.841
<v Speaker 1>himself as a little calf foolishly </v>
<v Speaker 1>budding a mighty oak and thinking this </v>

144
00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:34.071
<v Speaker 1>could bring it down as David Remnick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>editor of the New Yorker declares in </v>

145
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 1>terms of the effect it has had on </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

146
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.520
<v Speaker 1>social units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is the dominant writer of the </v>

147
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Else compares?</v>

148
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kessler.</v>

149
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Remnick concludes that to some extent </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to credit the literary works of</v>

150
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:57.681
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Solzhenitsyn with helping to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring down the last empire on earth.</v>

151
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 1>So after that introductory material my </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

152
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.460
<v Speaker 1>it begins with an excerpt from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech delivered by soldier knits into </v>

153
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.580
<v Speaker 1>the Swedish Academy on the occasion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his acceptance of the Nobel Prize for </v>

154
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

155
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Once we have taken up the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is thereafter impossible to turn </v>

156
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.211
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A writer is no detached judge of his </v>

157
00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:32.591
<v Speaker 1>countrymen and contemporaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is an accomplice to all the evil </v>

158
00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.310
<v Speaker 1>committed in this country or bias </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

159
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.810
<v Speaker 1>and if the tanks of his father </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatherland have bloodied the pavement of</v>

160
00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:43.130
<v Speaker 1>a foreign capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then rust colored stains have forever be</v>

161
00:11:43.131 --> 00:11:48.131
<v Speaker 1>spattered the writers face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if on some fateful night a trusting </v>

162
00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:53.441
<v Speaker 1>friend is strangled in his sleep than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the palms of the writer bear,</v>

163
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:58.591
<v Speaker 1>the bruises from that rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if his youthful fellow citizens </v>

164
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:03.901
<v Speaker 1>nonchalantly proclaimed the advantages </v>
<v Speaker 1>of debauchery over humbled toil.</v>

165
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 1>If they abandon themselves to drugs or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sees hostages,</v>

166
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 1>then this stench to his mingled with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>breadth of the writer.</v>

167
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Have we the insulins to declare that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do not answer for the evils of today's </v>

168
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.760
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The simple act of an ordinary,</v>

169
00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:27.761
<v Speaker 1>brave man is not to participate in lies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to support false actions.</v>

170
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.520
<v Speaker 1>His rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let that come into the world.</v>

171
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Let it even reign supreme only not </v>
<v Speaker 1>through me,</v>

172
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.980
<v Speaker 1>but it is within the power of writers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and artists to do much more to defeat </v>

173
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.391
<v Speaker 1>the lie for in the struggle with lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Art has always triumphed and Shell </v>

174
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:56.491
<v Speaker 1>always triumph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Visibly irrefutably for all lies can </v>

175
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 1>prevail against much in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never against art.</v>

176
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.870
<v Speaker 1>One word of truth shall outweigh the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole world.</v>

177
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.080
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you defend your homeland against the </v>

178
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.541
<v Speaker 1>Nazis serving as a twice decorated </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier on the eastern front in the </v>

179
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:21.191
<v Speaker 1>criminally ill prepared Soviet Red Army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're arrested,</v>

180
00:13:21.651 --> 00:13:24.770
<v Speaker 1>humiliated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripped of your military rank,</v>

181
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.860
<v Speaker 1>charged under the hospices of the all </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

182
00:13:27.861 --> 00:13:32.861
<v Speaker 1>Article Fifty eight with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissemination of anti Soviet propaganda </v>

183
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.290
<v Speaker 1>and dragged off to Moscow's infamous </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lubyanka prison.</v>

184
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.080
<v Speaker 1>They're through the bars of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch your beloved country </v>

185
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.240
<v Speaker 1>celebrating it's victory in the Great </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patriotic War.</v>

186
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Then you're sentenced in absentia to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years of hard labor,</v>

187
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:57.300
<v Speaker 1>but you got away easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't so long afterward that people </v>

188
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.201
<v Speaker 1>in your position were awarded a tenor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a quarter of a century and fate</v>

189
00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 1>isn't finished with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

190
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.140
<v Speaker 1>not by any means you develop a deadly </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer in the camp,</v>

191
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.440
<v Speaker 1>endure the exile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imposed on you after your imprisonment </v>

192
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.650
<v Speaker 1>ends and passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close to death.</v>

193
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Despite all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hold your head high,</v>

194
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 1>you refuse to turn against man or God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you have every reason to do so,</v>

195
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.730
<v Speaker 1>you write instead secretly at night </v>
<v Speaker 1>documenting your terrible experiences.</v>

196
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.910
<v Speaker 1>You craft a personal memoir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single day in the labor camps and </v>

197
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.900
<v Speaker 1>miracle of miracles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clouds part.</v>

198
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.440
<v Speaker 1>The Sun shines through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your book is published and in your own </v>

199
00:14:46.571 --> 00:14:51.571
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It meets with unparalleled claim </v>

200
00:14:51.571 --> 00:14:52.970
<v Speaker 1>nationally and internationally,</v>

201
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.720
<v Speaker 1>but the sky darkens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again in the sun disappears.</v>

202
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.870
<v Speaker 1>The repression returns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become,</v>

203
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:05.730
<v Speaker 1>once again a nonperson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the secret police,</v>

204
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:10.350
<v Speaker 1>the dread KGB sees the manuscript of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your next book.</v>

205
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.700
<v Speaker 1>It sees the light of day nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only in the west.</v>

206
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 1>There your reputation grows beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wildest imaginings the Nobel Committee </v>

207
00:15:21.631 --> 00:15:25.890
<v Speaker 1>itself bestows upon you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's highest literary honor.</v>

208
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.260
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet authorities stripped of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>camouflage are enraged.</v>

209
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.810
<v Speaker 1>They ordered the secret police to poison</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

210
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.900
<v Speaker 1>You pass once again near death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you continue to write driven,</v>

211
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:45.020
<v Speaker 1>solitary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerably inspired your gulag.</v>

212
00:15:45.301 --> 00:15:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Archipelago documents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute and utter corruption of the</v>

213
00:15:49.171 --> 00:15:52.710
<v Speaker 1>dogmas and doctrines of your state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your empire,</v>

214
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 1>your leaders and yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that is printed to not in your </v>

215
00:16:02.191 --> 00:16:04.260
<v Speaker 1>own country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the west.</v>

216
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Once again from copies also dangerously </v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden and smuggled across the borders </v>

217
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:14.670
<v Speaker 1>and your great book bursts with </v>
<v Speaker 1>unparalleled and dreadful force into the</v>

218
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.450
<v Speaker 1>still naive and unexpecting literary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual world.</v>

219
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.700
<v Speaker 1>You're expelled from the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripped of your citizenship,</v>

220
00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:29.210
<v Speaker 1>forced to take residency in a society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both strange to you and resistant in its</v>

221
00:16:29.611 --> 00:16:34.611
<v Speaker 1>own way to your prophetic words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the power of your stories and the </v>

222
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:38.820
<v Speaker 1>strength of your morals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demolish any remaining claims to ethical</v>

223
00:16:38.821 --> 00:16:43.821
<v Speaker 1>and philosophical credibility still made</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the defenders of the collectivist </v>

224
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:46.740
<v Speaker 1>system that gave rise to all that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>witnessed.</v>

225
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Years Pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not so many from the perspective of </v>

226
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.240
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then another miracle,</v>

227
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.010
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You return home,</v>

228
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.880
<v Speaker 1>your citizenship is restored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You write and speak,</v>

229
00:17:05.881 --> 00:17:10.881
<v Speaker 1>and you're reclaimed homeland until </v>
<v Speaker 1>death claims you in 2008 a year later,</v>

230
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.210
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag archipelago is deemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>mandatory.</v>

231
00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:20.211
<v Speaker 1>Reading by those responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing the national school </v>

<v Speaker 1>you're impossible.</v>

233
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Victory is complete.</v>

234
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 1>The three volumes of the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 1>archipelago,</v>

235
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:37.180
<v Speaker 1>one continuous extended scream of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage are paradoxically brilliant.</v>

236
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Bitter disbelieving and infused with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>are at the strength characterizing the </v>

237
00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:49.560
<v Speaker 1>best among us in the worst of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

238
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 1>In that monumental text published in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1973,</v>

239
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Solzhenitsyn conducted an </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment in literary investigation,</v>

240
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.870
<v Speaker 1>a hybrid of journalism history and </v>
<v Speaker 1>biography,</v>

241
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.890
<v Speaker 1>unlike anything ever written before or </v>
<v Speaker 1>since.</v>

242
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.940
<v Speaker 1>In 1985,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the author bestowed his approval upon </v>

248
00:18:41.001 --> 00:18:45.741
<v Speaker 1>whose lives were torn asunder are the </v>

249
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 1>stories carefully preserved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making the tragedy of mass,</v>

250
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:51.630
<v Speaker 1>betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>torture,</v>

251
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:52.290
<v Speaker 1>and death.</v>

252
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Not The mere statistic stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so disdainfully described,</v>

253
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:03.260
<v Speaker 1>but individual real and terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a matter of pure historical fact </v>

254
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.520
<v Speaker 1>that the Gulag archipelago played a </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary role in bringing the Soviet </v>

255
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Empire to its knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although economically unsustainable,</v>

256
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.120
<v Speaker 1>ruled in the most corrupt manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginable and reliant on the slavery </v>

257
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.621
<v Speaker 1>and enforced deceit of its citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet system managed to stumble </v>

258
00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 1>forward through far too many decades </v>
<v Speaker 1>before being cut to the quick,</v>

259
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 1>the courageous leaders of the labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>unions in Poland,</v>

260
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.690
<v Speaker 1>the great Pope John Paul two and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American president,</v>

261
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:41.691
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his blunt insistence that the West </v>

262
00:19:41.691 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 1>faced an evil empire all played their </v>
<v Speaker 1>role in its defeat and collapse.</v>

263
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Speaker 1>It was Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

264
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.940
<v Speaker 1>who's revelations made it positively </v>
<v Speaker 1>shameful to defend not just the Soviet </v>

265
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.980
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the very system of thought that made</v>

266
00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:59.730
<v Speaker 1>that state what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was soldier units new.</v>

267
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Most crucially made the case that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible excesses of communism could not</v>

268
00:20:03.961 --> 00:20:07.890
<v Speaker 1>be conveniently blamed on the corruption</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Soviet leadership,</v>

269
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:13.130
<v Speaker 1>the cult of personality surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen or the failure to put the </v>

270
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.001
<v Speaker 1>otherwise stellar and admirable utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles of Marxism into proper </v>

271
00:20:17.221 --> 00:20:17.970
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

272
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:24.110
<v Speaker 1>It was Solzhenitsyn who demonstrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the death of millions and the </v>

273
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.891
<v Speaker 1>devastation of many more were instead a </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct causal consequence of the </v>

274
00:20:28.291 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worse,</v>

275
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.710
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the theology driving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist system,</v>

276
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:40.460
<v Speaker 1>the hypothetically egalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>universalist doctrines of Karl Marx </v>

277
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.000
<v Speaker 1>contained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden within them,</v>

278
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.670
<v Speaker 1>sufficient hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>

279
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.850
<v Speaker 1>envy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and denial of culpability and </v>

280
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.431
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to produce nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>poison and death when manifested in the </v>

281
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:58.801
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Mark's man was a member of a class,</v>

282
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.740
<v Speaker 1>an economic class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group that and little more and </v>

283
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:09.931
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but the battleground of classes </v>

284
00:21:09.931 --> 00:21:11.440
<v Speaker 1>and groups is admires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded,</v>

285
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:16.300
<v Speaker 1>continue to regard marks doctrine as one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of compassion,</v>

286
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.630
<v Speaker 1>moral by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtuous by fit.</v>

287
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Consider the working classes in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>their oppression and work forthrightly </v>

288
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.440
<v Speaker 1>to free them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hate may well be a stronger and more</v>

289
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:33.740
<v Speaker 1>compelling motivator than love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In consequence,</v>

290
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:37.370
<v Speaker 1>it took no time in the aftermath of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian revolution.</v>

291
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.520
<v Speaker 1>For Solidarity with the common man and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the apparently laudable demand for </v>

292
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.991
<v Speaker 1>universal quality to manifest it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unarticulated and ever darkening,</v>

293
00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:47.660
<v Speaker 1>shadow</v>

294
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.780
<v Speaker 1>first came the most brutal indictment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the class enemy then came the ever </v>

295
00:21:55.931 --> 00:22:00.931
<v Speaker 1>expanding definition of that enemy until</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single person in the entirety of </v>

296
00:22:00.931 --> 00:22:05.911
<v Speaker 1>the State found him or herself at risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>of encapsulation within that insatiable </v>

297
00:22:06.011 --> 00:22:11.011
<v Speaker 1>and devouring net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the verdict delivered to those deemed at</v>

298
00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:16.201
<v Speaker 1>fault by those who elevated themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this simultaneously held positions of</v>

299
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:19.180
<v Speaker 1>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jury and executioner,</v>

300
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 1>the necessity to eradicate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>victimizers,</v>

301
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:28.620
<v Speaker 1>the oppressors in toto without any </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration whatsoever for reactionary</v>

302
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:34.351
<v Speaker 1>niceties such as individual innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us note as well this outcome wasn't </v>

303
00:22:35.861 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 1>the result of the initially pristine </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist doctrine becoming corrupted over</v>

304
00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:45.121
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something apparent and present at </v>

305
00:22:45.121 --> 00:22:45.121
<v Speaker 1>the very beginning of the Soviet state </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

306
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Sojourn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insights.</v>

307
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:48.400
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

308
00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:53.401
<v Speaker 1>Martin lapsis writing for the newspaper </v>
<v Speaker 1>read terror November first 1918.</v>

309
00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.830
<v Speaker 1>We are not fighting against single </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

310
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.580
<v Speaker 1>We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a class.</v>

311
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:10.050
<v Speaker 1>It is not necessary during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrogation to look for evidence </v>

312
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.820
<v Speaker 1>proving that the accused opposed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviets by word or action.</v>

313
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.370
<v Speaker 1>The first question you should ask him </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

314
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.970
<v Speaker 1>what class does he belong to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is his origin,</v>

315
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.490
<v Speaker 1>his education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his profession?</v>

316
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.880
<v Speaker 1>These are the questions that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine the fate of the accused such </v>

317
00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:30.310
<v Speaker 1>as the sense an essence of red terror.</v>

318
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.590
<v Speaker 1>It is necessary to think when you read </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a thing to meditate long and hard </v>

319
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.850
<v Speaker 1>on the message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is necessary to recognize,</v>

320
00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:44.851
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the writer believed that it would </v>

321
00:23:44.851 --> 00:23:46.951
<v Speaker 1>be better to execute 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially innocent individuals than to</v>

322
00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:51.971
<v Speaker 1>allow one poisonous member of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressor class to remain free is </v>

323
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:58.541
<v Speaker 1>equally necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To pose the question who precisely </v>

324
00:23:58.821 --> 00:24:02.900
<v Speaker 1>belonged to that hypothetical entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bourgeoisie.</v>

325
00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:08.850
<v Speaker 1>It is not as if the boundaries of such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>category or self evident there for the </v>

326
00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.971
<v Speaker 1>mere perceiving they must be drawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where exactly and more importantly </v>

327
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.800
<v Speaker 1>by whom or by what if it's hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>inscribing the lines instead of love,</v>

328
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.340
<v Speaker 1>they will inevitably be drawn so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lowest,</v>

329
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:29.180
<v Speaker 1>meanest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most cruel and useless of the conceptual</v>

330
00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:34.181
<v Speaker 1>geographers will be justified in </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting the greatest possible evil </v>

331
00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:39.160
<v Speaker 1>and producing the greatest possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>misery members of the Swazi beyond all </v>

332
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.280
<v Speaker 1>redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to go as a matter of course,</v>

333
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.910
<v Speaker 1>one of their wives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

334
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:55.350
<v Speaker 1>even their grandchildren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off with their heads to all were </v>

335
00:24:56.621 --> 00:25:00.610
<v Speaker 1>encouraged to be corrupted by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>class identity and their destruction.</v>

336
00:25:00.611 --> 00:25:05.611
<v Speaker 1>Therefore ethically necessitated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How convenient that the darkest and </v>

337
00:25:06.041 --> 00:25:08.890
<v Speaker 1>diarist of all possible motivations </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be granted,</v>

338
00:25:08.891 --> 00:25:13.891
<v Speaker 1>the highest of moral standings that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a true marriage of Hell and heaven.</v>

339
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.430
<v Speaker 1>What values?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What philosophical presumptions,</v>

340
00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:23.431
<v Speaker 1>truly dominated under such circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it desire for brotherhood,</v>

341
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.480
<v Speaker 1>dignity and freedom from want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In the least,</v>

342
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:35.030
<v Speaker 1>not given the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was instead and obviously the </v>

343
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:39.321
<v Speaker 1>murderous rage of hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of biblical canes each looking to </v>

344
00:25:39.691 --> 00:25:41.220
<v Speaker 1>torture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy,</v>

345
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.280
<v Speaker 1>and sacrifice their own private ables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is simply no other manner of </v>

346
00:25:47.311 --> 00:25:52.311
<v Speaker 1>accounting for the corpses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can be concluded in the deepest,</v>

347
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.070
<v Speaker 1>most permanent sense from Solzhenitsyn's</v>
<v Speaker 1>anguished,</v>

348
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.980
<v Speaker 1>ghoulag narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

349
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:04.230
<v Speaker 1>we learn what is indisputable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we all should have learned by now,</v>

350
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>what we have nonetheless failed to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the left like the right can go too </v>

351
00:26:11.161 --> 00:26:13.650
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the left has in the past,</v>

352
00:26:13.651 --> 00:26:16.950
<v Speaker 1>gone much too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

353
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.710
<v Speaker 1>we learn what is far more subtle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

354
00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.980
<v Speaker 1>How and why that going too far occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learn as social units and so </v>

355
00:26:25.561 --> 00:26:30.561
<v Speaker 1>profoundly insists that the line </v>
<v Speaker 1>dividing good and evil cuts through the </v>

356
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:35.241
<v Speaker 1>heart of every human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we learned as well that we all are </v>

357
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:36.230
<v Speaker 1>each of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cymbalta,</v>

358
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:39.210
<v Speaker 1>caneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressor and oppressed.</v>

359
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we come to realize that the twin </v>

360
00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.151
<v Speaker 1>categories of or presser and justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking victim can be made endlessly </v>

361
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.290
<v Speaker 1>inclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not least because we all benefit</v>

362
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:57.291
<v Speaker 1>unfairly and are all equally victimized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by our thrownness are arbitrary </v>

363
00:26:58.561 --> 00:27:03.561
<v Speaker 1>placement in the flow of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all accrue undeserved and somewhat </v>

364
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:08.220
<v Speaker 1>random privileged from the vagaries of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our place of birth or inequitably,</v>

365
00:27:08.221 --> 00:27:10.620
<v Speaker 1>distributed talents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ethnicity,</v>

366
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.060
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

367
00:27:12.061 --> 00:27:14.970
<v Speaker 1>and sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all belong to a group,</v>

368
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:20.060
<v Speaker 1>some group that has been elevated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparative status through no effort of </v>

369
00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.561
<v Speaker 1>our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is true in some manner along some </v>

370
00:27:24.561 --> 00:27:28.251
<v Speaker 1>dimension of group category for every </v>
<v Speaker 1>solitary individual except for the </v>

371
00:27:29.171 --> 00:27:34.171
<v Speaker 1>single most lowly of all at some time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in some manner we may all in </v>

372
00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:39.681
<v Speaker 1>consequence be justly targeted as </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressors and may all equally seek </v>

373
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:45.021
<v Speaker 1>justice or revenge as victims even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the initiators of the revolution had </v>

374
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:52.521
<v Speaker 1>therefore in their most pure moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>being driven by a holy desire to lift up</v>

375
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:56.690
<v Speaker 1>the downtrodden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it not guaranteed that they would be</v>

376
00:27:56.691 --> 00:28:00.380
<v Speaker 1>overtaken by those motivated primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>by envy,</v>

377
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.910
<v Speaker 1>hate and the desire to destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the revolution progressed,</v>

378
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:11.410
<v Speaker 1>hence the establishment of the hungrily </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing and most often fatal list of </v>

379
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:15.080
<v Speaker 1>class enemies right from the very first </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments of the communist revolution.</v>

380
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.710
<v Speaker 1>The demolition was aimed first at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

381
00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:23.740
<v Speaker 1>the religious believers and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialists continuing under Stalin with </v>

382
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.720
<v Speaker 1>the old revolutionaries themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>was followed.</v>

383
00:28:26.721 --> 00:28:31.721
<v Speaker 1>Soon thereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the annihilation of the successful </v>

384
00:28:31.721 --> 00:28:31.940
<v Speaker 1>peasant farmer Kulaks</v>

385
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.380
<v Speaker 1>and this appetite for destruction wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the type to be satiated with the </v>

386
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.191
<v Speaker 1>bodies of the perpetrators themselves as</v>
<v Speaker 1>social needs and rights,</v>

387
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.460
<v Speaker 1>they burned out hold nests whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>families from the start and they watched</v>

388
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.290
<v Speaker 1>jealously to be sure that none of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

389
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.450
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

390
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.720
<v Speaker 1>even six years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God away to the last scrapings all had </v>

391
00:29:00.511 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 1>to go down the same road to the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>common destruction.</v>

392
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.910
<v Speaker 1>This was driven by the perceived even </v>
<v Speaker 1>self perceived guilt of all how else was</v>

393
00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:17.601
<v Speaker 1>it possible for the hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands or perhaps even millions of </v>

394
00:29:17.601 --> 00:29:18.630
<v Speaker 1>informants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecutors,</v>

395
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:23.810
<v Speaker 1>betrayers and unforgivably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mute observers to praying and </v>

396
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:30.051
<v Speaker 1>unforgivably mute observers to spring so</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly into being in the tumult of the </v>

397
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 1>red terror.</v>

398
00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Thus the doctrine of group identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably ends with everyone identified</v>

399
00:29:40.761 --> 00:29:45.761
<v Speaker 1>as a class enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an oppressor with everyone unpleasantly </v>

400
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:49.180
<v Speaker 1>contaminated by bridgewater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Privilege unfairly enjoying the benefits</v>

401
00:29:49.181 --> 00:29:54.181
<v Speaker 1>be queen by the vagaries of history with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone prosecuted without respite for </v>

402
00:29:55.271 --> 00:30:00.271
<v Speaker 1>that corruption and injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no mercy for the oppressor and no </v>

403
00:30:01.811 --> 00:30:06.811
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too severe for the crime of </v>

404
00:30:06.811 --> 00:30:09.091
<v Speaker 1>exploitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expiation becomes impossible because </v>

405
00:30:09.091 --> 00:30:12.100
<v Speaker 1>there is no individual guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no individual responsibility,</v>

406
00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:17.460
<v Speaker 1>and therefore no manner in which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime of arbitrary birth can be </v>

407
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:21.811
<v Speaker 1>individually accounted for and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>misery that can be generated as a </v>

408
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:26.941
<v Speaker 1>consequence of such an accusation is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>true reason for the accusation.</v>

409
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.560
<v Speaker 1>When everyone is guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that serves justice is the </v>

410
00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.461
<v Speaker 1>punishment of everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the guilt extends to the existence </v>

411
00:30:38.461 --> 00:30:42.781
<v Speaker 1>of the world's misery itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the fatal punishment will suffice.</v>

412
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:51.390
<v Speaker 1>It is much more preferable instead and </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to preserve us all from</v>

413
00:30:52.091 --> 00:30:56.170
<v Speaker 1>metastasizing hell's to state </v>
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly.</v>

414
00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I am indeed throwing arbitrarily into </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

415
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I therefore choose to voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder the responsibility of my </v>

416
00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.340
<v Speaker 1>advantages and the burden of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantages.</v>

417
00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Like every other individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am morally bound to pay for my </v>

418
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.050
<v Speaker 1>advantages with my responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

419
00:31:18.051 --> 00:31:22.420
<v Speaker 1>morally bound to accept my disadvantages</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the price I pay for being.</v>

420
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I will therefore strive not to descend </v>
<v Speaker 1>into bitterness and then seek vengeance </v>

421
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.560
<v Speaker 1>because I have less to my credit and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater burden to stumble forward with </v>

422
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.140
<v Speaker 1>than others.</v>

423
00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Is this not an a or even the essential </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of difference between the West for</v>

424
00:31:43.081 --> 00:31:48.081
<v Speaker 1>all its faults and the brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible egalitarian systems generated </v>

425
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:53.180
<v Speaker 1>by the pathological communist doctrine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great and good framers of the </v>

426
00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:56.100
<v Speaker 1>American republic were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

427
00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.840
<v Speaker 1>anything but utopian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took full stock and full measure of</v>

428
00:32:00.841 --> 00:32:05.841
<v Speaker 1>ineradicable human imperfection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They held modest goals derived not least</v>

429
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.530
<v Speaker 1>from the profoundly cautious common law </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition of England.</v>

430
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.700
<v Speaker 1>They endeavored to establish a system </v>
<v Speaker 1>the corrupt and ignorant fools we all </v>

431
00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.050
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could not damage to fatally.</v>

432
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:24.950
<v Speaker 1>That's humility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's clear headed knowledge of the </v>

433
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.510
<v Speaker 1>limitations of human machination and </v>
<v Speaker 1>good intention,</v>

434
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.880
<v Speaker 1>but the communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolutionaries,</v>

435
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:38.570
<v Speaker 1>they aimed grandly and admirably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in theory at a more heavenly </v>

436
00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:45.191
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they began their pursuit with a </v>

437
00:32:45.191 --> 00:32:47.951
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically straightforward and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so morally justifiable enforcement of </v>

438
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 1>economic equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wealth,</v>

439
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:54.860
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not so easily generated.</v>

440
00:32:55.310 --> 00:33:00.310
<v Speaker 1>The poor could not simply become rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the riches of those who had anything</v>

441
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 1>more than the greatest popper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how pitiful that more was,</v>

442
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:10.010
<v Speaker 1>that could be redistributed or at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>

443
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:16.400
<v Speaker 1>That's equality to that sacrifice in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>name of heaven on earth and </v>

444
00:33:17.911 --> 00:33:21.150
<v Speaker 1>redistribution was not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With all its theft,</v>

445
00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.710
<v Speaker 1>betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and death.</v>

446
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Mere economic engineering was </v>
<v Speaker 1>insufficient.</v>

447
00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:32.540
<v Speaker 1>What emerged as well was the overarching</v>
<v Speaker 1>and truly totalitarian desire to remake </v>

448
00:33:33.451 --> 00:33:35.550
<v Speaker 1>man and woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>

449
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:41.180
<v Speaker 1>the longing to restructure the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit in the very image of the </v>

450
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:45.231
<v Speaker 1>communist preconceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributing to themselves this divine </v>

451
00:33:45.421 --> 00:33:47.730
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this transcendent wisdom,</v>

452
00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:52.890
<v Speaker 1>and with unshakeable belief in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>glowing but ever receiving future.</v>

453
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.400
<v Speaker 1>The newly minted Soviets tortured </v>
<v Speaker 1>thieved,</v>

454
00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 1>imprisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lied and betrayed all the wild masking </v>

455
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.630
<v Speaker 1>their great evil with virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Solzhenitsyn,</v>

456
00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:09.650
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag archipelago that tore off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mask and exposed the feral cowardice,</v>

457
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.820
<v Speaker 1>envy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deceit,</v>

458
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:17.090
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hatred for the individual and for </v>

459
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:20.151
<v Speaker 1>existence itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That pulse beneath others had made the </v>

460
00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:26.921
<v Speaker 1>attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm Muggeridge reported on the </v>

461
00:34:26.921 --> 00:34:29.651
<v Speaker 1>horrors of d Kula Ization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forced collectivization of the all </v>

462
00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:33.950
<v Speaker 1>too recently successful peasantry of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine and elsewhere that proceeded the</v>

463
00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:38.951
<v Speaker 1>horrifying famines of the 19 thirties in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same decade and in the following </v>

464
00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:44.891
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George orwell risked his ideological </v>

465
00:34:44.891 --> 00:34:47.591
<v Speaker 1>commitments and his reputation to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>us all what was truly occurring in the </v>

466
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union in the name of </v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism and brotherhood,</v>

467
00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:55.870
<v Speaker 1>but it was Solzhenitsyn who truly shamed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical leftists,</v>

468
00:34:55.930 --> 00:35:00.930
<v Speaker 1>forcing them under ground where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have festered and plotted for the last </v>

469
00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:05.161
<v Speaker 1>40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failing unforgivably to have learned </v>

470
00:35:05.161 --> 00:35:08.521
<v Speaker 1>what all reasonable people should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned from the cataclysm of the 20th </v>

471
00:35:08.521 --> 00:35:10.600
<v Speaker 1>century and it's Egalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>utopianism,</v>

472
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:16.030
<v Speaker 1>and today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite everything and under their sway,</v>

473
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:21.270
<v Speaker 1>almost three decades since the fall of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Berlin Wall and the apparent </v>

474
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.931
<v Speaker 1>collapse of communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing everything we can to forget </v>

475
00:35:24.931 --> 00:35:28.591
<v Speaker 1>what Solzhenitsyn so clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated to our great and richly </v>

476
00:35:28.591 --> 00:35:33.091
<v Speaker 1>deserved peril.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't all our children read the </v>

477
00:35:33.091 --> 00:35:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago in our high schools as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they now do in Russia?</v>

478
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Why don't our teachers feel compelled to</v>
<v Speaker 1>read the book aloud?</v>

479
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Did we not win the Cold War?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the body's not piled high enough,</v>

480
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.500
<v Speaker 1>how high then would be enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

481
00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:00.380
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it still acceptable end in polite </v>

482
00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.011
<v Speaker 1>company to profess the philosophy of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist or if not that to at least </v>

483
00:36:04.011 --> 00:36:08.040
<v Speaker 1>admire the work of Marx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it still acceptable to regard the</v>

484
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:13.041
<v Speaker 1>Marxist doctrine as essentially accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its diagnosis of the hypothetical </v>

485
00:36:13.041 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 1>evils of the free market democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

486
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.840
<v Speaker 1>to still consider that doctrine </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive and fit for the </v>

487
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Compassionate and proper thinking person</v>

488
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:28.580
<v Speaker 1>$25 million dead through internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>repression in the Soviet Union.</v>

489
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.280
<v Speaker 1>According to the black book of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communism,</v>

490
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:36.490
<v Speaker 1>$60 million dead in Mao's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and an all too likely return to </v>

491
00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.810
<v Speaker 1>audit craddick oppression in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>country in the near future.</v>

492
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.560
<v Speaker 1>The horrors of Cambodian killing fields </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their 2 million corpses,</v>

493
00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:50.320
<v Speaker 1>the barely animate body politic of Cuba </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people struggle even now to feed </v>

494
00:36:50.931 --> 00:36:55.931
<v Speaker 1>themselves Venezuela where it is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>been made illegal to attribute a child's</v>

495
00:36:57.951 --> 00:37:02.951
<v Speaker 1>death in hospital to starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No political experiment has ever been </v>

496
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:09.951
<v Speaker 1>tried so widely with so many disparate </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in so many different countries </v>

497
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:15.500
<v Speaker 1>with such different histories and failed</v>
<v Speaker 1>so absolutely and catastrophic.</v>

498
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it mere ignorance?</v>

499
00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll be at of the most inexcusable kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>that allows today's Marxists to flaunt </v>

500
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:29.310
<v Speaker 1>their continued allegiance to present it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as compassion and care,</v>

501
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.540
<v Speaker 1>or is it instead envy of the successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>in near infinite proportions or </v>

502
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:41.100
<v Speaker 1>something akin to hatred for mankind </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself?</v>

503
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.800
<v Speaker 1>How much proof do we need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we still avert our eyes from the </v>

504
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:52.721
<v Speaker 1>truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we simply locked sophistication.</v>

505
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we just can't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps our tendency toward compassion </v>

506
00:37:59.341 --> 00:38:03.390
<v Speaker 1>is so powerfully necessary in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimacy of our families and friendships</v>

507
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.150
<v Speaker 1>that we cannot contemplate its </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>

508
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:11.270
<v Speaker 1>It's an ability to scale and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>propensity to mutate into hatred of the </v>

509
00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:14.730
<v Speaker 1>oppressor rather than an allegiance with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oppressed.</v>

510
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we cannot comprehend the </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations and dangers of the Utopian </v>

511
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:25.221
<v Speaker 1>vision given our definite need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplate and to strive for a better </v>

512
00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:26.100
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

513
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.030
<v Speaker 1>We certainly don't seem to imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

514
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.630
<v Speaker 1>that the hypothesis of some state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>future perfection,</v>

515
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.960
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truly egalitarian and permanent </v>

516
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.851
<v Speaker 1>brotherhood of man can be used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify any and all sacrifices </v>

517
00:38:41.851 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pristine and heavenly end,</v>

518
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:49.900
<v Speaker 1>making all conceivable means no one only</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable but morally required.</v>

519
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:55.390
<v Speaker 1>There are simply no price too great to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay in pursuit of the ultimate utopia,</v>

520
00:38:55.750 --> 00:39:00.750
<v Speaker 1>and this is particularly true if it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else who foots the bill and it </v>

521
00:39:01.851 --> 00:39:06.851
<v Speaker 1>is clearly the case that we require a </v>
<v Speaker 1>future toward which to orient ourselves </v>

522
00:39:06.851 --> 00:39:09.890
<v Speaker 1>to provide meaning in our life </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically speaking.</v>

523
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It is for that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see the same need expressed </v>

524
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.020
<v Speaker 1>collectively on a much larger scale in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Judeo Christian vision of the </v>

525
00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Promised Land and the Kingdom of Heaven </v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth,</v>

526
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:27.970
<v Speaker 1>and it is also clearly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sacrifice is necessary to bring </v>

527
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:31.811
<v Speaker 1>that desire to instate into being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the discovery of the future </v>

528
00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:36.461
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the necessity to forego instantaneous </v>

529
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:37.550
<v Speaker 1>gratification in the present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to delay,</v>

530
00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:42.850
<v Speaker 1>to bargain with fate so the future can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be better twinned with the necessity to </v>

531
00:39:42.921 --> 00:39:45.110
<v Speaker 1>let go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to burn off,</v>

532
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 1>to separate wheat from chaff and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice what is presently unworthy so </v>

533
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:55.061
<v Speaker 1>that tomorrow can be better than today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but limits need to be placed around who </v>

534
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
<v Speaker 1>or what is deemed dispensable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is exactly the necessity for </v>

535
00:40:01.851 --> 00:40:06.851
<v Speaker 1>interminable sacrifice that constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible counterpart of the Utopian </v>

536
00:40:06.851 --> 00:40:09.530
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heaven is worth any price,</v>

537
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.600
<v Speaker 1>but who pays Christianity solve that </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem by insisting on the sacrifice of</v>

538
00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:21.241
<v Speaker 1>the self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insisting that the suffering and </v>

539
00:40:21.241 --> 00:40:24.151
<v Speaker 1>malevolence of the world is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of each individual </v>

540
00:40:24.151 --> 00:40:28.770
<v Speaker 1>insisting that each of us sacrifice what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is unworthy and unnecessary and </v>

541
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:33.451
<v Speaker 1>resentful and deadly and our characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the pain of such sacrifice so </v>

542
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:39.121
<v Speaker 1>that we can stumble properly uphill </v>
<v Speaker 1>under our respective and voluntarily </v>

543
00:40:39.121 --> 00:40:43.801
<v Speaker 1>shouldered existential burdens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was an is the opinion of the </v>

544
00:40:44.081 --> 00:40:49.081
<v Speaker 1>materialist utopians that someone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>be sacrificed so that heaven itself </v>

545
00:40:49.081 --> 00:40:53.050
<v Speaker 1>might be attained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some perpetrator or victimizer,</v>

546
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>oral oppressor or member of a privileged</v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

547
00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.610
<v Speaker 1>A cynic might be forgiven in consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>for asking,</v>

548
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:05.890
<v Speaker 1>is it the city of God that is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>the aim or is the true aim?</v>

549
00:41:05.891 --> 00:41:10.891
<v Speaker 1>The desire to make a burning sacrificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>pyre of everyone and everything and the </v>

550
00:41:10.891 --> 00:41:13.390
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis of the coming brotherhood of </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

551
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Merely the cover story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camouflage perhaps it is precisely </v>

552
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:21.820
<v Speaker 1>the horror that is the point and not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>utopia.</v>

553
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.420
<v Speaker 1>It is far from obvious in such </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

554
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Just what his horse and what his cart it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is precisely in the aftermath of the </v>

555
00:41:30.731 --> 00:41:35.731
<v Speaker 1>death of 100 million people or more that</v>
<v Speaker 1>such dark questions must be asked and we</v>

556
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:41.861
<v Speaker 1>should also note that the Utopian vision</v>
<v Speaker 1>dressed as it is inevitably in </v>

557
00:41:41.861 --> 00:41:43.370
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a temptation,</v>

558
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.110
<v Speaker 1>particularly difficult to resist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bay.</v>

559
00:41:46.111 --> 00:41:51.111
<v Speaker 1>Therefore offer a particularly subtle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and insidious justification for mayhem.</v>

560
00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Here's some thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know some facts.</v>

561
00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Every social system produces inequality </v>
<v Speaker 1>at present and every social system has </v>

562
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.831
<v Speaker 1>done so since the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poor have been with us and will be </v>

563
00:42:08.681 --> 00:42:13.480
<v Speaker 1>with us always and now let's just have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the content of individual.</v>

564
00:42:13.481 --> 00:42:18.481
<v Speaker 1>Paleolithic grave sites provides </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence for the existence of </v>

565
00:42:18.481 --> 00:42:20.530
<v Speaker 1>substantive variance in the distribution</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ability,</v>

566
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.150
<v Speaker 1>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wealth.</v>

567
00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Even in our distant past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more illustrious of our ancestors </v>

568
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:31.360
<v Speaker 1>were buried with great possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hordes of precious metals,</v>

569
00:42:31.361 --> 00:42:32.950
<v Speaker 1>weaponry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jewelry,</v>

570
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.560
<v Speaker 1>and costuming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The majority,</v>

571
00:42:35.561 --> 00:42:40.561
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggled through their lives and were </v>

572
00:42:40.561 --> 00:42:42.040
<v Speaker 1>buried with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inequality is the iron rule,</v>

573
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:45.340
<v Speaker 1>even among animals with their intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>

574
00:42:45.341 --> 00:42:48.790
<v Speaker 1>for quality living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>space and reproductive opportunity,</v>

575
00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:53.890
<v Speaker 1>even among plants and cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even among the stellar lights,</v>

576
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.920
<v Speaker 1>the doc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos themselves were a minority of</v>

577
00:42:56.921 --> 00:43:01.921
<v Speaker 1>privileged and oppressive heavenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies contained in the mass and </v>

578
00:43:01.921 --> 00:43:05.131
<v Speaker 1>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions or even billions of average </v>

579
00:43:05.131 --> 00:43:08.941
<v Speaker 1>dispossessed planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inequality is the deepest of problems </v>

580
00:43:08.941 --> 00:43:13.350
<v Speaker 1>built into the structure of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and will not be solved by the </v>

581
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:17.551
<v Speaker 1>presumptuous ibiology inspired retooling</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rare free,</v>

582
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.590
<v Speaker 1>stable and productive democracies of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

583
00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.940
<v Speaker 1>The only systems that have produced some</v>
<v Speaker 1>modicum of wealth along with the </v>

584
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:31.051
<v Speaker 1>inevitable inequality and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>intendance along with the inevitable </v>

585
00:43:31.061 --> 00:43:33.370
<v Speaker 1>inequality and its attendant suffering,</v>

586
00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:40.610
<v Speaker 1>the only systems that have produced some</v>
<v Speaker 1>modicum of wealth along with the </v>

587
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:44.691
<v Speaker 1>inevitable inequality and its attendant </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering or those that evolved in the </v>

588
00:43:44.691 --> 00:43:47.100
<v Speaker 1>west with their roots in the Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian tradition.</v>

589
00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Precisely those systems that emphasize </v>
<v Speaker 1>above all the essential dignity,</v>

590
00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:56.690
<v Speaker 1>divinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimate responsibility of the </v>

591
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:57.240
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In consequence,</v>

592
00:43:57.241 --> 00:44:02.241
<v Speaker 1>any attempt to attribute the existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of inequality to the functioning of the </v>

593
00:44:02.241 --> 00:44:04.860
<v Speaker 1>productive institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have managed to create and protect so</v>

594
00:44:04.861 --> 00:44:09.861
<v Speaker 1>recently in what is still accurately </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded as the free world will hurt </v>

595
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:11.760
<v Speaker 1>those who are weakest and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>

596
00:44:11.761 --> 00:44:15.390
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radicals who conflate the activities</v>

597
00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:18.120
<v Speaker 1>of the west with the oppression of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>downtrodden,</v>

598
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.010
<v Speaker 1>therefore do nothing to aid those whom </v>
<v Speaker 1>they purport to prize and plenty to harm</v>

599
00:44:23.011 --> 00:44:28.011
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The claims they make to act under the </v>

600
00:44:28.011 --> 00:44:30.891
<v Speaker 1>inspiration of pure compassion must </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore come to be regarded with the </v>

601
00:44:30.891 --> 00:44:34.050
<v Speaker 1>deepest suspicion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not least by those who dare to make such</v>

602
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:35.850
<v Speaker 1>claims themselves.</v>

603
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 1>The dangers of the Utopian vision had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been laid bare even if the reasons those</v>

604
00:44:41.641 --> 00:44:45.360
<v Speaker 1>dangers exist have not yet been fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>unacceptably articulated.</v>

605
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.900
<v Speaker 1>If there was any excuse to be a marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1917 and both Dostoevsky and nichier </v>

606
00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:56.280
<v Speaker 1>prophesied well before then that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be held to pay for that doctrine.</v>

607
00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:01.490
<v Speaker 1>There is absolutely and finally no </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse now and we know that mostly </v>

608
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:05.520
<v Speaker 1>because of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag archipelago.</v>

609
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Thank heaven for that great authors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage,</v>

610
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 1>courage and unquenchable thirst for </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice and truth.</v>

611
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:19.340
<v Speaker 1>It was Solzhenitsyn who warned us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the catastrophes of the Soviet state </v>

612
00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.510
<v Speaker 1>were inextricably and causally linked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deceitful blandishments of the </v>

613
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Marxist Utopian Vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Solzhenitsyn who carefully </v>

614
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.090
<v Speaker 1>documented the price paid in suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the dreadful communist experiment.</v>

615
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.590
<v Speaker 1>And who distilled from that suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom we must all he'd so that such</v>

616
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:39.840
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe does not visit us again.</v>

617
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we could take from his writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the humility that would allow us to </v>

618
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:50.551
<v Speaker 1>understand that our mere good intentions</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not sufficient to make us good men </v>

619
00:45:50.651 --> 00:45:55.651
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we could take from his writing </v>

620
00:45:55.651 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 1>the humility that would allow us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that our mere good intentions</v>

621
00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.980
<v Speaker 1>are not sufficient to make us good men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>

622
00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we could come to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>such intentions are instead all too </v>

623
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:12.601
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of our unpardonable </v>

624
00:46:12.601 --> 00:46:15.541
<v Speaker 1>historical ignorance are author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>willful blindness and are voracious </v>

625
00:46:15.541 --> 00:46:19.360
<v Speaker 1>hidden appetite for vengeance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terror and destruction.</v>

626
00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we could come to remember and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from the intolerable trials </v>

627
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.640
<v Speaker 1>endeared by all those who pass through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fiery chambers of the Marxists </v>

628
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.160
<v Speaker 1>collectivists ideology.</v>

629
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we could derive from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembering and learning the wisdom </v>

630
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:40.971
<v Speaker 1>necessary to take personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for the suffering and </v>

631
00:46:40.971 --> 00:46:44.991
<v Speaker 1>malevolence that still so terribly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unforgivably characterizes the world.</v>

632
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:51.440
<v Speaker 1>We have been provided with the means to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform ourselves in due humility by </v>

633
00:46:52.501 --> 00:46:56.130
<v Speaker 1>the literary and moral genius of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>great Russian author.</v>

634
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:01.820
<v Speaker 1>We should also pray most devoutly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever dad he guides us implicitly or </v>

635
00:47:02.101 --> 00:47:07.101
<v Speaker 1>explicitly for the desire and the will </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn from what we have been offered.</v>

636
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.800
<v Speaker 1>May God himself eternally fail to </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgive us if in the painstakingly </v>

637
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.080
<v Speaker 1>revealed aftermath of such bloodshed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>torture,</v>

638
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 1>and anguish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we remain stiff,</v>

639
00:47:18.901 --> 00:47:22.800
<v Speaker 1>necked in cautious and unchanged.</v>
