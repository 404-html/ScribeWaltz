<v Speaker 1>audience at the American Enterprise </v>
<v Speaker 1>Institute in Washington DC where </v>

35
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:29.794
<v Speaker 1>for the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now for an introduction though he </v>

36
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:34.870
<v Speaker 1>needs no introduction to the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

37
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:35.704
<v Speaker 1>but Jordan Peterson is a professor at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto and author of </v>

38
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:40.474
<v Speaker 1>many books and and poster of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic lecturers and his most recent </v>

39
00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:48.910
<v Speaker 1>book has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep track of how many languages</v>

40
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:49.744
<v Speaker 1>it's been translated into and the sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a phenomenally successful book </v>

41
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 1>tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

42
00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>my first question is really about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour.</v>

43
00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.553
<v Speaker 1>You look pretty good for somebody who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>visited what a hundred cities in the </v>

44
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 1>past years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>January 23rd I don't know how you do it,</v>

45
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.130
<v Speaker 1>and mostly flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do for fun?</v>

46
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:15.370
<v Speaker 1>What do you ever get to relax?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even brief moments.</v>

47
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 1>And what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on twitter and,</v>

48
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

49
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Although I've been qualified that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxing.</v>

50
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.023
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to forestall that temptation as </v>

51
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 2>much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

52
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I have the auto mode bit of time that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can spend with my wife.</v>

53
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 2>She does travel with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

54
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had,</v>

55
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.843
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tried to take some time to walk </v>

56
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 2>around the cities that we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

57
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.480
<v Speaker 2>and see what we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're usually not at any given place for</v>

58
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:42.314
<v Speaker 2>more than a day or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're usually pretty packed up </v>

59
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:45.110
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

60
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.183
<v Speaker 2>whatever is associated with the lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then with press that the publishers </v>

61
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:50.984
<v Speaker 2>usually arrange.</v>

62
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Well I heard you interviewed in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in Stockholm and you were,</v>

63
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.553
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a half an hour to visit the city </v>

64
00:02:58.651 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>with your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.440
<v Speaker 1>And you loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

66
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very tricky breaks where you get </v>

67
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:05.511
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

68
00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:06.344
<v Speaker 2>the thing is is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lecture to her is unbelievably </v>

69
00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

70
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.430
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of this has is ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

71
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.881
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

72
00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:18.260
<v Speaker 2>so if I'm going out on the streets now </v>
<v Speaker 2>or in cafes or you know,</v>

73
00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:19.094
<v Speaker 2>airports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meet people all the time and they're </v>

74
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 2>always polite and they're always happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see me and they always have some very</v>

75
00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:27.914
<v Speaker 2>touching story to relate and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the audiences themselves are </v>

76
00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:37.280
<v Speaker 2>very positively predisposed to whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is that we're doing together.</v>

77
00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:42.281
<v Speaker 2>And so that makes it a lot easier to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay motivated and to continue.</v>

78
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.203
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's demanding because </v>

79
00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:48.674
<v Speaker 2>everything's scheduled so tightly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do a different lecture every </v>

80
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.500
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

81
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.333
<v Speaker 2>every time I go.</v>

82
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.233
<v Speaker 1>I find that amazing because I give a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of lectures that I anguish over </v>

83
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:01.124
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I have another one and it I it </v>

84
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.090
<v Speaker 1>you go up without notes.</v>

85
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I have a large collection of,</v>

86
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I know what,</v>

87
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.973
<v Speaker 2>how to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually what I try to do is to </v>

88
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:16.691
<v Speaker 2>formulate a problem before the lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm addressing a specific problem and</v>

89
00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:21.980
<v Speaker 2>then I can track how I would set up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument and then I walked through it.</v>

90
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:25.670
<v Speaker 2>But part of it's also an attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 2>formulate the argument on the fly,</v>

91
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

92
00:04:26.181 --> 00:04:27.014
<v Speaker 2>to make the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say to formulate it more </v>

93
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:32.090
<v Speaker 2>precisely and to make a more precise and</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging answer.</v>

94
00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:34.670
<v Speaker 2>And then I can use the audience to judge</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not that's,</v>

95
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.923
<v Speaker 2>that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's also a real challenge to do </v>

96
00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:40.064
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I enjoyed that and it's an excellent </v>

97
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.413
<v Speaker 2>intellectual workout and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>recording the lectures and I'd been </v>

98
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:48.944
<v Speaker 2>using fair some of them to write the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first draft of the chapters for my next </v>

99
00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:56.030
<v Speaker 2>book and for books after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

100
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

101
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.833
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to maximize the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say the utility of doing </v>

102
00:05:00.741 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 2>this at each event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

103
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.770
<v Speaker 2>and my wife seems to be particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>well suited to traveling like that.</v>

104
00:05:06.771 --> 00:05:11.771
<v Speaker 2>She actually enjoys it quite a bit and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is very stable person.</v>

105
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

106
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.410
<v Speaker 2>that's also helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

107
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

108
00:05:16.911 --> 00:05:17.744
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to have an extra brain along </v>
<v Speaker 2>because things are scheduled so tightly </v>

109
00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:22.850
<v Speaker 2>that we don't ever have any room for </v>
<v Speaker 2>error.</v>

110
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Well we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

111
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.023
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how intellectually rigorous</v>
<v Speaker 1>we plan to be with you today because we </v>

112
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>know that when you ever year on one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these platform,</v>

113
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about your ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the fence planners,</v>

114
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>we want to hear more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more about Jordan Peterson,</v>

115
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 1>the man desk desperately and definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to hear about your wife Tammy.</v>

116
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 1>And also you're so well known for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>views on men or how your ideas have been</v>

117
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 1>taken up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So enthusiastic or by young men.</v>

118
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Speaker 1>But we want to talk to you about women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

119
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

120
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.143
<v Speaker 1>but what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you and I share is </v>

121
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:04.360
<v Speaker 1>that we both grew up in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

122
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.683
<v Speaker 1>I promise Christine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not do my Canadian accent while </v>

123
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>you were here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

124
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>but you grew up in rural Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Toronto.</v>

125
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you are what?</v>

126
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 1>The country's most famous grew now since</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marshall Mcluhan.</v>

127
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

128
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's the fact that you came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada have any effect on your views,</v>

129
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has it formed you in any way?</v>

130
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did,</v>

131
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.700
<v Speaker 1>what would it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

132
00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 1>would it be the same if you think you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown up in rural Texas?</v>

133
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 1>How was Canada contributed to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview?</v>

134
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>She's always looking to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Canadian angle?</v>

135
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.073
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the particular part of Canada I </v>

136
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 2>grew up in probably was formative to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree.</v>

137
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:52.964
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the town I grew up in was only 50 years </v>

138
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

139
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:56.924
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the particular part of the world </v>

140
00:06:58.581 --> 00:06:59.414
<v Speaker 2>that I grew up in was really the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>settled part of the North American </v>

141
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 2>prairie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was outside of Edmonton,</v>

142
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:05.070
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

143
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.370
<v Speaker 2>about 400 miles north of Edmonton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

144
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:08.550
<v Speaker 2>400 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

145
00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right at the tip of the shorts.</v>

146
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 2>So the prairie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prairie stretches up that far north.</v>

147
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.004
<v Speaker 2>It's stretches up farther north in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alberta than it does anywhere else in </v>

148
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:19.094
<v Speaker 2>the North American continent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we were at the tip of viable </v>

149
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 2>farming essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was,</v>

150
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.783
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a new place and it was a rather </v>

151
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 2>raw place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

152
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.290
<v Speaker 2>it was a rather harsh place in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

153
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 2>especially because of the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was fundamentally a working class</v>

154
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:37.124
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although a prosperous working class </v>

155
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:39.051
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

156
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Because most of the industry there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>related to the oil and gas industry on,</v>

157
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it was cyclical,</v>

158
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:49.541
<v Speaker 2>when things were good working class </v>
<v Speaker 2>people could make a very good living.</v>

159
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.940
<v Speaker 2>This is during the 70s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So through the goal.</v>

160
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

161
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.910
<v Speaker 1>To be a kid in 400 miles outside a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>

162
00:07:57.911 --> 00:07:58.744
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

163
00:07:59.050 --> 00:07:59.883
<v Speaker 2>liked it when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it was as fun when I was </v>

164
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:04.860
<v Speaker 2>a teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

165
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not convinced that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people who are teenagers</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily have the most wonderful time</v>

167
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:13.450
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

168
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I think adults often look backwards at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pass through rose colored glasses.</v>

169
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:19.214
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what the cartoon is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trudeau accused Reagan of doing </v>

170
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 2>continually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

171
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Gary Trudeau,</v>

172
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 1>the American Enterprise Institute tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mister man.</v>

173
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.981
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>

174
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting input used for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In your book was teenage wasteland,</v>

175
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.580
<v Speaker 1>what you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

176
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's Canadianness does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

177
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.070
<v Speaker 1>how does that formed you or affected </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

178
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.210
<v Speaker 1>if at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it did.</v>

179
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.920
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've,</v>

180
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I've lived in lots of different parts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada and Canada is quite different.</v>

181
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 2>I lived in Alberta for a while and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>had this particular flavor of existence.</v>

182
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:57.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly in fairview.</v>

183
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I was striving to leave and to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>ahead,</v>

184
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to move,</v>

185
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.320
<v Speaker 2>I hesitate to say up at somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>different somewhere more urban.</v>

186
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.363
<v Speaker 2>But that's the case with many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the small towns all across the </v>

187
00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:12.364
<v Speaker 2>West in the u s and Canada are dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're down to nothing because </v>

188
00:09:17.171 --> 00:09:20.440
<v Speaker 2>everyone's moved to the cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in Montreal for a good while and</v>

189
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.540
<v Speaker 2>that was interesting because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

190
00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:24.230
<v Speaker 2>very different culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

191
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.990
<v Speaker 2>it was a culture that was to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 2>stratified by language and by class.</v>

192
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.153
<v Speaker 2>None of that was true in Alberta because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so new that there's no class </v>

193
00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:32.981
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

194
00:09:32.981 --> 00:09:34.050
<v Speaker 2>So that was quite interesting.</v>

195
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you worked,</v>

196
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I loved,</v>

197
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.890
<v Speaker 3>I pulled a passage because I think as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

198
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.700
<v Speaker 3>people are born in small places </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and someone to leave and some</v>

199
00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:45.520
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said I want it to be elsewhere.</v>

200
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.503
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone who eventually left the </v>

201
00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:51.490
<v Speaker 3>fairview I grew up knew they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving by the age of 12.</v>

202
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.713
<v Speaker 3>I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my wife who grew up with me on the </v>

203
00:09:54.491 --> 00:09:58.690
<v Speaker 3>same street knew what was that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call that?</v>

204
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.640
<v Speaker 3>What's the thing that makes you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave and,</v>

205
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:05.500
<v Speaker 3>and set you off because you point out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no class system education with</v>

206
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.250
<v Speaker 3>cheap in Canada compared to states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't cost,</v>

207
00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:11.290
<v Speaker 3>it was stopping people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were from a what?</v>

208
00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Middleclass or you worked in other </v>
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>

209
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 2>teacher and Mario and my mother was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>librarian though.</v>

210
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.330
<v Speaker 2>She had trained as a nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

211
00:10:17.331 --> 00:10:18.164
<v Speaker 2>we had a comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say a suburban lifestyle </v>

212
00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:22.990
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

213
00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:24.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moderate,</v>

214
00:10:24.021 --> 00:10:26.540
<v Speaker 2>middle class suburban lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what trevor you looked like.</v>

215
00:10:26.541 --> 00:10:27.374
<v Speaker 2>It looked like a surface hub that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>built mostly in the ninth save between </v>

216
00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:32.690
<v Speaker 2>the 1950s in the 1970s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

217
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.223
<v Speaker 3>the young Jordan and the then young </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tammy and you have to tell us that </v>

218
00:10:36.731 --> 00:10:39.400
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you met but wanted one and more.</v>

219
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:41.703
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

220
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.370
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one thing that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>different to some degree about</v>

221
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.650
<v Speaker 4>class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um Hm.</v>

222
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.503
<v Speaker 2>My father and my mother had both left </v>
<v Speaker 2>the towns they were from and they were </v>

223
00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:56.360
<v Speaker 2>forward future looking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

224
00:10:56.361 --> 00:10:59.750
<v Speaker 2>most of my friends who quit school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>who didn't attend university,</v>

225
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.390
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have,</v>

226
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that more developed sense of</v>

227
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:10.230
<v Speaker 2>a world outside of what they knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is that my,</v>

228
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>my father took us on long trips when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a kid.</v>

229
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.603
<v Speaker 2>He was a teacher and so he had summer </v>
<v Speaker 2>holidays and we drove all over western </v>

230
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Canada and down into the u s long </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving trips,</v>

231
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:22.830
<v Speaker 2>thousands of miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

232
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 2>that also gave us the sense that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world was a bigger place.</v>

233
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:30.810
<v Speaker 2>But I knew way before I was 12 I believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was off at least to university.</v>

234
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:35.550
<v Speaker 2>And I think generally in your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're liable to go to university,</v>

235
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.533
<v Speaker 2>people don't even really talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a given that that's what's </v>

236
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:40.060
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

237
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:40.923
<v Speaker 2>it's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you take in with every breath </v>

238
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:45.600
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

239
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:46.434
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an often an unspoken expectation </v>

240
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.440
<v Speaker 2>and maybe people make casual reference </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

241
00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:53.274
<v Speaker 2>well when you go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like there's a question </v>

242
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:56.764
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're from a working class </v>

243
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if your family hasn't pursued</v>

244
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:02.494
<v Speaker 2>postsecondary education that isn't in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the realm of unspoken or spoken </v>

245
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 2>expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't like,</v>

246
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.453
<v Speaker 2>like lots of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including many of them who dropped out </v>

247
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:13.880
<v Speaker 2>before they hit high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't by,</v>

248
00:12:13.881 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 2>they were by no means the dumbest people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the class.</v>

249
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:22.171
<v Speaker 2>Like they were plenty smart but they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't oriented towards the idea of,</v>

250
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 2>of pursuing a career that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that involved intellectual,</v>

251
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:27.973
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

252
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.270
<v Speaker 2>what intellectual engagement wasn't in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their worldview.</v>

253
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.660
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear people on the,</v>

254
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.330
<v Speaker 2>let's say more socialists end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution,</v>

255
00:12:39.331 --> 00:12:40.164
<v Speaker 2>talk about barriers to education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are often talk about cost and </v>

256
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.090
<v Speaker 2>sometimes cost is a barrier and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

257
00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:46.800
<v Speaker 2>and it's more of a barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

258
00:12:46.801 --> 00:12:47.634
<v Speaker 2>And it's more of a barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there's still plenty of </v>

259
00:12:48.931 --> 00:12:49.764
<v Speaker 2>community colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>state colleges where you can get </v>

260
00:12:51.721 --> 00:12:54.420
<v Speaker 2>educated for a perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money.</v>

261
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:55.613
<v Speaker 2>But for my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was never a reason that money was </v>

262
00:12:58.891 --> 00:12:59.724
<v Speaker 2>never a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't pursue post secondary </v>

263
00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:01.794
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more like a truncated view of </v>

264
00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:07.230
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

265
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.123
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was more of an emphasis on the </v>

266
00:13:09.241 --> 00:13:12.930
<v Speaker 2>here and now and there were jobs aplenty</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there was also that,</v>

267
00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:13.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

268
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.353
<v Speaker 2>and well paying jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it wasn't obvious that you were in </v>

269
00:13:16.471 --> 00:13:19.270
<v Speaker 2>better shape economically to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>university then.</v>

270
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loss.</v>

271
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you were doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like working on the oil rates.</v>

272
00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

273
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.373
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

274
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was rough,</v>

275
00:13:26.341 --> 00:13:28.170
<v Speaker 2>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harsh work and it wasn't,</v>

276
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.520
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't once you had an inn you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay employed,</v>

277
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:35.430
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't that easy to land an entry</v>
<v Speaker 2>level job either.</v>

278
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.863
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

279
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.713
<v Speaker 4>mmm.</v>

280
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it was wise for lots of working </v>

281
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:40.944
<v Speaker 2>class people to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work in those jobs because they were </v>

282
00:13:43.351 --> 00:13:45.450
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably lucrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

283
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.343
<v Speaker 2>and they should have been because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were very difficult and dangerous and </v>

284
00:13:48.241 --> 00:13:49.320
<v Speaker 2>frigid cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

285
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.700
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rough.</v>

286
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.563
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the people didn't earn </v>
<v Speaker 2>your money.</v>

288
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Let's just tell us quickly how you met </v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife.</v>

289
00:13:56.701 --> 00:13:59.640
<v Speaker 2>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you met her when you were seven or eight</v>

290
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:03.390
<v Speaker 2>are in grade three and grade three yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

291
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:08.420
<v Speaker 2>did you fall in love with her in grade </v>
<v Speaker 2>three and grade three and was it mutual?</v>

292
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.720
<v Speaker 4>Mm,</v>

293
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.110
<v Speaker 2>not in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't admit it if it was,</v>

294
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.000
<v Speaker 2>there were lots of the boys in grade </v>
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>

295
00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:20.540
<v Speaker 2>We are in love with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a whole little crew of guys that</v>

296
00:14:20.541 --> 00:14:21.374
<v Speaker 2>were perfectly willing to follow her </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and she was perfectly willing to </v>

297
00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:27.770
<v Speaker 2>exploit that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was very good at it.</v>

298
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was very popular and a little girl </v>

299
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.550
<v Speaker 2>so wonderful that you met his children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were friends for a long time.</v>

300
00:14:34.551 --> 00:14:35.384
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to play chess together and </v>

301
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.960
<v Speaker 2>croquet and she was a vicious croquet </v>
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>

302
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.853
<v Speaker 2>She would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever played </v>

303
00:14:40.971 --> 00:14:41.804
<v Speaker 2>croquet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's your balls touch then you </v>

304
00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:45.734
<v Speaker 2>can stand on European whack it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other person's ball will vanish off </v>

305
00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 2>into the stratosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She liked it,</v>

306
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:54.760
<v Speaker 2>knock it all the way down the street and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then she laughed.</v>

307
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.060
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she always had a good sense of good,</v>

308
00:14:59.061 --> 00:14:59.894
<v Speaker 2>vicious sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things actually admire </v>

309
00:15:01.441 --> 00:15:05.450
<v Speaker 2>about my wife when we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we've had our verbal disputes,</v>

310
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:06.284
<v Speaker 2>which you know of certainly happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can string together a sequence of </v>

311
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:11.190
<v Speaker 2>insults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so hair raising.</v>

312
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.620
<v Speaker 1>You have to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

313
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 1>did she have brothers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

314

<v Speaker 1>She hasn't brother much older age,</v>

315
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.610
<v Speaker 1>eight years older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite a peaceful person.</v>

316
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And she had two brothers to can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with guys,</v>

317
00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:25.851
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

318
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

319
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.710
<v Speaker 1>they show love and affection by insults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

320
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.713
<v Speaker 1>And Jabs and jeers and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you and I had brother and I </v>

321
00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:35.290
<v Speaker 1>started learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

322
00:15:35.291 --> 00:15:36.750
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't have brothers,</v>

323
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.541
<v Speaker 1>girls like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

324
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:38.650
<v Speaker 1>that's so rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so,</v>

325
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:39.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was,</v>

326
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well she,</v>

327
00:15:41.071 --> 00:15:42.070
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has a,</v>

328
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.680
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was maybe a case,</v>

329
00:15:43.681 --> 00:15:46.480
<v Speaker 1>she came by it naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she should get</v>

330
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.280
<v Speaker 2>farther is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

331
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.970
<v Speaker 2>quite sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Witted and,</v>

332
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.570
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

333
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a real town character.</v>

334
00:15:53.131 --> 00:15:54.180
<v Speaker 2>He's still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

335
00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.150
<v Speaker 2>He was a real character and the tone in </v>
<v Speaker 2>real hyper extrovert,</v>

336
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.043
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew him and he had a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>good with torn him and she had some of </v>

337
00:16:02.191 --> 00:16:04.080
<v Speaker 2>that while it still does have some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

338
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.480
<v Speaker 2>So she was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

339
00:16:06.481 --> 00:16:08.490
<v Speaker 2>aside from her acerbic yeah.</v>

340
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Humor and her ability to whack balls and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

341
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to go further on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>description and that could have many,</v>

342
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.200
<v Speaker 1>many things that tells us about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

343
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.880
<v Speaker 1>What else attract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

344
00:16:20.881 --> 00:16:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you've known her pretty much your whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

345
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.323
<v Speaker 1>so some of the other qualities that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just attracted you but enable you to </v>

346
00:16:28.141 --> 00:16:29.070
<v Speaker 1>sustain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

347
00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I think every young person in this room </v>
<v Speaker 1>will want to know,</v>

348
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.410
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there isn't one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's the secret?</v>

349
00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:35.940
<v Speaker 1>What's it like to be with someone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>long?</v>

350
00:16:35.941 --> 00:16:37.770
<v Speaker 1>How do you sustain that?</v>

351
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.730
<v Speaker 2>You're fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it's,</v>

352
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.190
<v Speaker 2>some of it's good fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

353
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say this is true.</v>

354
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I've watched people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>

355
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personally for a long time,</v>

356
00:16:47.801 --> 00:16:48.634
<v Speaker 2>but also as a professional because I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done a lot of clinical counseling and I </v>

357
00:16:51.311 --> 00:16:55.660
<v Speaker 2>mean there's some things that need to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a given about the relationship.</v>

358
00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

359
00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.220
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't hurt to find the other person</v>
<v Speaker 2>very attractive,</v>

360
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.151
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

361
00:17:01.151 --> 00:17:01.984
<v Speaker 2>and that's a mysterious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not exactly sure what it is that </v>

362
00:17:05.081 --> 00:17:07.330
<v Speaker 2>produces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say chemistry between people.</v>

363
00:17:07.331 --> 00:17:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Although chemistry is definitely part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what produces it.</v>

364
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.300
<v Speaker 2>There's subtle things that attract </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to one another that are way below</v>

365
00:17:13.301 --> 00:17:15.820
<v Speaker 2>the level of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

366
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:21.120
<v Speaker 2>women don't like the older of men who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have rh blood factors,</v>

367
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.980
<v Speaker 2>who if they had children with would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to produce a stillborn infant.</v>

368
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.670
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely a category of </v>
<v Speaker 1>match.com</v>

369
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange though,</v>

370
00:17:33.121 --> 00:17:37.200
<v Speaker 1>because you even know that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

371
00:17:37.201 --> 00:17:37.921
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:40.110
<v Speaker 1>by older apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

373
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all wearing cologne.</v>

374
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.503
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then it would depend on what type </v>

375
00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 1>of colonias are h what was the smell is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a strange</v>

376
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.513
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very deeply tied to very </v>

377
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 2>profound emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including memory.</v>

378
00:17:55.591 --> 00:18:00.591
<v Speaker 2>And so you find people attractive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons that you can't always determine.</v>

379
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.500
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

380
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:05.363
<v Speaker 2>that was part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've always found her very </v>

381
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 2>attractive in that continues and I liked</v>
<v Speaker 2>her combativeness you know,</v>

382
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 2>like I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want someone,</v>

383
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.283
<v Speaker 2>I think in a relationship that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>spar with and it's partly because you </v>

384
00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:27.981
<v Speaker 2>have hard problems to solve and if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that you're with isn't willing to</v>

385
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.603
<v Speaker 2>put forward their opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you only have half the cognitive </v>

386
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:35.810
<v Speaker 2>power that you would otherwise have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

387
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully you find someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly different from you,</v>

388
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:40.913
<v Speaker 2>like not so different that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate and you have to be careful </v>

389
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:45.450
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But interestingly different.</v>

390
00:18:45.451 --> 00:18:46.284
<v Speaker 2>And then hopefully they have the ability</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the will to express their opinion </v>

391
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.050
<v Speaker 2>and then all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's,</v>

392
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then your interest stays heightened</v>

393
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.540
<v Speaker 2>and there has to be that tension in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

394
00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:58.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think,</v>

395
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.480
<v Speaker 2>well I want to get along perfectly with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my partner.</v>

396
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

397
00:19:03.751 --> 00:19:05.160
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably don't.</v>

398
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.520
<v Speaker 2>You just get bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd go looking for trouble.</v>

399
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And so you want it a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble in the relationship and a little</v>

400
00:19:11.911 --> 00:19:14.420
<v Speaker 2>bit of mystery and a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>combativeness and,</v>

401
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.270
<v Speaker 2>and the ability to exchange opinions </v>
<v Speaker 2>forthrightly and,</v>

402
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.460
<v Speaker 2>and I trust her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a huge element.</v>

403
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

404
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:27.690
<v Speaker 2>when we finally did decide to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>together permanently,</v>

405
00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:30.530
<v Speaker 2>we're both in our later twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

406
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.540
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I had learned by </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point and insisted to her about was</v>

407
00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:41.451
<v Speaker 2>that we had to tell each other the truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she took to that wholeheartedly,</v>

408
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.270
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

409
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.050
<v Speaker 2>for better and for worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because truths can be harsh.</v>

410
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Does that include like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this,</v>

411
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:51.774
<v Speaker 1>how fit?</v>

412
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:54.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

413
00:19:54.391 --> 00:19:55.224
<v Speaker 2>the truthful answer to that is I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer questions that are likely to get </v>

414
00:19:57.361 --> 00:19:58.194
<v Speaker 2>me in trouble.</v>

415
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a son who will answer </v>

416
00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.320
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's infuriating.</v>

417
00:20:05.321 --> 00:20:07.300
<v Speaker 1>But then I realized if you want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

418
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.220
<v Speaker 1>talk to Tamworth telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

419
00:20:09.221 --> 00:20:10.180
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

420
00:20:10.181 --> 00:20:11.014
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to know truth is empowering </v>

421
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.353
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tellers are charismatic and he never </v>

422
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.940
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both my sons are like brutally honest,</v>

423
00:20:18.941 --> 00:20:20.510
<v Speaker 1>which is disconcerting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

424
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:21.843
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that it has made them very </v>

425
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.220
<v Speaker 1>formidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

426
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:32.410
<v Speaker 1>and because of the people trust them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the friendships and just,</v>

427
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.800
<v Speaker 1>it gives them a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've written a lot about that.</v>

428
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

429
00:20:35.681 --> 00:20:37.780
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I tell my wife that she looks good in</v>

430
00:20:37.781 --> 00:20:39.250
<v Speaker 2>that outfit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knows that I mean it.</v>

431
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's some utility.</v>

432
00:20:41.321 --> 00:20:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

433
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.410
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're silent and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't answer questions that she,</v>

434
00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 1>she goes and change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well sometimes sometimes know,</v>

435
00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>she'll say,</v>

436
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you like this?</v>

437
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:51.810
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell her that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

438
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.820
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't necessarily make her </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy in the moment,</v>

439
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

440
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Speaker 2>but if I do say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it,</v>

441
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 2>she knows that I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

442
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I actually liked her sense of style a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

443
00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:06.520
<v Speaker 2>So it turns out that 90% of the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty easy for me to say,</v>

444
00:21:06.521 --> 00:21:08.740
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you look great and mean it.</v>

445
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.203
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

446
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:11.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a fairly harsh standard bearer to </v>

447
00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:13.564
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

448
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.750
<v Speaker 2>she's insisted that I stay in whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable physical shape I happen to be</v>

449
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:19.421
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

450
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:20.254
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was something that she's very </v>

451
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.653
<v Speaker 2>demanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that it's the same from my </v>

452
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:29.641
<v Speaker 2>side and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've been good at negotiating,</v>

453
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.450
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

454
00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:33.850
<v Speaker 2>what do you want from a partner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally?</v>

455
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want need,</v>

456
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:38.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we'll hopefully you,</v>

457
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.153
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're blessed with the fact that you </v>

458
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 2>find each other attractive and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for the relationship</v>

459
00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:49.381
<v Speaker 2>to begin or proceed or sustain itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>without that.</v>

460
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.063
<v Speaker 2>But having that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what do you want while you want </v>

461
00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:55.750
<v Speaker 2>someone that you can trust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want someone that you can build a</v>

462
00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:59.650
<v Speaker 2>view of the future with and you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that you can negotiate with?</v>

463
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:00.484
<v Speaker 2>And that's very hard to negotiate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because they have to tell you </v>

464
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:04.803
<v Speaker 2>what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to know what they want or </v>

465
00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:09.010
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to tell you what they want.</v>

466
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.920
<v Speaker 2>They have to be satisfied when they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they want,</v>

467
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:13.960
<v Speaker 2>which is also a very difficult thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage.</v>

468
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.250
<v Speaker 2>And you have to continually update that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your life goes through different</v>

469
00:22:18.251 --> 00:22:21.070
<v Speaker 2>stages and well in your attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wayne's,</v>

470
00:22:21.071 --> 00:22:26.040
<v Speaker 2>as we all know at our stage of like not </v>
<v Speaker 2>Badaliya necessarily player's health,</v>

471
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.360
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

472
00:22:28.361 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Speaker 2>but you will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you will not be 25 forever,</v>

473
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.480
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that that has to be renegotiated.</v>

474
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you have to work at that too.</v>

475
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:36.521
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

476
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:37.354
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that people also </v>

477
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:38.974
<v Speaker 2>don't understand because they tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that well that that all romantic </v>

478
00:22:44.261 --> 00:22:47.260
<v Speaker 2>interaction should be spontaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

479
00:22:47.261 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's your theory,</v>

480
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.360
<v Speaker 2>then you might as well just give up </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now if you're going to get married</v>

481
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 2>because that like the only reason you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can think that is because you don't have</v>

482
00:22:56.201 --> 00:23:00.220
<v Speaker 2>enough responsibility to make romantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>entanglement virtually impossible.</v>

483
00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 2>And what happens when you're married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you have little kids,</v>

484
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:05.500
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you both have a job,</v>

485
00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:06.334
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you're so busy that the probability </v>

486
00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:09.064
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to find time for </v>
<v Speaker 2>spontaneous mutual interaction is </v>

487
00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:15.910
<v Speaker 2>decreases to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if that's what you're hoping for,</v>

488
00:23:15.911 --> 00:23:16.744
<v Speaker 2>then you're never going to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you have to do is you have </v>

489
00:23:18.581 --> 00:23:19.870
<v Speaker 2>to make time for each other.</v>

490
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.150
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're dating,</v>

491
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're establishing a relationship,</v>

492
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 2>while you put some effort into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

493
00:23:26.681 --> 00:23:27.514
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decide that you're going to go out </v>

494
00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:31.150
<v Speaker 2>for dinner and you dress up to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree and you know,</v>

495
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:31.984
<v Speaker 2>you try to present yourself to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other in some halfways mutually </v>

496
00:23:34.601 --> 00:23:35.434
<v Speaker 2>acceptable manner and you hope that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a positive </v>

497
00:23:38.081 --> 00:23:38.914
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to find each other </v>

498
00:23:40.091 --> 00:23:40.924
<v Speaker 2>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then as people somehow think that </v>

499
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:43.863
<v Speaker 2>once they're married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the same amount of effort isn't </v>

500
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:48.080
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's wrong.</v>

501
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.393
<v Speaker 2>I would say more effort is necessary on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same front and you have to think it </v>

502
00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:54.440
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

503
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want to be bitter about the</v>

504
00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.833
<v Speaker 2>intimate element of your relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time do you have to spend </v>

505
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 2>together each week?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And My,</v>

506
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:05.683
<v Speaker 2>my rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of derived from clinical </v>

507
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:07.874
<v Speaker 2>observations is that you need to spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>90 minutes a week with your partner </v>

508
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:12.254
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

509
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.390
<v Speaker 2>And that means you're telling each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>about your life and staying in touch,</v>

510
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:18.224
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you each know what the other is </v>

511
00:24:19.401 --> 00:24:23.390
<v Speaker 2>up to and you're discussing what needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be done to keep the household running</v>

512
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:24.224
<v Speaker 2>smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're laying out some mutually </v>

513
00:24:26.271 --> 00:24:27.104
<v Speaker 2>acceptable vision of how the next week </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the next months are going to go </v>

514
00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:30.441
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

515
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:31.274
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that keeps your narratives locked </v>

516
00:24:32.691 --> 00:24:33.351
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

517
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:35.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the strands in a rope,</v>

518
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.013
<v Speaker 2>you need that for 90 minutes or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>drift apart and you need to spend </v>

519
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.490
<v Speaker 2>intimate time together at least once a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week and probably more like twice.</v>

520
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.460
<v Speaker 2>And that has to be negotiated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't negotiate it,</v>

521
00:24:46.461 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't make it a priority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it won't happen in all likelihood.</v>

522
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:51.800
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

523
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.730
<v Speaker 2>well then you don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a catastrophe because there's not</v>

524
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:57.920
<v Speaker 2>that many things in life that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

525
00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.230
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>

526
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Engaging in meaningful and pleasurable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also bonding,</v>

527
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:06.530
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you let that go,</v>

528
00:25:06.531 --> 00:25:10.610
<v Speaker 2>then well part of you dies and part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship dies.</v>

529
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:11.444
<v Speaker 2>And while then there's always the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of becoming attracted by </v>

530
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:16.040
<v Speaker 2>alternative entanglement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

531
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.800
<v Speaker 2>which you would do if you had any spirit</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

532
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.233
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the thing is if you're </v>

533
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.940
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

534
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.960
<v Speaker 2>if your relationship at home is entirely</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsatisfying sexually,</v>

535
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.390
<v Speaker 2>what are you supposed to do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

536
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.490
<v Speaker 2>He was supposed to just bear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

537
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.250
<v Speaker 2>in one way the answer is yes because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your marriage,</v>

538
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:36.550
<v Speaker 2>but another way as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

539
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.393
<v Speaker 2>that's all the fight you've got in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to just let the erotic </v>

540
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:41.354
<v Speaker 2>element of your life die and accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that goes along with that </v>

541
00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:45.614
<v Speaker 2>because you're not willing to causing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of trouble to ensure that it's </v>

542
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:51.800
<v Speaker 2>maintained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

543
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:54.830
<v Speaker 2>and we're not very good at thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things through consciously and it,</v>

544
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are bad at negotiating period.</v>

545
00:25:57.531 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 2>As far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're particularly bad.</v>

546
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:02.000
<v Speaker 2>It negotiating things that are deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>private.</v>

547
00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.120
<v Speaker 2>How much do you want your partner to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about you anyways,</v>

548
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.673
<v Speaker 2>it takes a lot of trust to have a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about what you need and </v>

549
00:26:10.731 --> 00:26:11.564
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

550
00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Now you have it in the press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People read that you are,</v>

551
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a following of young men.</v>

552
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.593
<v Speaker 1>And I went to hear your lecture in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington DC and there were a lot of </v>

553
00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:29.920
<v Speaker 1>women there and your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

554
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:31.483
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men don't buy books that often compared </v>

555
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:33.914
<v Speaker 1>to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm presuming you have a lot of </v>

556
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:36.350
<v Speaker 1>female readers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I found it,</v>

557
00:26:36.351 --> 00:26:36.981
<v Speaker 1>Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danielle,</v>

558
00:26:36.981 --> 00:26:41.981
<v Speaker 1>and I found it completely readable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't a ribbon for men.</v>

559
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one.</v>

560
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.270
<v Speaker 1>So you have more like a delusional</v>

561
00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.880
<v Speaker 2>desire on the part of the radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>leftists that the only people that could</v>

562
00:26:48.881 --> 00:26:51.250
<v Speaker 2>possibly be attracted to me or angry </v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

563
00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.293
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be better if they were angry young </v>

564
00:26:53.621 --> 00:26:54.580
<v Speaker 2>white men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

565
00:26:54.581 --> 00:26:56.020
<v Speaker 2>because then that fits the narrative.</v>

566
00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.590
<v Speaker 1>But you have a diverse audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a diverse following,</v>

567
00:26:59.591 --> 00:27:02.890
<v Speaker 1>including many women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're also not particularly angry.</v>

568
00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to 200 fusing the anchor.</v>

569
00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:08.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the point of your book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping angry,</v>

570
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:09.500
<v Speaker 1>stomping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resent.</v>

571
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.121
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

572
00:27:10.121 --> 00:27:12.670
<v Speaker 2>resentment is that that's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>crippling,</v>

573
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get resentment.</v>

574
00:27:13.781 --> 00:27:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Just zenman deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrogance.</v>

575
00:27:16.421 --> 00:27:17.254
<v Speaker 2>That's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing another book and one of the </v>

576
00:27:18.611 --> 00:27:23.611
<v Speaker 2>rules is don't allow yourself to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentful,</v>

577
00:27:23.921 --> 00:27:24.970
<v Speaker 2>deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deceitful,</v>

578
00:27:24.971 --> 00:27:27.190
<v Speaker 2>and arrogant or those two things </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

579
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.260
<v Speaker 2>But it could be red.</v>

580
00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

581
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.180
<v Speaker 1>that's supposed to be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

582
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.810
<v Speaker 2>there's been 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

583
00:27:35.811 --> 00:27:36.644
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to the lectures and there hasn't </v>

584
00:27:37.611 --> 00:27:39.320
<v Speaker 2>been a single negative incident.</v>

585
00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:40.323
<v Speaker 1>Not One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I find fascinating is that </v>

586
00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I found you early on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I had no idea you were just that.</v>

587
00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.310
<v Speaker 1>It was like butch cassidy and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sundance kid.</v>

588
00:27:51.311 --> 00:27:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Like who is that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is that guy?</v>

589
00:27:53.591 --> 00:27:54.424
<v Speaker 1>Like you were pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were covering a lot of the same </v>

590
00:27:57.581 --> 00:27:58.960
<v Speaker 1>topics later on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

591
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

592
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out who you were.</v>

593
00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.270
<v Speaker 1>What is astonishing to me is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this amazing,</v>

594
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.573
<v Speaker 1>it just split between the positivity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your audience and diversity of your </v>

595
00:28:13.121 --> 00:28:13.954
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

596
00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.770
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual content of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>

597
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.950
<v Speaker 1>And then you get with a snarky </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist with an agenda,</v>

598
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.480
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not mentioning names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

599
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe no,</v>

600
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.980
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this young woman from Gq and it was just</v>

601
00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.600
<v Speaker 1>me on site and I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was just like few lady.</v>

602
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

603
00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:37.840
<v Speaker 1>For,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't want to blame the BBC,</v>

604
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.780
<v Speaker 1>it was two or a saint and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she seemed,</v>

605
00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as often she seemed intelligent and</v>

606
00:28:44.411 --> 00:28:45.244
<v Speaker 1>capable of insight up to a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's almost as if something gets </v>

607
00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:53.910
<v Speaker 1>seized her mind and show you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had something happen.</v>

608
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I think people enjoy the meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polyols it.</v>

609
00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Can you a Polya says that a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

610
00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:05.010
<v Speaker 1>some of our most talented young women </v>
<v Speaker 1>are incapable because of this idea.</v>

611
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just an openness to,</v>

612
00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.623
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were saying completely like </v>

613
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.840
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

614
00:29:13.841 --> 00:29:18.400
<v Speaker 1>original things even to me who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied these topics and wow.</v>

615
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.260
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

616
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was quite the day.</v>

617
00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:22.410
<v Speaker 2>So I went to Baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You survived.</v>

618
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.933
<v Speaker 2>It made me think a lot that day because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I went there and I have to go out of my </v>

619
00:29:28.501 --> 00:29:30.540
<v Speaker 2>way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm complaining,</v>

620
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:33.060
<v Speaker 2>but there's a reason for saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

621
00:29:33.061 --> 00:29:34.990
<v Speaker 2>so I go up there in Baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

622
00:29:34.991 --> 00:29:36.850
<v Speaker 2>well I was talking in Baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

623
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where's the aquarium?</v>

624
00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.693
<v Speaker 2>And I showed up to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the hotel room where this was all </v>

625
00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:44.890
<v Speaker 2>occurring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what you expect,</v>

626
00:29:44.891 --> 00:29:48.130
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even from journalists who aren't,</v>

627
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are more of the attack dog variety </v>

628
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:51.964
<v Speaker 2>or who may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't positively predisposed to </v>

629
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.143
<v Speaker 2>ideologically or personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you expect a certain modicum of </v>

630
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 2>professional politeness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

631
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.383
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

632
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to be there.</v>

633
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:07.240
<v Speaker 2>And you came and you accepted an </v>
<v Speaker 2>invitation and all of that.</v>

634
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:09.910
<v Speaker 2>And so even with the channel for </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists,</v>

635
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Kathy Newman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

636
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.950
<v Speaker 2>she was quite polite and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forthcoming in the,</v>

637
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.860
<v Speaker 2>in the green room before the interview.</v>

638
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 2>So she would have had at least that </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional persona,</v>

639
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:23.170
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not nothing right there.</v>

640
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.033
<v Speaker 2>There's something to be said for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for going through the motions </v>

641
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.380
<v Speaker 2>professionally in an inappropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>

642
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.190
<v Speaker 2>But when I walked into the hotel room in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore,</v>

643
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:34.024
<v Speaker 2>it was obvious that this interviewer had</v>
<v Speaker 2>already made up her mind about me 100% </v>

644
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:41.230
<v Speaker 2>and that she was absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

645
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:45.010
<v Speaker 2>negatively predisposed to me with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal animus.</v>

646
00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.913
<v Speaker 2>Animus is exactly the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was about a half an hour </v>

647
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.000
<v Speaker 2>photography session because it was Gq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was in that atmosphere.</v>

648
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:54.853
<v Speaker 2>The photographers were fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in that atmosphere for about 45 </v>

649
00:30:57.311 --> 00:31:01.330
<v Speaker 2>minutes before we started to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of the reason that I'm so,</v>

650
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as calm during that interview is</v>

651
00:31:06.341 --> 00:31:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I usually am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bit harsher.</v>

652
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:10.210
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

653
00:31:10.211 --> 00:31:13.530
<v Speaker 2>it just started off instantly combative </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

654
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.060
<v Speaker 2>and what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I should have done,</v>

655
00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:17.980
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

656
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:18.963
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to be awake enough to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things properly and to end the </v>

657
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:26.140
<v Speaker 2>interview progressed fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although by the end of it,</v>

658
00:31:26.141 --> 00:31:26.974
<v Speaker 2>I thought that I had maybe done enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews for a while because I didn't </v>

659
00:31:29.441 --> 00:31:34.090
<v Speaker 2>think I had regulated my temper as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>during that interview as I might've,</v>

660
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.290
<v Speaker 2>I was harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

661
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Well for the first two minutes,</v>

662
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.943
<v Speaker 3>so you were getting at and then she </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought up a question about anger and I </v>

663
00:31:41.041 --> 00:31:44.790
<v Speaker 3>just saw you kind of adjust and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>after that it was smooth.</v>

664
00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Well that's good because it was touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

665
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

666
00:31:47.991 --> 00:31:48.741
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

667
00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:50.530
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're running out of patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you,</v>

668
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:51.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's time to dial back on the </v>

669
00:31:52.671 --> 00:31:53.504
<v Speaker 2>interviews because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had many interviews like that and </v>

670
00:31:56.001 --> 00:31:58.520
<v Speaker 2>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find them like,</v>

671
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.240
<v Speaker 2>and it takes me like three days to weeks</v>

672
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.430
<v Speaker 3>and then you start thinking of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what I should have said,</v>

673
00:32:03.431 --> 00:32:05.130
<v Speaker 3>I should have said that and I drive </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself mad.</v>

674
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you did very well.</v>

675
00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:07.534
<v Speaker 3>But it's so interesting that what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>told me was how parochial she was and </v>

676
00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:16.930
<v Speaker 3>she lives in her own little world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Stina isn't that more a little bit about</v>

677
00:32:16.931 --> 00:32:19.990
<v Speaker 3>the ideology of our time and Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you encountered this everywhere.</v>

678
00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 3>And when I used to write about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>wisely,</v>

679
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would encounter it.</v>

680
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.233
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of the issue is that you </v>

681
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:32.890
<v Speaker 3>will acknowledge that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between the sexes.</v>

682
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.930
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that's a hell of a no,</v>

683
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 3>that's a heresy because when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading your book,</v>

684
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.843
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing about it that is anti </v>

685
00:32:46.371 --> 00:32:47.204
<v Speaker 3>female affecting you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do a lot of examination of the Adam </v>

686
00:32:50.061 --> 00:32:53.390
<v Speaker 3>and Eve story and you have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful passage about like,</v>

687
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.433
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam being the originally aggrieved man </v>

688
00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:56.570
<v Speaker 3>who</v>

689
00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:01.570
<v Speaker 5>throws the woman under the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The original fault you made her.</v>

690
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's really funny.</v>

691
00:33:06.141 --> 00:33:07.340
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

692
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:08.650
<v Speaker 5>so there's nothing in there</v>

693
00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:09.520
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

694
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.620
<v Speaker 3>the rules such as they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

695
00:33:11.621 --> 00:33:15.280
<v Speaker 3>they seem very common sensical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could apply to anyone.</v>

696
00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:20.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so is that a fair surmise of why you get</v>

697
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.790
<v Speaker 3>so attacked?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

698
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.633
<v Speaker 3>that just the very fact that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to speak about the sexes as </v>

699
00:33:26.321 --> 00:33:28.840
<v Speaker 3>being not unequal but different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Funny.</v>

700
00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

701
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

702
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's part of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a threat there.</v>

703
00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.030
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that happen when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in Scandinavia,</v>

704
00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.190
<v Speaker 2>I just wrote a column about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

705
00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was interesting being in Scandinavia,</v>

706
00:33:44.891 --> 00:33:45.724
<v Speaker 2>especially in Sweden because they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed the equality of opportunity </v>

707
00:33:49.001 --> 00:33:51.310
<v Speaker 2>doctrine farther than any other country.</v>

708
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.233
<v Speaker 3>They invented it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It almost started there like in the UN </v>

709
00:33:54.821 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 3>and the original,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

710
00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.930
<v Speaker 3>the charter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Swedes were there and they,</v>

711
00:33:58.931 --> 00:33:59.764
<v Speaker 3>they've never given</v>

712
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.681
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

713
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:01.514
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the week that I was there was the </v>

714
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 2>same week that two articles were </v>
<v Speaker 2>published on gender differences,</v>

715
00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:10.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

716
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.013
<v Speaker 2>in temperament and in interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the biggest sex differences that we </v>

717
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:20.210
<v Speaker 2>know of that aren't morphological are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>

718
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.860
<v Speaker 2>So women are more interested in people </v>
<v Speaker 2>by and large and men are more interested</v>

719
00:34:24.861 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 2>in things by and large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the difference is actually large.</v>

720
00:34:28.131 --> 00:34:32.150
<v Speaker 2>It's one standard deviation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that means if you're a man,</v>

721
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.793
<v Speaker 2>you would have to be more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>people than 85% of men to be as </v>

722
00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:41.270
<v Speaker 2>interested as 50% of women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a woman,</v>

723
00:34:41.271 --> 00:34:42.104
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>things than 85% of women to be as </v>

724
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:46.664
<v Speaker 2>interested as the 50th percentile male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the difference is actually quite </v>

725
00:34:50.061 --> 00:34:50.894
<v Speaker 2>substantial and it's certainly large </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to drive occupational choice </v>

726
00:34:54.741 --> 00:34:55.574
<v Speaker 2>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is does it explains a lot about </v>

727
00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.610
<v Speaker 2>the configuration of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace?</v>

728
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:01.581
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

729
00:35:01.581 --> 00:35:02.414
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're approaching approaching parody in </v>

730
00:35:04.461 --> 00:35:07.940
<v Speaker 2>terms of workplace overall workplace </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution of men and women,</v>

731
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.760
<v Speaker 2>but there's massive differences in </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupational choice.</v>

732
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Like it's very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

733
00:35:12.471 --> 00:35:13.304
<v Speaker 2>to go to the website of the u s labor </v>
<v Speaker 2>department and look at male and female </v>

734
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:20.840
<v Speaker 2>dominated industries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

735
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:21.703
<v Speaker 2>there's the top 10 male dominated </v>
<v Speaker 2>industries have basically zero women in </v>

736
00:35:26.511 --> 00:35:27.320
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

737
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.790
<v Speaker 2>brick layers like</v>

738
00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.400
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people free zones according to</v>

739
00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Camille Paglia that you find you're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of men in the people free zones.</v>

740
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

741
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:35.991
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

742
00:35:35.991 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 3>And the women are in ask a group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>women</v>

743
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.353
<v Speaker 2>and men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather spend the next three </v>

744
00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:42.054
<v Speaker 2>weeks taking a part of machine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it together or helping a group </v>

745
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:49.110
<v Speaker 2>of people work out their problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pool of people who want to do them.</v>

746
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:50.063
<v Speaker 2>It's just far more men than women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more men and women dominated </v>

747
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.970
<v Speaker 2>industries than there are women and men </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated industries at the extreme.</v>

748
00:35:56.971 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would that be like nursing?</v>

749
00:35:59.041 --> 00:36:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Nursing is way more male nurses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The male nurses,</v>

750
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I've studied these male nurses and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

751
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

752
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:11.670
<v Speaker 2>gender activists are upset because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>earn more than women.</v>

753
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.500
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

754
00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.423
<v Speaker 2>a professor of nursing at University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania tried to find out why and </v>

755
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:22.370
<v Speaker 2>she found out they immediately find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the best paying field subfield.</v>

756
00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:24.840
<v Speaker 2>So they go into like nurse </v>
<v Speaker 2>anesthesiology,</v>

757
00:36:24.841 --> 00:36:27.660
<v Speaker 2>it pays a lot more than men are there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and disproportionate number.</v>

758
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.970
<v Speaker 2>And they're willing to work and cry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

759
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.750
<v Speaker 2>insane hours.</v>

760
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.970
<v Speaker 2>They're far more willing to move to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher,</v>

761
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:34.290
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Farrell phone with,</v>

762
00:36:34.291 --> 00:36:37.080
<v Speaker 2>with gender differences is that men are </v>
<v Speaker 2>more willing to move.</v>

763
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're more willing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're willing to call me yours.</v>

764
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.600
<v Speaker 2>They're more willing to to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work outside.</v>

765
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.970
<v Speaker 2>They're more willing to take on </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous tasks.</v>

766
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 2>They're more likely to work in scalable </v>
<v Speaker 2>industries.</v>

767
00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.890
<v Speaker 2>So we'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't scale personal care.</v>

768
00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:51.030
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

769
00:36:51.031 --> 00:36:51.864
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're much less likely to work part </v>

770
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they have small businesses,</v>

771
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:56.484
<v Speaker 2>they're much more likely to work full </v>
<v Speaker 2>time in the small business rather than </v>

772
00:36:58.441 --> 00:36:59.274
<v Speaker 2>this than part time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean women have the reasons to </v>

773
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:02.574
<v Speaker 2>want to work part time and feral also </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed out that if you work 10% longer </v>

774
00:37:06.781 --> 00:37:08.760
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make 40% more money.</v>

775
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:09.763
<v Speaker 2>A non linear nonlinear return on </v>
<v Speaker 2>overtime had something that's really </v>

776
00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:13.074
<v Speaker 2>useful to know in terms of your career </v>
<v Speaker 2>to an employer that have somewhat also </v>

777
00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 2>marks you out.</v>

778
00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.253
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you have 10 employees and </v>

779
00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:22.050
<v Speaker 2>they're all doing a reasonable job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

780
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.033
<v Speaker 2>but one of them is working an extra half</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour a day or 45 minutes a day and </v>

781
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:26.724
<v Speaker 2>you can observe that every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that gives them an edge with </v>

782
00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:31.350
<v Speaker 2>regards to potential promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

783
00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:33.870
<v Speaker 2>and the return on those edges is </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonlinear.</v>

784
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.213
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went to Scandinavia and it was the </v>

785
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:38.843
<v Speaker 2>same week that two studies were released</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing what had already been </v>

786
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:47.631
<v Speaker 2>established beyond a shadow of a doubt </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the personality differences between</v>

787
00:37:47.731 --> 00:37:48.564
<v Speaker 2>men and women and the differences in </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest as well actually get bigger as </v>

788
00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:56.290
<v Speaker 2>your society gets richer and as it gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>more egalitarian and,</v>

789
00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:57.403
<v Speaker 2>and not just a little bit either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing that's so </v>

790
00:37:59.221 --> 00:38:00.054
<v Speaker 2>interesting is you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the effect is it's the opposite of </v>

791
00:38:03.361 --> 00:38:05.730
<v Speaker 2>what the social constructionists would </v>
<v Speaker 2>predict first of all.</v>

792
00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:06.564
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first thing to point out </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's not only that their hypothesis </v>

793
00:38:09.571 --> 00:38:13.750
<v Speaker 2>wasn't supported,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was decidedly refuted and,</v>

794
00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.690
<v Speaker 2>and none of them have come to terms with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

795
00:38:15.691 --> 00:38:16.320
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

796
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.420
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a small effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

797
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.333
<v Speaker 2>the difference between personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>between men and women in Scandinavia is </v>

798
00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:26.880
<v Speaker 2>a lot larger than it is in Noni.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Galitary and contract can rural Botswana</v>

799
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.770
<v Speaker 2>true in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The richer the democratic your household</v>

800
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.810
<v Speaker 2>demographic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your household,</v>

801
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 2>the more likely the woman to take</v>

802
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.590
<v Speaker 3>town timeout and be at home with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

803
00:38:37.591 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because she can afford,</v>

804
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 3>she can afford to do it and she can </v>
<v Speaker 3>afford to major in odd,</v>

805
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low paying fields like a,</v>

806
00:38:44.741 --> 00:38:46.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminists dance therapy</v>

807
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.830
<v Speaker 2>you use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see to,</v>

808
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.850
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting I think is that,</v>

809
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:55.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this idea that mate,</v>

810
00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.140
<v Speaker 2>that marriage is a patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution,</v>

811
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:58.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's primarily put there for the,</v>

812
00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.790
<v Speaker 2>for the utility of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the mail and think,</v>

813
00:39:01.791 --> 00:39:04.340
<v Speaker 2>well like I think that's complete bloody</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubbish.</v>

814
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.620
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think there's any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>to support it at all.</v>

815
00:39:06.621 --> 00:39:08.690
<v Speaker 2>But I think the best counter evidence is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

816
00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>

817
00:39:10.161 --> 00:39:10.994
<v Speaker 2>then rich people shouldn't be getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>married because they don't have to </v>

818
00:39:14.391 --> 00:39:17.360
<v Speaker 2>oppress themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the truth of the matter is,</v>

819
00:39:17.361 --> 00:39:19.850
<v Speaker 2>is that the higher your demographic </v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

820
00:39:19.851 --> 00:39:23.670
<v Speaker 2>the more likely you are to be married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So marriage has fallen apart among,</v>

821
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.603
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the more likely the wife is staying </v>

822
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:27.730
<v Speaker 3>home and not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

823
00:39:27.731 --> 00:39:30.520
<v Speaker 3>she has all sorts of pursuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's not well,</v>

824
00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:31.780
<v Speaker 3>there's an old saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone,</v>

825
00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:33.970
<v Speaker 3>any woman who marries for money earns </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

826
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now let me just,</v>

827
00:39:37.001 --> 00:39:37.834
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where you might get in a little </v>

828
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:39.454
<v Speaker 3>trouble because in your book you call </v>
<v Speaker 3>men order and women chaos and you say </v>

829
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.973
<v Speaker 3>order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the known appears symbolically </v>

830
00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:47.434
<v Speaker 3>associated with masculinity and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Eternal Feminine is also the </v>

831
00:39:51.011 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Speaker 3>crushing force of sexual selection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

832
00:39:52.961 --> 00:39:54.270
<v Speaker 3>What's up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

833
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.590
<v Speaker 3>We chaotic chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men and women,</v>

834
00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.633
<v Speaker 2>order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's masculinity and femininity </v>

835
00:40:01.551 --> 00:40:02.384
<v Speaker 2>symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what's happened fundamentally is </v>

836
00:40:05.001 --> 00:40:05.834
<v Speaker 2>that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our brains are wired for social </v>

837
00:40:09.921 --> 00:40:10.754
<v Speaker 2>cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're not natural scientists were </v>

838
00:40:13.821 --> 00:40:16.450
<v Speaker 2>natural sociologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be a better,</v>

839
00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.860
<v Speaker 2>even though I shutter to think that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be true,</v>

840
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:21.050
<v Speaker 2>especially given the stage associates as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

841
00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:21.770
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

842
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Triggering or maybe rick or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or may him or maybe we're more,</v>

843
00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:28.140
<v Speaker 2>we're more naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

844
00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:29.413
<v Speaker 2>people who observe through the lens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction and that what we see as the </v>

845
00:40:32.271 --> 00:40:37.271
<v Speaker 2>world as characterized and the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's made out of men and women</v>

846
00:40:38.391 --> 00:40:42.770
<v Speaker 2>and children and those seem to be our </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental cognitive categories.</v>

847
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>femininity and,</v>

848
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:45.543
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

849
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:46.463
<v Speaker 2>and then the category of children and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those categories have expanded to take </v>

850
00:40:51.471 --> 00:40:56.471
<v Speaker 2>on connotations outside of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of pure person perception.</v>

851
00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.000
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

852
00:40:59.001 --> 00:40:59.834
<v Speaker 2>it's for this reason that if you go to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and then maybe it's a Disney </v>

853
00:41:02.691 --> 00:41:03.524
<v Speaker 2>animated movie and I like to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>those because they draw on a very deep </v>

854
00:41:06.921 --> 00:41:07.754
<v Speaker 2>symbolic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's perfectly reasonable to see a </v>

855
00:41:10.011 --> 00:41:13.610
<v Speaker 2>witch that lives in a swamp because </v>
<v Speaker 2>those go together.</v>

856
00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.360
<v Speaker 2>Like it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

857
00:41:15.361 --> 00:41:18.170
<v Speaker 2>the which doesn't live in a gleaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>chrome high rise,</v>

858
00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she lives in a swamp cause that's a </v>

859
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe an a shock for her room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she could just fly up.</v>

860
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.863
<v Speaker 2>Well that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the high rise would be </v>

861
00:41:25.161 --> 00:41:25.994
<v Speaker 2>better for the brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can take off if you could take off </v>

862
00:41:28.161 --> 00:41:30.760
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are categories of,</v>

863
00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.820
<v Speaker 2>of symbolic association that are natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the way we think.</v>

864
00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:38.660
<v Speaker 2>And the fundamental elements of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories seem to be gendered.</v>

865
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.110
<v Speaker 2>And so this is partly why I make </v>
<v Speaker 2>reference to Taoism,</v>

866
00:41:42.111 --> 00:41:42.944
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for the Dow is the world is made out </v>

867
00:41:44.631 --> 00:41:49.370
<v Speaker 2>of chaos and order and chaos is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain that you don't understand.</v>

868
00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:54.140
<v Speaker 2>And that emerges unpredictably but also </v>
<v Speaker 2>the domain from which new forms emerge,</v>

869
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:55.723
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's from novelty that the new </v>

870
00:41:57.291 --> 00:41:58.124
<v Speaker 2>emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the fundamental association </v>

871
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:01.034
<v Speaker 2>between femininity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it chaos is the association between </v>

872
00:42:03.831 --> 00:42:06.170
<v Speaker 2>what's unexpected and novel and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>new.</v>

873
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Because new forms emerge from chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that chaos is,</v>

874
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.510
<v Speaker 2>is bad in order is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's,</v>

875
00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:15.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

876
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 2>both have their pathologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both have their pathology.</v>

877
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:19.251
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

878
00:42:19.251 --> 00:42:20.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what you're looking for,</v>

879
00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.573
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the book concentrates on above </v>

880
00:42:23.901 --> 00:42:24.734
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you're looking constantly to </v>

881
00:42:25.971 --> 00:42:27.710
<v Speaker 2>find the balance between those two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

882
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.260
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>formerly speaking,</v>

883
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.000
<v Speaker 2>the domain of order is that place that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are with.</v>

884
00:42:34.001 --> 00:42:36.650
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing is producing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>results that you want,</v>

885
00:42:36.651 --> 00:42:39.020
<v Speaker 2>who have produced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine,</v>

886
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 2>imagine you think about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>preconditions for not being anxious.</v>

887
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:44.533
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the preconditions are that you're </v>

888
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:48.080
<v Speaker 2>constantly making predictions about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen next.</v>

889
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:52.880
<v Speaker 2>And those predictions are tied tightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your behavioral output.</v>

890
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.330
<v Speaker 2>So you act in a certain way and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>presume that a certain thing is going to</v>

891
00:42:56.331 --> 00:43:00.050
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if your actions produced the results</v>

892
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:00.884
<v Speaker 2>that you desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you assume that you know where you </v>

893
00:43:02.931 --> 00:43:03.764
<v Speaker 2>are and you know what you're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your plan is intact and that the </v>

894
00:43:06.021 --> 00:43:09.110
<v Speaker 2>environment is secure and that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>your anxiety under control.</v>

895
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 2>That's order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

896
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.093
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're at a party and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know anybody and you tell a joke and </v>

897
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:19.730
<v Speaker 2>everybody looks at you like what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said was not only not funny,</v>

898
00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:20.564
<v Speaker 2>but also downright offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden you've moved </v>

899
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:24.554
<v Speaker 2>from the domain of order into the domain</v>
<v Speaker 2>of chaos because you thought you were </v>

900
00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:29.480
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and you thought you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>

901
00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:30.314
<v Speaker 2>And you thought you were with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were of a certain type and you got </v>

902
00:43:33.741 --> 00:43:34.574
<v Speaker 2>all that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it causes the guessing is going </v>

903
00:43:37.521 --> 00:43:39.940
<v Speaker 2>to be the woman who says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that really open.</v>

904
00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not suggesting that it probably is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nevermind,</v>

905
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.740
<v Speaker 2>but women are also more sensitive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion,</v>

906
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:49.683
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is some slightly higher </v>

907
00:43:50.991 --> 00:43:51.824
<v Speaker 2>probability that that might be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I think women are also </v>

908
00:43:54.711 --> 00:43:55.544
<v Speaker 2>associated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in men's imaginations with </v>

909
00:43:57.321 --> 00:43:58.154
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the chaotic domain say </v>

910
00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:03.950
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to culture because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually selective.</v>

911
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.130
<v Speaker 2>So you gotta think what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is nature?</v>

912
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.190
<v Speaker 2>When we have that as a cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>category,</v>

913
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think of the natural world,</v>

914
00:44:11.661 --> 00:44:14.510
<v Speaker 2>we think of nature versus culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fundamental opposition.</v>

915
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.780
<v Speaker 2>What is nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

916
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.610
<v Speaker 2>nature is trees and landscapes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and all of that.</v>

917
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.670
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't what nature fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

918
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Nature fundamentally is that which </v>
<v Speaker 2>selects from a genetic perspective,</v>

919
00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:29.413
<v Speaker 2>that's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental definition of </v>

920
00:44:31.051 --> 00:44:31.884
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is the case that human females </v>

921
00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:35.334
<v Speaker 2>are sexually selective and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a major component of human </v>

922
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:40.400
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

923
00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.260
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

924
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:48.500
<v Speaker 2>is that the reason we diverged from </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees 8 million years ago,</v>

925
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:50.394
<v Speaker 2>7 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is at least in part because of the </v>

926
00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:54.984
<v Speaker 2>differences between sexual selectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>between female humans and female </v>

927
00:44:59.491 --> 00:45:00.324
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Female chimpanzees are more likely to </v>

928
00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:03.534
<v Speaker 2>have offspring from dominant males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because of their sexual </v>

929
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:08.124
<v Speaker 2>selectivities.</v>

930
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.720
<v Speaker 2>So a female chimpanzee has periods of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fertility that are marked by physical,</v>

931
00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by observable physiological changes,</v>

932
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.740
<v Speaker 2>not the case with human females.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human female ovulation is,</v>

933
00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:20.723
<v Speaker 2>is concealed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a very profound biological </v>

934
00:45:23.731 --> 00:45:26.100
<v Speaker 2>difference between human females and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees.</v>

935
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:29.010
<v Speaker 2>And the chimpanzee females will mate </v>
<v Speaker 2>with any male,</v>

936
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.860
<v Speaker 2>but the dominant males chased the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordinate males away.</v>

937
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.040
<v Speaker 2>But human females are sexually </v>
<v Speaker 2>selective.</v>

938
00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:37.110
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a trivial fact.</v>

939
00:45:37.111 --> 00:45:41.940
<v Speaker 2>So you have twice as many female </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors as male ancestors.</v>

940
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.291
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

941
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:44.820
<v Speaker 2>how can that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

942
00:45:44.821 --> 00:45:45.654
<v Speaker 2>imagine that on average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single human female has had one </v>

943
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:50.910
<v Speaker 2>child throughout the entire course of </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

944
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 2>which is approximately correct by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

945
00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.090
<v Speaker 2>Then imagine that half of the men had </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero and the other half had to.</v>

946
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's roughly the case.</v>

947
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.820
<v Speaker 2>So half of males historically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been reproductive disasters.</v>

948
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.000
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>female sexual subjectivity.</v>

949
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.960
<v Speaker 2>So it is actually the case that female </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are nature.</v>

950
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:13.853
<v Speaker 2>It's not only that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're associated with nature </v>

951
00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:18.990
<v Speaker 2>symbolically as far as rep production is</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

952
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.710
<v Speaker 2>They are the force of nature that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>the selection.</v>

953
00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.140
<v Speaker 2>And so their nature in the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental way,</v>

954
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:29.400
<v Speaker 2>and there is a chaotic element of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in relationship to men and also</v>

955
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:33.000
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of the um,</v>

956
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.300
<v Speaker 2>female on female competition is </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

957
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.930
<v Speaker 2>That's chaotic for the right to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually selective,</v>

958
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only with regards to men,</v>

959
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:43.463
<v Speaker 2>which drives a lot of politicking but </v>
<v Speaker 2>also in relationship to each other </v>

960
00:46:46.111 --> 00:46:46.944
<v Speaker 2>because part of what human females do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his jockey for position in the female </v>

961
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:53.700
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy for the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

962
00:46:53.701 --> 00:46:56.520
<v Speaker 2>which is the woman who gets to be most </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually selective.</v>

963
00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.430
<v Speaker 2>And so that drives female female </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

964
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:01.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's a different dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

965
00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:02.423
<v Speaker 2>there's similarities between female </v>
<v Speaker 2>female competition and male male </v>

966
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:05.754
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are also differences and </v>

967
00:47:07.051 --> 00:47:08.670
<v Speaker 2>they're pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So men,</v>

968
00:47:08.671 --> 00:47:10.110
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

969
00:47:10.111 --> 00:47:11.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men are more likely to compete,</v>

970
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:12.413
<v Speaker 2>compete for socioeconomic status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly because that drives </v>

971
00:47:15.391 --> 00:47:16.224
<v Speaker 2>female mate choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the correlation for men between </v>

972
00:47:18.361 --> 00:47:22.440
<v Speaker 2>socioeconomic status and sexual success </v>
<v Speaker 2>is about 0.6.</v>

973
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:25.440
<v Speaker 2>And for women it's zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>

974
00:47:25.441 --> 00:47:27.150
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually slightly negative.</v>

975
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a huge difference.</v>

976
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.213
<v Speaker 2>Men and women.</v>

977
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.050
<v Speaker 1>But do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the anthropologists?</v>

978
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Hrdy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>h,</v>

979
00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:34.540
<v Speaker 1>r,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d y,</v>

980
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:35.423
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's like my favorite feminist </v>

981
00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:37.534
<v Speaker 1>theorist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although she would say I'm a theorist </v>

982
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:44.460
<v Speaker 1>who happens to be a feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she studied primate behavior and she</v>

983
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:46.930
<v Speaker 1>watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she looked at the women very care.</v>

984
00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.980
<v Speaker 1>They're the females in not with walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>very carefully and looked at it,</v>

985
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees and gazelles and,</v>

986
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:55.640
<v Speaker 1>and found that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

987
00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:01.410
<v Speaker 1>the female initially like male </v>
<v Speaker 1>primatologist would look and say,</v>

988
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:03.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the females,</v>

989
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:06.430
<v Speaker 1>the males are dominant and the females </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so cooperative.</v>

990
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.353
<v Speaker 1>She looked more carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the females weren't exactly </v>

991
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:10.714
<v Speaker 1>cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they would pass around their </v>

992
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.020
<v Speaker 1>infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their baby,</v>

993
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they were and would find it.</v>

994
00:48:17.551 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 1>And so the male primatology will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

995
00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:22.120
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so kind.</v>

996
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And caring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She found out that when it was not your,</v>

997
00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:27.003
<v Speaker 1>it was not hers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would take like little tufts of </v>

998
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:29.310
<v Speaker 1>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

999
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:31.470
<v Speaker 1>it would come out or they do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the eyes,</v>

1000
00:48:31.471 --> 00:48:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you and the baby would like be injured </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she saw all this violence.</v>

1001
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.100
<v Speaker 2>That would be true in her status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Differentiation.</v>

1002
00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.053
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much more likely that it'll happen </v>

1003
00:48:40.141 --> 00:48:42.930
<v Speaker 2>when a higher status female is taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of lower status infant.</v>

1004
00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said the great tragedy,</v>

1005
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:46.803
<v Speaker 1>well not tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had the reality of our species and </v>

1006
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:53.260
<v Speaker 1>in fact the subtitle for the book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the woman who never evolved,</v>

1007
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 1>we didn't evolve for niceness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperative.</v>

1008
00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:02.220
<v Speaker 1>There's immense competition and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to her,</v>

1009
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:03.603
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's indelibly marked in our nature to </v>

1010
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:11.830
<v Speaker 1>compete for the dominant males and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt about that.</v>

1011
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:12.820
<v Speaker 1>There's so,</v>

1012
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 2>and that seems to cross culturally as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1013
00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:16.920
<v Speaker 2>That does flatten out a little bit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning,</v>

1014
00:49:16.921 --> 00:49:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Gail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tarion societies.</v>

1015
00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of being exaggerated,</v>

1016
00:49:19.991 --> 00:49:21.460
<v Speaker 2>it does flatten to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1017
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:22.294
<v Speaker 2>So you could imagine that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological component and the cultural </v>

1018
00:49:25.001 --> 00:49:26.970
<v Speaker 2>component of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both in,</v>

1019
00:49:26.971 --> 00:49:28.300
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that case,</v>

1020
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:33.280
<v Speaker 2>if you modify the cultural component </v>
<v Speaker 2>then that seems to decrease the overall.</v>

1021
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.600
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me meet,</v>

1022
00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:36.443
<v Speaker 2>be more clear about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are less prone to mate up across </v>

1023
00:49:41.201 --> 00:49:42.034
<v Speaker 2>an up status hierarchies in Scandinavia </v>
<v Speaker 2>than they are in lessie Galitary and </v>

1024
00:49:44.911 --> 00:49:46.990
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are still prone to do it.</v>

1025
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.630
<v Speaker 2>So worldwide for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

1026
00:49:49.631 --> 00:49:50.464
<v Speaker 2>young women find men who are about four </v>
<v Speaker 2>years older than them maximumly </v>

1027
00:49:53.051 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 2>attractive and they tend to mate across </v>
<v Speaker 2>and up status hierarchies.</v>

1028
00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:59.410
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the consequences of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1029
00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.010
<v Speaker 2>is that as women have entered the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workforce,</v>

1030
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.963
<v Speaker 2>they've have actually driven in equality</v>
<v Speaker 2>because rich women will only marry rich </v>

1031
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:11.140
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men rich as them or Richard.</v>

1032
00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Whereas rich men will marry women who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are poor than them,</v>

1033
00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.573
<v Speaker 2>but women won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is it's another </v>

1034
00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:21.070
<v Speaker 2>factor that's pooling wealth in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands of fewer and fewer people.</v>

1035
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:22.143
<v Speaker 1>This is all its assorted of mating know </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just find someone with your </v>

1036
00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.473
<v Speaker 1>background here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the doctor might have married </v>

1037
00:50:27.771 --> 00:50:28.440
<v Speaker 1>his secretary.</v>

1038
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.060
<v Speaker 2>You now marries another doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1039
00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.073
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I ask then stepping a little bit </v>

1040
00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:35.310
<v Speaker 2>back from primates as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does this um,</v>

1041
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.570
<v Speaker 2>selection work in the era of swiping </v>
<v Speaker 2>right</v>

1042
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:39.643
<v Speaker 1>and unless</v>

1043
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.533
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your reaction to the way young </v>

1044
00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:44.990
<v Speaker 2>people did</v>

1045
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.571
<v Speaker 5>today?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1046
00:50:45.571 --> 00:50:47.870
<v Speaker 5>that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was really hoping we'd get into that.</v>

1047
00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:48.773
<v Speaker 5>I was really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were very into the monkey so I </v>

1048
00:50:50.481 --> 00:50:51.600
<v Speaker 5>didn't want to interrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1049
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.800
<v Speaker 5>Well I should close off to Scandinavia</v>

1050
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:55.703
<v Speaker 2>discussion just by pointing out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that the </v>

1051
00:50:57.511 --> 00:50:59.430
<v Speaker 2>scandinavians are already going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to wrestle with,</v>

1052
00:50:59.431 --> 00:51:00.264
<v Speaker 2>is that if you institute effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies to promote equality of </v>

1053
00:51:04.891 --> 00:51:07.560
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the Scandinavians have done,</v>

1054
00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.293
<v Speaker 2>you're going to produce some equality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like a 50 50 distribution of men and </v>

1055
00:51:12.301 --> 00:51:13.134
<v Speaker 2>women in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also going to exacerbate </v>

1056
00:51:15.511 --> 00:51:19.170
<v Speaker 2>certain kinds of inequality and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get out of that.</v>

1057
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:20.063
<v Speaker 2>So you cannot have equality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity and equality of outcome </v>

1058
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.810
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't work together.</v>

1059
00:51:24.811 --> 00:51:25.644
<v Speaker 2>And equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the essentially quality of outcome </v>

1060
00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.133
<v Speaker 2>doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is often described with the code </v>

1061
00:51:30.161 --> 00:51:30.994
<v Speaker 2>word equity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that at every level of every </v>

1062
00:51:33.181 --> 00:51:37.200
<v Speaker 2>occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people have to be represented by the</v>

1063
00:51:37.201 --> 00:51:39.930
<v Speaker 2>same number that they're represented in </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the population.</v>

1064
00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:44.340
<v Speaker 2>So if it's not 50 50 men and women at </v>
<v Speaker 2>each in each occupation I need,</v>

1065
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:45.263
<v Speaker 2>and in each strata at each occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that sort of prime of Fossi </v>

1066
00:51:48.301 --> 00:51:52.410
<v Speaker 2>evidence for discrimination and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>systemic discrimination,</v>

1067
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.670
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1068
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:55.770
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to factor in choice.</v>

1069
00:51:55.771 --> 00:51:58.650
<v Speaker 2>And choice actually turns out to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very important determinant.</v>

1070
00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:01.140
<v Speaker 2>And as the society gets flatter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>flatter,</v>

1071
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:04.560
<v Speaker 2>choice becomes a more important and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more important determinant.</v>

1072
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:05.693
<v Speaker 2>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what that essentially means is that </v>

1073
00:52:08.101 --> 00:52:08.934
<v Speaker 2>the most radical end of the left wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>political agenda is logically </v>

1074
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.680
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apart from the fact that it's impossible</v>

1075
00:52:16.681 --> 00:52:17.820
<v Speaker 2>for a variety of other reasons.</v>

1076
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And they should look at the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

1077
00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:25.590
<v Speaker 1>it's just a cliche now of in any group </v>
<v Speaker 1>of activists and they'll say,</v>

1078
00:52:26.681 --> 00:52:27.514
<v Speaker 1>oh well we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for women to achieve the </v>

1079
00:52:30.071 --> 00:52:33.760
<v Speaker 1>quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need government funded daycare and we</v>

1080
00:52:33.761 --> 00:52:35.680
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have it in Sweden.</v>

1081
00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Sweden has fewer women in managerial </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels in American women are ahead.</v>

1082
00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:43.083
<v Speaker 1>In fact now they have jen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh they have quotas over there so they </v>

1083
00:52:45.131 --> 00:52:45.964
<v Speaker 1>need a female ceos and females on boards</v>
<v Speaker 1>and made any differences in bringing in </v>

1084
00:52:49.691 --> 00:52:52.750
<v Speaker 1>member American women because we're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much further ahead.</v>

1085
00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.203
<v Speaker 5>It's called no difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>distribution of men and women lower in </v>

1087
00:52:56.311 --> 00:52:57.144
<v Speaker 5>the herd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called the Nordic paradox and say </v>

1088
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:01.400
<v Speaker 5>you guys are so wonky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to get back.</v>

1089
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.390
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You all want to get back to,</v>

1090
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:08.290
<v Speaker 5>I want to get back to those monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well thinking</v>

1091
00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:09.183
<v Speaker 2>this morning about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to a variety of political </v>

1092
00:53:11.801 --> 00:53:14.440
<v Speaker 2>types and we were talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>

1093
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In DC and hard to believe.</v>

1094
00:53:16.501 --> 00:53:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Hard to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No I'm not.</v>

1095
00:53:17.771 --> 00:53:18.604
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1096
00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.473
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of Republicans here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've been talking to Democrats as </v>

1097
00:53:21.701 --> 00:53:23.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was mostly Republicans here.</v>

1098
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 2>And we were talking about abortion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1099
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.553
<v Speaker 2>I made a case that that's really not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very productive discussion because </v>

1100
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:38.390
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a problem way too </v>
<v Speaker 2>late in the sequence of problems.</v>

1101
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.910
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1102
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:43.980
<v Speaker 2>by the time the discussion starts to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>about abortion,</v>

1103
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:47.400
<v Speaker 2>there's 50 problems that have already </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerged that no one has addressed.</v>

1104
00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:48.623
<v Speaker 2>And some of those problems are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental problem is how human beings </v>

1105
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:54.720
<v Speaker 2>should regulate their sexual behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big problem.</v>

1106
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:55.554
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1107
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.130
<v Speaker 2>there's an interesting thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening because you know,</v>

1108
00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:01.140
<v Speaker 2>the people on the right would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1109
00:54:01.141 --> 00:54:01.710
<v Speaker 2>that's easy.</v>

1110
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:02.543
<v Speaker 2>It's like don't sleep around and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get married and have sex with your </v>

1111
00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:07.560
<v Speaker 2>marital partner and that solve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1112
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 2>So there's strictures on sexual behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those would be the traditional ones.</v>

1113
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:16.940
<v Speaker 2>And what you see on the left is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this weird paradoxical demand,</v>

1114
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.410
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1115
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.173
<v Speaker 2>that people should be allowed to express</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sexuality in any manner that they </v>

1116
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:29.271
<v Speaker 2>choose whenever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that sex is so dangerous that it has</v>

1117
00:54:31.381 --> 00:54:35.490
<v Speaker 2>to be carefully regulated at every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single stage of the interaction.</v>

1118
00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:36.480
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1119
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.313
<v Speaker 2>that many state legislatures have now </v>
<v Speaker 2>followed the example of university </v>

1120
00:54:41.551 --> 00:54:42.384
<v Speaker 2>campuses and put it in affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 2>consent legislation so that every move </v>

1121
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:47.034
<v Speaker 2>you make towards physical intimacy has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be proceeded by the instantiation of </v>

1122
00:54:52.201 --> 00:54:54.060
<v Speaker 2>a verbal contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

1123
00:54:54.061 --> 00:54:54.611
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1124
00:54:54.611 --> 00:54:57.660
<v Speaker 2>can I take your hand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1125
00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.490
<v Speaker 2>you actually hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand,</v>

1126
00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:03.240
<v Speaker 2>you actually have to say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nodding is not sufficient.</v>

1127
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.270
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so each stage has to be,</v>

1128
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:10.140
<v Speaker 2>has to be proceeded by affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 2>consent and uh,</v>

1129
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:12.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1130
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.920
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1131
00:55:13.921 --> 00:55:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't say anything about,</v>

1132
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:15.931
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

1133
00:55:15.931 --> 00:55:16.764
<v Speaker 2>It's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absurd to assume that that's how </v>

1134
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:23.370
<v Speaker 2>human intimate relationships are </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to proceed.</v>

1135
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:27.900
<v Speaker 2>And then you have complicated laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerging that are part of that,</v>

1136
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.700
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1137
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:32.130
<v Speaker 2>this is the case in California as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it,</v>

1138
00:55:32.131 --> 00:55:35.430
<v Speaker 2>is that you cannot give affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 2>consent if you're intoxicated.</v>

1139
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think about that,</v>

1140
00:55:37.561 --> 00:55:38.850
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what does that mean?</v>

1141
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:43.770
<v Speaker 2>It means that like a lot of sex is </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>

1142
00:55:43.771 --> 00:55:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Been illegal for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including marital,</v>

1143
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:47.761
<v Speaker 2>marital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1144
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:50.370
<v Speaker 2>That's the one that's next to me on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>honeymoon.</v>

1145
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that is thinking it,</v>

1146
00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:53.640
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems,</v>

1147
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.020
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to mean,</v>

1148
00:55:56.021 --> 00:55:56.580
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1149
00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1150
00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me,</v>

1151
00:56:00.481 --> 00:56:01.314
<v Speaker 2>to me in the California legislation that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have sex with your wife or </v>

1152
00:56:04.051 --> 00:56:07.530
<v Speaker 2>husband and either of you is </v>
<v Speaker 2>intoxicated,</v>

1153
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:11.700
<v Speaker 2>then you're either one of you or both is</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty of rape.</v>

1154
00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

1155
00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:14.934
<v Speaker 2>I was in a debate a few years ago at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Virginia Law School and I </v>

1156
00:56:18.631 --> 00:56:23.631
<v Speaker 2>turned to my debate partner in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if what you're saying is right,</v>

1157
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.310
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two people can rate one another,</v>

1158
00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.010
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She said yes.</v>

1159
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.960
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit.</v>

1160
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how can that be?</v>

1161
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:37.480
<v Speaker 5>That's the question.</v>

1162
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1163
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.033
<v Speaker 2>so then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's interesting because I think </v>

1164
00:56:41.741 --> 00:56:42.574
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of this confusion has emerged</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally as a consequence of the </v>

1165
00:56:45.611 --> 00:56:47.710
<v Speaker 2>birth control pill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1166
00:56:47.711 --> 00:56:48.544
<v Speaker 2>cause you got to think situationally </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you think it theologically or </v>

1167
00:56:50.771 --> 00:56:51.604
<v Speaker 2>psychologically it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that the 20th century </v>

1168
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:57.670
<v Speaker 2>will be remembered for the hydrogen </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb,</v>

1169
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 2>the transistor and the birth control </v>
<v Speaker 2>pill.</v>

1170
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.863
<v Speaker 2>And those are unbelievably radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological innovations and maybe the </v>

1171
00:57:05.261 --> 00:57:06.094
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

1172
00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:11.570
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's dependent on the transistor,</v>

1173
00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause it spawned off with that.</v>

1174
00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.690
<v Speaker 5>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's</v>

1175
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:17.030
<v Speaker 2>technological innovation that spawned </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

1176
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:18.980
<v Speaker 2>Of the three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say the,</v>

1177
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.160
<v Speaker 2>the birth control pill is probably the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger hydrogen bomb.</v>

1178
00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.230
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because it,</v>

1179
00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.153
<v Speaker 2>it changed the fundamental biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of women and men and because it </v>

1180
00:57:31.191 --> 00:57:34.730
<v Speaker 2>gave women for the first time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological history,</v>

1181
00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.780
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the option of choosing their,</v>

1182
00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.280
<v Speaker 5>the status.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

1183
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.230
<v Speaker 5>that's abs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1184
00:57:43.231 --> 00:57:44.460
<v Speaker 5>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1185
00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:45.660
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we like it,</v>

1186
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:48.050
<v Speaker 5>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not something that's come without a</v>

1187
00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:53.130
<v Speaker 5>tremendous w h it's come with your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>complexity.</v>

1188
00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.620
<v Speaker 5>A fellow can anything reading?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1189
00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:57.890
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't that,</v>

1190
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:00.620
<v Speaker 5>well I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not making it in your</v>

1191
00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:01.453
<v Speaker 2>case for the abolition of the birth </v>
<v Speaker 2>control pill by any stretch of the </v>

1192
00:58:03.591 --> 00:58:06.020
<v Speaker 2>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pointing at its complexity.</v>

1193
00:58:06.021 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And so because one of the questions is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1194
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:11.210
<v Speaker 2>once you can regulate your reproductive </v>
<v Speaker 2>function,</v>

1195
00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:14.630
<v Speaker 2>what attitude should you have towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex?</v>

1196
00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.560
<v Speaker 2>And one answer might be the more of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the more varied circumstances,</v>

1197
00:58:20.661 --> 00:58:21.494
<v Speaker 2>the better because why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that was actually part </v>

1198
00:58:25.131 --> 00:58:25.964
<v Speaker 2>of the attitude that emerged in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aftermath of the birth control pill in </v>

1199
00:58:28.491 --> 00:58:29.810
<v Speaker 2>the 1960s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1200
00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:30.793
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a reasonable response in some </v>

1201
00:58:33.291 --> 00:58:34.124
<v Speaker 2>sense because it's such a cataclysmic </v>
<v Speaker 2>change that you don't know what it </v>

1202
00:58:36.381 --> 00:58:38.090
<v Speaker 2>implies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1203
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:40.760
<v Speaker 2>what's the consequence of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1204
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:41.803
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people aren't reliable enough to use </v>

1205
00:58:44.241 --> 00:58:46.610
<v Speaker 2>birth control in an entirely reliable </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>

1206
00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:50.270
<v Speaker 2>So even though it can work at near 100% </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiency,</v>

1207
00:58:50.271 --> 00:58:51.104
<v Speaker 2>you have to take it extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>regularly and in a disciplined manner </v>

1208
00:58:53.511 --> 00:58:54.380
<v Speaker 2>for that to work.</v>

1209
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:56.520
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1210
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:59.390
<v Speaker 2>there was still the problem of unwanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnancy,</v>

1211
00:58:59.391 --> 00:59:00.224
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was the problem of the </v>

1212
00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:06.940
<v Speaker 2>proliferation of sexual epidemics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that culminated in aids,</v>

1213
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.670
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1214
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:09.830
<v Speaker 2>could have easily wiped all of us out </v>
<v Speaker 2>but didn't.</v>

1215
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:12.680
<v Speaker 2>But there's other sexual epidemics that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have had the same effect.</v>

1216
00:59:12.681 --> 00:59:13.514
<v Speaker 2>But we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been fortunate enough to escape </v>

1217
00:59:15.111 --> 00:59:16.280
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1218
00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:20.390
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then more recently there's been this</v>

1219
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:21.883
<v Speaker 2>weird inversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially on the radical left that </v>

1220
00:59:26.691 --> 00:59:30.530
<v Speaker 2>points to the reemergence of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a set of sexual taboos.</v>

1221
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:31.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1222
00:59:31.311 --> 00:59:36.311
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea that sex is casual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a form of entertainment is,</v>

1223
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:40.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an absolutely preposterous </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

1224
00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:41.623
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>shallow beyond belief to hold that as a </v>

1225
00:59:47.631 --> 00:59:49.220
<v Speaker 2>core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1226
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 2>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it forces you to,</v>

1227
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:53.600
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1228
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:54.463
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's repetitive sex with multiple </v>

1229
00:59:55.881 --> 00:59:56.714
<v Speaker 2>partners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1230
00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.560
<v Speaker 2>it forces you to treat people as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're interchangeable.</v>

1231
01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:01.813
<v Speaker 2>And I don't see how that's good for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically or for the people that </v>

1232
01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:07.270
<v Speaker 2>you're using interchangeably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1233
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.413
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it implies that you can divorce </v>

1234
01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:15.550
<v Speaker 2>sexuality from play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the desire for more,</v>

1235
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.560
<v Speaker 2>for a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from emotional fragility,</v>

1236
01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.380
<v Speaker 2>from love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from family,</v>

1237
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.273
<v Speaker 2>from responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of those things that are part and </v>

1238
01:00:24.201 --> 01:00:26.360
<v Speaker 2>parcel of every one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think you can,</v>

1239
01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:29.360
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think people's experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicates that you can,</v>

1240
01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.793
<v Speaker 2>and especially on the emotional front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's partly what's </v>

1241
01:00:34.851 --> 01:00:37.970
<v Speaker 2>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was also a residual sense that</v>

1242
01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:38.804
<v Speaker 2>there's something about sex that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally dangerous and maybe it's </v>

1243
01:00:41.211 --> 01:00:42.044
<v Speaker 2>dangerous emotionally and personally and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's dangerous socially and </v>

1244
01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:46.124
<v Speaker 2>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which most certainly is because it's a </v>

1245
01:00:47.901 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 2>powerful force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way the left is reacting to that</v>

1246
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:56.270
<v Speaker 2>is by insisting that all forms of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior are valid and,</v>

1247
01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.090
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that it's reasonable to manifest all</v>

1248
01:00:59.091 --> 01:00:59.924
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that it's simultaneously so </v>

1249
01:01:01.401 --> 01:01:02.234
<v Speaker 2>dangerous that absolutely every aspect </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it has to be state regulated and in </v>

1250
01:01:05.571 --> 01:01:06.404
<v Speaker 2>an increasingly draconian form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think what needs to happen is </v>

1251
01:01:09.951 --> 01:01:12.950
<v Speaker 2>that the left and the right have to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and have a,</v>

1252
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.820
<v Speaker 2>like a real discussion about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes felid sexual morality.</v>

1253
01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:20.690
<v Speaker 2>And that's the conversation you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have way before you worry about solving.</v>

1254
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Like the abortion debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

1255
01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:25.640
<v Speaker 2>is very divisive and very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and very intractable.</v>

1256
01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.513
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we talked about </v>

1257
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.253
<v Speaker 3>actually just last week on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does this cover story in the Atlantic </v>

1258
01:01:30.811 --> 01:01:31.644
<v Speaker 3>about the sexual recession among young </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that despite the advent of the </v>

1259
01:01:35.851 --> 01:01:37.350
<v Speaker 3>birth control pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abortion is,</v>

1260
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:39.360
<v Speaker 3>is going down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1261
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1262
01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:44.050
<v Speaker 3>there's lexus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's blessing is going down.</v>

1263
01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what have you looked into that worry</v>

1264
01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.050
<v Speaker 3>about opinion on that?</v>

1265
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you raise the cost of something,</v>

1266
01:01:51.331 --> 01:01:53.340
<v Speaker 2>you'd decrease its prevalence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1267
01:01:53.341 --> 01:01:54.750
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that it's,</v>

1268
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.090
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1269
01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.770
<v Speaker 2>dangerous nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1270
01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:00.993
<v Speaker 2>I kind of think that it's also a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflection of the same thing that </v>

1271
01:02:03.151 --> 01:02:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Bloomberg reported on just a few days </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1272
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.150
<v Speaker 2>He said that across businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men are thinking,</v>

1273
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not spending any time with a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman that isn't,</v>

1274
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:14.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with me in some formal manner</v>

1275
01:02:14.551 --> 01:02:16.170
<v Speaker 2>like my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it.</v>

1276
01:02:16.171 --> 01:02:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to mentor young women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be in a room alone with</v>

1277
01:02:18.781 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I couldn't face career</v>

1278
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.260
<v Speaker 5>annihilation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And instantly they,</v>

1279
01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.070
<v Speaker 5>they're frightened of</v>

1280
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 3>the young women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that was kate.</v>

1281
01:02:24.301 --> 01:02:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Julian said that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we can overexaggerate the part,</v>

1282
01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:28.284
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and depression is going up </v>

1283
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:30.870
<v Speaker 3>amongst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1284
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:34.410
<v Speaker 3>both young men and young women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A suicide is going up,</v>

1285
01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:35.591
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1286
01:02:35.591 --> 01:02:38.310
<v Speaker 3>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a,</v>

1287
01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:41.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people I think are not,</v>

1288
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.233
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about an elite demographic</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is into the consent and political </v>

1289
01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:46.434
<v Speaker 3>correctness and work with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is across the board and it's </v>

1290
01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:50.920
<v Speaker 3>global.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1291
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.830
<v Speaker 3>it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's happening even in Sweden,</v>

1292
01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:55.920
<v Speaker 3>it's really happening in Japan and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan.</v>

1293
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.990
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1294
01:02:56.991 --> 01:02:59.410
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that speaks to,</v>

1295
01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.130
<v Speaker 5>and especially in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have,</v>

1296
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:01.440
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1297
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.273
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially young men have given up on </v>

1298
01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:08.550
<v Speaker 3>intimacy and having sex is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1299
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:10.620
<v Speaker 3>that had too much trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sex robots.</v>

1300
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1301
01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:12.151
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1302
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:12.560
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1303
01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.530
<v Speaker 3>hello question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1304
01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 3>and there's pornography.</v>

1305
01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's pornography,</v>

1306
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:19.220
<v Speaker 5>basically zero risks when you allow for </v>
<v Speaker 5>pornography.</v>

1307
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:19.980
<v Speaker 3>Three the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1308
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:23.900
<v Speaker 3>that the men and women will sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>separate that from their actual cyclic.</v>

1309
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe we were seeing a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

1310
01:03:26.621 --> 01:03:28.830
<v Speaker 3>collapse of intimacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1311
01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Let alone sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1312
01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:31.251
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1313
01:03:31.251 --> 01:03:32.084
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think that's just explained </v>

1314
01:03:33.071 --> 01:03:35.710
<v Speaker 3>by the political nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1315
01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.830
<v Speaker 3>so I'd be interested in your thoughts.</v>

1316
01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:39.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1317
01:03:39.711 --> 01:03:40.544
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the literature on the </v>

1318
01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:46.040
<v Speaker 2>decline in sexual activity well enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know if it's valid or reliable.</v>

1319
01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.950
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1320
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:50.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a stable society you take lots of </v>

1321
01:03:51.591 --> 01:03:53.060
<v Speaker 2>things for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take,</v>

1322
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.983
<v Speaker 2>you take the fact that men and women are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be sexually attracted to one </v>

1323
01:03:56.781 --> 01:03:57.614
<v Speaker 2>another for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even though it's more fragile than </v>

1324
01:03:59.991 --> 01:04:01.490
<v Speaker 2>it appears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1325
01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:04.370
<v Speaker 2>And it's suppressed more easily than you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might think.</v>

1326
01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you take the idea that men and women</v>

1327
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:08.663
<v Speaker 2>are going to move together towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment of longterm intimate </v>

1328
01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:12.314
<v Speaker 2>relationships for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's partly because you don't </v>

1329
01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.720
<v Speaker 2>understand what invisible preconditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist to make that self evident,</v>

1330
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:21.983
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when those invisible preconditions </v>

1331
01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:27.980
<v Speaker 2>are disrupted by rapid technological or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociological change,</v>

1332
01:04:27.981 --> 01:04:30.320
<v Speaker 2>then things shift underneath you when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know why.</v>

1333
01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:34.000
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is traced to the advent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the smartphone,</v>

1334
01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.590
<v Speaker 3>especially in the generation z that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kate was explaining this to us,</v>

1335
01:04:38.591 --> 01:04:39.424
<v Speaker 3>that you could see it was broadband </v>
<v Speaker 3>internet and the smartphone that led to </v>

1336
01:04:43.451 --> 01:04:44.490
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1337
01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:45.363
<v Speaker 3>increasing fall off of relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the abstract is more interesting </v>

1338
01:04:50.351 --> 01:04:51.260
<v Speaker 3>than right proximal.</v>

1339
01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.570
<v Speaker 5>Well you see that I just want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to know the truth.</v>

1340
01:04:54.571 --> 01:04:56.670
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever been with somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 5>would have loved,</v>

1341
01:04:56.671 --> 01:04:57.960
<v Speaker 5>if I'm fascinated and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1342
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:59.990
<v Speaker 3>you really wanted to get back to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>smartphone.</v>

1343
01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Has that ever happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1344
01:05:01.611 --> 01:05:02.840
<v Speaker 3>Well it happens all the time.</v>

1345
01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.960
<v Speaker 5>No Tab is during our podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tell you to put your phones.</v>

1346
01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.593
<v Speaker 5>I know I'm climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm researching for the printers of the </v>

1347
01:05:13.831 --> 01:05:14.910
<v Speaker 5>pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very addictive,</v>

1348
01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.710
<v Speaker 5>very addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1349
01:05:16.711 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 5>I read the other day that</v>

1350
01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:19.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very laurie,</v>

1351
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:21.063
<v Speaker 2>they are kind of going together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The preferred method of interpersonal </v>

1352
01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:25.804
<v Speaker 2>communication between young people know </v>
<v Speaker 2>is texting rather than face to face </v>

1353
01:05:28.181 --> 01:05:29.130
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1354
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:31.560
<v Speaker 2>And the swiping the apes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1355
01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:32.410
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1356
01:05:32.411 --> 01:05:35.140
<v Speaker 2>that's a very interesting topic to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

1357
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:36.850
<v Speaker 2>like the tinder phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1358
01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Cause that that's an also right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Major technological revolution.</v>

1359
01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Because what it's done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say for the first time is reduce</v>

1360
01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:49.800
<v Speaker 2>the cost of rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two males,</v>

1361
01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:52.710
<v Speaker 2>two zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it hides it.</v>

1362
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:54.023
<v Speaker 2>You're the only people you ever hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>from our people who haven't rejected </v>

1363
01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:56.181
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although,</v>

1364
01:05:56.181 --> 01:05:57.330
<v Speaker 2>although they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1365
01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:58.173
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was one man who had to make </v>

1366
01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:02.680
<v Speaker 2>300 he key actually tallied it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1367
01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.440
<v Speaker 2>You have to make 300 requests of swiping</v>
<v Speaker 2>right or whatever one replies.</v>

1368
01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:09.440
<v Speaker 2>So I think he had the sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

1369
01:06:09.441 --> 01:06:10.041
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1370
01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:13.150
<v Speaker 2>But it's massively attenuated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>observer.</v>

1371
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:15.080
<v Speaker 2>You're not being humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

1372
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

1373
01:06:16.251 --> 01:06:18.230
<v Speaker 2>it's really at arm's length and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1374
01:06:18.231 --> 01:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>you can swipe very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly and so you can get all that</v>

1375
01:06:20.991 --> 01:06:23.000
<v Speaker 2>rejection over within a very short </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>

1376
01:06:23.001 --> 01:06:26.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like losing a video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gamers or well last be worse.</v>

1377
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean not nearly as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1378
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.490
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1379
01:06:30.491 --> 01:06:31.080
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1380
01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1381
01:06:32.711 --> 01:06:36.160
<v Speaker 2>tinder also reduces the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the other things that,</v>

1382
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:38.350
<v Speaker 2>things that you want to think about with</v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to sex,</v>

1383
01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:40.870
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly true for women,</v>

1384
01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:41.704
<v Speaker 2>is that to what degree is it in women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests to allow the cost of sex to </v>

1385
01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:46.534
<v Speaker 2>fall to zero?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because with pornography certainly does </v>

1386
01:06:49.541 --> 01:06:50.374
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just seems to me that that's not </v>

1387
01:06:51.911 --> 01:06:52.744
<v Speaker 2>a very good long term strategy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships between men and women </v>

1388
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.470
<v Speaker 2>because whatever sex is worth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cost of zero is the wrong price,</v>

1389
01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.760
<v Speaker 2>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1390
01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:02.843
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you heard of the bunny ranch and pay </v>

1391
01:07:03.441 --> 01:07:04.340
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit for it.</v>

1392
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:05.450
<v Speaker 2>Well true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1393
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.970
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>

1394
01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:08.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to,</v>

1395
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.200
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1396
01:07:09.201 --> 01:07:10.034
<v Speaker 2>I've heard from a number of women what </v>
<v Speaker 2>written read blog reports on their </v>

1397
01:07:13.971 --> 01:07:18.971
<v Speaker 2>frustration with their attempts to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively sexually selective.</v>

1398
01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.353
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say they decide that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to sleep with their new </v>

1399
01:07:23.991 --> 01:07:26.690
<v Speaker 2>partner on the first date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1400
01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:27.883
<v Speaker 2>they're frustrated by the fact that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the degree that they're being cautious </v>

1401
01:07:31.011 --> 01:07:31.844
<v Speaker 2>in their sexual behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is actually an admirable </v>

1402
01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:38.990
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're instantly out competed,</v>

1403
01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.590
<v Speaker 2>especially if their partners are </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat impulsive by women who will say</v>

1404
01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:45.680
<v Speaker 2>yes at the drop of a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1405
01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:47.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1406
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you know what depends on </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the goal is.</v>

1407
01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:53.120
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing is that there's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>short terms,</v>

1408
01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.013
<v Speaker 2>there's short term sexual gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the literature indicates that </v>

1409
01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:58.040
<v Speaker 2>married couples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1410
01:07:58.130 --> 01:08:01.970
<v Speaker 2>or couples in a permanent long term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monogamous relationship or more sexually</v>

1411
01:08:01.971 --> 01:08:02.804
<v Speaker 2>satisfied than single people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe the single people have to be </v>

1412
01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:09.140
<v Speaker 2>parsed out into those who were sexually </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful and those who aren't.</v>

1413
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:12.710
<v Speaker 2>But I suspect that wouldn't make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much difference.</v>

1414
01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:13.663
<v Speaker 2>But whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's utility of relatively immediate </v>

1415
01:08:17.391 --> 01:08:18.224
<v Speaker 2>sexual gratification for whatever that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth and the adventurousness that goes </v>

1416
01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:24.350
<v Speaker 2>along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the hunt and the excitement of</v>

1417
01:08:24.351 --> 01:08:25.184
<v Speaker 2>having a new partner and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe even the danger that's </v>

1418
01:08:27.381 --> 01:08:28.214
<v Speaker 2>associated with that because people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a little bit of danger in their </v>

1419
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:33.140
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's the goal?</v>

1420
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:36.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like what do people want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean there's a great book called a</v>

1421
01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:40.040
<v Speaker 2>billion wicked thoughts that was written</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Google engineers.</v>

1422
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:40.874
<v Speaker 2>And so it contains great psychology </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Google engineers don't care </v>

1423
01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:46.220
<v Speaker 2>about political correctness and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just write down what they find.</v>

1424
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:48.620
<v Speaker 2>They don't even notice that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically incorrect.</v>

1425
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.633
<v Speaker 2>Hence James Demora for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they found was that women use </v>

1426
01:08:54.081 --> 01:08:54.914
<v Speaker 2>pornography just as much as men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the pornography that women use is </v>

1427
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.843
<v Speaker 2>verbal.</v>

1428
01:08:59.000 --> 01:08:59.833
<v Speaker 2>It's not even just stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the pornographic novels essentially </v>

1429
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.963
<v Speaker 2>follow the same extraordinarily standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>plot line to the degree that publishing </v>

1430
01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:11.640
<v Speaker 2>houses like Harlequin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was going to say it's the,</v>

1431
01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:13.940
<v Speaker 2>it's the bodice rippers that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1432
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:15.950
<v Speaker 2>So in the Harlequin series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

1433
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that were published like in the</v>

1434
01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:19.760
<v Speaker 2>1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are pretty tame.</v>

1435
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.060
<v Speaker 2>There's a small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

1436
01:09:21.061 --> 01:09:22.400
<v Speaker 2>or they're pretty hot actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1437
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:25.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They range from,</v>

1438
01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.173
<v Speaker 2>they range from rep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weebly team to essentially to hardcore </v>

1439
01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:29.360
<v Speaker 2>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

1440
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:30.350
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1441
01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:32.450
<v Speaker 2>the plots are quite similar and the plot</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1442
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:33.743
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1443
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:34.603
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively innocent woman finds </v>

1444
01:09:36.501 --> 01:09:37.940
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

1445
01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 2>dangerous male tames him and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>live happily ever after love.</v>

1446
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:43.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1447
01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:45.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's the beauty and the beast plot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a fundamental</v>

1448
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:47.440
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is search for women on porn hub.</v>

1449
01:09:47.441 --> 01:09:49.930
<v Speaker 1>We discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did an episode on Porn was,</v>

1450
01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for women it was getting rape.</v>

1451
01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that like the no lesbian aneurysm</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least that was your port.</v>

1452
01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was your search on me.</v>

1453
01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1454
01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1455
01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like porn is going to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>William Sonoma store.</v>

1456
01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I know it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is female.</v>

1457
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:06.350
<v Speaker 1>All those pumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1458
01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.193
<v Speaker 1>the no longer philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher one said that men and women </v>

1459
01:10:11.531 --> 01:10:12.364
<v Speaker 1>should never tell one another their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies because when are outraged by </v>

1460
01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:19.960
<v Speaker 1>what we say and we're totally bored by </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they say.</v>

1461
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:24.070
<v Speaker 1>And I thought like women have kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these scenarios and you know,</v>

1462
01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:26.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Unicorns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're doing.</v>

1463
01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Storylines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>storylines and men are just like,</v>

1464
01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say this to you,</v>

1465
01:10:31.211 --> 01:10:34.990
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of just close ups of </v>
<v Speaker 1>female body parts.</v>

1466
01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well men are much more visually oriented</v>

1467
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:39.250
<v Speaker 1>sexually and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they're being shamed.</v>

1468
01:10:39.251 --> 01:10:40.084
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that it's called the male gaze and </v>

1469
01:10:42.191 --> 01:10:44.110
<v Speaker 1>so there's all of this sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1470
01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:47.720
<v Speaker 1>The sports illustrated is exploiting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>female it.</v>

1471
01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baby men like it.</v>

1472
01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:51.281
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1473
01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried that now sort of the way in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>

1474
01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual sub,</v>

1475
01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gays were shamed.</v>

1476
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.480
<v Speaker 1>We're now reversing it in shaming like </v>
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual.</v>

1477
01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:02.373
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely,</v>

1478
01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.830
<v Speaker 1>remember we had the young woman who </v>
<v Speaker 1>complained about being whistled at and I</v>

1479
01:11:05.831 --> 01:11:06.461
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>

1480
01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:07.390
<v Speaker 1>it stops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1481
01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:09.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we have a little bit of time for a </v>

1482
01:11:10.511 --> 01:11:12.880
<v Speaker 1>couple more topics with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1483
01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>because one of the</v>

1484
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.903
<v Speaker 2>things that just coming out of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger generation and you have a </v>

1485
01:11:16.741 --> 01:11:17.574
<v Speaker 2>chapter of it in your book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I wanted to finish what the line </v>

1486
01:11:20.011 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Speaker 2>that we were pursuing with sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

1487
01:11:23.461 --> 01:11:24.294
<v Speaker 2>The question is what's the end game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what people have to ask </v>

1488
01:11:27.031 --> 01:11:27.864
<v Speaker 2>themselves is like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corollaries to the female pornographic </v>

1489
01:11:32.101 --> 01:11:35.730
<v Speaker 2>romance is actually the establishment of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a longterm relationship.</v>

1490
01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.650
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1491
01:11:37.651 --> 01:11:40.320
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny cause I got pilloried in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times,</v>

1492
01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1493
01:11:41.541 --> 01:11:42.374
<v Speaker 2>for talking about enforced monogamy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite interesting because I </v>

1494
01:11:46.231 --> 01:11:46.820
<v Speaker 2>talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1495
01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:50.130
<v Speaker 2>that gets brought up like in every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so ridiculous.</v>

1496
01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:52.140
<v Speaker 2>I talked to that woman for two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two days.</v>

1497
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.330
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like a little side comment.</v>

1498
01:11:54.331 --> 01:11:58.570
<v Speaker 2>And then that became like the like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like enforced monogamy.</v>

1499
01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.240
<v Speaker 2>You mean forced marriage or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1500
01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:01.074
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was an anthropological term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which she knew perfectly well because </v>

1501
01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:05.520
<v Speaker 2>she's a very smart person.</v>

1502
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.823
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all it means is that there's a </v>

1503
01:12:07.831 --> 01:12:08.664
<v Speaker 2>pronounced proclivity in human societies</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world to enforce monogamous </v>

1504
01:12:13.321 --> 01:12:16.770
<v Speaker 2>relationships at multiple levels of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociological hierarchy.</v>

1505
01:12:16.771 --> 01:12:20.520
<v Speaker 2>You'd do it culturally do you do with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>expectation you do it illegally,</v>

1506
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:22.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an enforced monogamy.</v>

1507
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.370
<v Speaker 2>So my son was just married and if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>came to me next year and he said,</v>

1508
01:12:26.371 --> 01:12:27.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey dad,</v>

1509
01:12:27.211 --> 01:12:29.850
<v Speaker 2>guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've managed to have four affairs in the</v>

1510
01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:33.090
<v Speaker 2>last year with hot women and my wife </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't found out about any of them.</v>

1511
01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:35.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to pat them on the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

1512
01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:37.280
<v Speaker 2>good job kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1513
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is up with you?</v>

1514
01:12:38.851 --> 01:12:39.684
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you violated the vow that you took your </v>

1515
01:12:41.131 --> 01:12:42.660
<v Speaker 2>putting your whole future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>riskier,</v>

1516
01:12:42.661 --> 01:12:46.140
<v Speaker 2>betraying yourself and your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's enforced monogamy.</v>

1517
01:12:46.141 --> 01:12:46.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1518
01:12:46.591 --> 01:12:47.424
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that the social norm is the </v>

1519
01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:50.334
<v Speaker 2>establishment of a long term monogamous </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship and that there are </v>

1520
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:56.040
<v Speaker 2>strictures put in place to support that.</v>

1521
01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.920
<v Speaker 2>But also to punish deviation from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd say,</v>

1522
01:12:58.921 --> 01:12:59.461
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1523
01:12:59.461 --> 01:13:02.070
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not so much on the punishment in,</v>

1524
01:13:02.071 --> 01:13:03.570
<v Speaker 2>but you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>

1525
01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:04.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1526
01:13:04.831 --> 01:13:05.664
<v Speaker 2>what is it that you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want a longterm stable relationship </v>

1527
01:13:08.431 --> 01:13:10.290
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if that's the goal,</v>

1528
01:13:10.291 --> 01:13:11.124
<v Speaker 2>then your behavior should be devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that facilitates that </v>

1529
01:13:14.101 --> 01:13:15.990
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't see that.</v>

1530
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't see that casual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive sex fits that bill now,</v>

1531
01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:21.323
<v Speaker 2>not in the least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of the evidence with regards to </v>

1532
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.863
<v Speaker 2>living together shows that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually detrimental to the </v>

1533
01:13:27.511 --> 01:13:29.430
<v Speaker 2>establishment of a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

1534
01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.160
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>common law marriage,</v>

1535
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:35.520
<v Speaker 2>people who are in common law marriage </v>
<v Speaker 2>are much more likely to be be divorced.</v>

1536
01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:36.793
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is people who live </v>

1537
01:13:38.971 --> 01:13:39.804
<v Speaker 2>together before they get married are </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more likely to be divorced after </v>

1538
01:13:42.301 --> 01:13:43.134
<v Speaker 2>they get married.</v>

1539
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.100
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that while you can try </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone on for size and see how it works</v>

1540
01:13:47.101 --> 01:13:48.960
<v Speaker 2>and then you're going to see if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>compatible,</v>

1541
01:13:48.961 --> 01:13:51.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's one story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another story is,</v>

1542
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:52.621
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about you?</v>

1543
01:13:52.621 --> 01:13:55.020
<v Speaker 2>And I lived together for a little while </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1544
01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.090
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not so bad,</v>

1545
01:13:57.091 --> 01:13:59.430
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I can find someone better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I do,</v>

1546
01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the next year and a half or so </v>

1547
01:14:00.961 --> 01:14:03.330
<v Speaker 2>because we're not hooked together in any</v>
<v Speaker 2>formal way,</v>

1548
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:05.190
<v Speaker 2>I can just trade you in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay,</v>

1549
01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:06.024
<v Speaker 2>you can do the same to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't really see that as the sort </v>

1550
01:14:08.881 --> 01:14:09.714
<v Speaker 2>of complimentary mutual interaction that</v>
<v Speaker 2>leads to the formulation of long term </v>

1551
01:14:13.901 --> 01:14:14.734
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's a better story for </v>

1552
01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:18.910
<v Speaker 2>interpreting what constitutes living </v>
<v Speaker 2>together then.</v>

1553
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1554
01:14:19.601 --> 01:14:20.434
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try each other out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what mature people would </v>

1555
01:14:22.511 --> 01:14:24.160
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A store rental.</v>

1556
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's right.</v>

1557
01:14:25.451 --> 01:14:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Wash the rental cars Reagan uses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:28.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

1559
01:14:28.271 --> 01:14:29.950
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what more,</v>

1560
01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:30.784
<v Speaker 2>most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data indicate that it doesn't work </v>

1561
01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.140
<v Speaker 2>is that you're more likely to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorced,</v>

1562
01:14:35.141 --> 01:14:37.840
<v Speaker 2>not less likely because maybe the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude is,</v>

1563
01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably about as flawed as me.</v>

1564
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:42.460
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're lucky that we found each other.</v>

1565
01:14:42.461 --> 01:14:43.294
<v Speaker 2>And so let's see if we can make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment because we're engaging in </v>

1566
01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:47.920
<v Speaker 2>something that's very risky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1567
01:14:47.921 --> 01:14:48.754
<v Speaker 2>an intimate relationship and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to commit to each other and see if we </v>

1568
01:14:51.131 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 2>can build something of value across </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1569
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:54.843
<v Speaker 2>And there's a definite a risk in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a compliment to your </v>

1570
01:14:56.831 --> 01:14:57.551
<v Speaker 2>partner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1571
01:14:57.551 --> 01:14:58.384
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're worth making a sacrifice </v>

1572
01:15:00.581 --> 01:15:02.560
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's the sacrifice?</v>

1573
01:15:02.561 --> 01:15:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's everyone else.</v>

1574
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.863
<v Speaker 2>It's a big sacrifice and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't see that as a </v>

1575
01:15:07.481 --> 01:15:08.314
<v Speaker 2>compliment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I don't think you're thinking </v>

1576
01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:11.044
<v Speaker 2>because not only is it a compliment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like the ultimate </v>

1577
01:15:13.241 --> 01:15:14.074
<v Speaker 2>compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you don't get to have a </v>

1578
01:15:15.521 --> 01:15:18.190
<v Speaker 2>marriage that works without that </v>
<v Speaker 2>compliment.</v>

1579
01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:19.024
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's so difficult to establish a </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm relationship that's functional </v>

1580
01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.553
<v Speaker 2>that you have to make a walloping </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice very early on in the </v>

1581
01:15:26.051 --> 01:15:28.960
<v Speaker 2>relationship in order for that to even </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a possibility.</v>

1582
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:30.263
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not because what the hell do we </v>

1583
01:15:31.421 --> 01:15:33.460
<v Speaker 2>know about what binds people together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1584
01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:37.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that easy to stay with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone for a long period of time.</v>

1585
01:15:37.481 --> 01:15:37.941
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1586
01:15:37.941 --> 01:15:40.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real commitment.</v>

1587
01:15:40.451 --> 01:15:42.070
<v Speaker 2>It takes a tremendous amount of effort.</v>

1588
01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:43.693
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that actually you're bringing us </v>

1589
01:15:44.781 --> 01:15:48.140
<v Speaker 3>back to the beginning and that your time</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Tammy and um,</v>

1590
01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.420
<v Speaker 3>one of the things about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1591
01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:51.523
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to guess this is a bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>overlooked part in your chapter in your </v>

1592
01:15:54.111 --> 01:15:56.840
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just was like one of my favorites.</v>

1593
01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:59.250
<v Speaker 3>It was your book on modern parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1594
01:15:59.251 --> 01:16:00.084
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the goal and I thought I </v>

1595
01:16:00.991 --> 01:16:02.930
<v Speaker 3>would get most trouble for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1596
01:16:02.931 --> 01:16:05.390
<v Speaker 3>but it reminded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's don't read that far into the book.</v>

1597
01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:06.293
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it,</v>

1598
01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:07.460
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother,</v>

1599
01:16:07.461 --> 01:16:08.294
<v Speaker 3>when I had my first child gave me a </v>
<v Speaker 3>1950s copy of doctor spock and he was </v>

1600
01:16:12.351 --> 01:16:13.184
<v Speaker 3>considered so controversial and yet he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the most sensible person may </v>

1601
01:16:16.881 --> 01:16:19.190
<v Speaker 3>new children very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very well was a pediatrician.</v>

1602
01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:20.413
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your rule for parenting is do not let </v>

1603
01:16:22.641 --> 01:16:25.760
<v Speaker 3>your children do anything that makes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>dislike them.</v>

1604
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:27.403
<v Speaker 3>And you kind of in that one chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not even one of your longest </v>

1605
01:16:30.921 --> 01:16:31.754
<v Speaker 3>chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just did this wonderful sweeping </v>

1606
01:16:34.011 --> 01:16:37.820
<v Speaker 3>overview of modern parenting and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

1607
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:39.283
<v Speaker 3>And in some ways that we're producing </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe some of these kids who are </v>

1608
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:46.130
<v Speaker 3>prolonging adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prolonging the markers of adulthood,</v>

1609
01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1610
01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:49.910
<v Speaker 3>that you feel that parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1611
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:53.660
<v Speaker 3>you said you see today's parents is </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified by their children.</v>

1612
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.823
<v Speaker 3>Not least because they've denied credit </v>
<v Speaker 3>for their role as benevolent and </v>

1613
01:16:57.481 --> 01:17:00.380
<v Speaker 3>necessary agents of discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>order and conventionality.</v>

1614
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:01.603
<v Speaker 3>And then you told some hilarious stories</v>
<v Speaker 3>about when your wife ran a daycare </v>

1615
01:17:03.831 --> 01:17:04.664
<v Speaker 3>center out of your house and you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would get into test of wills with </v>

1616
01:17:07.971 --> 01:17:08.804
<v Speaker 3>some of the two year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the tough man [inaudible] son is </v>

1617
01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:14.510
<v Speaker 3>ordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad to hear he got married to Greg.</v>

1618
01:17:16.450 --> 01:17:18.640
<v Speaker 2>He still doesn't want to do anything he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to do.</v>

1619
01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.593
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very charming and very emotionally </v>

1620
01:17:20.981 --> 01:17:21.814
<v Speaker 2>stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like he's easy to get along </v>

1621
01:17:23.741 --> 01:17:25.390
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trying to get him to do something he</v>

1622
01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:26.224
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he had my wife defeated when </v>

1623
01:17:28.031 --> 01:17:30.400
<v Speaker 2>he was nine months old and she's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1624
01:17:30.490 --> 01:17:31.360
<v Speaker 2>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

1625
01:17:31.361 --> 01:17:32.194
<v Speaker 2>she's no pushover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he would just sit there with his </v>

1626
01:17:33.881 --> 01:17:34.714
<v Speaker 2>mouth closed and glare at her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm not eating out and I can </v>

1627
01:17:37.901 --> 01:17:41.110
<v Speaker 2>take more than you can dish out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really something to see,</v>

1628
01:17:41.111 --> 01:17:41.944
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see that kind of force of will and </v>

1629
01:17:43.061 --> 01:17:44.200
<v Speaker 2>someone not small.</v>

1630
01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:45.333
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk a little bit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just the modern roles between men </v>

1631
01:17:49.691 --> 01:17:51.070
<v Speaker 3>and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're less,</v>

1632
01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't really,</v>

1633
01:17:52.631 --> 01:17:53.464
<v Speaker 3>you're not really supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinguish between fathers and mothers </v>

1634
01:17:55.811 --> 01:17:59.070
<v Speaker 3>even though that seems to inevitably </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen in most [inaudible].</v>

1635
01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Well it happens in large part because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the children differentiate between them.</v>

1636
01:18:02.461 --> 01:18:03.294
<v Speaker 2>Like parents are under the delusion that</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of what you do with your children </v>

1637
01:18:05.821 --> 01:18:06.654
<v Speaker 2>is driven by what you want to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your children when in fact it's driven </v>

1638
01:18:09.541 --> 01:18:13.530
<v Speaker 2>to a massive degree by what your </v>
<v Speaker 2>children want you to do with them.</v>

1639
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:18.980
<v Speaker 2>And so there were studies done 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago on feminist parents who decided that</v>

1640
01:18:20.251 --> 01:18:23.670
<v Speaker 2>they were going to raise their children </v>
<v Speaker 2>in non gender differentiated manners.</v>

1641
01:18:23.671 --> 01:18:24.504
<v Speaker 2>And when they were studied they found </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the parents who had that explicit </v>

1642
01:18:27.331 --> 01:18:30.420
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just as gender differentiated with</v>

1643
01:18:30.421 --> 01:18:32.790
<v Speaker 2>their children as the parents who didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have with the philosophy.</v>

1644
01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:33.624
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a parent that has any sense at </v>

1645
01:18:36.691 --> 01:18:40.020
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't re respond to your children as</v>

1646
01:18:40.021 --> 01:18:43.050
<v Speaker 2>a rigid idiot log.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You respond to them as whatever it is.</v>

1647
01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:47.520
<v Speaker 2>The child man manifests himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him or herself as like,</v>

1648
01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with any individualized relationship,</v>

1649
01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:53.100
<v Speaker 2>you take your cue from the person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>

1650
01:18:53.101 --> 01:18:55.850
<v Speaker 2>well a child has no intrinsic nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1651
01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:00.860
<v Speaker 2>if you think that you either don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>children or you've never seen a child or</v>

1652
01:19:00.901 --> 01:19:04.290
<v Speaker 2>you're so blinded by your radiology that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a child,</v>

1653
01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:05.124
<v Speaker 2>you just have a blank projection screen </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto which you project your </v>

1654
01:19:07.951 --> 01:19:10.770
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions and then heaven help </v>
<v Speaker 2>your child.</v>

1655
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:12.390
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1656
01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:13.343
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of the gender differentiation </v>

1657
01:19:14.731 --> 01:19:18.450
<v Speaker 2>is actually driven by the children's </v>
<v Speaker 2>demands and that's all for the good.</v>

1658
01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:19.643
<v Speaker 2>That chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I would get into tremendous </v>

1659
01:19:21.481 --> 01:19:22.314
<v Speaker 2>trouble for writing that chapter because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's contentious right on the surface </v>

1660
01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:26.063
<v Speaker 2>just to the rule because the rule first </v>
<v Speaker 2>implies the children can be dislikable </v>

1661
01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:31.740
<v Speaker 2>and then I would say again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1662
01:19:31.890 --> 01:19:32.940
<v Speaker 2>like have you met children?</v>

1663
01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:33.893
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a very child where their </v>

1664
01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:37.260
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't like obviously,</v>

1665
01:19:37.261 --> 01:19:38.094
<v Speaker 2>and so lots of children or dislikable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's taboo to admit that because </v>

1666
01:19:40.891 --> 01:19:43.950
<v Speaker 2>they're all sweetness and light and </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocence ever since Rousseau.</v>

1667
01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.950
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we so put all five of his children in an</v>

1668
01:19:46.951 --> 01:19:50.070
<v Speaker 2>orphanage where they all died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we won't.</v>

1669
01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:52.860
<v Speaker 2>So we won't talk too much about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rousseau.</v>

1670
01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:56.730
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next taboo is,</v>

1671
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:58.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that parents can dislike their children,</v>

1672
01:19:58.940 --> 01:19:59.773
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a clinician and you don't </v>

1673
01:20:01.141 --> 01:20:03.210
<v Speaker 2>think that parents can dislike their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

1674
01:20:03.211 --> 01:20:06.870
<v Speaker 2>then well then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you're not a clinician because</v>

1675
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:07.853
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you constantly see is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that pathology within families is an </v>

1676
01:20:12.361 --> 01:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>incredibly con common source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological destabilization,</v>

1677
01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.113
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's terrible tension between </v>

1678
01:20:19.501 --> 01:20:21.390
<v Speaker 2>parents and their children in between </v>
<v Speaker 2>siblings.</v>

1679
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.940
<v Speaker 2>What I suggest in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the book,</v>

1680
01:20:23.941 --> 01:20:27.360
<v Speaker 2>which I think is radical by today's </v>
<v Speaker 2>standards,</v>

1681
01:20:27.361 --> 01:20:32.361
<v Speaker 2>is that your fundamental job as a parent</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to ensure that by the time your child</v>

1682
01:20:34.441 --> 01:20:35.274
<v Speaker 2>is four years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are maximally desirable to </v>

1683
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:39.534
<v Speaker 2>other children and to adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what happens is that after the </v>

1684
01:20:43.681 --> 01:20:44.514
<v Speaker 2>age of four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you aren't the primary agent of </v>

1685
01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:47.424
<v Speaker 2>socialization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The social world becomes the primary </v>

1686
01:20:50.341 --> 01:20:51.174
<v Speaker 2>agent of socialization and if your child</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the sort of child that's invited to </v>

1687
01:20:55.501 --> 01:20:56.334
<v Speaker 2>play by other children because your </v>
<v Speaker 2>child is capable of for stolen </v>

1688
01:20:59.551 --> 01:21:03.600
<v Speaker 2>gratification and taking turns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing someone else's game when,</v>

1689
01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.553
<v Speaker 2>when it's necessary and abiding by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and not having a temper tantrum </v>

1690
01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:10.890
<v Speaker 2>when they lose and not getting to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1691
01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:14.340
<v Speaker 2>high on their horse when they win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then many children,</v>

1692
01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:15.970
<v Speaker 2>we'll invite them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1693
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:18.083
<v Speaker 5>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait.</v>

1694
01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.040
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just say it.</v>

1695
01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.010
<v Speaker 5>What do you want me to know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1696
01:21:22.011 --> 01:21:22.844
<v Speaker 5>I know we have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have our limited time and so I just </v>

1697
01:21:25.451 --> 01:21:26.590
<v Speaker 5>wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was actually saying</v>

1698
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:28.423
<v Speaker 2>any more.</v>

1699
01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:30.493
<v Speaker 5>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was selfish of me because I really </v>

1700
01:21:32.331 --> 01:21:33.980
<v Speaker 5>wanted to hear you talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1701
01:21:33.981 --> 01:21:37.810
<v Speaker 5>I just want to let them all take 15 </v>
<v Speaker 5>seconds to wrap that up and then stop.</v>

1702
01:21:37.811 --> 01:21:38.601
<v Speaker 5>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>

1703
01:21:38.601 --> 01:21:39.434
<v Speaker 5>So look,</v>

1704
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:40.423
<v Speaker 2>you get married when you have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>children and you're flawed and your </v>

1705
01:21:43.461 --> 01:21:46.040
<v Speaker 2>partner's flawed and hopefully you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>flawed and different ways.</v>

1706
01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:46.874
<v Speaker 2>And so you put the two of you together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you make one approximately normal </v>

1707
01:21:49.581 --> 01:21:54.581
<v Speaker 2>person and then hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then your child has to interact with</v>

1708
01:21:54.831 --> 01:21:55.664
<v Speaker 2>that dyad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a reasonable representative of </v>

1709
01:21:58.341 --> 01:22:01.370
<v Speaker 2>social norms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they disappear,</v>

1710
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:04.790
<v Speaker 2>if your child disappoints you with their</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

1711
01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:08.570
<v Speaker 2>the probability that they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappoint other people is very high.</v>

1712
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:09.703
<v Speaker 2>And so you have an ethical obligation to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ensure that your child is behaving in a </v>

1713
01:22:14.031 --> 01:22:18.530
<v Speaker 2>manner that makes them optimally </v>
<v Speaker 2>desirable to their playmates and also to</v>

1714
01:22:18.531 --> 01:22:19.364
<v Speaker 2>other adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then the kids invite them to </v>

1715
01:22:22.041 --> 01:22:25.130
<v Speaker 2>play and they get to be socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1716
01:22:25.131 --> 01:22:27.170
<v Speaker 2>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have friends for God's sake.</v>

1717
01:22:27.171 --> 01:22:28.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want for your kids?</v>

1718
01:22:28.431 --> 01:22:30.770
<v Speaker 2>How about some friends?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't that be nice?</v>

1719
01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:31.843
<v Speaker 2>And maybe what you'd like is that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulate their behavior well enough so </v>

1720
01:22:34.641 --> 01:22:37.970
<v Speaker 2>that when you take them places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants to see your friends,</v>

1721
01:22:37.971 --> 01:22:38.804
<v Speaker 2>to see your relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they behave in a manner that's </v>

1722
01:22:40.611 --> 01:22:41.444
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So their intrinsic charm wins over the </v>

1723
01:22:45.291 --> 01:22:48.950
<v Speaker 2>adults and everywhere they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are smiling and welcoming instead</v>

1724
01:22:48.951 --> 01:22:49.784
<v Speaker 2>of wishing with fake smiles that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn Bruh would leave along with their </v>

1725
01:22:53.721 --> 01:22:56.090
<v Speaker 2>foolish parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not a good,</v>

1726
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:57.103
<v Speaker 2>that's not a good environment to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>your child constantly exposed to no </v>

1727
01:23:01.911 --> 01:23:06.911
<v Speaker 2>friends because they're too selfish and </v>
<v Speaker 2>immature and irritated era irritating to</v>

1728
01:23:07.271 --> 01:23:11.560
<v Speaker 2>adults so that they're barely tolerated </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the mask of false smiles.</v>

1729
01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:12.813
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have an ethical obligation</v>
<v Speaker 2>to regulate your child's behavior so </v>

1730
01:23:15.851 --> 01:23:17.800
<v Speaker 2>that they're optimally acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially.</v>

1731
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:21.130
<v Speaker 2>And that is not how people look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>children in the modern world.</v>

1732
01:23:21.131 --> 01:23:21.964
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you raising their self esteem or </v>

1733
01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.364
<v Speaker 2>you're enhancing their creativity or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to put constraints on their </v>

1734
01:23:26.831 --> 01:23:27.664
<v Speaker 2>behavior because you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interfere with the flowering of their </v>

1735
01:23:30.011 --> 01:23:31.780
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1736
01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:34.620
<v Speaker 2>it's all Bruce Soliah nonsense and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1737
01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:39.370
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's no evidence that's rice.</v>

1738
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Father,</v>

1739
01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:41.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was straight</v>

1740
01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:43.243
<v Speaker 1>am such a corrupt and he had these </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies with this poor scullery maid and </v>

1741
01:23:46.941 --> 01:23:51.941
<v Speaker 1>left them all in a actually a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they would just languish and die.</v>

1742
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:53.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1743
01:23:53.341 --> 01:23:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Five of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rousseau.</v>

1744
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1745
01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:56.281
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1746
01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:57.390
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1747
01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.220
<v Speaker 2>and Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Is intrinsically good.</v>

1748
01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:00.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What external?</v>

1749
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:01.203
<v Speaker 5>Sean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sean,</v>

1750
01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:03.653
<v Speaker 1>a few weeks ago I was reading about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and somehow I got onto somebody's </v>

1751
01:24:07.651 --> 01:24:10.500
<v Speaker 1>twitter feed whom I will not mention </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1752
01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:11.730
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

1753
01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:16.320
<v Speaker 1>a difficult person and she was attacking</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and had a,</v>

1754
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:17.383
<v Speaker 1>a selection from your book a bit where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had called two-year-olds little </v>

1755
01:24:21.691 --> 01:24:22.524
<v Speaker 1>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so suddenly all of these distraught </v>

1756
01:24:26.281 --> 01:24:29.310
<v Speaker 1>twitter followers of this feminist we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1757
01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:32.070
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the monster.</v>

1758
01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Little monsters and nobody,</v>

1759
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:37.440
<v Speaker 5>and then occasionally there'd be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>parent</v>

1760
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.373
<v Speaker 1>who would take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of two year olds kind of our </v>

1761
01:24:40.931 --> 01:24:41.830
<v Speaker 1>monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1762
01:24:41.831 --> 01:24:42.664
<v Speaker 1>and then there'd be eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can kind of art and they had </v>

1763
01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:49.770
<v Speaker 1>taken this out of context and shown it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like just something to deplore in a bit.</v>

1764
01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:52.460
<v Speaker 1>And it was so amusing to me this little,</v>

1765
01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:54.240
<v Speaker 2>hopefully they will soon be cursed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some too.</v>

1766
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:59.890
<v Speaker 5>I won't tell say which one was two years</v>
<v Speaker 5>old.</v>

1767
01:24:59.891 --> 01:25:00.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1768
01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a good boy,</v>

1769
01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.460
<v Speaker 1>but he had an insane meltdown in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermarket.</v>

1770
01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I was with my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both pretended we didn't know.</v>

1771
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:11.160
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be the parent.</v>

1772
01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:12.870
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch.</v>

1773
01:25:12.871 --> 01:25:14.400
<v Speaker 5>And we heard people say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1774
01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:16.860
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A child watching a two year old having a</v>

1775
01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:18.870
<v Speaker 5>Tantrum is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so terrifying.</v>

1776
01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.940
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to be associated with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The</v>

1777
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:24.120
<v Speaker 2>boy who used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when my wife was taken care of more kids</v>

1778
01:25:24.121 --> 01:25:26.110
<v Speaker 2>than ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a little boy who,</v>

1779
01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:28.470
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had learned to throw a pretty decent</v>

1780
01:25:28.471 --> 01:25:29.304
<v Speaker 2>town and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would do that and it didn't work </v>

1781
01:25:32.041 --> 01:25:32.874
<v Speaker 2>in our house because we just leave him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have his tantrum and going into to a </v>

1782
01:25:35.101 --> 01:25:37.250
<v Speaker 2>different room and then he'd kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up out of it.</v>

1783
01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.000
<v Speaker 2>There wouldn't be anybody around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that,</v>

1784
01:25:39.330 --> 01:25:40.163
<v Speaker 2>like if you put all that words audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic display and you have zero </v>

1785
01:25:43.081 --> 01:25:43.891
<v Speaker 2>audios,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1786
01:25:43.891 --> 01:25:47.050
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to sustain it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could actually turn,</v>

1787
01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:51.020
<v Speaker 2>hold his breath until he turned blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you should try that.</v>

1788
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:53.160
<v Speaker 2>You go home and see if you could do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of the mirror man.</v>

1789
01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Like it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

1790
01:25:55.261 --> 01:25:57.330
<v Speaker 2>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to hire it will you do.</v>

1791
01:25:57.330 --> 01:25:58.620
<v Speaker 2>It was impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1792
01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:01.110
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two year olds are very impressive.</v>

1793
01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:01.973
<v Speaker 2>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have unbelievable of rage and </v>

1794
01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.740
<v Speaker 2>dis-inhibited emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your job is,</v>

1795
01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:07.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1796
01:26:07.641 --> 01:26:08.474
<v Speaker 2>they're driven by these underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational systems that are </v>

1797
01:26:11.421 --> 01:26:12.254
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's part of what makes them </v>

1798
01:26:13.941 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 2>delightful because when they're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're insanely happy.</v>

1799
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 2>And when they're playful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're incredibly playful.</v>

1800
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:23.930
<v Speaker 2>And so the positive end of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is way exaggerated compared to,</v>

1801
01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rather drab adult.</v>

1802
01:26:25.381 --> 01:26:26.214
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it makes two year olds </v>

1803
01:26:27.051 --> 01:26:27.884
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the same is true on the negative </v>

1804
01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:32.840
<v Speaker 2>emotion side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're completely dysregulated and it's</v>

1805
01:26:32.841 --> 01:26:36.080
<v Speaker 2>really hard on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to have a two year old who isn't in</v>

1806
01:26:36.081 --> 01:26:36.914
<v Speaker 2>control of their emotions means that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a child who's developing central </v>

1807
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:41.900
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1808
01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:42.830
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ego,</v>

1809
01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:43.664
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is constantly being swamped by these </v>

1810
01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:48.470
<v Speaker 2>powerful underlying emotional systems.</v>

1811
01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:49.513
<v Speaker 2>You know what it's like if you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>enraged for any period of time or if </v>

1812
01:26:52.281 --> 01:26:54.950
<v Speaker 2>you're engulfed by grief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's exhausting.</v>

1813
01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:55.880
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1814
01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.300
<v Speaker 2>it's demeaning and it's exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same with a little kid.</v>

1815
01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:00.134
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a real defeat for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing integrated individual to be </v>

1816
01:27:05.001 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 2>subjugated by those catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful emergency motions.</v>

1817
01:27:09.801 --> 01:27:10.634
<v Speaker 2>And part of your job as a parent is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>scaffold the part of the child that can </v>

1818
01:27:15.141 --> 01:27:18.230
<v Speaker 2>regulate and inhibit those powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying systems.</v>

1819
01:27:18.231 --> 01:27:19.880
<v Speaker 2>So with my son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1820
01:27:19.881 --> 01:27:22.550
<v Speaker 2>when he used to misbehave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would count,</v>

1821
01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.170
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're going to go sit on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps.</v>

1822
01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.760
<v Speaker 2>He'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no I'm not.</v>

1823
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes you are.</v>

1824
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:31.400
<v Speaker 2>And then usually I'd have to chase him </v>
<v Speaker 2>around because he wouldn't go sit on the</v>

1825
01:27:31.401 --> 01:27:33.050
<v Speaker 2>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I put him on the steps.</v>

1826
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Say you're going to sit there until </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got yourself under control.</v>

1827
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:37.790
<v Speaker 2>And so he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1828
01:27:37.791 --> 01:27:38.624
<v Speaker 2>I not say yes you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he tried to get up and I just </v>

1829
01:27:41.001 --> 01:27:42.920
<v Speaker 2>told them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you're going to sit there,</v>

1830
01:27:42.921 --> 01:27:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hold you until you sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1831
01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1832
01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like I could out wait a two year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

1833
01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:52.140
<v Speaker 2>So I usually won those battles and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd sit there and I say,</v>

1834
01:27:52.141 --> 01:27:53.330
<v Speaker 2>look kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the deal.</v>

1835
01:27:53.331 --> 01:27:54.164
<v Speaker 2>Let's say two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you want to have a bad day or you </v>

1836
01:27:55.461 --> 01:27:57.620
<v Speaker 2>want to have a good day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about that because if you want</v>

1837
01:27:57.621 --> 01:27:58.690
<v Speaker 2>to have a good day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1838
01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.820
<v Speaker 2>you can just have a better idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to have a bad day,</v>

1839
01:28:01.821 --> 01:28:02.654
<v Speaker 2>we could have a bad days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sit here and as soon as you can </v>

1840
01:28:04.281 --> 01:28:05.114
<v Speaker 2>control yourself and you're ready to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilized than you can come back and we </v>

1841
01:28:08.241 --> 01:28:12.620
<v Speaker 2>can have a good day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He'd sit there just,</v>

1842
01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was unbelievable to watch.</v>

1843
01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Just the developed with rage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1844
01:28:16.941 --> 01:28:19.910
<v Speaker 2>just trying to get himself under </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

1845
01:28:19.911 --> 01:28:20.744
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'd come back 30 seconds later </v>

1846
01:28:21.981 --> 01:28:23.660
<v Speaker 2>and I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1847
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:26.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's got yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got your act together yet.</v>

1848
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:30.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1849
01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:31.473
<v Speaker 2>I wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually it took them two or three </v>

1850
01:28:33.021 --> 01:28:35.690
<v Speaker 2>minutes and he'd calm down and then he'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back out and you'd say,</v>

1851
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to have a good day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he meant it,</v>

1852
01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:39.590
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell he meant it too,</v>

1853
01:28:39.591 --> 01:28:40.424
<v Speaker 2>because whatever resentment I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>harboring towards him for his </v>

1854
01:28:43.731 --> 01:28:44.564
<v Speaker 2>misbehavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to watch that when you're </v>

1855
01:28:46.251 --> 01:28:48.860
<v Speaker 2>an adult would vanish because he'd come </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he'd,</v>

1856
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:51.050
<v Speaker 2>he was done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was ready,</v>

1857
01:28:51.051 --> 01:28:51.890
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1858
01:28:51.891 --> 01:28:52.724
<v Speaker 2>to proceed on a civilized basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was really interesting to watch </v>

1859
01:28:56.061 --> 01:29:00.020
<v Speaker 2>that because it took him every time he </v>
<v Speaker 2>sat on the steps,</v>

1860
01:29:00.021 --> 01:29:02.760
<v Speaker 2>it took them a shorter and shorter </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time to attain mastery.</v>

1861
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Until,</v>

1862
01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:04.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got to the point where he could only </v>

1863
01:29:05.911 --> 01:29:10.620
<v Speaker 2>have to sit for 15 seconds or so when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would bring himself under control.</v>

1864
01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:12.610
<v Speaker 2>And that was a victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

1865
01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:13.613
<v Speaker 2>if you imagine the neurological systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop that are responsible for </v>

1866
01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:17.274
<v Speaker 2>personality integration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a victory for those systems </v>

1867
01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:22.900
<v Speaker 2>because they were attaining the ability </v>
<v Speaker 2>to regulate the lower order,</v>

1868
01:29:22.901 --> 01:29:25.980
<v Speaker 2>spontaneous emotions and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1869
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.903
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he turned into an individual who's </v>

1870
01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.860
<v Speaker 2>capable of a tremendous level of self </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and you know,</v>

1871
01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:32.490
<v Speaker 2>when he had</v>

1872
01:29:32.490 --> 01:29:34.590
<v Speaker 5>large gaming with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1873
01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.500
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1874
01:29:36.501 --> 01:29:38.750
<v Speaker 5>and while it didn't turned out well for </v>
<v Speaker 5>my daughter to be,</v>

1875
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:39.623
<v Speaker 2>cause she ended up being very ill and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up being extraordinarily </v>

1876
01:29:42.630 --> 01:29:44.100
<v Speaker 2>levelheaded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead reliable,</v>

1877
01:29:44.101 --> 01:29:45.360
<v Speaker 2>and thank God for that.</v>

1878
01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:46.603
<v Speaker 5>Could you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could you come to my house and do that </v>

1879
01:29:47.571 --> 01:29:50.600
<v Speaker 5>for my little multiple izzy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I can't,</v>

1880
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:53.200
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't eat.</v>

1881
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:55.420
<v Speaker 5>I can't train her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like a woman and ice.</v>

1882
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:56.263
<v Speaker 5>The next book a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to have rules on how to </v>

1883
01:29:59.301 --> 01:30:02.030
<v Speaker 5>train your dog.</v>

<v Speaker 5>what's with petting the cat.</v>

1886
01:30:06.170 --> 01:30:08.510

<v Speaker 5>begin with,</v>

1887
01:30:08.511 --> 01:30:10.940
<v Speaker 5>just to satisfy the dog that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>satisfy.</v>

1888
01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:11.993
<v Speaker 5>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got a score.</v>

1889
01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.630

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
