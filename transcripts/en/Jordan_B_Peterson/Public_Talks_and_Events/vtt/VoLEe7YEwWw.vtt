<v Speaker 1>Hi Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back on February 20th,</v>

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I announced that I was going to go to 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>different cities in North America and </v>

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.330
<v Speaker 1>talk about my new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life and a variety of other</v>

4
00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:18.331
<v Speaker 1>things and so we arranged theaters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put those tickets up for sale and </v>

5
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>they've proved very popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the first one this week on Sunday </v>

6
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>in New York at the beacon theater to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience of about 3000 people and it </v>

7
00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 1>seemed to go very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequences of that is that I'm now</v>

8
00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:38.860
<v Speaker 1>announcing another 20 cities and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video to make that announcement.</v>

9
