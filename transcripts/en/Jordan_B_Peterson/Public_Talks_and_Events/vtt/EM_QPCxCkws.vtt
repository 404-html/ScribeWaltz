WEBVTT

1
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I get get from a coma,</v>

2
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to switch to English since we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

3
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Since Jordan hasn't had Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson hasn't had time to learn enough</v>

4
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>icelandic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so thank you all for coming.</v>

6
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.570
<v Speaker 1>This has been amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>first when I got the idea to book into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iceland,</v>

8
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea that others had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching him on youtube.</v>

9
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as it turns out,</v>

10
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:42.721
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have been and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's exploded since then in popularity.</v>

11
00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 1>So we've sold out this venue which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost three times larger than the first</v>

12
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>one we had and we've sold it out two </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

13
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty good.</v>

14
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

15
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna come up here and he's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak for one hour and 15 minutes </v>

17
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>just about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>then he's going to take a four minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>break and go off stage before the q and </v>

19
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.610
<v Speaker 1>you can submit questions to the q and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're gonna use a similar system </v>

21
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>that he's been using on his trips in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America with Dave Ruben.</v>

22
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to serve as a surrogate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin here are slightly less gay,</v>

23
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

24
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>and I'll bring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

25
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:46.671
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask him the questions and you will </v>

26
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:49.071
<v Speaker 1>put them online on a site called slido.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's spelled l I dropped the O </v>

27
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.340
<v Speaker 1>slideshow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it in Icelandic as well as a </v>

28
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 1>punter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dia or slidell.</v>

29
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

30
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is customary to introduce the speaker</v>

31
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.700
<v Speaker 1>as if you know me better than him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

33
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>and usually when someone is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced,</v>

34
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people tell things about him,</v>

35
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.260
<v Speaker 1>things that are true about that speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now of course you've all come here </v>

36
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.310
<v Speaker 1>because you know who that guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to do a different thing </v>

38
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.300
<v Speaker 1>because I think it has tells you more </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply something about what is going on </v>

39
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:44.061
<v Speaker 1>with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to read you a few things </v>

40
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:48.261
<v Speaker 1>that are wrong about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are actual things that have </v>

41
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:55.431
<v Speaker 1>been said about him in media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly in hit pieces and um,</v>

42
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>character assassination attempts and </v>

43
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.370
<v Speaker 1>there has been one each day just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and some of them and be </v>

44
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>big media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

45
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>he's a bright guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>

46
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>he wants to force young women into </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

47
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.490
<v Speaker 1>He's the stupid people's smart person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually not that bad about him,</v>

48
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.910
<v Speaker 1>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the reason they say that they</v>

49
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>want you to become afraid to admit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you like him or go to his talks,</v>

50
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.550
<v Speaker 1>well groomed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alter,</v>

51
00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least he's well groomed,</v>

52
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a messiah come,</v>

53
00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:47.321
<v Speaker 1>surrogate dad for gormless dimwits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another one directed that you,</v>

54
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

55
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of you as well because I don't </v>

56
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>know what gormless means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

57
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.021
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that having a quorum is </v>

58
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:03.841
<v Speaker 1>preferable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just stay away from this guy them </v>

59
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 1>with Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson has nothing of value to say.</v>

60
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.870
<v Speaker 1>He's a patriarchal pseudo scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He encourages young men to see </v>

61
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>themselves as victims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a Mashup of.</v>

62
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>He has delivered a Mashup of cosmo tips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my first book of myths,</v>

63
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.870
<v Speaker 1>he's the professor of piffle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.950
<v Speaker 1>he seems like a terrible therapist is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad political and social thinker,</v>

65
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>an angry white guy.</v>

66
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.650
<v Speaker 1>And the line between Peterson's </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism and Richard Spencer's </v>

67
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.581
<v Speaker 1>Paleo Nazi-ism is a blurry one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a Jewish shill.</v>

68
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to be a shill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be a Jewish shoe,</v>

69
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a fascist.</v>

70
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Ms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

71
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.880
<v Speaker 1>This is just a small sample of what has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been going on and it's all wrong </v>

72
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.080
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you define chill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chill,</v>

74
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.120
<v Speaker 1>she'll is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all wrong.</v>

75
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>And that tells you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new one everyday to miss informed </v>

76
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 1>people about that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can demonstrate it.</v>

77
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It's demonstratively false everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are some people that see him </v>

78
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:29.671
<v Speaker 1>as a risk to their agenda and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>world view for some reason,</v>

79
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 1>but he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a reasonable,</v>

80
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>a balanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderate,</v>

81
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.350
<v Speaker 1>truthful man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've never seen such a campaign </v>

82
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.570
<v Speaker 1>against any thinker ever in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.720
<v Speaker 1>not even someone that is untruthful or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask this despicable as they make him </v>

84
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>sound like.</v>

85
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this tells you something.</v>

86
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:56.851
<v Speaker 1>This is the reason I was reading this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This tells you something about the </v>

87
00:05:56.851 --> 00:06:00.931
<v Speaker 1>importance of his message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not gonna I'm not gonna theorize</v>

88
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:07.001
<v Speaker 1>about exactly what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are lots of theories about</v>

89
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>exactly what it is in what he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is threatening.</v>

90
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.320
<v Speaker 1>And to whom it is threatening and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think actually many of them are correct,</v>

91
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.930
<v Speaker 1>but let's just listen to him and let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear what he has to say and we'll,</v>

92
00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure out why it's threatening </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

93
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.320
<v Speaker 1>So please give a warm welcome to Dr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan b Peterson.</v>

94
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

95
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an introduction that I'm going to</v>

96
00:07:16.681 --> 00:07:21.681
<v Speaker 3>have to live up to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was thinking the other day about </v>

97
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.430
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

98
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.450
<v Speaker 3>there are mathematicians who think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't anything more real than </v>

99
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.150
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's an interesting proposition.</v>

100
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's obviously the case that once</v>
<v Speaker 3>you invent or discover numbers that that</v>

101
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 3>confers on you a tremendous power and </v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows the limits of that power and </v>

102
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:08.100
<v Speaker 3>the claim that numbers are more real </v>
<v Speaker 3>than anything else is predicated in part</v>

103
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:12.010
<v Speaker 3>on the fact that when you discovered </v>
<v Speaker 3>them or invent them and start to utilize</v>

104
00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:17.011
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your ability to operate in the </v>

105
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:20.390
<v Speaker 3>world expands immensely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

106
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.430
<v Speaker 3>and so that's one of the ways of judging</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not something is real is </v>

107
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.400
<v Speaker 3>whether or not when you use it </v>
<v Speaker 3>facilitates your means of operating in </v>

108
00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:33.370
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interestingly,</v>

109
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:39.270
<v Speaker 3>numbers are abstractions and so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>raises another question which is,</v>

110
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.780
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's more real,</v>

111
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.990
<v Speaker 3>the thing that's being abstracted from </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the abstractions and again,</v>

112
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 3>that's not obvious and maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>question of more real isn't Germane.</v>

113
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a question of equal reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not obvious that abstractions </v>

114
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.221
<v Speaker 3>aren't real and you can make a damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong case that there are more real </v>

115
00:09:07.221 --> 00:09:09.240
<v Speaker 3>than anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then you might ask yourself,</v>

116
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 3>well then what are the most real </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstractions?</v>

117
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what I'm going to start to</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about tonight.</v>

118
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to talk about it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to as many rules as I can </v>

119
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 3>lay out simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go through the rules first.</v>

120
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 3>So rule one is stand up straight with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your shoulders back,</v>

121
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:40.130
<v Speaker 3>and rule two is treat yourself like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're someone responsible for helping a</v>

122
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.320
<v Speaker 3>number three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very tightly associated with </v>

123
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.841
<v Speaker 3>number two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are sort of variations on a theme </v>

124
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Speaker 3>is make friends with those people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>want the best for you.</v>

125
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:58.190
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these last two rules aren't injunctions </v>

126
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.900
<v Speaker 3>designed to make your life easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're actually injunctions designed to</v>

127
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:05.901
<v Speaker 3>make your life more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Character Guard said at one point that </v>

128
00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:10.821
<v Speaker 3>his role in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given that everything was proceeding to </v>

129
00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 3>become easier and easier in all possible</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways,</v>

130
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 3>that there would come a time when people</v>
<v Speaker 3>would cry out for difficulty,</v>

131
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 3>and so that's partly how he envisioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>his role in the world.</v>

132
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a universal benefactor of mankind who</v>

133
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:28.770
<v Speaker 3>would strive to do nothing other than to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make life more difficult for everyone.</v>

134
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so rule two and three are like that </v>

135
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.650
<v Speaker 3>because treat yourself as if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone responsible for helping isn't </v>

136
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.630
<v Speaker 3>the same as be nice to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that and to associate with </v>

137
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:46.131
<v Speaker 3>people who want the best for you means </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they get to demand the best from </v>

138
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's also not an easy thing.</v>

139
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Rule four is compare yourself to who you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were yesterday and not to who someone </v>

140
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:57.060
<v Speaker 3>else is today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's an injunction about envy,</v>

141
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to.</v>

142
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.670
<v Speaker 3>You need people who you need things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are above you because you need to do </v>

143
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.320
<v Speaker 3>something worthwhile with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need something to a map,</v>

144
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:12.321
<v Speaker 3>but one of the consequences of that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can become envious of people </v>

145
00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:16.971
<v Speaker 3>that you believe have attained more in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>deserved or undeserved manner and that </v>

146
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:22.071
<v Speaker 3>can make you better and so it's much </v>
<v Speaker 3>better to compare yourself to yourself </v>

147
00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 3>and to use yourself as the target for </v>
<v Speaker 3>improvement and comparison.</v>

148
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.700
<v Speaker 3>Rule five is don't let your children do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that makes you dislike them and</v>

149
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:32.640
<v Speaker 3>the rule of thumb there is if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>dislike them,</v>

150
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.700
<v Speaker 3>then other people will and it's a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea to allow your children to act in a </v>

151
00:11:38.461 --> 00:11:43.110
<v Speaker 3>way that makes other children disliked </v>
<v Speaker 3>them or adults disliked them,</v>

152
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:48.350
<v Speaker 3>given that they're going to have to deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with children and they're going to have </v>

153
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.350
<v Speaker 3>to deal with adults.</v>

154
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.640
<v Speaker 3>So your primary responsibility as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>parent is to help your child learn how </v>

155
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:57.801
<v Speaker 3>to behave so that the social world opens</v>
<v Speaker 3>up its arms to them and welcomes them at</v>

156
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:03.190
<v Speaker 3>every level and you've done your job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can manage that,</v>

157
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:08.250
<v Speaker 3>and it's not a simple thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rule six is put your house in perfect </v>

158
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.811
<v Speaker 3>order before you criticize the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not take no action for others</v>

159
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 3>until you have your act together that </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't what the rule means.</v>

160
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.660
<v Speaker 3>It means that bind your ambition with </v>
<v Speaker 3>humility and work on what's right in </v>

161
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 3>front of you that you will suffer for if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get wrong,</v>

162
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 3>before you engage in the large scale </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation of other people.</v>

163
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Rule seven is do what is meaningful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not what is expedient and I would say in</v>

164
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:48.811
<v Speaker 3>some sense in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the core ethos of the book.</v>

165
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.680
<v Speaker 3>Not exactly because rule eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is tell the truth or at least </v>

166
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.951
<v Speaker 3>don't lie as a necessary conjunction to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are unnecessary additional element </v>

167
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.950
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>pursue what is meaningful without </v>

168
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.401
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is if you don't </v>

169
00:13:08.401 --> 00:13:11.131
<v Speaker 3>tell the truth or let's say if you lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an easier way to think about </v>

170
00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:12.040
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You corrupt the mechanisms,</v>

171
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:17.041
<v Speaker 3>the instinctual mechanisms that that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that manifest themselves as meaning and </v>

172
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:21.340
<v Speaker 3>then you can't trust them and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very bad idea.</v>

173
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.760
<v Speaker 3>So the fundamental reason to not lie is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you corrupt your own </v>

174
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 3>perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you lie,</v>

175
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.040
<v Speaker 3>and when you corrupt your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptions,</v>

176
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.520
<v Speaker 3>then you can't rely on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you can't rely on yourself,</v>

177
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:38.521
<v Speaker 3>then well good luck to you because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going to rely on in the absence </v>

178
00:13:38.521 --> 00:13:39.550
<v Speaker 3>of your own judgment?</v>

179
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Your you've got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

180
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.100
<v Speaker 3>if you lose that rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rule eight a is,</v>

181
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.960
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell the truth or don't,</v>

182
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.150
<v Speaker 3>or at least don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rule nine,</v>

183
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.740
<v Speaker 3>assume that the person that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to know something you don't </v>

184
00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.890
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not so much a mark of respect for</v>

185
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:04.891
<v Speaker 3>the person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it is that it's a mark of </v>

186
00:14:04.891 --> 00:14:05.590
<v Speaker 3>recognition of your own unbearable </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignorance.</v>

187
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you have to do in life</v>

188
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:14.010
<v Speaker 3>is decide whether you're more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to make friends more with.</v>

189
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

190
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 3>let me rephrase that properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to decide what's more </v>

191
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.160
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you know or what you don't know.</v>

192
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of what you don't know and</v>

193
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:31.690
<v Speaker 3>so if you make friends with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you decide that's important,</v>

194
00:14:31.691 --> 00:14:36.691
<v Speaker 3>then well that's a good thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be surrounded by what </v>

195
00:14:36.691 --> 00:14:38.890
<v Speaker 3>you don't know your entire life and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're appreciative of that,</v>

196
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 3>then that's going to make things go </v>
<v Speaker 3>better for you.</v>

197
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.310
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other element of that is,</v>

198
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should you be appreciative of what </v>

199
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:51.240
<v Speaker 3>you don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>An answer to that is,</v>

200
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:51.440
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't.</v>

201
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 3>If you're life is absolutely perfect in </v>
<v Speaker 3>every way you have exactly what you need</v>

202
00:14:56.361 --> 00:15:01.361
<v Speaker 3>and want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've put everything in order around </v>

203
00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:04.421
<v Speaker 3>you then what you know is sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you believe that things could </v>

204
00:15:04.421 --> 00:15:08.771
<v Speaker 3>still be put right around you in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own personal life and with regard to the</v>

205
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:12.420
<v Speaker 3>effect that you have another people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then obviously what you don't yet know,</v>

206
00:15:12.421 --> 00:15:17.421
<v Speaker 3>it was more important than what you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>know and you should be paying attention </v>

207
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:18.920
<v Speaker 3>to find out what you don't know at every</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible moment.</v>

208
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:24.190
<v Speaker 3>And if you're fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have a conversation with </v>

209
00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 3>someone and you're actually interested </v>
<v Speaker 3>in what they say,</v>

210
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 3>then even if they're not very good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating,</v>

211
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.790
<v Speaker 3>even if they're awkward or even if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>display a certain amount of enmity </v>

212
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.390
<v Speaker 3>towards you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always the possibility that they</v>

213
00:15:35.391 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 3>might tell you something you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which case you can walk away from the</v>

214
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:44.291
<v Speaker 3>conversation less ignorant and corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 3>than you were when you started the </v>

215
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:45.290
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

216
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 3>And if your life isn't everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would like it to be,</v>

217
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 3>than being slightly less ignorant and </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt is probably a good thing.</v>

218
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 3>And so rule 10 is be precise in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech and that's.</v>

219
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:04.030
<v Speaker 3>That's an observation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that that's a variant of a </v>

220
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:09.311
<v Speaker 3>new testament injunction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is or maybe a description of the </v>

221
00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:13.061
<v Speaker 3>nature of the world which is knock and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the door will open and ask and you will </v>

222
00:16:13.061 --> 00:16:16.790
<v Speaker 3>receive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very strange theory,</v>

223
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.150
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but which I would say is far more in </v>

224
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.380
<v Speaker 3>accordance with what we know about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology of perception,</v>

225
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.600
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than you might imagine.</v>

226
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Because it is the case that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

227
00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:37.520
<v Speaker 3>What you don't aim at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might get what you do,</v>

228
00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:40.400
<v Speaker 3>a mat and your aim might get better as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you aim as well,</v>

229
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:41.660
<v Speaker 3>which is something to consider</v>

230
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:48.150
<v Speaker 3>if you specify the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

231
00:16:48.151 --> 00:16:52.200
<v Speaker 3>If you specify the nature of the being </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you want to bring into being,</v>

232
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.560
<v Speaker 3>then you radically increase the </v>
<v Speaker 3>probability that that's what will occur </v>

233
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.531
<v Speaker 3>and of course you all know that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you regard yourself at least to some </v>

234
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:03.210
<v Speaker 3>degree as active creative agents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

235
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Your fundamental attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself at at least in the manner that </v>

236
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:13.700
<v Speaker 3>you act towards yourself is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up in the morning and you have a </v>

237
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.081
<v Speaker 3>landscape of possibilities that lay </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves open to you and you make </v>

238
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:22.581
<v Speaker 3>choices between those possibilities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>determined in consequence how the world </v>

239
00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:26.850
<v Speaker 3>is going to manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you confront a field of potential.</v>

240
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and through your choices you determine </v>

241
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 3>which elements of that potential are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to concretize them selves into the</v>

242
00:17:35.941 --> 00:17:40.941
<v Speaker 3>real world and you are very unhappy with</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

243
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.520
<v Speaker 3>If you don't do that properly and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unhappy with other people.</v>

244
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:47.760
<v Speaker 3>If they don't do that properly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're very unhappy with other people,</v>

245
00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:52.761
<v Speaker 3>if they don't treat like that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like because part of what you </v>

246
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.760
<v Speaker 3>demand from people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say in terms of sheer civility is </v>

247
00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 3>that they act towards you is if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>the locus of voluntary choice in a world</v>

248
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:05.610
<v Speaker 3>of potential and you are braid each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other for that as well.</v>

249
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 3>If you have children and parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your parents will say to you,</v>

250
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 3>if you're fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not living up to your potential,</v>

251
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 3>which is actually a compliment in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>

252
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:20.721
<v Speaker 3>even though it's also a judgment and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>compliment is I know perfectly well that</v>

253
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:26.331
<v Speaker 3>you could be more than you are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll hang your head if you have any </v>

254
00:18:26.331 --> 00:18:28.290
<v Speaker 3>sense and you'll think like you think in</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to your own conscience that</v>

255
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.440
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of potential that I'm not </v>

256
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.321
<v Speaker 3>fully realizing and that actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitutes a transgression against the </v>

257
00:18:36.321 --> 00:18:37.380
<v Speaker 3>good and I don't.</v>

258
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever met anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't believe that.</v>

259
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.560
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a reasonable conversation </v>

260
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.250
<v Speaker 3>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just seems self evident.</v>

261
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:52.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe now and then you meet someone </v>

262
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.580
<v Speaker 3>who's narcissistically self satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they're narcissistic and that's</v>

263
00:18:53.581 --> 00:18:54.660
<v Speaker 3>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That as a,</v>

264
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:59.661
<v Speaker 3>as a medium to longterm strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a catastrophe that ends in </v>

265
00:18:59.661 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 3>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

266
00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:01.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a short term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It protects people,</v>

267
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 3>but longterm it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good in the least,</v>

268
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 3>and of course other people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate it as well.</v>

269
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Rule 11 is don't bother children when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're skateboarding and that's </v>

270
00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.851
<v Speaker 3>actually a discussion of courage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of encouragement more more specifically </v>

271
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.530
<v Speaker 3>because I've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to understand,</v>

272
00:19:19.531 --> 00:19:24.531
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what role parents play in the lives of </v>

273
00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:28.221
<v Speaker 3>their children and I would say this is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>role that that that is a fundamental </v>

274
00:19:28.221 --> 00:19:33.201
<v Speaker 3>importance as well as attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>guide your children so that they act in </v>

275
00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:37.710
<v Speaker 3>a socially desirable manner so that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world opens itself up to them.</v>

276
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.160
<v Speaker 3>You also want to encourage them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not the same as sheltering </v>

277
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.670
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same at all.</v>

278
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 3>And to encourage someone is to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

279
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:49.800
<v Speaker 3>or to act out something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

280
00:19:49.801 --> 00:19:54.801
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you move the world is already </v>

281
00:19:54.801 --> 00:19:58.881
<v Speaker 3>difficult because the world isn't easy </v>
<v Speaker 3>for children anymore than it's easy for </v>

282
00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:00.240
<v Speaker 3>adults that the difficulties are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not the same,</v>

283
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:03.390
<v Speaker 3>their child sized difficulties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are still difficulties.</v>

284
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.260
<v Speaker 3>The world is a very hard place and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bitter place in many ways and it's not</v>

285
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:15.051
<v Speaker 3>only a hard and bitter place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also touched with betrayal and </v>

286
00:20:15.051 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 3>malevolence and that's the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom line,</v>

287
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:22.070
<v Speaker 3>but there's something in you that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of taking that full on and </v>

288
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:26.940
<v Speaker 3>transcending it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>encouragement.</v>

289
00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

290
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:33.440
<v Speaker 3>as difficult as things are Europe to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge and to interfere with children</v>

291
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:37.350
<v Speaker 3>when they're skateboarding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

292
00:20:37.351 --> 00:20:42.351
<v Speaker 3>when they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say in advisably dangerous things </v>

293
00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:44.490
<v Speaker 3>which kids of course do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're skateboarding.</v>

294
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 3>To interfere with that is to interfere</v>

295
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:53.130
<v Speaker 4>with the child's willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily expose themselves to the </v>

296
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:58.321
<v Speaker 4>risks that they need to expose </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves to in order to develop this </v>

297
00:20:58.351 --> 00:21:03.351
<v Speaker 4>sort of competence that allows them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>thrive in a world they cannot be </v>

298
00:21:03.351 --> 00:21:07.891
<v Speaker 4>sheltered from and so to interfere with </v>
<v Speaker 4>children when they're taking necessary </v>

299
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:14.551
<v Speaker 4>risks is not love or empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but cowardice on the part of parents and</v>

300
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:19.861
<v Speaker 4>it's deeply damaging to children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I can tell you as a clinical </v>

301
00:21:19.861 --> 00:21:23.341
<v Speaker 4>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never had a client come to my </v>

302
00:21:23.341 --> 00:21:24.490
<v Speaker 4>office and all the hundreds in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

303
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 4>in all of the hundreds of encounters </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had with people in my office.</v>

304
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.490
<v Speaker 4>I've never had a client say my parents </v>
<v Speaker 4>made me to independent.</v>

305
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.510
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That hasn't happened once.</v>

306
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:43.290
<v Speaker 4>Right now my parents made me too </v>
<v Speaker 4>dependent or I conspired with my parents</v>

307
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:49.600
<v Speaker 4>to perpetuate my dependence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That happened all the time.</v>

308
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.010
<v Speaker 4>So there's a rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a good one,</v>

309
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:59.011
<v Speaker 4>which I believe is often applied in </v>
<v Speaker 4>nursing homes by people who work in </v>

310
00:21:59.011 --> 00:22:00.310
<v Speaker 4>nursing homes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is of course a very difficult job.</v>

311
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:05.020
<v Speaker 4>And the rule is do not do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone they can do for themselves.</v>

312
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.530
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>form of theft,</v>

313
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.090
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

314
00:22:10.091 --> 00:22:11.080
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

315
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:15.100
<v Speaker 4>if you do something for someone and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>facilitates their movement forward,</v>

316
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 4>then they moved forward because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>helped them.</v>

317
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.730
<v Speaker 4>Which is something I was very careful </v>
<v Speaker 4>about as a therapist.</v>

318
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:26.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to give my clients advice </v>
<v Speaker 4>first I it might fail,</v>

319
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:30.670
<v Speaker 4>in which case they are going to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 4>my advice and second,</v>

320
00:22:30.671 --> 00:22:34.300
<v Speaker 4>if it succeeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I get to be the successful one.</v>

321
00:22:34.301 --> 00:22:37.300
<v Speaker 4>And I don't want to steal the success </v>
<v Speaker 4>from my clients.</v>

322
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.480
<v Speaker 4>That's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to help them figure out what it </v>

323
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 4>is that they should aim at and then help</v>
<v Speaker 4>plot out a strategy for attaining that.</v>

324
00:22:45.881 --> 00:22:46.770
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

325
00:22:46.771 --> 00:22:51.771
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to ensure that it's their </v>

326
00:22:51.771 --> 00:22:52.510
<v Speaker 4>destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not something I'm imposing.</v>

327
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.290
<v Speaker 4>And of course the imposition of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of thing is the hallmark of a bad,</v>

328
00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:01.120
<v Speaker 4>I would say therapeutic relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also a bad relationship period.</v>

329
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.090
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things you want to do with</v>

330
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:05.500
<v Speaker 4>your partners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your spouse,</v>

331
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.520
<v Speaker 4>your say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your husband or wife and also with your </v>

332
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.171
<v Speaker 4>children is to listen to them so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can figure out what their problems </v>

333
00:23:13.171 --> 00:23:17.191
<v Speaker 4>are and figure out with them because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to figure that out by </v>

334
00:23:17.191 --> 00:23:19.630
<v Speaker 4>communicating and then perhaps aid them </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the development of a strategy.</v>

335
00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:24.631
<v Speaker 4>But you have to ensure very carefully </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're not imposing your own </v>

336
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:30.150
<v Speaker 4>structure in a manner that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>steal from them what's rightfully </v>

337
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.900
<v Speaker 4>theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

338
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:37.270
<v Speaker 4>so rule 11 is an injunction to courage </v>
<v Speaker 4>as the fundamental,</v>

339
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:42.630
<v Speaker 4>because you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what's the antidote to the </v>

340
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe of life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one answer might be safety.</v>

341
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:43.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

342
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:44.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

343
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 4>everyone's sensible enough to</v>

344
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.640
<v Speaker 3>know that a certain amount of provision </v>
<v Speaker 3>for safety is,</v>

345
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.940
<v Speaker 3>is worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should probably wear your seat belts</v>

346
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:57.350
<v Speaker 3>when you're driving around in your car </v>
<v Speaker 3>because why take foolhardy risks?</v>

347
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.750
<v Speaker 3>But given that there is no security in </v>
<v Speaker 3>life in the final analysis,</v>

348
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 3>then encouragement is a much better </v>
<v Speaker 3>medication than sheltering.</v>

349
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.220
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what,</v>

350
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:16.300
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's I think in keeping with the idea </v>

351
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.540
<v Speaker 3>that what life is essentially is not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>place to attain happiness or even to aim</v>

352
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:25.751
<v Speaker 3>for happiness even though you should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>grateful if someone comes along now and </v>

353
00:24:25.751 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a call to something like adventure,</v>

354
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.650
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's the proper way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualizing it.</v>

355
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Certainly if you go watch a story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a movie,</v>

356
00:24:33.551 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 3>you read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

357
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 3>If you encounter a narrative that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gripping,</v>

358
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.870
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a romance or a classic </v>
<v Speaker 3>adventure story,</v>

359
00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:45.560
<v Speaker 3>then the element of it that's gripping </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the adventure.</v>

360
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:51.130
<v Speaker 3>And so to portray life as an adventure </v>
<v Speaker 3>in romance and and in the world is the </v>

361
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.751
<v Speaker 3>proper way to portray it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way that you facilitate the </v>

362
00:24:57.801 --> 00:25:01.490
<v Speaker 3>adventure is through encouragement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a client once,</v>

363
00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:03.170
<v Speaker 3>I really liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a good guy,</v>

364
00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 3>smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good looking young guy,</v>

365
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.210
<v Speaker 3>had everything going for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

366
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.640
<v Speaker 3>he's a good musician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a talented athlete,</v>

367
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 3>but he hadn't been encouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say he told me about his </v>

368
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:19.950
<v Speaker 3>relationship with his girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

369
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:20.120
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

370
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.990
<v Speaker 3>his girlfriend wanted to go biking </v>
<v Speaker 3>around southern Ontario.</v>

371
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:31.830
<v Speaker 3>She was about 19 or 20 and he thought he</v>
<v Speaker 3>might join her and when she went and </v>

372
00:25:31.931 --> 00:25:36.931
<v Speaker 3>talked to her parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they made every provision possible to </v>

373
00:25:36.931 --> 00:25:40.270
<v Speaker 3>help her prepare for the journey to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure her bike was in good shape,</v>

374
00:25:40.271 --> 00:25:44.380
<v Speaker 3>to make sure she had the right equipment</v>
<v Speaker 3>to help her plot out a route and when he</v>

375
00:25:44.381 --> 00:25:49.381
<v Speaker 3>went and talked to his parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all they did was worried that he was </v>

376
00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:51.841
<v Speaker 3>going to get hurt and like he might get </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt because people get hurt,</v>

377
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:58.290
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't understand that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were choosing between the hurt that he </v>

378
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.460
<v Speaker 3>might encounter by going out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and having an adventure,</v>

379
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.640
<v Speaker 3>let's say with his girlfriend or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt that he would encounter by staying </v>

380
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.331
<v Speaker 3>at home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>powering in his basement under the </v>

381
00:26:09.331 --> 00:26:09.820
<v Speaker 3>protection of his over loving parents.</v>

382
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his girlfriend ventured bravely into the</v>

383
00:26:12.281 --> 00:26:13.450
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

384
00:26:13.451 --> 00:26:15.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of those two things is most likely</v>

385
00:26:15.311 --> 00:26:17.350
<v Speaker 3>to be damaging?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And their answer to that is,</v>

386
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.840
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his parents wouldn't worry as much as if</v>

387
00:26:19.841 --> 00:26:22.330
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he was in the basement and that's the</v>

388
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:25.630
<v Speaker 3>wrong worry even because they should </v>
<v Speaker 3>worry more,</v>

389
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:31.470
<v Speaker 3>not less so in rural 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his pedicab when you encounter one on </v>

390
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:36.391
<v Speaker 3>the street and it's a oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a meditation on fragility.</v>

391
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 3>It's a discussion of what you do when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what do and that's really</v>

392
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:49.200
<v Speaker 3>when things have gone badly for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you face a terrible tragedy in your</v>

393
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:53.100
<v Speaker 3>own personal life or in your familiar </v>
<v Speaker 3>life or perhaps even in the life of your</v>

394
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When things come crowding in and you too</v>

395
00:26:55.531 --> 00:27:00.531
<v Speaker 3>quickly in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the case of a death in the family or </v>

396
00:27:00.531 --> 00:27:03.921
<v Speaker 3>a terrible illness or the collapse of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dream or any of the things that can flip</v>

397
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:04.620
<v Speaker 3>your world.</v>

398
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Upside down is how do you cope with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that chapter contains discussion of </v>

399
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.710
<v Speaker 3>the necessity of narrowing your </v>
<v Speaker 3>timeframe.</v>

400
00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:20.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes the right way to look </v>

401
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.701
<v Speaker 3>at the world is across years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's across months and when </v>

402
00:27:22.701 --> 00:27:26.280
<v Speaker 3>things are more out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps it's across days and when things</v>

403
00:27:26.281 --> 00:27:28.590
<v Speaker 3>are really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're really up against the wall,</v>

404
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:33.591
<v Speaker 3>it's a car across hours or even minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and during those minutes than you </v>

405
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:38.871
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on doing as well as you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>with what's right in front of you for </v>

406
00:27:38.871 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 3>the longest unit of time that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerate conceptualizing.</v>

407
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what you do at someone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>deathbed and while you're doing that in </v>

408
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:51.290
<v Speaker 3>suffering away madly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you also take the time to </v>

409
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.070
<v Speaker 3>appreciate everything you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That manifests itself.</v>

410
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.960
<v Speaker 3>That allows itself to be appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the metaphor of the cat,</v>

411
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 3>I suppose.</v>

412
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:04.430
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the 12 rules and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>return to rule one which is stand up </v>

413
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:08.661
<v Speaker 3>straight with your shoulders back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to use it as a platform </v>

414
00:28:08.661 --> 00:28:12.710
<v Speaker 3>for laying out the abstractions that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to at the beginning of the </v>

415
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:17.300
<v Speaker 3>lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some of you might be familiar with </v>

416
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.231
<v Speaker 3>the central Dallas symbol and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbol of dao and dow is a very strange </v>

417
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:27.710
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have an easily translatable </v>

418
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.130
<v Speaker 3>single meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least in English.</v>

419
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.430
<v Speaker 3>It means a variety of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means the path of life.</v>

420
00:28:32.431 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 3>So that would mean the the path that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>take as you move forward through life,</v>

421
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.550
<v Speaker 3>but it would mean more also the proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>path.</v>

422
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.890
<v Speaker 3>So it's that it's the proper path </v>
<v Speaker 3>through life.</v>

423
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.040
<v Speaker 3>So the idea dow is a symbol of reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that means is the </v>

424
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:50.961
<v Speaker 3>path you take through life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's an implicit idea there </v>

425
00:28:50.961 --> 00:28:53.790
<v Speaker 3>that the fundamental reality of life is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the path you take through life.</v>

426
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.180
<v Speaker 3>It's not a materialist idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a different kind of idea.</v>

427
00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:02.330
<v Speaker 3>It's the idea that life is a journey </v>
<v Speaker 3>while we're mobile creatures and we're </v>

428
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:06.231
<v Speaker 3>on a journey and the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualize reality has as the place </v>

429
00:29:06.231 --> 00:29:08.070
<v Speaker 3>that you journey through and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>question is,</v>

430
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the elements?</v>

431
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.320
<v Speaker 3>What are the constituent elements of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>place that you journey through?</v>

432
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Because that's also part of Dow and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dallas believed that that's the Yin and </v>

433
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.951
<v Speaker 3>Yang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Yin is the black serpent because </v>

434
00:29:21.951 --> 00:29:23.550
<v Speaker 3>those are two serpent's head to head </v>
<v Speaker 3>that make up the totality of the world,</v>

435
00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:27.900
<v Speaker 3>and the black serpent is Yin and Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yin is feminine.</v>

436
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.540
<v Speaker 3>Classically speaking from the Taoist </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

437
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:35.541
<v Speaker 3>it's a symbolic representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that women or men and </v>

438
00:29:35.541 --> 00:29:36.480
<v Speaker 3>that men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men aren't.</v>

439
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:41.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not that it's an attempt to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual symbolism to a deeper underlying </v>

440
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 3>reality and Yang is masculine.</v>

441
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Urine is dark and night and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white.in</v>

442
00:29:49.931 --> 00:29:52.980
<v Speaker 3>the block serpent and there's a black.in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the white serpent.</v>

443
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:57.990
<v Speaker 3>The serpent is the daytime and </v>
<v Speaker 3>masculinity and it's the interplay </v>

444
00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:02.011
<v Speaker 3>between those two things that make up </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality and one can transform into the </v>

445
00:30:02.011 --> 00:30:06.211
<v Speaker 3>other at any moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's the Taoist idea of </v>

446
00:30:06.211 --> 00:30:09.480
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's Yin and Yang and they </v>

447
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.151
<v Speaker 3>make up the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the question is perhaps that </v>

448
00:30:12.151 --> 00:30:12.151
<v Speaker 3>question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

449
00:30:12.151 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 3>what exactly does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

450
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.680
<v Speaker 3>it actually means something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a kind of abstraction and it's </v>

451
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.260
<v Speaker 3>actually an incredibly helpful </v>
<v Speaker 3>obstruction.</v>

452
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Once you understand the abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be the most real abstraction </v>

453
00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:30.961
<v Speaker 3>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to lay out a little bit a </v>

454
00:30:30.961 --> 00:30:34.471
<v Speaker 3>layout for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit about what these two </v>

455
00:30:34.471 --> 00:30:36.331
<v Speaker 3>domains refer to and then I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a case that they're real and then </v>

456
00:30:36.331 --> 00:30:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell you what it means that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're real.</v>

457
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:44.820
<v Speaker 3>So you could think of Yin as chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we need to know what chaos is now.</v>

458
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Chaos is what God made the world out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the beginning of time.</v>

459
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.640
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that chaos is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something like potential.</v>

460
00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:03.810
<v Speaker 3>And so you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not how we think as modern </v>

461
00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 3>people because we tend to think in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>materialist way,</v>

462
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.700
<v Speaker 3>but it is how we act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as I said already,</v>

463
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:12.210
<v Speaker 3>you act as if you confront potential and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you treat potential as if it's real.</v>

464
00:31:14.351 --> 00:31:19.060
<v Speaker 3>And if your attitude towards it confers </v>
<v Speaker 3>on us certain moral obligation,</v>

465
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:24.270
<v Speaker 3>which is why you know what people mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they say you're not living up to </v>

466
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:27.460
<v Speaker 3>your potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one ever says,</v>

467
00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:33.570
<v Speaker 3>well what do you mean by potential?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not unless they're being argumentative </v>

468
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:35.770
<v Speaker 3>because you already know and very few </v>
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

469
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.080
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fully living up to my potential.</v>

470
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:43.290
<v Speaker 3>So you admit to the reality that </v>
<v Speaker 3>undergirds that conception that makes </v>

471
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 3>that question and possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>

472
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.380
<v Speaker 3>The potential is while potential is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

473
00:31:50.381 --> 00:31:53.620
<v Speaker 3>that's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we believe in the future.</v>

474
00:31:53.621 --> 00:31:57.730
<v Speaker 3>We believe that it exists even though it</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't here and it's not measurable.</v>

475
00:31:57.731 --> 00:32:02.731
<v Speaker 3>It's it only exists as a potential set </v>
<v Speaker 3>of realizable possibilities.</v>

476
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.920
<v Speaker 3>That's what the future is and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really what we contend with.</v>

477
00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:08.470
<v Speaker 3>We don't really contend with the present</v>
<v Speaker 3>precisely.</v>

478
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:13.620
<v Speaker 3>We Orient Ourselves towards the future </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the future comes at us from every </v>

479
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:17.461
<v Speaker 3>direction and we we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we decide as we encounter the future,</v>

480
00:32:17.891 --> 00:32:22.891
<v Speaker 3>which parts of it we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>interact with and how we're going to </v>

481
00:32:22.891 --> 00:32:25.240
<v Speaker 3>construct the present and the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a consequence of doing that.</v>

482
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.710
<v Speaker 3>And so part of chaos is potential and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the positive part.</v>

483
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:34.711
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're in a bind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you look for is potential.</v>

484
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Is there another way of conceptualizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

485
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Do I have a different way of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of</v>

486
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.500
<v Speaker 4>acting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I make another plan?</v>

487
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:47.710
<v Speaker 4>Is there something that I'm not taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>into account that would make this </v>

488
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.311
<v Speaker 4>terrible situation tolerable?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all an attempt to to call upon </v>

489
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:56.471
<v Speaker 4>potential and to use it to transfigure a</v>
<v Speaker 4>reality that's intolerable and maybe </v>

490
00:32:57.801 --> 00:33:00.580
<v Speaker 4>it's intolerable because of the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're conceptualizing it.</v>

491
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not being naive about that.</v>

492
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 4>I understand perfectly well that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>can find themselves so badly cornered in</v>

493
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:11.690
<v Speaker 4>life that they're basically done no </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter what they do.</v>

494
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.840
<v Speaker 4>People obviously developed fatal </v>
<v Speaker 4>illnesses and they die and their </v>

495
00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:21.251
<v Speaker 4>businesses collapsed and genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible things can happen to you that </v>

496
00:33:21.251 --> 00:33:23.810
<v Speaker 4>aren't your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can't fix.</v>

497
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:29.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that you can just </v>
<v Speaker 4>gerrymander the world by changing your </v>

498
00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:29.600
<v Speaker 4>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that straightforward,</v>

499
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:35.260
<v Speaker 4>but I am saying that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendous ability to transform the </v>

500
00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:41.111
<v Speaker 4>landscape of possibility that reveals </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself in front of you and that when </v>

501
00:33:41.111 --> 00:33:42.830
<v Speaker 4>things are terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your best bet.</v>

502
00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:48.570
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean it will succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just means you don't have a better </v>

503
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:52.601
<v Speaker 4>option and so chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That potential is also something that </v>

504
00:33:52.601 --> 00:33:55.670
<v Speaker 4>manifests itself in a terrible manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So imagine this.</v>

505
00:33:55.671 --> 00:34:00.671
<v Speaker 4>This is a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So imagine that you have an intimate </v>

506
00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:04.481
<v Speaker 4>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say a marriage and the marriage is</v>

507
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:09.941
<v Speaker 4>predicated on trust and fidelity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a variant of trust and that </v>

508
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.760
<v Speaker 4>trust and fidelity is an axiom of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>memories.</v>

509
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.970
<v Speaker 4>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

510
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:18.170
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

511
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's play it out.</v>

512
00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Imagine you've been married for 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then your wife tells you that she </v>

513
00:34:25.341 --> 00:34:30.341
<v Speaker 4>has had three affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each of them lasted three years and the </v>

514
00:34:30.341 --> 00:34:32.810
<v Speaker 4>last one has lasted five years and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>still ongoing.</v>

515
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.690
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe you discover that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

516
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 4>so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

517
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 4>what happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

518
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:43.880
<v Speaker 4>what happens is that everything you </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought was wrong.</v>

519
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is such an interesting thing </v>

520
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:51.401
<v Speaker 4>because it actually means you had the </v>
<v Speaker 4>past and you think the past is fixed.</v>

521
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.530
<v Speaker 4>It's done with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's the past.</v>

522
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.280
<v Speaker 4>But all of a sudden you find out that </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that you thought about</v>

523
00:34:58.281 --> 00:35:00.680
<v Speaker 4>the past and it happens to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>important thing,</v>

524
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.920
<v Speaker 4>wasn't true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what that means is that whole </v>

525
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.990
<v Speaker 4>past that you thought was what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't what it was at all,</v>

526
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:14.470
<v Speaker 4>and so it transforms itself from an </v>
<v Speaker 4>actuality into potential and most of </v>

527
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:20.891
<v Speaker 4>that potential is negative unless you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>relieved that your wife had an affair.</v>

528
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:26.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's an important consideration </v>

529
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.141
<v Speaker 4>because you know you can imagine a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation where your marriage is </v>

530
00:35:29.141 --> 00:35:32.240
<v Speaker 4>dreadfully unhappy and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for an excuse to leave.</v>

531
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.960
<v Speaker 4>It's possible that that revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though it would be shocking,</v>

532
00:35:35.961 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 4>would also come with a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>relief.</v>

533
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 4>And so this potential,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the potential that manifests itself,</v>

534
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:46.401
<v Speaker 4>even when it's unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't only necessarily manifest </v>

535
00:35:46.401 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 4>itself in a negative guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can also free,</v>

536
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if your marriage was unhappy,</v>

537
00:35:51.031 --> 00:35:56.031
<v Speaker 4>even if you wanted to cling to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if your marriage wasn't happy and the </v>

538
00:35:56.031 --> 00:36:00.920
<v Speaker 4>betrayal was revealed and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>divorced and you set yourself up in two </v>

539
00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.791
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might be in a better place than you </v>

540
00:36:04.791 --> 00:36:06.471
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a pathway I'm recommending by </v>

541
00:36:06.471 --> 00:36:08.991
<v Speaker 4>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that it's more </v>

542
00:36:08.991 --> 00:36:10.701
<v Speaker 4>complicated than it looks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the introduction of chaos into </v>

543
00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:11.370
<v Speaker 4>order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

544
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:12.910
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

545
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:18.080
<v Speaker 4>the oldest story we have is something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like order is susceptible to disruption </v>

546
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.920
<v Speaker 4>by chaos and the human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the fundamental demand that's made </v>

547
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
<v Speaker 4>on the human being is to contend with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the chaos that disrupts order not to </v>

548
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.450
<v Speaker 4>live in order and not to live in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to be able to contend with the chaos</v>

549
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:37.440
<v Speaker 4>that disrupts order.</v>

550
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.140
<v Speaker 4>And so when you encourage your children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

551
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.670
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is encouraging them to</v>
<v Speaker 4>become the masters of the chaos that can</v>

552
00:36:44.671 --> 00:36:49.671
<v Speaker 4>disrupt order rather than Denisons of </v>
<v Speaker 4>order which makes them tyrants or </v>

553
00:36:49.671 --> 00:36:53.901
<v Speaker 4>denizens of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which makes them nihilistic and </v>

554
00:36:53.901 --> 00:36:54.420
<v Speaker 4>hopeless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you train your children,</v>

555
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.480
<v Speaker 4>you encourage your children and yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your partner if you have any sense </v>

556
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.060
<v Speaker 4>to be a master of emergent chaos and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to contend with that.</v>

557
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:08.660
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so chaos has potential and it's this </v>

558
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:13.610
<v Speaker 4>disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the capacity of the infinite world </v>

559
00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:17.010
<v Speaker 4>to disrupt your finite considerations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another way of looking at it.</v>

560
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:22.250
<v Speaker 4>Another way of looking at it is it's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>serpent in the garden of Eden and the </v>

561
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:27.021
<v Speaker 4>reason that that story is set up the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is is because it's trying to </v>

562
00:37:27.021 --> 00:37:30.981
<v Speaker 4>represent that there is no place that so</v>
<v Speaker 4>bounded and secure,</v>

563
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.980
<v Speaker 4>even if it's set up by God himself that </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have an agent of chaos inside </v>

564
00:37:37.891 --> 00:37:38.040
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

565
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.820
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly the same idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dallas put forward with their,</v>

566
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:47.270
<v Speaker 4>with their symbolic representation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just portrayed in a different </v>

567
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 4>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is,</v>

568
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you do in the garden,</v>

569
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:57.080
<v Speaker 4>given that there's a snake in it and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>answer to that is something like you </v>

570
00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.431
<v Speaker 4>become the master of snakes and so and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a deep idea.</v>

571
00:38:02.371 --> 00:38:06.300
<v Speaker 4>That's the same idea as confronting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dragon in getting the treasure.</v>

572
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:11.570
<v Speaker 4>That's the same idea as going to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom of the ocean and rescue your </v>

573
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:15.681
<v Speaker 4>father from the belly of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same idea and that's an element</v>

574
00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:19.530
<v Speaker 4>in the greatest of stories and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest of stories is heroic,</v>

575
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.760
<v Speaker 4>heroic story and the heroic story is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily confront the unknown when it</v>

576
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:26.550
<v Speaker 4>manifests itself and together something </v>
<v Speaker 4>of value.</v>

577
00:38:26.551 --> 00:38:29.100
<v Speaker 4>As a consequence and to share it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the community,</v>

578
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.580
<v Speaker 4>there isn't a story that's more </v>
<v Speaker 4>emblematic of what it means to be human </v>

579
00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 4>then that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that is us.</v>

580
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.180
<v Speaker 4>That's our best bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

581
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:45.181
<v Speaker 4>so chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is the catastrophe that will </v>

582
00:38:45.181 --> 00:38:48.160
<v Speaker 4>suddenly enter your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is the flood.</v>

583
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 4>That's definitely coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is the ever present possibility of</v>

584
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:57.301
<v Speaker 4>apocalypse in your personal life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your familiar life and in this broader </v>

585
00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.330
<v Speaker 4>social life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

586
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.600
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is the consequence of your finite </v>
<v Speaker 4>fragility existing in a world that's </v>

587
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:06.850
<v Speaker 4>beyond you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is potential.</v>

588
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:12.120
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is what lies before you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is what you can call on when you </v>

589
00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.740
<v Speaker 4>need something to rescue yourself from </v>
<v Speaker 4>malfunctioning order.</v>

590
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.510
<v Speaker 4>It's a permanent element of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is what you don't know.</v>

591
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is what's outside the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is what's outside the walls of </v>

592
00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:30.091
<v Speaker 4>your house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is what's outside the walls of </v>

593
00:39:30.091 --> 00:39:32.731
<v Speaker 4>your town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chaos is what's outside of the borders </v>

594
00:39:32.731 --> 00:39:36.211
<v Speaker 4>of your country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of that is chaos and potential</v>

595
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.020
<v Speaker 5>order</v>

596
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:46.520
<v Speaker 4>order is where you are when what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing is working in the manner that you </v>

597
00:39:46.831 --> 00:39:48.870
<v Speaker 4>intended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

598
00:39:48.871 --> 00:39:53.871
<v Speaker 4>It's a very specific definition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you know that you know what </v>

599
00:39:53.871 --> 00:39:53.871
<v Speaker 4>you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

600
00:39:53.871 --> 00:39:58.371
<v Speaker 4>you don't because you don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing because you don't know </v>

601
00:39:58.371 --> 00:40:00.831
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything you do is bounded by </v>

602
00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:03.051
<v Speaker 4>ignorance while you still have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>operate in the world and so what you do </v>

603
00:40:03.051 --> 00:40:06.861
<v Speaker 4>is you make a finite plans and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>execute plans and then you execute </v>

604
00:40:07.231 --> 00:40:11.640
<v Speaker 4>strategies to make those plans manifest </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

605
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:15.230
<v Speaker 4>and if the plan's manifest themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that you desired,</v>

606
00:40:15.231 --> 00:40:17.760
<v Speaker 4>then you regard your knowledge as </v>
<v Speaker 4>sufficient.</v>

607
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:23.540
<v Speaker 4>That's your definition of truth and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only definition of truth that you </v>

608
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.100
<v Speaker 4>can use because you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything at hand and when you're aware</v>

609
00:40:26.101 --> 00:40:30.210
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing is working that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>order and you might think,</v>

610
00:40:30.211 --> 00:40:35.211
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should just stay there because that's </v>

611
00:40:35.211 --> 00:40:37.701
<v Speaker 4>a comfortable place to be and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of truth to that except </v>

612
00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:39.880
<v Speaker 4>for one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've</v>

613
00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:48.290
<v Speaker 4>defined a domain of order and you stand </v>
<v Speaker 4>in it and you wait,</v>

614
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:54.080
<v Speaker 4>the disorder will enter all by itself </v>
<v Speaker 4>because things aren't static.</v>

615
00:40:54.081 --> 00:40:59.081
<v Speaker 4>Things change all the time and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>attempt to bind yourself within a static</v>

616
00:40:59.241 --> 00:41:04.241
<v Speaker 4>structure is destined to fail because </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything around you is in flux and the</v>

617
00:41:05.391 --> 00:41:09.800
<v Speaker 4>thing that you parceled out as permanent</v>
<v Speaker 4>will transform itself across time.</v>

618
00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you're a perfectly well </v>

619
00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.600
<v Speaker 4>adapted 11 year old and it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible to meet an 11 year old.</v>

620
00:41:17.601 --> 00:41:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Children are often very delightful </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're like adult children.</v>

621
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 4>They're not teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like as they're.</v>

622
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.790
<v Speaker 4>They're the most mature form of children</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can be really delightful people</v>

623
00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:33.940
<v Speaker 4>and then like three years later you hate</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and and the reason for that is that</v>

624
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.470
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as they hit puberty,</v>

625
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:39.410
<v Speaker 4>which is the emergence of chaos into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

626
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 4>into the already developed childhood </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>

627
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:47.231
<v Speaker 4>it's really the emergence of sexuality </v>
<v Speaker 4>into a structure that didn't have to </v>

628
00:41:47.231 --> 00:41:49.400
<v Speaker 4>adapt to sexuality and maybe even the </v>
<v Speaker 4>emergence of aggression to some degree,</v>

629
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 4>but mostly sexuality.</v>

630
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:56.080
<v Speaker 4>If the child maintains only the 11 year </v>
<v Speaker 4>old personality by the time they're 16,</v>

631
00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.270
<v Speaker 4>they're no longer a delightful 11 year </v>
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>

632
00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:03.200
<v Speaker 4>There are very immature 16 year old and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason that I'm pointing that out is</v>

633
00:42:03.201 --> 00:42:08.201
<v Speaker 4>because just because something works for</v>
<v Speaker 4>you now doesn't mean it's going to work </v>

634
00:42:08.201 --> 00:42:11.240
<v Speaker 4>for you five years from now and so in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order to remain stable,</v>

635
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:14.180
<v Speaker 4>you can't be stagnant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not the same thing.</v>

636
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:19.220
<v Speaker 4>Stability is a dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a not something static,</v>

637
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.070
<v Speaker 4>and so not only do you have to be where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>

638
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:27.340
<v Speaker 4>but you have to be going to where you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going and you have to be participating </v>

639
00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.731
<v Speaker 4>in both of those things actively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's stability plus transformation </v>

640
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.200
<v Speaker 4>and and I would say that manifests </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

641
00:42:33.201 --> 00:42:36.800
<v Speaker 4>You know when you're there because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifests itself as meaningful.</v>

642
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.290
<v Speaker 4>That's actually the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The instinct of meaning,</v>

643
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.440
<v Speaker 4>which is an instinct and perhaps the </v>
<v Speaker 4>deepest instinct is precisely the </v>

644
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.940
<v Speaker 4>instinct that tells you when where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are as sufficiently stable,</v>

645
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:51.941
<v Speaker 4>but you're transforming yourself at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sufficient rate to keep up with </v>

646
00:42:51.941 --> 00:42:52.130
<v Speaker 4>everything that's changing.</v>

647
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 4>And you know that because if you're at </v>
<v Speaker 4>your job,</v>

648
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.110
<v Speaker 4>you might say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

649
00:42:57.111 --> 00:43:02.111
<v Speaker 4>my job is really secure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not very challenging and you </v>

650
00:43:02.111 --> 00:43:03.050
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well why do you care about that?</v>

651
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.440
<v Speaker 4>It's very secure and answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

652
00:43:06.441 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 4>if it's not challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's deadening in a sense,</v>

653
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:10.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The spirit goes out of it.</v>

654
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.700
<v Speaker 4>If it's not challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to be challenged.</v>

655
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.560
<v Speaker 4>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

656
00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:20.610
<v Speaker 4>the answer is well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow is coming and whoever you are </v>

657
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:24.011
<v Speaker 4>now isn't enough for tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so today you also have to be </v>

658
00:43:24.011 --> 00:43:25.640
<v Speaker 4>preparing for tomorrow and next week and</v>
<v Speaker 4>next year.</v>

659
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 4>And if your job isn't challenging than </v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't doing that for you,</v>

660
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.700
<v Speaker 4>and you find it deadening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not meaningful.</v>

661
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.880
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>violates your most essential instinct </v>

662
00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 4>and your most essential instinct is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>instinct for meaning.</v>

663
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 4>And it signifies that.</v>

664
00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.600
<v Speaker 4>It actually signifies that you have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>balance between chaos and order right </v>

665
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.330
<v Speaker 4>deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

666
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:52.810
<v Speaker 4>Which is why it's the most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>of instincts because chaos in order are </v>

667
00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:54.810
<v Speaker 4>the most real of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright?</v>

668
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.380
<v Speaker 4>So you have the chaos that surrounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

669
00:43:57.381 --> 00:44:00.200
<v Speaker 4>And in some some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>infinite in scope,</v>

670
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.230
<v Speaker 4>and then you have the order that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>produce,</v>

671
00:44:03.231 --> 00:44:06.080
<v Speaker 4>which is your mastery of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

672
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:11.260
<v Speaker 4>let's take order a part for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want to think about the structure of </v>

673
00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.561
<v Speaker 4>order and bill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying that chaos is bad in </v>

674
00:44:14.561 --> 00:44:15.890
<v Speaker 4>order is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that at all.</v>

675
00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:18.490
<v Speaker 4>That's not the right way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the balance.</v>

676
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.350
<v Speaker 4>It's the balance between them that's of </v>
<v Speaker 4>crucial importance.</v>

677
00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.290
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they exist as superordinate categories.</v>

678
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:27.290
<v Speaker 4>Whether you liked them or not is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>not that relevant.</v>

679
00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

680
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.920
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're the fundamental constituent </v>

681
00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:33.920
<v Speaker 4>elements of reality.</v>

682
00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:33.930
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might say,</v>

683
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.520
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your evidence for that?</v>

684
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:40.521
<v Speaker 4>And I can tell you one piece of evidence</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I won't go into for for very much </v>

685
00:44:40.521 --> 00:44:42.270
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have two hemispheres.</v>

686
00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:48.210
<v Speaker 4>And each in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain is composed of two </v>

687
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:48.630
<v Speaker 4>hemispheres,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which implies something about the nature</v>

688
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:53.631
<v Speaker 4>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Given that your brain is hypothetically </v>

689
00:44:53.631 --> 00:44:56.811
<v Speaker 4>adapted to the structure of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just your brain because animal </v>

690
00:44:56.811 --> 00:44:58.290
<v Speaker 4>brains have the same fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>

691
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:03.291
<v Speaker 4>this bifurcated structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the bifurcation indicates that </v>

692
00:45:03.291 --> 00:45:07.281
<v Speaker 4>there's two fundamental realities </v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise why would you need a </v>

693
00:45:07.281 --> 00:45:11.061
<v Speaker 4>bifurcated structure or maybe you needed</v>
<v Speaker 4>try you brain or one that's divided into</v>

694
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:12.750
<v Speaker 4>four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that isn't what you have.</v>

695
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.960
<v Speaker 4>You have one that's divided into two and</v>
<v Speaker 4>if your working definition of reality is</v>

696
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:20.130
<v Speaker 4>scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>biological,</v>

697
00:45:20.131 --> 00:45:25.131
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then your definition of reality is </v>

698
00:45:25.131 --> 00:45:25.650
<v Speaker 4>reality is that which shapes life.</v>

699
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.820
<v Speaker 4>You can't actually do better than that </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a Darwinian perspective.</v>

700
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:35.240
<v Speaker 4>And if the reality that shaped life </v>
<v Speaker 4>produced a bifurcated representational </v>

701
00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.980
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that implies that the proper way to</v>

702
00:45:37.981 --> 00:45:42.981
<v Speaker 4>represent reality and perhaps that </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality itself is in fact bifurcated.</v>

703
00:45:43.231 --> 00:45:48.231
<v Speaker 4>And I believe it's bifurcated in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>manner I just described and the </v>

704
00:45:48.231 --> 00:45:50.250
<v Speaker 4>neurological evidence for that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually quite overwhelming.</v>

705
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 4>It's come from multiple sources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them Russian,</v>

706
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:57.921
<v Speaker 4>some of them American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where most of the work has been </v>

707
00:45:57.921 --> 00:46:00.801
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your left hemisphere is specialized for </v>

708
00:46:00.801 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 4>operation in those situations that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know and understand,</v>

709
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:07.670
<v Speaker 4>and your right hemisphere is specialized</v>
<v Speaker 4>for operation in those situations that </v>

710
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:11.661
<v Speaker 4>you neither know nor understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the proper way to Orient Yourself in</v>

711
00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:16.080
<v Speaker 4>life is to get the balance between those</v>
<v Speaker 4>two sets of operations.</v>

712
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:21.290
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the way that manifests itself in </v>

713
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:23.160
<v Speaker 4>your subjective experiences as </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful engagement.</v>

714
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:29.480
<v Speaker 4>And so that's not a bad first pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would you say?</v>

715
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:35.270
<v Speaker 4>Justification for the view that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>two domains are the most real domains.</v>

716
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so order.</v>

717
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.240
<v Speaker 4>What is order?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

718
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:46.560
<v Speaker 4>if you just sit there and do nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that will be chaos.</v>

719
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.150
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

720
00:46:48.151 --> 00:46:50.070
<v Speaker 4>because you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll suffer and die.</v>

721
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.840
<v Speaker 4>That's what will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So without action on your part,</v>

722
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:59.010
<v Speaker 4>deterioration in death is a certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

723
00:46:59.011 --> 00:47:04.011
<v Speaker 4>So you need to act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While then we built on an action </v>

724
00:47:04.011 --> 00:47:05.130
<v Speaker 4>platform being where the consequences of</v>

725
00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:14.490
<v Speaker 4>3 billion years of evolution for action,</v>
<v Speaker 4>action,</v>

726
00:47:14.681 --> 00:47:19.681
<v Speaker 4>movement forward in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessity is the prime dictum of life.</v>

727
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:23.500
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were embodied action.</v>

728
00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:27.610
<v Speaker 4>What do you have to do when you act?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

729
00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:30.520
<v Speaker 4>at minimum you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps you able to act.</v>

730
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:32.110
<v Speaker 4>These are truisms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

731
00:47:32.111 --> 00:47:33.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to have something to eat.</v>

732
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:37.000
<v Speaker 4>You have to have some fresh water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need some shelter,</v>

733
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.230
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need some companionship.</v>

734
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.100
<v Speaker 4>You need a sexual partner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need children.</v>

735
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 4>You need play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to be touched.</v>

736
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.400
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an.</v>

737
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually mean need by the way.</v>

738
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 4>People deprived of play go insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who aren't touched,</v>

739
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.930
<v Speaker 4>die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These things are necessary.</v>

740
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:03.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assuming that survival itself is </v>

741
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:03.960
<v Speaker 4>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we'll start with that.</v>

742
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:08.010
<v Speaker 4>We'll start with the assumption that </v>
<v Speaker 4>just sitting there and suffering and </v>

743
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.520
<v Speaker 4>dying is not the right solution.</v>

744
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.190
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to act in the world.</v>

745
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:17.350
<v Speaker 4>You have to act in the world that in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>manner that stops you from deteriorating</v>

746
00:48:17.351 --> 00:48:22.351
<v Speaker 4>and dying at minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that means that you have to address </v>

747
00:48:22.351 --> 00:48:24.700
<v Speaker 4>the problems that are intrinsic to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>destiny.</v>

748
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.550
<v Speaker 4>Now you have all sorts of systems that </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolved,</v>

749
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:32.790
<v Speaker 4>have evolved to help you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Motivational systems we have to eat so </v>

750
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 4>you get hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to find water and consume it so</v>

751
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:37.120
<v Speaker 4>you get thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get lonely,</v>

752
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:38.550
<v Speaker 4>you get curious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

753
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:43.700
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's specialized biological systems </v>

754
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:43.700
<v Speaker 4>that are very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very old.</v>

755
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.830
<v Speaker 4>You get aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get afraid.</v>

756
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:48.730
<v Speaker 4>You suffer pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those specialized systems for all of</v>

757
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:53.731
<v Speaker 4>those unit directional systems of </v>
<v Speaker 4>orientation in the world and they help </v>

758
00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 4>you figure out what to do so when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>hungry,</v>

759
00:48:55.211 --> 00:49:00.211
<v Speaker 4>it's time to eat and when you're thirsty</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's it's time to drink and when your </v>

760
00:49:00.211 --> 00:49:00.940
<v Speaker 4>lonesome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's time to seek out some companionship</v>

761
00:49:00.941 --> 00:49:04.390
<v Speaker 4>and you have specialized systems that </v>
<v Speaker 4>help you do that,</v>

762
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 4>but they're not enough because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

763
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:08.290
<v Speaker 4>they're not very bright.</v>

764
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:13.290
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're kind of uni dimensional and you </v>

765
00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:13.290
<v Speaker 4>also have the problem of organizing all </v>
<v Speaker 4>of them.</v>

766
00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

767
00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:18.721
<v Speaker 4>you have to eat now and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>drink now and you need a companion and </v>

768
00:49:18.721 --> 00:49:22.170
<v Speaker 4>it's probably time to play and you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do something about shelter and there </v>

769
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.531
<v Speaker 4>isn't just you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's you now and tomorrow and next </v>

770
00:49:25.531 --> 00:49:26.260
<v Speaker 4>week and a year from now and five years </v>
<v Speaker 4>from now.</v>

771
00:49:26.261 --> 00:49:31.261
<v Speaker 4>So you have to plan across all those </v>
<v Speaker 4>stretches of time and there isn't just </v>

772
00:49:31.261 --> 00:49:32.020
<v Speaker 4>you now in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

773
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:37.021
<v Speaker 4>there's you plus your family and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>community and so all of that has to be </v>

774
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:40.690
<v Speaker 4>taken into account while you're plotting</v>
<v Speaker 4>your movement forward is very,</v>

775
00:49:40.691 --> 00:49:45.691
<v Speaker 4>very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have all these problems to solve </v>

776
00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:46.090
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously and your motivational </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems,</v>

777
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:51.120
<v Speaker 4>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunger and so forth can help you solve </v>

778
00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.410
<v Speaker 4>one of those problems now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not all of them permanently.</v>

779
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:58.590
<v Speaker 4>That requires higher cognitive function </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's part of what drove the </v>

780
00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:00.670
<v Speaker 4>evolution of our complex cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems.</v>

781
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 4>That's how do you propagate the game </v>
<v Speaker 4>across time in a complex environment,</v>

782
00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.170
<v Speaker 4>the left hemisphere operates when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>

783
00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:14.220
<v Speaker 4>when what you're doing works and so a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of what you do during your life is </v>

784
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:19.081
<v Speaker 4>to keep your right hemisphere off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't like it going on </v>

785
00:50:19.091 --> 00:50:21.520
<v Speaker 4>accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the home of negative emotion.</v>

786
00:50:21.521 --> 00:50:26.290
<v Speaker 4>It's the home of pain and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the thing that turns on and freezes</v>

787
00:50:26.291 --> 00:50:30.830
<v Speaker 4>you in your tracks when something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you deeply did not expect happens and it</v>

788
00:50:30.831 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 4>prepares you to deal with the onslaught </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what you didn't expect.</v>

789
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not all bad news because to use the</v>

790
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:43.481
<v Speaker 4>right hemisphere in a judicious manner </v>
<v Speaker 4>is also something that adds intrigue and</v>

791
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:47.750
<v Speaker 4>interest in artistic expression and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorts of positive things to your life,</v>

792
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 4>so because potential is not only </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative,</v>

793
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:52.490
<v Speaker 4>it's also positive.</v>

794
00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.700
<v Speaker 4>It can be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can be dealt with in ways that are </v>

795
00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.890
<v Speaker 4>deeply enriching and meaningful order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

796
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:05.570
<v Speaker 4>so you have to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise the consequences are dire.</v>

797
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.930
<v Speaker 4>To do something you have to value </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

798
00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:14.340
<v Speaker 4>It's a definitional issue because to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>something is to act out the proposition </v>

799
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.930
<v Speaker 4>that the thing you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing you're aiming at,</v>

800
00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:22.931
<v Speaker 4>let's say is preferable to the thing you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have and preferable means you'll do it </v>

801
00:51:22.931 --> 00:51:24.260
<v Speaker 4>so those things are tied together so </v>
<v Speaker 4>tightly.</v>

802
00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:27.470
<v Speaker 4>You can't disentangle them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you say,</v>

803
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm aiming at x,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't value it,</v>

804
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:36.010
<v Speaker 4>then there's something wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way that you're conceptualizing the </v>

805
00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:38.921
<v Speaker 4>statement because to aim at something </v>
<v Speaker 4>and to work to bring it into existence </v>

806
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.690
<v Speaker 4>is the same as valuing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you say,</v>

807
00:51:41.691 --> 00:51:42.710
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't value it,</v>

808
00:51:42.711 --> 00:51:47.711
<v Speaker 4>then something's out of kilter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either you're acting out a falsehood or </v>

809
00:51:47.711 --> 00:51:48.680
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

810
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:53.830
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those two things and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet people like that are deeply </v>

811
00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:56.801
<v Speaker 4>confused there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their action patterns and their verbal </v>

812
00:51:56.801 --> 00:52:00.971
<v Speaker 4>self representation don't Mesh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that they're </v>

813
00:52:00.971 --> 00:52:05.950
<v Speaker 4>critics of value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just means that they're deeply </v>

814
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:07.700
<v Speaker 4>confused,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to act or you suffer.</v>

815
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:12.730
<v Speaker 4>In order to act,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to have a value structure </v>

816
00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:13.370
<v Speaker 4>because to act you have to value one </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing more than another,</v>

817
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:17.180
<v Speaker 4>which means that you have to inhabit a </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of value.</v>

818
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.840
<v Speaker 4>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

819
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:25.510
<v Speaker 4>so you need a structure value because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the antidote to catastrophe.</v>

820
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:31.990
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you act out a structure of values </v>

821
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.990
<v Speaker 4>socially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you will because you're social,</v>

822
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:37.280
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to pursue your aims in </v>
<v Speaker 4>isolation because you're not.</v>

823
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:41.990
<v Speaker 4>You're not a solitary animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a social animal,</v>

824
00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.590
<v Speaker 4>you're a tribal animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Deeply tribal.</v>

825
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.290
<v Speaker 4>We live in groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live in families,</v>

826
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 4>we live in communities.</v>

827
00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:54.520
<v Speaker 4>We live in large societies were social </v>
<v Speaker 4>at every level of analysis and we've </v>

828
00:52:54.801 --> 00:52:58.970
<v Speaker 4>been social for as long as we've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>primates,</v>

829
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:04.570
<v Speaker 4>so maybe that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's at least 6 million years and it </v>

830
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:07.490
<v Speaker 4>might be more like 60 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really a long time,</v>

831
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:11.180
<v Speaker 4>so it's not an arbitrary social </v>
<v Speaker 4>construction.</v>

832
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:13.280
<v Speaker 4>It's far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>far deeper than that.</v>

833
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
<v Speaker 4>Now what happens when you act out a </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of value in a social </v>

834
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.571
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you produce a hierarchy inevitably.</v>

835
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's think it through.</v>

836
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:26.730
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

837
00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:30.450
<v Speaker 4>let's say that you say that one thing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>more worth doing than another,</v>

838
00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:36.110
<v Speaker 4>whatever it happens to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you tell a bunch of people </v>

839
00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:39.231
<v Speaker 4>about what you're doing and they decide </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're going to come along and </v>

840
00:53:39.231 --> 00:53:41.631
<v Speaker 4>help you do this thing that's valuable </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they also think it's valuable </v>

841
00:53:41.631 --> 00:53:43.440
<v Speaker 4>and maybe you get 20 people together to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do this thing.</v>

842
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.830
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it happens to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the first thing you discover is that</v>

843
00:53:46.831 --> 00:53:51.831
<v Speaker 4>some of the people are way better at </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing whatever it is that they're doing </v>

844
00:53:51.831 --> 00:53:51.831
<v Speaker 4>than other people.</v>

845
00:53:51.831 --> 00:53:56.660
<v Speaker 4>So and that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And who knows why that is because it </v>

846
00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:56.660
<v Speaker 4>depends on what you chose to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

847
00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:01.371
<v Speaker 4>if you chose a then it would be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different group of people who were good </v>

848
00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:01.890
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then if you chose B,</v>

849
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.750
<v Speaker 4>because people differ in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>abilities.</v>

850
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:08.751
<v Speaker 4>But one thing you will not escape from </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you make an organization to do </v>

851
00:54:08.751 --> 00:54:13.161
<v Speaker 4>something valuable is the brute fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it will be a minority of the people</v>

852
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.950
<v Speaker 4>who are good at doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's actually a law,</v>

853
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:20.460
<v Speaker 4>it's called price's law and it's a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>law.</v>

854
00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:25.920
<v Speaker 4>Even governs the size of cities and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>massive stars in the heights of plants </v>

855
00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:31.221
<v Speaker 4>in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just doesn't govern human </v>

856
00:54:31.221 --> 00:54:33.741
<v Speaker 4>interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And price's law says that the square </v>

857
00:54:33.741 --> 00:54:34.350
<v Speaker 4>root of the number of people engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 4>an enterprise.</v>

858
00:54:34.351 --> 00:54:39.351
<v Speaker 4>We'll do half the work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you have 10 people doing </v>

859
00:54:39.351 --> 00:54:39.810
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three of them will do half the work.</v>

860
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:41.760
<v Speaker 4>But if you have 100 people doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

861
00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:45.540
<v Speaker 4>then 10 of them will do half the work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you have 10,000</v>

862
00:54:45.541 --> 00:54:48.690
<v Speaker 4>people doing something than 100 of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>will do half the work.</v>

863
00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.560
<v Speaker 4>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know how wealth distributes itself </v>

864
00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 4>such that a minority of people have most</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the money.</v>

865
00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.000
<v Speaker 4>Twelve 85 richest people in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>have as much money as the bottom two and</v>

866
00:55:00.001 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 4>a half billion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>

867
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.720
<v Speaker 4>And everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

868
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:05.700
<v Speaker 4>the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

869
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:06.570
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

870
00:55:06.571 --> 00:55:10.140
<v Speaker 4>you're all the one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so get over yourself because you're,</v>

871
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:12.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>western European,</v>

872
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:17.070
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking and by world current </v>
<v Speaker 4>world standards,</v>

873
00:55:17.071 --> 00:55:22.071
<v Speaker 4>and certainly by historical standards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're all well ensconced in the one </v>

874
00:55:22.071 --> 00:55:23.280
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if that's a problem,</v>

875
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.540
<v Speaker 4>well it's a problem for all of you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of you might be,</v>

876
00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>richer than that,</v>

877
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:32.160
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean all of you aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the same boat.</v>

878
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:37.280
<v Speaker 4>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that wealth aggregates in the </v>

879
00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:40.761
<v Speaker 4>hands of a small number of people is </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the general expression of </v>

880
00:55:40.761 --> 00:55:45.021
<v Speaker 4>price's law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing special about the </v>

881
00:55:45.021 --> 00:55:45.750
<v Speaker 4>distribution of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the same thing in every creative</v>

882
00:55:45.751 --> 00:55:50.751
<v Speaker 4>domain mean how many of you have have </v>
<v Speaker 4>recorded a gold record?</v>

883
00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:58.110
<v Speaker 4>How many looks like zero up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one,</v>

884
00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.550
<v Speaker 4>one person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

885
00:55:59.551 --> 00:56:02.710
<v Speaker 4>there's 850 people in here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's one in a thousand.</v>

886
00:56:02.711 --> 00:56:05.070
<v Speaker 4>So that's one 10th of one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

887
00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:07.890
<v Speaker 4>How many of you have written a piano </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerto?</v>

888
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:14.910
<v Speaker 4>How bout painted a painting that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging in a national museum?</v>

889
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's none of you again.</v>

890
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:19.200
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

891
00:56:19.201 --> 00:56:22.410
<v Speaker 4>and how many of you have been a member </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a professional sports team?</v>

892
00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:25.880
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look up one one.</v>

893
00:56:25.881 --> 00:56:28.670
<v Speaker 4>So that's one in a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you get the point here.</v>

894
00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Well if there was a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was.</v>

895
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:34.930
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it looks like it's easier to be a </v>

896
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.391
<v Speaker 4>member of a professional sports team or </v>
<v Speaker 4>my or my audiences is biased.</v>

897
00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:41.540
<v Speaker 4>The sample is biased but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is the case.</v>

898
00:56:41.541 --> 00:56:43.880
<v Speaker 4>If you look at high levels of creative </v>
<v Speaker 4>achievement,</v>

899
00:56:43.881 --> 00:56:48.440
<v Speaker 4>of the sword I've just described,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they characterize it staggering minority</v>

900
00:56:48.441 --> 00:56:53.030
<v Speaker 4>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the rule is is that you produce a</v>

901
00:56:53.031 --> 00:56:58.031
<v Speaker 4>value system which you better produce </v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise you suffer and die and</v>

902
00:56:58.101 --> 00:56:59.450
<v Speaker 4>it isn't only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only that.</v>

903
00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.500
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

904
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.320
<v Speaker 4>here's something else you all know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As far as I can tell,</v>

905
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.740
<v Speaker 4>we start with the idea that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>intrinsic chaotic element to life and </v>

906
00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:15.061
<v Speaker 4>that includes the inevitability of </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering and malevolence betrayal at </v>

907
00:57:15.221 --> 00:57:20.221
<v Speaker 4>the hands of yourself and other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's the baseline and that's </v>

908
00:57:20.221 --> 00:57:23.020
<v Speaker 4>intolerable in many ways because life is</v>
<v Speaker 4>in many ways intolerable.</v>

909
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:24.250
<v Speaker 4>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

910
00:57:24.251 --> 00:57:26.500
<v Speaker 4>what do you do in the face of something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's intolerable?</v>

911
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:29.290
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is when you try to find </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that justifies it,</v>

912
00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:31.960
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to have something that gets you</v>

913
00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:36.961
<v Speaker 4>the hell out of bed in the morning and </v>
<v Speaker 4>not just any old morning but a morning </v>

914
00:57:36.961 --> 00:57:41.521
<v Speaker 4>when your father has Alzheimer's disease</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your daughter has an incurable </v>

915
00:57:41.521 --> 00:57:45.781
<v Speaker 4>illness because you need something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get out of bed for in those mornings </v>

916
00:57:45.781 --> 00:57:49.291
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that better be the purpose that you </v>

917
00:57:49.291 --> 00:57:52.201
<v Speaker 4>found in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if the purpose is going to be such </v>

918
00:57:52.201 --> 00:57:52.330
<v Speaker 4>that it gets you out of bed in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mornings,</v>

919
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:57.310
<v Speaker 4>it better be a pretty damn noble purpose</v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise why would you bother?</v>

920
00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.860
<v Speaker 4>And so not only do you need a value </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>

921
00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:03.730
<v Speaker 4>you need one that's of sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 4>tension,</v>

922
00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:08.731
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or sufficient value or sufficient </v>

923
00:58:08.731 --> 00:58:11.851
<v Speaker 4>nobility so that it's worth suffering </v>
<v Speaker 4>for because you're going to suffer and </v>

924
00:58:12.251 --> 00:58:15.220
<v Speaker 4>you better have something that makes the</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering justifiable,</v>

925
00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:20.550
<v Speaker 4>and so not only do you need the value </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure so that you don't just </v>

926
00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:23.851
<v Speaker 4>deteriorate and die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need the value structure so that </v>

927
00:58:23.851 --> 00:58:25.240
<v Speaker 4>when the flood comes in your life as it </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly will,</v>

928
00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:29.350
<v Speaker 4>that you have built a vessel that will </v>
<v Speaker 4>sustain you through the catastrophe.</v>

929
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:33.100
<v Speaker 4>And that's not this pursuit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness.</v>

930
00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:36.670
<v Speaker 4>It's not even the pursuit of security.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's none of that.</v>

931
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:42.150
<v Speaker 4>It's your the orientation that you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>managed to produce in your own life </v>

932
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:47.040
<v Speaker 4>towards our higher good that's so high </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's worth bearing the burden of </v>

933
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:47.950
<v Speaker 4>being to produce.</v>

934
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:51.790
<v Speaker 4>You implement that in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You produce a hierarchy.</v>

935
00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

936
00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:59.840
<v Speaker 4>and then you have the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy and the problem of hierarchy </v>

937
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.641
<v Speaker 4>is a very few people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>very good at whatever that hierarchy </v>

938
00:59:02.641 --> 00:59:06.151
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you have the second problem </v>

939
00:59:06.151 --> 00:59:08.820
<v Speaker 4>with hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the problem I just laid out </v>

940
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.921
<v Speaker 4>when I asked you about your spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 4>levels of attainment and found out that </v>

941
00:59:10.921 --> 00:59:13.840
<v Speaker 4>they were very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was very unlikely.</v>

942
00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that you haven't attained</v>
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile things.</v>

943
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.420
<v Speaker 4>That's not my point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My point is,</v>

944
00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:23.421
<v Speaker 4>is that very high levels of attainment </v>
<v Speaker 4>or rare and that's an inevitability.</v>

945
00:59:24.141 --> 00:59:29.141
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you decide that something's </v>
<v Speaker 4>worth doing to inevitabilities people </v>

946
00:59:29.141 --> 00:59:33.110
<v Speaker 4>stack up at the top minority of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>stack up at the top and take most of the</v>

947
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:38.140
<v Speaker 4>proceeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they happen to be or deserve </v>

948
00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:38.140
<v Speaker 4>them or earn them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

949
00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:42.400
<v Speaker 4>however,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care how you conceptualize it </v>

950
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:42.400
<v Speaker 4>and almost everybody else stacks up at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom.</v>

951
00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:46.340
<v Speaker 4>And so the problem with hierarchies is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that even though they're necessary,</v>

952
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:50.000
<v Speaker 4>they tend to produce a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 4>most people stack up at the bottom.</v>

953
00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.660
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the next thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to contend with.</v>

954
00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:58.900
<v Speaker 4>You can't get rid of the hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you get rid of the </v>

955
00:59:58.900 --> 00:59:58.900
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no value structure.</v>

956
00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.910
<v Speaker 4>And if there's no value structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only do you deteriorate and die,</v>

957
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.740
<v Speaker 4>you want to deteriorate and die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not a good solution.</v>

958
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:12.010
<v Speaker 4>But if you do generate a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have the problem of the </v>

959
01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the problem of the hierarchy is that</v>

960
01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:18.581
<v Speaker 4>it will dispossess most people now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the degree that the postmodernists </v>

961
01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:21.980
<v Speaker 4>have something to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they say is hierarchies,</v>

962
01:00:21.981 --> 01:00:23.630
<v Speaker 4>dispossessed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

963
01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:26.630
<v Speaker 4>And then we can look at that clearly and</v>
<v Speaker 4>carefully,</v>

964
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:32.020
<v Speaker 4>and we can say that doesn't mean a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hierarchies themselves are corrupt </v>

965
01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:34.610
<v Speaker 4>or that we can dispense with them.</v>

966
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:39.500
<v Speaker 4>But it also doesn't mean that we have no</v>
<v Speaker 4>moral obligation to the dispossessed.</v>

967
01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:40.760
<v Speaker 4>And we say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

968
01:00:40.761 --> 01:00:44.480
<v Speaker 4>how do we deal with that politically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptually?</v>

969
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:46.370
<v Speaker 4>And the way we deal with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in part,</v>

970
01:00:46.371 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 4>is to produce a political spectrum that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ranges from left to right.</v>

971
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.360
<v Speaker 4>The deals with hierarchy and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems that hierarchies caused.</v>

972
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:58.540
<v Speaker 4>So one of the things that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>reliably assume about someone who's on </v>

973
01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:03.191
<v Speaker 4>the right is that they will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>patriotically in favor of the current </v>

974
01:01:04.011 --> 01:01:09.011
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy or even more abstractly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're in favor of the idea of </v>

975
01:01:09.011 --> 01:01:11.870
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy itself and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

976
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:16.871
<v Speaker 4>more power to the people on the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you need hierarchies so they </v>

977
01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:22.091
<v Speaker 4>should support them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you have to take the people on </v>

978
01:01:22.091 --> 01:01:22.091
<v Speaker 4>the left who say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

979
01:01:22.091 --> 01:01:24.020
<v Speaker 4>but what about the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispossessed by the hierarchy?</v>

980
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:26.570
<v Speaker 4>And what you have to say to them is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

981
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.910
<v Speaker 4>we actually have to do something about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

982
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:31.400
<v Speaker 4>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well how do we do something about that?</v>

983
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:36.400
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is we don't actually know</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's no permanent solution to</v>

984
01:01:36.561 --> 01:01:39.320
<v Speaker 4>the problem of dispossession by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy.</v>

985
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:43.070
<v Speaker 4>We don't know how to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>

986
01:01:43.071 --> 01:01:44.410
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could flatten hierarchies.</v>

987
01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.300
<v Speaker 4>It's not without disrupting the value </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure.</v>

988
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:50.420
<v Speaker 4>That's a price you don't want to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

989
01:01:50.421 --> 01:01:52.610
<v Speaker 4>we could take from the top and put it at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom.</v>

990
01:01:52.611 --> 01:01:55.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

991
01:01:56.150 --> 01:02:01.150
<v Speaker 4>hypothetically we could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it turns out that when you try that </v>

992
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.210
<v Speaker 4>in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

993
01:02:02.211 --> 01:02:07.211
<v Speaker 4>very easy to rapidly go too far and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you end up with not is less </v>

994
01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:13.180
<v Speaker 4>dispossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You end up with no one who has anything,</v>

995
01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:17.540
<v Speaker 4>and that's not a good solution to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem of scarcity,</v>

996
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:22.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>To make equally dead or equally </v>

997
01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:27.021
<v Speaker 4>starving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is essentially what the communist </v>

998
01:02:27.021 --> 01:02:29.781
<v Speaker 4>states did across the entirety of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>20th century is not the proper way to </v>

999
01:02:30.511 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 4>address the problem of hierarchy.</v>

1000
01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 4>Now it has to be addressed even if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on the right.</v>

1001
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:39.900
<v Speaker 4>Because here's one thing that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hierarchies tend to Ossify,</v>

1002
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:45.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because what happens is that the people </v>

1003
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.170
<v Speaker 4>at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they got there by merit,</v>

1004
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:49.790
<v Speaker 4>but it's easy for them to Gerrymander </v>
<v Speaker 4>the system so they can stay there </v>

1005
01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 4>without merit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or perhaps their children can stay there</v>

1006
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 4>without merit or they can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or the hierarchy becomes corrupt so that</v>

1007
01:02:56.161 --> 01:02:59.070
<v Speaker 4>people who only use tyranny and power </v>
<v Speaker 4>can climate,</v>

1008
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 4>and so you don't have a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 4>competence and value anymore.</v>

1009
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.910
<v Speaker 4>You have a hierarchy of brute power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which looks like a tyranny.</v>

1010
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:11.150
<v Speaker 4>So there's all sorts of ways that </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies can deteriorate and we have </v>

1011
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:12.390
<v Speaker 4>to be awake to ensure that that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>occur.</v>

1012
01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.840
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the hierarchy gets so steep that </v>

1013
01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.830
<v Speaker 4>everybody stacks up at zero and no one </v>
<v Speaker 4>can climate,</v>

1014
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:25.190
<v Speaker 4>which is basically the definition of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>malfunctioning tyranny than all the </v>

1015
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:26.730
<v Speaker 4>people at the bottom rightly think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1016
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:30.720
<v Speaker 4>why don't we just destroyed the game </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're already at zero,</v>

1017
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 4>so what the hell do we have to lose?</v>

1018
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:36.720
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the things that you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do if you're a sensible conservative,</v>

1019
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.040
<v Speaker 4>is make sure that the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 4>maintains its routing and competence,</v>

1020
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:46.250
<v Speaker 4>that it's transparent and that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>climate will because otherwise it will </v>

1021
01:03:46.471 --> 01:03:50.400
<v Speaker 4>ossify and steepen and then it will </v>
<v Speaker 4>destroy itself,</v>

1022
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:54.630
<v Speaker 4>and if you're a conservative and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>value stability and the hierarchy,</v>

1023
01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:59.631
<v Speaker 4>then you don't want to set up a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation where the most likely outcome </v>

1024
01:03:59.631 --> 01:04:01.620
<v Speaker 4>is that the hierarchy destroys itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1025
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:04.380
<v Speaker 4>so we can be intelligent about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could say,</v>

1026
01:04:04.381 --> 01:04:06.030
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be thinking.</v>

1027
01:04:06.031 --> 01:04:08.790
<v Speaker 4>You can get rid of hierarchies they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been around.</v>

1028
01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:11.400
<v Speaker 4>This is why I wrote chapter one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked about lobsters.</v>

1029
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.240
<v Speaker 4>The reason I talked about them is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because not only is the hierarchical </v>

1030
01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:21.270
<v Speaker 4>structure itself as a permanent feature </v>
<v Speaker 4>of existence,</v>

1031
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:26.390
<v Speaker 4>at least a third of a billion years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which by the way means that you cannot </v>

1032
01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:32.331
<v Speaker 4>attribute it to capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the free market or the corrupt </v>

1033
01:04:32.331 --> 01:04:36.531
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal west,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you're willing to make the case </v>

1034
01:04:36.531 --> 01:04:39.681
<v Speaker 4>that all three of those elements </v>
<v Speaker 4>contributed to the existence of </v>

1035
01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:42.990
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchies among crustaceans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which seems highly unlikely,</v>

1036
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:45.570
<v Speaker 4>so an and this is actually something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1037
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.020
<v Speaker 4>that you could think about it as an idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's actually directed towards the </v>

1038
01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:51.420
<v Speaker 4>productive left.</v>

1039
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:57.110
<v Speaker 4>If you want to help the dispossessed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't blame the existence of hierarchies</v>

1040
01:04:57.481 --> 01:05:02.481
<v Speaker 4>on capitalism because it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's wrong that the problem is way </v>

1041
01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:08.361
<v Speaker 4>deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's something else that's very </v>

1042
01:05:08.361 --> 01:05:09.210
<v Speaker 4>interesting about capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A couple of things you might consider,</v>

1043
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:14.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have become spectacularly wealthy </v>

1044
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.750
<v Speaker 4>since 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>95,</v>

1045
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>First in the West Icelands at classic.</v>

1046
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:22.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean you guys are so much more wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 4>than you were 100 years ago that it's </v>

1047
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:24.850
<v Speaker 4>absolutely impossible to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's first happened in the west</v>

1048
01:05:24.851 --> 01:05:27.970
<v Speaker 4>to exponential economic growth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Starting in about 1895,</v>

1049
01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:29.260
<v Speaker 4>there's a long tail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1050
01:05:29.261 --> 01:05:34.261
<v Speaker 4>people were improving before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it really kicked in around 1895 and </v>

1051
01:05:34.261 --> 01:05:36.010
<v Speaker 4>first happened in the west and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening everywhere in the world.</v>

1052
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:37.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1053
01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:43.340
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eon set a goal in 2000 to have the </v>

1054
01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.550
<v Speaker 4>level of absolute poverty in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>by 2015,</v>

1055
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.330
<v Speaker 4>which is the fastest rate of economic </v>
<v Speaker 4>growth ever recorded.</v>

1056
01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:54.040
<v Speaker 4>We attained it in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three years ahead of the most optimistic</v>

1057
01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:55.810
<v Speaker 4>projections.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1058
01:05:55.811 --> 01:06:00.811
<v Speaker 4>And so people are being lifted out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>poverty at a rate that has never been </v>

1059
01:06:00.811 --> 01:06:04.561
<v Speaker 4>seen in the history of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hope to the power grids provided with </v>

1060
01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:08.431
<v Speaker 4>cell phones provided with free,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with access to fresh water provided with</v>

1061
01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 4>access to medications that decrease </v>
<v Speaker 4>child mortality.</v>

1062
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:17.040
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are so many things getting better </v>

1063
01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:17.970
<v Speaker 4>so fast you cannot even believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

1064
01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:20.290
<v Speaker 4>and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a consequences as far as,</v>

1065
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:24.760
<v Speaker 4>as far as the data indicate of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>operation of the free market system,</v>

1066
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:27.880
<v Speaker 4>which does produce inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing,</v>

1067
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:33.540
<v Speaker 4>but as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only system that has ever produced </v>

1068
01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:36.541
<v Speaker 4>wealth and as law or has every system </v>
<v Speaker 4>produces inequality,</v>

1069
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.360
<v Speaker 4>but the only system we know of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>produces,</v>

1070
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.200
<v Speaker 4>produces wealth and inequality is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>free market.</v>

1071
01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:47.530
<v Speaker 4>So here's a question for everyone left </v>
<v Speaker 4>and right.</v>

1072
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:51.280
<v Speaker 4>How many units of inequality will you </v>
<v Speaker 4>tolerate to produce one unit of wealth?</v>

1073
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.590
<v Speaker 4>And if the answer is zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you've gone too far.</v>

1074
01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.130
<v Speaker 4>You're outside the appropriate political</v>
<v Speaker 4>debate.</v>

1075
01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:05.490
<v Speaker 4>That's the wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you try to impose that all there </v>

1076
01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:09.511
<v Speaker 4>will be as mayhem because the price we </v>
<v Speaker 4>pay for wealth is inequality.</v>

1077
01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Now that doesn't mean that you can let </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality run to its ultimate extreme </v>

1078
01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:17.320
<v Speaker 4>because then you run into the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>

1079
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.960
<v Speaker 4>which is the monopoly problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've all played monopoly.</v>

1080
01:07:19.961 --> 01:07:22.570
<v Speaker 4>I presume what happens in every monopoly</v>
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>

1081
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:27.280
<v Speaker 4>if you lay it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's stacks out at zero,</v>

1082
01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:29.020
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>except one person.</v>

1083
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:34.230
<v Speaker 4>Now if you play at 50 times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll find that it's hardly ever the </v>

1084
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:36.130
<v Speaker 4>same person because it's basically a </v>
<v Speaker 4>game of chance and there's a fair bit of</v>

1085
01:07:36.131 --> 01:07:41.131
<v Speaker 4>chance by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>operating in the distribution of money </v>

1086
01:07:41.131 --> 01:07:41.131
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>

1087
01:07:41.131 --> 01:07:41.290
<v Speaker 4>It's not all chance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a fair bit of chance.</v>

1088
01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:46.650
<v Speaker 4>But the logical conclusion to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy that can play itself out </v>

1089
01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:50.160
<v Speaker 4>totally is that one person has </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything and everyone else has </v>

1090
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.640
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously that's not a useful outcome.</v>

1091
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.400
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

1092
01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:57.550
<v Speaker 4>and there are ways that we fix that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>our society.</v>

1093
01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:02.080
<v Speaker 4>We have progressive tax policies and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can argue about their utility,</v>

1094
01:08:02.081 --> 01:08:06.040
<v Speaker 4>but that's one way of rectifying it </v>
<v Speaker 4>potentially.</v>

1095
01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.340
<v Speaker 4>Another way of rectifying is that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have one game,</v>

1096
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In a pluralistic society,</v>

1097
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.110
<v Speaker 4>we have many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many games that people can play.</v>

1098
01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 4>And so if you can't be a successful </v>
<v Speaker 4>lawyer,</v>

1099
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:19.370
<v Speaker 4>then maybe you could be a successful </v>
<v Speaker 4>plumber and if you can't be a successful</v>

1100
01:08:19.371 --> 01:08:24.371
<v Speaker 4>plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you can run a small restaurant or </v>

1101
01:08:24.371 --> 01:08:24.371
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a diversity of games.</v>

1102
01:08:24.371 --> 01:08:27.050
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a good way of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of allowing,</v>

1103
01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:30.050
<v Speaker 4>of increasing the robustness of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

1104
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:35.050
<v Speaker 4>So that you don't get hierarchies that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are so steep that they collapsed in an </v>

1105
01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:38.430
<v Speaker 4>in it upon themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so those are sophisticated </v>

1106
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:39.740
<v Speaker 4>approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps there are other approaches to,</v>

1107
01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.650
<v Speaker 4>but it's an intractable problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says in the New Testament,</v>

1108
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:47.890
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the things you'd swear would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be edited out because it's such a harsh </v>

1109
01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.430
<v Speaker 4>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The poor will be with us always.</v>

1110
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:51.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that in reference to?</v>

1111
01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:53.570
<v Speaker 4>It's also in reference to the matthew </v>
<v Speaker 4>principle,</v>

1112
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:58.690
<v Speaker 4>which is another new testament statement</v>
<v Speaker 4>and happens to be an economic axiom to </v>

1113
01:08:59.061 --> 01:09:02.630
<v Speaker 4>those who have everything more will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>given from those who have nothing.</v>

1114
01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.720
<v Speaker 4>Everything will be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the structure of the world and </v>

1115
01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.600
<v Speaker 4>you can't lay it at the feet of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>West.</v>

1116
01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:13.780
<v Speaker 4>It's the structure of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that means we have to contend with </v>

1117
01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:15.950
<v Speaker 4>it and it's not an easy thing to contend</v>
<v Speaker 4>with and part of the reason that we have</v>

1118
01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:20.951
<v Speaker 4>a continual political dialogue and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to have a continual political </v>

1119
01:09:20.951 --> 01:09:25.421
<v Speaker 4>dialogue is to make sure that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies exist and remain intact,</v>

1120
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.760
<v Speaker 4>but don't become so steep and corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they destroy themselves and you </v>

1121
01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:35.021
<v Speaker 4>need a left and a right for that and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>and but that means the left half has to </v>

1122
01:09:35.021 --> 01:09:39.821
<v Speaker 4>admit that hierarchies are not only </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary but valuable and the right has</v>

1123
01:09:39.861 --> 01:09:42.860
<v Speaker 4>to admit that despite their necessity </v>
<v Speaker 4>and value,</v>

1124
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:48.010
<v Speaker 4>they tend to stack people up at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom and that actually constitutes a </v>

1125
01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:48.010
<v Speaker 4>continual problem.</v>

1126
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.430
<v Speaker 4>You see that in.</v>

1127
01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:57.940
<v Speaker 4>You see that in the old testament </v>
<v Speaker 4>because one of the things that happens </v>

1128
01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:01.451
<v Speaker 4>in the old testament is Israel struggles</v>
<v Speaker 4>up to state and empire status.</v>

1129
01:10:01.521 --> 01:10:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Six Times its struggles out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos,</v>

1130
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:07.610
<v Speaker 4>up to empire status,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it gets corrupt.</v>

1131
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.180
<v Speaker 4>It loses the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't.</v>

1132
01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:15.190
<v Speaker 4>Balancing things between chaos and order</v>
<v Speaker 4>properly that the kings get arrogant is </v>

1133
01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:17.690
<v Speaker 4>so to the people and they forget their </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with God.</v>

1134
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:20.900
<v Speaker 4>That's another way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then a profit comes up and says,</v>

1135
01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.080
<v Speaker 4>you aren't paying enough attention to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the widows and the orphans.</v>

1136
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.320
<v Speaker 4>You better look out because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>displeases God and the Israelites who </v>

1137
01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.480
<v Speaker 4>are stiff necked and arrogant think </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's God going to do to us,</v>

1138
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:34.550
<v Speaker 4>which is not a very wise way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

1139
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:39.910
<v Speaker 4>and so they don't take the steps </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary to rectify their deviation </v>

1140
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:44.621
<v Speaker 4>from the proper path and they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely flattened and the </v>

1141
01:10:44.621 --> 01:10:48.200
<v Speaker 4>consequences of that last for </v>
<v Speaker 4>generations like seven generations,</v>

1142
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:53.470
<v Speaker 4>and then they struggle their way up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>something approximating empire status </v>

1143
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:54.890
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and exactly the same thing happens.</v>

1144
01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.720
<v Speaker 4>They forget and they collapse and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's six stories like that in the Old</v>

1145
01:10:59.721 --> 01:11:04.721
<v Speaker 4>Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all documented by a man named </v>

1146
01:11:04.721 --> 01:11:07.241
<v Speaker 4>Northrop Frye who is a Canadian literary</v>
<v Speaker 4>critic who wrote a couple of books on </v>

1147
01:11:07.241 --> 01:11:11.681
<v Speaker 4>the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One called the great code and the other </v>

1148
01:11:11.681 --> 01:11:11.681
<v Speaker 4>called words with power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I,</v>

1149
01:11:11.681 --> 01:11:15.240
<v Speaker 4>I would highly recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an analysis of the Bible </v>

1150
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:15.240
<v Speaker 4>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brilliant.</v>

1151
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.040
<v Speaker 4>For those of you who might be interested</v>
<v Speaker 4>in human thinking,</v>

1152
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:20.280
<v Speaker 4>fries thinking is a nice adjunct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1153
01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

1154
01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:27.450
<v Speaker 4>So that's the nature of the world order </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos and order,</v>

1155
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:33.260
<v Speaker 4>and your goal is to keep those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the relationship between those two </v>

1156
01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.460
<v Speaker 4>things optimized and you do that by </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing what's meaningful,</v>

1157
01:11:35.461 --> 01:11:40.461
<v Speaker 4>not what's expedient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's rule six and you ensure that you </v>

1158
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:44.490
<v Speaker 4>have the world construed properly by </v>
<v Speaker 4>following rule number eight,</v>

1159
01:11:44.491 --> 01:11:47.250
<v Speaker 4>which is tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or at least don't lie.</v>

1160
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:52.430
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to pathologize the </v>
<v Speaker 4>instinct that orients you in the world </v>

1161
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:54.840
<v Speaker 4>and you will pathologize it by engaging </v>
<v Speaker 4>in habitual deceit.</v>

1162
01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.780
<v Speaker 4>And the reason you do that is when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>practice something,</v>

1163
01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:02.520
<v Speaker 4>you build structures that specialize in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and then they run automatically.</v>

1164
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:07.700
<v Speaker 4>So if you're living a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a very common thing for people </v>

1165
01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:11.001
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're building neurological </v>

1166
01:12:11.001 --> 01:12:11.001
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms that view the world through </v>
<v Speaker 4>that lie.</v>

1167
01:12:11.001 --> 01:12:15.320
<v Speaker 4>And once they're built,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're you and good luck unbuilding </v>

1168
01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:15.420
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very,</v>

1169
01:12:15.421 --> 01:12:20.421
<v Speaker 4>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's in part what happens to people </v>

1170
01:12:20.421 --> 01:12:22.821
<v Speaker 4>who are addicted by the way they build </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms of search neurological </v>

1171
01:12:23.371 --> 01:12:27.810
<v Speaker 4>structures that are focused on the drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>and those systems are alive and all they</v>

1172
01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:31.800
<v Speaker 4>want is the drug and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not psychological.</v>

1173
01:12:31.801 --> 01:12:36.801
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's psychophysiological don't build </v>

1174
01:12:36.801 --> 01:12:40.380
<v Speaker 4>structures of cognition predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 4>deception because you will pay for it,</v>

1175
01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:45.770
<v Speaker 4>and so if you're going to guide your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life with the orientation of the </v>

1176
01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:49.101
<v Speaker 4>instinct of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have to be very careful with </v>

1177
01:12:49.101 --> 01:12:51.801
<v Speaker 4>what you say and write and think because</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time you say or write or think </v>

1178
01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:56.901
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you build a little neurological </v>

1179
01:12:56.901 --> 01:12:58.791
<v Speaker 4>structure that's specialized for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it participates in this parsing of </v>

1180
01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.750
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all right,</v>

1181
01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:12.420
<v Speaker 4>chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you can say the order orders a </v>

1182
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:12.420
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1183
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:17.340
<v Speaker 4>so here's the next question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next two questions is order a hierarchy</v>

1184
01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.150
<v Speaker 4>and then a subsidiary question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if order is a hierarchy,</v>

1185
01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:30.420
<v Speaker 4>what's what either what is at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchy or what should be at the </v>

1186
01:13:30.611 --> 01:13:33.520
<v Speaker 4>top of the hierarchy instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies of structure.</v>

1187
01:13:33.521 --> 01:13:36.490
<v Speaker 4>Value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the question is what should be</v>

1188
01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.640
<v Speaker 4>of ultimate value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1189
01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:41.650
<v Speaker 4>so now we're going to take that apart a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

1190
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:46.000
<v Speaker 4>The first thing I would say his order is</v>
<v Speaker 4>not an hierarchy.</v>

1191
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:51.640
<v Speaker 4>Order is a set of hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a different thing.</v>

1192
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:56.290
<v Speaker 4>So I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you how to think about that.</v>

1193
01:13:56.291 --> 01:14:00.730
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine you have a child and they're</v>

1194
01:14:00.731 --> 01:14:05.731
<v Speaker 4>playing soccer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your child is a pretty good soccer </v>

1195
01:14:05.731 --> 01:14:05.731
<v Speaker 4>player.</v>

1196
01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:08.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you a different story.</v>

1197
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:14.390
<v Speaker 4>This actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to tell you a story about </v>

1198
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:16.690
<v Speaker 4>hockey and I'm since I'm Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell?</v>

1199
01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:18.130
<v Speaker 4>I might as well tell you a story about </v>
<v Speaker 4>hockey.</v>

1200
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.030
<v Speaker 4>My son played hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He still plays hockey.</v>

1201
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:27.270
<v Speaker 4>He's a pretty good hockey player and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>wife and I used to go watch him play </v>

1202
01:14:27.311 --> 01:14:32.311
<v Speaker 4>hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an arena just down the street </v>

1203
01:14:32.311 --> 01:14:32.620
<v Speaker 4>from us and there was a nice </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood league there.</v>

1204
01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:37.621
<v Speaker 4>And so they'd start the kids into teams </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they let them play a few demo </v>

1205
01:14:37.621 --> 01:14:42.511
<v Speaker 4>games and if any team was getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>stomped flat or any other team was </v>

1206
01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:47.191
<v Speaker 4>winning too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they'd rebel the team so that they </v>

1207
01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:50.851
<v Speaker 4>were approximately equal in skill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was the sorting of the teams.</v>

1208
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:55.030
<v Speaker 4>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they,</v>

1209
01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:00.140
<v Speaker 4>then they were on their teams and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd play 15 games during the regular </v>

1210
01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:00.140
<v Speaker 4>season.</v>

1211
01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.420
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have a little tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See who won?</v>

1212
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.960
<v Speaker 4>And it was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was good friendly league and so my </v>

1213
01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.180
<v Speaker 4>son's team was in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the championship game,</v>

1214
01:15:10.181 --> 01:15:15.181
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's one kid on his team who is </v>

1215
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:18.190
<v Speaker 4>the best player on the team by quite a </v>
<v Speaker 4>margin,</v>

1216
01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:20.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was very fast on his feet.</v>

1217
01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:22.540
<v Speaker 4>He could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could skate rings around.</v>

1218
01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:24.280
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was good at stick handling.</v>

1219
01:15:24.281 --> 01:15:29.230
<v Speaker 4>He was a good hockey player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he had some problems.</v>

1220
01:15:29.231 --> 01:15:34.231
<v Speaker 4>This kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one problem was he wouldn't pass the </v>

1221
01:15:34.231 --> 01:15:34.990
<v Speaker 4>puck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you think,</v>

1222
01:15:34.991 --> 01:15:36.640
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why the hell should you pass the puck if</v>

1223
01:15:36.641 --> 01:15:39.760
<v Speaker 4>you're the best hockey player?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is pretty much what he thought and</v>

1224
01:15:39.761 --> 01:15:40.990
<v Speaker 4>the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1225
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:44.270
<v Speaker 4>you're part of a team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1226
01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.510
<v Speaker 4>You want to be the best person on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>team,</v>

1227
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:49.750
<v Speaker 4>fair enough and you want to win the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hockey game,</v>

1228
01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:55.500
<v Speaker 4>but you also want to what make your team</v>
<v Speaker 4>mates better players.</v>

1229
01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.320
<v Speaker 4>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you even want to meet the people </v>

1230
01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:01.320
<v Speaker 4>on other teams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>better players.</v>

1231
01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.500
<v Speaker 4>I knew now I know that's going a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit too far,</v>

1232
01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:07.740
<v Speaker 4>but you certainly want to make your </v>
<v Speaker 4>teammates better players and you might </v>

1233
01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:07.930
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1234
01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:12.931
<v Speaker 4>why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if there are better than maybe </v>

1235
01:16:12.931 --> 01:16:15.001
<v Speaker 4>you won't be the best while that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>boneheaded way of looking at the world </v>

1236
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:20.490
<v Speaker 4>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you amp up the competition around </v>

1237
01:16:20.490 --> 01:16:23.701
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that will motivate you to to be </v>

1238
01:16:23.701 --> 01:16:25.540
<v Speaker 4>even better and it's a hell of a way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>win by making everyone else lose.</v>

1239
01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:29.740
<v Speaker 4>That's not much of a victory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you have any sense,</v>

1240
01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:33.400
<v Speaker 4>you pass the damn puck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you're the better player,</v>

1241
01:16:33.401 --> 01:16:38.401
<v Speaker 4>especially you especially do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you've got a comfortable two </v>

1242
01:16:38.401 --> 01:16:42.181
<v Speaker 4>goal lead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then maybe you can risk taking the </v>

1243
01:16:42.911 --> 01:16:46.900
<v Speaker 4>time away from that specific game to </v>
<v Speaker 4>build up the confidence,</v>

1244
01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:52.290
<v Speaker 4>confidence and ability of your teammates</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe everybody thinks that </v>

1245
01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:53.920
<v Speaker 4>you're a bit of a leader and they make </v>
<v Speaker 4>you team captain.</v>

1246
01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:56.680
<v Speaker 4>Not even so much because you're the best</v>
<v Speaker 4>hockey player,</v>

1247
01:16:56.681 --> 01:16:58.390
<v Speaker 4>but because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1248
01:16:58.391 --> 01:17:00.760
<v Speaker 4>because why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the question.</v>

1249
01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.880
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're watching the game and it's </v>

1250
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.461
<v Speaker 4>pretty exciting and it's real close game</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like three to three and it's a </v>

1251
01:17:08.461 --> 01:17:13.051
<v Speaker 4>minute left and now their team zips down</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nights and scores are really </v>

1252
01:17:13.051 --> 01:17:17.770
<v Speaker 4>brilliant goal and so my son's team </v>
<v Speaker 4>loses except that they were in the </v>

1253
01:17:18.441 --> 01:17:20.330
<v Speaker 4>championship and it was a really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

1254
01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:24.110
<v Speaker 4>So you know whether or not they lost is </v>
<v Speaker 4>not all that obvious.</v>

1255
01:17:24.111 --> 01:17:26.210
<v Speaker 4>They lost that game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1256
01:17:26.211 --> 01:17:28.940
<v Speaker 4>there's a broader context to take into </v>
<v Speaker 4>consideration.</v>

1257
01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.250
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this kid,</v>

1258
01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:36.720
<v Speaker 4>the star goes off the ice and he takes </v>
<v Speaker 4>his hockey stick and he smashes it onto </v>

1259
01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:41.090
<v Speaker 4>the cement and he's all angry because as</v>
<v Speaker 4>far as he was concerned,</v>

1260
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:46.270
<v Speaker 4>he was robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that's because of his useless </v>

1261
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:48.230
<v Speaker 4>teammates who he didn't really spend any</v>
<v Speaker 4>time helping by the way.</v>

1262
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:52.580
<v Speaker 4>And maybe it's because the referees were</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfair and who the hell knows why but it</v>

1263
01:17:52.581 --> 01:17:57.581
<v Speaker 4>wasn't fair and his idiot farther rushes</v>
<v Speaker 4>over to them and consoles him in on his </v>

1264
01:18:00.111 --> 01:18:04.400
<v Speaker 4>loss and supports him in his notion that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was robbed.</v>

1265
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:10.130
<v Speaker 4>And I thought you unspeakable son of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch</v>

1266
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:19.390
<v Speaker 4>because he was an arrogant narcissist </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was way more important to him </v>

1267
01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:25.300
<v Speaker 4>that he had a son who was a star then </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he had a son who is a good person </v>

1268
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:32.670
<v Speaker 4>and that's absolutely inexcusable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made the wrong choice.</v>

1269
01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:37.970
<v Speaker 4>He sacrificed his son's soul in part to </v>
<v Speaker 4>help them save face for a hockey game.</v>

1270
01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:44.770
<v Speaker 4>That's not acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1271
01:18:44.771 --> 01:18:46.240
<v Speaker 4>So here's what you tell your children.</v>

1272
01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:50.190
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter whether you win or </v>
<v Speaker 4>lose,</v>

1273
01:18:50.191 --> 01:18:55.191
<v Speaker 4>it matters how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what the father should </v>

1274
01:18:55.191 --> 01:18:56.400
<v Speaker 4>have told the son and he should have </v>
<v Speaker 4>meant it.</v>

1275
01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:58.860
<v Speaker 4>And even better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he should have known what it meant.</v>

1276
01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:04.430
<v Speaker 4>But who knows what that means because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you tell your children that and maybe </v>

1277
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:07.260
<v Speaker 4>they're not so happy because they lost a</v>
<v Speaker 4>game and they look at you like you're an</v>

1278
01:19:07.261 --> 01:19:09.150
<v Speaker 4>alien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they think,</v>

1279
01:19:09.151 --> 01:19:10.530
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell do you mean by that?</v>

1280
01:19:10.531 --> 01:19:15.450
<v Speaker 4>Because obviously it matters whether you</v>
<v Speaker 4>win and it does matter whether you win.</v>

1281
01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:17.790
<v Speaker 4>So what is it that you mean when you say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

1282
01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:19.260
<v Speaker 4>And your kid asks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1283
01:19:19.261 --> 01:19:21.390
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you go,</v>

1284
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.770
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it means,</v>

1285
01:19:22.771 --> 01:19:27.771
<v Speaker 4>but it's a good rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do you mean by that?</v>

1286
01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:30.790
<v Speaker 4>Here's what you mean,</v>

1287
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:35.090
<v Speaker 4>and it relates to rule five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is don't make your.</v>

1288
01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:40.150
<v Speaker 4>Don't let your children do anything that</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you dislike them because other </v>

1289
01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:43.151
<v Speaker 4>people will dislike them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That and you don't want other people to </v>

1290
01:19:43.151 --> 01:19:46.181
<v Speaker 4>dislike your children unless you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>your children to inhabit a world where </v>

1291
01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:49.490
<v Speaker 4>everyone dislikes them and maybe you do </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you don't like your children and</v>

1292
01:19:49.491 --> 01:19:52.280
<v Speaker 4>maybe you don't like your children </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you let them behave in ways that</v>

1293
01:19:52.281 --> 01:19:57.281
<v Speaker 4>makes you not like them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the way you take revenge is by </v>

1294
01:19:57.281 --> 01:20:00.280
<v Speaker 4>not correcting them so that other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>will punish them because you don't have </v>

1295
01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:03.791
<v Speaker 4>the courage to discipline them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you think that people don't play </v>

1296
01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:06.971
<v Speaker 4>that game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you don't know much about people </v>

1297
01:20:06.971 --> 01:20:06.971
<v Speaker 4>because they play that game all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

1298
01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:07.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1299
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:15.550
<v Speaker 4>it matters how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter whether you win or </v>

1300
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:15.550
<v Speaker 4>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's take that apart.</v>

1301
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:16.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the first thing is,</v>

1302
01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.280
<v Speaker 4>and this goes back to the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy is order a hierarchy and the </v>

1303
01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.181
<v Speaker 4>answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a set of all hierarchies or you </v>

1304
01:20:25.181 --> 01:20:28.370
<v Speaker 4>could say it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the set of all possible hierarchies</v>

1305
01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.550
<v Speaker 4>because you know in in a society at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>given time,</v>

1306
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:34.790
<v Speaker 4>there's hierarchies that function,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that transforms and then there's new</v>

1307
01:20:34.791 --> 01:20:39.791
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies that function,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the specifics of the hierarchies change,</v>

1308
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:45.550
<v Speaker 4>but the fact of the hierarchies remains </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you can imagine a hierarchy as a </v>

1309
01:20:45.741 --> 01:20:50.741
<v Speaker 4>metal structure that consists of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>multitude of possible hierarchies and </v>

1310
01:20:50.931 --> 01:20:52.670
<v Speaker 4>that's going to change as life </v>
<v Speaker 4>continues.</v>

1311
01:20:52.671 --> 01:20:57.671
<v Speaker 4>And so what you want for your children </v>
<v Speaker 4>is not to be the master of our </v>

1312
01:20:57.671 --> 01:21:01.300
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want for your children to be the </v>

1313
01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:01.640
<v Speaker 4>master of the set of all possible </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies</v>

1314
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:04.710
<v Speaker 4>because then no matter how things </v>
<v Speaker 4>change,</v>

1315
01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:06.500
<v Speaker 4>they're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>

1316
01:21:06.501 --> 01:21:11.501
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is it that you get ready for things </v>

1317
01:21:11.501 --> 01:21:13.961
<v Speaker 4>to change?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is play so that people </v>

1318
01:21:13.961 --> 01:21:15.110
<v Speaker 4>will invite you to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1319
01:21:15.111 --> 01:21:16.510
<v Speaker 4>And there's a rule for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

1320
01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.800
<v Speaker 4>for children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for raising children,</v>

1321
01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.330
<v Speaker 4>and it really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a rule.</v>

1322
01:21:20.690 --> 01:21:22.520
<v Speaker 4>One of the things you can do with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>

1323
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:27.790
<v Speaker 4>this is something good for men because </v>
<v Speaker 4>men are more likely to do this than </v>

1324
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:27.830
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although women can do it too,</v>

1325
01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:33.040
<v Speaker 4>but men are more likely to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really good for children to engage </v>

1326
01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.370
<v Speaker 4>in rough and tumble play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>play fighting.</v>

1327
01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:40.180
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have children and you've played </v>

1328
01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.300
<v Speaker 4>with them physically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that they absolutely love it.</v>

1329
01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:42.410
<v Speaker 4>They will</v>

1330
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:48.830
<v Speaker 4>rough and tumble play with you until you</v>
<v Speaker 4>are completely exhausted and they're not</v>

1331
01:21:48.901 --> 01:21:53.901
<v Speaker 4>even vaguely ready to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have an inexhaustible hunger for it</v>

1332
01:21:54.690 --> 01:21:57.810
<v Speaker 4>and they like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like to be pushed to the edge,</v>

1333
01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:03.650
<v Speaker 4>so I knew this when I was a new father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>partly because I read work by a man </v>

1334
01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:05.970
<v Speaker 4>named Jaak Panksepp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a genius,</v>

1335
01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:11.330
<v Speaker 4>an affective neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the world's great </v>

1336
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:13.581
<v Speaker 4>neuroscientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps the world's greatest </v>

1337
01:22:13.581 --> 01:22:16.101
<v Speaker 4>neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although there's four or five people </v>

1338
01:22:16.101 --> 01:22:17.991
<v Speaker 4>that might compete with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote a book called affective </v>

1339
01:22:17.991 --> 01:22:18.000
<v Speaker 4>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotional neuroscience,</v>

1340
01:22:18.001 --> 01:22:23.001
<v Speaker 4>which is a work of real genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He discovered the place circuit in </v>

1341
01:22:23.001 --> 01:22:24.030
<v Speaker 4>mammals because there's a separate place</v>
<v Speaker 4>or could in mammals,</v>

1342
01:22:24.031 --> 01:22:29.031
<v Speaker 4>a specialized circuit and he did a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of work on rats and showing that in </v>

1343
01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:32.070
<v Speaker 4>order for a rat to become socialized </v>
<v Speaker 4>because rats are highly social,</v>

1344
01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.030
<v Speaker 4>they had to engage in iterative bouts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>rough and tumble play,</v>

1345
01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.740
<v Speaker 4>and here's a cool thing.</v>

1346
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:42.630
<v Speaker 4>It's a ridiculously cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So and this has to do in some sense with</v>

1347
01:22:42.631 --> 01:22:45.210
<v Speaker 4>the postmodern critique of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal tyranny.</v>

1348
01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:50.190
<v Speaker 4>So if you take two juvenile rats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>males,</v>

1349
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:56.270
<v Speaker 4>and you imagine you give them an </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to play,</v>

1350
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.610
<v Speaker 4>so you throw two of them into a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>player arena and you let them wrestle.</v>

1351
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:03.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next time that you bring them to the</v>

1352
01:23:03.121 --> 01:23:06.430
<v Speaker 4>same place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can measure how much work they'll do</v>

1353
01:23:06.431 --> 01:23:10.570
<v Speaker 4>to open the door to the arena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many times they'll push a button,</v>

1354
01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.480
<v Speaker 4>say to open the door or how hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how hard.</v>

1355
01:23:13.481 --> 01:23:16.330
<v Speaker 4>They'll pull a few tie a string spring </v>
<v Speaker 4>to their tail,</v>

1356
01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:21.720
<v Speaker 4>and so you can get an estimate of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation because the more motivated </v>

1357
01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.150
<v Speaker 4>they are to play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the harder they'll work.</v>

1358
01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:27.280
<v Speaker 4>And rats will work really hard to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know that they want to play.</v>

1359
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assuming that you're willing to accept </v>

1360
01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:32.600
<v Speaker 4>the fact that if you work for something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want it.</v>

1361
01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like an operational definition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So rats will work to play.</v>

1362
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.760
<v Speaker 4>Now if you let the rats out in the play </v>
<v Speaker 4>arena and one rat is 10 percent bigger </v>

1363
01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:44.410
<v Speaker 4>than the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then that rat will win.</v>

1364
01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:45.640
<v Speaker 4>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1365
01:23:45.641 --> 01:23:48.970
<v Speaker 4>what does winning mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rats wrestle like people wrestle.</v>

1366
01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:53.410
<v Speaker 4>They even pin each other and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest play behavior to begin with.</v>

1367
01:23:53.411 --> 01:23:58.411
<v Speaker 4>Like dogs playing in a park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know how a dog looks when it wants </v>

1368
01:23:58.411 --> 01:23:58.480
<v Speaker 4>to play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of hunkers down a little bit.</v>

1369
01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:03.040
<v Speaker 4>Looks up at you like expectancy </v>
<v Speaker 4>expectedly kind of move back and forth,</v>

1370
01:24:03.041 --> 01:24:04.630
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay human,</v>

1371
01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:10.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm ready to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you have any sense and you know </v>

1372
01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:10.020
<v Speaker 4>how to play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you look at the dog and you sort of</v>

1373
01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:14.881
<v Speaker 4>go like this and the dog goes like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you cuff the dog not too hard and </v>

1374
01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:16.630
<v Speaker 4>the dog bites you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not too hard.</v>

1375
01:24:16.631 --> 01:24:19.060
<v Speaker 4>And then you can play and you're both </v>
<v Speaker 4>happy with that.</v>

1376
01:24:19.061 --> 01:24:24.061
<v Speaker 4>And kids can do that with dogs because </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids understand dogs and dogs and kids </v>

1377
01:24:24.061 --> 01:24:26.320
<v Speaker 4>knew how to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your dog can play,</v>

1378
01:24:26.321 --> 01:24:29.980
<v Speaker 4>then you should not own a dog because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not smart enough to own a dog.</v>

1379
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:34.660
<v Speaker 4>So it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you have a dog that can't play,</v>

1380
01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:37.150
<v Speaker 4>then don't have a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1381
01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.220
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>

1382
01:24:47.221 --> 01:24:52.221
<v Speaker 4>His dog I ever saw was owned by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist that was really </v>

1383
01:24:52.221 --> 01:24:54.410
<v Speaker 4>embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So okay,</v>

1384
01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:59.420
<v Speaker 4>so you put the rat to rats together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the 10 percent bigger route and </v>

1385
01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:03.841
<v Speaker 4>there's the 10 percent smaller rat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 10 percent bigger rat stomps the </v>

1386
01:25:03.841 --> 01:25:05.680
<v Speaker 4>small rat and pins him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he wins.</v>

1387
01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:11.760
<v Speaker 4>And so now you're a postmodernist doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the experiment and you say powerful,</v>

1388
01:25:12.101 --> 01:25:15.790
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical rat dominates hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1389
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you conclude and of </v>

1390
01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:22.120
<v Speaker 4>experiment and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it looks correct because powerful,</v>

1391
01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.230
<v Speaker 4>dominant rat dominated and one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1392
01:25:26.231 --> 01:25:29.530
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>except for one thing,</v>

1393
01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:33.820
<v Speaker 4>rats live with rats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't wander.</v>

1394
01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:37.570
<v Speaker 4>They're not psychopathic individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wandering from isolated community,</v>

1395
01:25:37.571 --> 01:25:42.571
<v Speaker 4>dissect a community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know all the other rats and that </v>

1396
01:25:42.571 --> 01:25:46.861
<v Speaker 4>means they have to keep playing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and the rules for playing with </v>

1397
01:25:46.861 --> 01:25:50.851
<v Speaker 4>someone 30 times are not the same as the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rules for playing with someone once.</v>

1398
01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:57.400
<v Speaker 4>So Pang sap had the rats play repeatedly</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what he observed was,</v>

1399
01:25:57.401 --> 01:26:02.401
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now the next time you put those rats </v>

1400
01:26:02.401 --> 01:26:02.401
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the situation's a little different.</v>

1401
01:26:02.401 --> 01:26:06.530
<v Speaker 4>The little rat comes bouncing out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>does the playful dog thing too.</v>

1402
01:26:06.531 --> 01:26:09.440
<v Speaker 4>The big rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now the rule is you're the little rat</v>

1403
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:12.530
<v Speaker 4>you lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be the creature that invites</v>

1404
01:26:12.531 --> 01:26:14.420
<v Speaker 4>to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's now your status.</v>

1405
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:17.090
<v Speaker 4>So you bounced around and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big rats all cool.</v>

1406
01:26:17.091 --> 01:26:18.730
<v Speaker 4>And he's smoking a cigarette and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to,</v>

1407
01:26:19.150 --> 01:26:24.150
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they'll flick it away at some point </v>

1408
01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:24.150
<v Speaker 4>and think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1409
01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:27.881
<v Speaker 4>what the hell you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then he gets in it and so nico </v>

1410
01:26:27.881 --> 01:26:28.730
<v Speaker 4>can stomp the little route again because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a bigger rat.</v>

1411
01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:34.780
<v Speaker 4>If the big Grad doesn't let the little </v>
<v Speaker 4>rat win 30 percent of the time across </v>

1412
01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:38.801
<v Speaker 4>repeated play boats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the little rat won't ask him to </v>

1413
01:26:38.801 --> 01:26:38.801
<v Speaker 4>play anymore.</v>

1414
01:26:38.801 --> 01:26:40.310
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1415
01:26:40.311 --> 01:26:42.380
<v Speaker 4>if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't think so,</v>

1416
01:26:42.381 --> 01:26:47.381
<v Speaker 4>what you don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did Jaak Panksepp waste his time </v>

1417
01:26:47.381 --> 01:26:47.381
<v Speaker 4>studying play in rats?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Think,</v>

1418
01:26:47.381 --> 01:26:51.371
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an absolute miracle because it </v>

1419
01:26:51.371 --> 01:26:54.281
<v Speaker 4>shows you that there's an ethic of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fairplay that emerges as a consequence </v>

1420
01:26:54.281 --> 01:26:56.450
<v Speaker 4>of repeated bouts of play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even among rats.</v>

1421
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:59.750
<v Speaker 4>It's so basic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't even human.</v>

1422
01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:03.620
<v Speaker 4>That ethic they effect of fair play is </v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper than human.</v>

1423
01:27:04.130 --> 01:27:09.130
<v Speaker 4>It's real and it's the ethic that </v>
<v Speaker 4>governs iterated interactions and it's </v>

1424
01:27:09.861 --> 01:27:14.270
<v Speaker 4>not just in rats that we've seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So chimpanzees are pretty damn brutal.</v>

1425
01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.940
<v Speaker 4>They're way more brutal than you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're really,</v>

1426
01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:21.941
<v Speaker 4>really strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe six times as strong as an adult </v>

1427
01:27:21.941 --> 01:27:22.640
<v Speaker 4>male.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's the estimates vary,</v>

1428
01:27:22.641 --> 01:27:26.450
<v Speaker 4>but there are plenty strong enough to </v>
<v Speaker 4>tear you to bits and that happens now.</v>

1429
01:27:26.451 --> 01:27:31.451
<v Speaker 4>And then people have chimps for pets and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they become adults and it's like don't </v>

1430
01:27:31.451 --> 01:27:33.770
<v Speaker 4>miss with the chimp because it'll tear </v>
<v Speaker 4>you to pieces.</v>

1431
01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:38.920
<v Speaker 4>And so and chimps are brutal and this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting because they're our closest </v>

1432
01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:43.871
<v Speaker 4>relatives and so Jane Goodall discovered</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the 19 seventies that rats or tribe </v>

1433
01:27:44.481 --> 01:27:48.050
<v Speaker 4>or chimps are tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They live in tribal groups like we do,</v>

1434
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:53.530
<v Speaker 4>and they have a territory that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>known territory and there's a perimeter </v>

1435
01:27:53.530 --> 01:27:57.640
<v Speaker 4>that's the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's chaos and other chimpanzees </v>

1436
01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.821
<v Speaker 4>inhabit the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Foreign Chimpanzees and the juvenile </v>

1437
01:28:00.821 --> 01:28:03.590
<v Speaker 4>chimps patrol the perimeters in groups </v>
<v Speaker 4>of four or five,</v>

1438
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:07.520
<v Speaker 4>and if they buy us a foreign chimp or </v>
<v Speaker 4>two of them,</v>

1439
01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.650
<v Speaker 4>if they outnumber them because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't count,</v>

1440
01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:14.651
<v Speaker 4>but they have a sense of quantity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If five chimps come across to foreign </v>

1441
01:28:14.651 --> 01:28:19.210
<v Speaker 4>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will tear them to bits and I </v>

1442
01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:19.760
<v Speaker 4>actually mean that literally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they do.</v>

1443
01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.370
<v Speaker 4>And chimps also hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They hunt,</v>

1444
01:28:22.371 --> 01:28:27.371
<v Speaker 4>call a bus monkeys and they weigh about </v>
<v Speaker 4>40 pounds and they're quite carnivorous </v>

1445
01:28:27.371 --> 01:28:27.740
<v Speaker 4>and they will eat them alive.</v>

1446
01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:32.880
<v Speaker 4>They're screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there isn't a lot of empathy </v>

1447
01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.760
<v Speaker 4>regulating chimp aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is something to think about when </v>

1448
01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:40.661
<v Speaker 4>you think about human beings because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not obvious what regulates our </v>

1449
01:28:40.661 --> 01:28:40.661
<v Speaker 4>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you might think,</v>

1450
01:28:40.661 --> 01:28:41.810
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's your conscience.</v>

1451
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:43.190
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1452
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:46.310
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's your conscience and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something else.</v>

1453
01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:51.520
<v Speaker 4>You read the book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you read the rape of Nanking for </v>

1454
01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:51.530
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'll start wondering very,</v>

1455
01:28:51.531 --> 01:28:54.350
<v Speaker 4>very rapidly about whether people have </v>
<v Speaker 4>any conscience at all.</v>

1456
01:28:54.650 --> 01:28:59.650
<v Speaker 4>So that's a story of absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>atrocious Japanese behavior in China at,</v>

1457
01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.480
<v Speaker 4>at the beginning of World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's a horrifying book.</v>

1458
01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:06.450
<v Speaker 4>So read it with caution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's very instructive.</v>

1459
01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:09.480
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chimps,</v>

1460
01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.140
<v Speaker 4>the chimps are very brutal creatures and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you might think,</v>

1461
01:29:13.141 --> 01:29:18.141
<v Speaker 4>well let's look at a chimp hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 4>because chimps have dominance </v>

1462
01:29:18.141 --> 01:29:18.720
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies and they're basically male </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominated,</v>

1463
01:29:18.721 --> 01:29:22.110
<v Speaker 4>although there are lots of powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>female chimps say,</v>

1464
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:24.360
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who becomes the dominant chimp?</v>

1465
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:28.020
<v Speaker 4>And the answer might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this would be the postmodern answer,</v>

1466
01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:33.410
<v Speaker 4>the most powerful tyrannical brutal </v>
<v Speaker 4>chimp rules because it's power that </v>

1467
01:29:34.621 --> 01:29:39.621
<v Speaker 4>moves you up the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that happened sometimes among </v>

1468
01:29:39.621 --> 01:29:39.720
<v Speaker 4>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1469
01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:44.721
<v Speaker 4>what happens to tyron chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have an off day and to subordinate </v>

1470
01:29:46.591 --> 01:29:51.591
<v Speaker 4>chimps each three quarters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the size gang up to make a one and a </v>

1471
01:29:51.591 --> 01:29:54.450
<v Speaker 4>half super chimp and then they tear him </v>
<v Speaker 4>to pieces.</v>

1472
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:57.540
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's the rule,</v>

1473
01:29:57.541 --> 01:30:01.110
<v Speaker 4>if you're a chimp tyrants meet bloody </v>
<v Speaker 4>ends,</v>

1474
01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:07.040
<v Speaker 4>so how do you conduct yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>chimp if you want to be at the top of </v>

1475
01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:12.201
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchy and have preferential </v>
<v Speaker 4>access to the things that being at the </v>

1476
01:30:12.201 --> 01:30:16.071
<v Speaker 4>top of the hierarchy would give you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the answer is engage in mutually </v>

1477
01:30:16.231 --> 01:30:21.231
<v Speaker 4>reciprocal interactions with your peers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The chimps that rise to the top that </v>

1478
01:30:21.450 --> 01:30:26.450
<v Speaker 4>stay there stable he and also have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>most stable functioning troops by the </v>

1479
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:30.081
<v Speaker 4>way are the ones that have friends that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are long term and permanent and engage </v>

1480
01:30:30.081 --> 01:30:34.791
<v Speaker 4>in reciprocal interactions not only with</v>
<v Speaker 4>their friends but also with the females </v>

1481
01:30:34.791 --> 01:30:36.300
<v Speaker 4>and the infants and so even among </v>
<v Speaker 4>chimps,</v>

1482
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:42.470
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a is not the norm and B is not the </v>

1483
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:46.401
<v Speaker 4>proper motive approaching the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that speaks to a broader ethic.</v>

1484
01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:52.400
<v Speaker 4>The same kind of ethic that is spoken to</v>
<v Speaker 4>with regards to the rat studies have </v>

1485
01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.020
<v Speaker 4>play behavior and you can see this sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of thing throughout the animal kingdom.</v>

1486
01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:00.640
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a pattern of reciprocal </v>

1487
01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.421
<v Speaker 4>interaction that seems to stabilize </v>
<v Speaker 4>social animals that isn't predicated on </v>

1488
01:31:02.421 --> 01:31:04.650
<v Speaker 4>brute force.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now maybe the simpler the animal,</v>

1489
01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:10.730
<v Speaker 4>the more it's predicated on brute force,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we are by no means simple animals </v>

1490
01:31:10.730 --> 01:31:14.160
<v Speaker 4>and the idea that our hierarchies are </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally tyrannical,</v>

1491
01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:19.460
<v Speaker 4>the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a word that nobody who thinks </v>

1492
01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:23.660
<v Speaker 4>carefully should ever use casually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that term is predicated on the idea that</v>

1493
01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:26.940
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are hierarchies are tyrannical,</v>

1494
01:31:27.150 --> 01:31:30.420
<v Speaker 4>which they aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although they can become that way and be</v>

1495
01:31:30.421 --> 01:31:35.421
<v Speaker 4>that the most reliable means to </v>
<v Speaker 4>attaining status within a hierarchy is </v>

1496
01:31:35.421 --> 01:31:39.300
<v Speaker 4>through the expression of power and both</v>
<v Speaker 4>of those things are wrong.</v>

1497
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:42.270
<v Speaker 4>They are wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and nonetheless,</v>

1498
01:31:42.271 --> 01:31:47.271
<v Speaker 4>that's the primary theory of the social </v>
<v Speaker 4>sciences and the humanities and enough </v>

1499
01:31:47.271 --> 01:31:47.750
<v Speaker 4>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>

1500
01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:52.880
<v Speaker 4>we have enough data to indicate that </v>
<v Speaker 4>none of that's sufficiently </v>

1501
01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:56.730
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated to constitute a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 4>explanation of the world.</v>

1502
01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 4>So we should dispense with it as fast as</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

1503
01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:04.570
<v Speaker 4>All it's doing is dividing us into </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribes and it's not solving the problems</v>

1504
01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:06.970
<v Speaker 4>that it's hypothetically intended to </v>
<v Speaker 4>solve.</v>

1505
01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:08.140
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1506
01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:20.040
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now back to the question.</v>

1507
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.460
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1508
01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:28.920
<v Speaker 4>there isn't a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a set of hierarchies and it's </v>

1509
01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:33.571
<v Speaker 4>like the set of games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's what you're telling your </v>

1510
01:32:33.571 --> 01:32:36.661
<v Speaker 4>child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say it doesn't matter whether </v>

1511
01:32:36.661 --> 01:32:36.940
<v Speaker 4>you win or lose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it matters how you play the game.</v>

1512
01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:40.060
<v Speaker 4>What you're telling them is life is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>a game.</v>

1513
01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:43.900
<v Speaker 4>It's not even a sequence of the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>games.</v>

1514
01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.660
<v Speaker 4>It's multiple sequences of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>games,</v>

1515
01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:52.800
<v Speaker 4>and if you want to be a successful </v>
<v Speaker 4>player in the set of multiple sequence </v>

1516
01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:57.271
<v Speaker 4>of different games,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have to adopt a higher order </v>

1517
01:32:57.271 --> 01:33:00.421
<v Speaker 4>ethic and you don't subordinate that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethic to victory in any one game ever.</v>

1518
01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:06.340
<v Speaker 4>So you put the manner in which you play </v>
<v Speaker 4>above your victory in,</v>

1519
01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:11.520
<v Speaker 4>in each instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the reason that that produces the </v>

1520
01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:15.331
<v Speaker 4>best possible outcome for you is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get invited to play the largest </v>

1521
01:33:15.331 --> 01:33:17.740
<v Speaker 4>number of games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so let's go back to rule five.</v>

1522
01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:20.590
<v Speaker 4>Don't let your children do anything that</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you dislike them.</v>

1523
01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:22.870
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say you like your children.</v>

1524
01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:26.260
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you love your children and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want the best for them.</v>

1525
01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.600
<v Speaker 4>You've detached yourself in a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you think,</v>

1526
01:33:28.601 --> 01:33:33.601
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to be around forever and </v>

1527
01:33:33.601 --> 01:33:35.470
<v Speaker 4>they're going to deal with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different people,</v>

1528
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:39.130
<v Speaker 4>single people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like individuals,</v>

1529
01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:43.030
<v Speaker 4>groups of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>children and adults,</v>

1530
01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.480
<v Speaker 4>and what they have to be prepared for is</v>
<v Speaker 4>to interact with that set of people in </v>

1531
01:33:48.641 --> 01:33:52.090
<v Speaker 4>the best possible manner because and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you want?</v>

1532
01:33:52.091 --> 01:33:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say your child's two,</v>

1533
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:59.310
<v Speaker 4>and it's still pretty egocentric because</v>
<v Speaker 4>children shoot two year olds are quite </v>

1534
01:33:59.310 --> 01:34:00.310
<v Speaker 4>egocentric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't share yet.</v>

1535
01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:03.850
<v Speaker 4>They don't really learn how to share in </v>
<v Speaker 4>any technical sense.</v>

1536
01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.910
<v Speaker 4>Tiller about three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for them to learn to share</v>

1537
01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:14.860
<v Speaker 4>between two and four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They learn to share and to play and the </v>

1538
01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:18.281
<v Speaker 4>way they learn is by at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by engaging in reciprocal interactions </v>

1539
01:34:18.281 --> 01:34:18.440
<v Speaker 4>with their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1540
01:34:18.441 --> 01:34:20.360
<v Speaker 4>what is it that it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

1541
01:34:20.361 --> 01:34:24.230
<v Speaker 4>That's your job when you're socializing </v>
<v Speaker 4>a child who's two to four,</v>

1542
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:27.560
<v Speaker 4>you have to do it between the ages of </v>
<v Speaker 4>two and four by the way,</v>

1543
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:30.500
<v Speaker 4>because if you don't manage it by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time they're four,</v>

1544
01:34:30.710 --> 01:34:35.710
<v Speaker 4>then you might as well give up because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't going to happen and the </v>

1545
01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:38.240
<v Speaker 4>literature on antisocial behavior in </v>
<v Speaker 4>children is crystal clear on this point.</v>

1546
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:43.810
<v Speaker 4>If your child's antisocial ad for you </v>
<v Speaker 4>failed and there isn't anything that can</v>

1547
01:34:44.751 --> 01:34:47.840
<v Speaker 4>be done about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a dismal literature and believe me,</v>

1548
01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:53.140
<v Speaker 4>psychologists and sociologists and </v>
<v Speaker 4>anthropologists and criminologists have </v>

1549
01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:57.761
<v Speaker 4>tried for like six decades to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to remediate anti social in older </v>

1550
01:34:58.551 --> 01:35:03.050
<v Speaker 4>children and adolescents and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't managed it so.</v>

1551
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:06.350
<v Speaker 4>So between two and four is crucial.</v>

1552
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:13.810
<v Speaker 4>You want to help your child become the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of person that other children want </v>

1553
01:35:13.810 --> 01:35:17.021
<v Speaker 4>to play with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason you want to do that is </v>

1554
01:35:17.021 --> 01:35:19.160
<v Speaker 4>because from four onward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other children are the primary agents of</v>

1555
01:35:19.161 --> 01:35:24.161
<v Speaker 4>socialization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if your children are accepted by </v>

1556
01:35:24.161 --> 01:35:27.701
<v Speaker 4>other children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're on their way because other </v>

1557
01:35:27.701 --> 01:35:30.611
<v Speaker 4>children will socialize them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't mean you're not important as a </v>

1558
01:35:30.611 --> 01:35:33.041
<v Speaker 4>parent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it means they find their peers who </v>

1559
01:35:33.041 --> 01:35:36.161
<v Speaker 4>are at the same developmental level as </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and they start to reciprocally </v>

1560
01:35:36.161 --> 01:35:40.811
<v Speaker 4>socialize one another and they do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>through play and so if you've prepared </v>

1561
01:35:40.811 --> 01:35:45.011
<v Speaker 4>your child to be a great play companion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can just stand back and let it </v>

1562
01:35:45.411 --> 01:35:48.110
<v Speaker 4>happen and you have to be around when </v>
<v Speaker 4>something breaks down.</v>

1563
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:51.230
<v Speaker 4>When the system doesn't work properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be there as a resource,</v>

1564
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:54.980
<v Speaker 4>but basically you can sort of push them </v>
<v Speaker 4>out onto the playground and say,</v>

1565
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:56.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what to do.</v>

1566
01:35:56.510 --> 01:36:01.510
<v Speaker 4>Go play and play is of absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>crucial importance as documented by </v>

1567
01:36:02.571 --> 01:36:07.571
<v Speaker 4>people like John Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're trying to make your child </v>

1568
01:36:07.881 --> 01:36:12.881
<v Speaker 4>maximally attractive as a play partner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the ethic there is while the world </v>

1569
01:36:12.881 --> 01:36:16.631
<v Speaker 4>is made out of a sequence of hierarchies</v>
<v Speaker 4>that transform and so you want your </v>

1570
01:36:17.631 --> 01:36:22.631
<v Speaker 4>child to be the sort of person who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>invited to participate in whatever </v>

1571
01:36:22.631 --> 01:36:27.370
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy organizes itself and how and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what should a child be like to do that </v>

1572
01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:31.670
<v Speaker 4>while they have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be Reciprocal.</v>

1573
01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:36.140
<v Speaker 4>Take turns right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't always get to pick the game.</v>

1574
01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.630
<v Speaker 4>You have to find out what other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to do.</v>

1575
01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:43.720
<v Speaker 4>They have to want to play too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's all these sophisticated </v>

1576
01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.100
<v Speaker 4>ethical rules that go around play and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1577
01:36:46.101 --> 01:36:49.190
<v Speaker 4>if you're playing with some of you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>played with kids that aren't fun to play</v>

1578
01:36:49.191 --> 01:36:50.870
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what do they like?</v>

1579
01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:53.660
<v Speaker 4>If something doesn't go their way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens?</v>

1580
01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:58.730
<v Speaker 4>They have an emotional outburst so they </v>
<v Speaker 4>revert to the behavior of ill prepared.</v>

1581
01:36:58.731 --> 01:37:01.010
<v Speaker 4>Two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a temper tantrum.</v>

1582
01:37:01.011 --> 01:37:04.310
<v Speaker 4>They burst into tears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they thrash around on the floor.</v>

1583
01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:09.830
<v Speaker 4>It's not fun because when you play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't lose some times that no one</v>

1584
01:37:09.831 --> 01:37:12.320
<v Speaker 4>else ever wins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so who the hell's going to play with?</v>

1585
01:37:12.321 --> 01:37:16.460
<v Speaker 4>Someone like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a downtrodden victim,</v>

1586
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:17.990
<v Speaker 4>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

1587
01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.750
<v Speaker 4>No kid with any senses is going to put </v>
<v Speaker 4>up with that.</v>

1588
01:37:20.751 --> 01:37:22.790
<v Speaker 4>All they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is exactly what kids are like,</v>

1589
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:28.540
<v Speaker 4>if they find out that their potential </v>
<v Speaker 4>play partner is a whiny two year old,</v>

1590
01:37:28.730 --> 01:37:32.360
<v Speaker 4>even though therefore they just start </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing and they go find another kid.</v>

1591
01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:36.140
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so if you want that for your kid,</v>

1592
01:37:36.141 --> 01:37:38.930
<v Speaker 4>then make sure that they're whiny and </v>
<v Speaker 4>bitter every time they lose.</v>

1593
01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:44.110
<v Speaker 4>A good way to do that is to never let </v>
<v Speaker 4>them lose at anything so they don't get </v>

1594
01:37:44.110 --> 01:37:44.450
<v Speaker 4>any practice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1595
01:37:44.451 --> 01:37:47.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't want my kid to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like wrong.</v>

1596
01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:53.080
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want your kid to lose in an </v>

1597
01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.650
<v Speaker 4>unsophisticated manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the same thing at all.</v>

1598
01:37:54.651 --> 01:37:58.290
<v Speaker 4>And if you think the way you accomplish </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is by never having your kid lose,</v>

1599
01:37:58.291 --> 01:37:59.610
<v Speaker 4>then well then,</v>

1600
01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:04.210
<v Speaker 4>well then we're back to the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't even own a dog problem.</v>

1601
01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.140
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then you might take apart.</v>

1602
01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:17.500
<v Speaker 4>What does it mean to be a desirable play</v>
<v Speaker 4>partner?</v>

1603
01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:19.540
<v Speaker 4>Assuming you're going to play </v>
<v Speaker 4>reciprocal,</v>

1604
01:38:19.541 --> 01:38:22.300
<v Speaker 4>repeated games across all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different contexts.</v>

1605
01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:23.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a.</v>

1606
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:25.780
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole ethic that emerges from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1607
01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:31.440
<v Speaker 4>See Nature back in the late 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was the first person to kind of </v>

1608
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.770
<v Speaker 4>caught onto this sort of thing because </v>
<v Speaker 4>until then,</v>

1609
01:38:33.130 --> 01:38:38.130
<v Speaker 4>people tended to think of morality as </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that was invented rationally </v>

1610
01:38:38.130 --> 01:38:42.811
<v Speaker 4>and then imposed from the top down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But nature being a very intelligent </v>

1611
01:38:42.811 --> 01:38:46.000
<v Speaker 4>observer noted that that wasn't really </v>
<v Speaker 4>the case.</v>

1612
01:38:46.150 --> 01:38:51.150
<v Speaker 4>There was a ethic already built into </v>
<v Speaker 4>human interactions that we all acted </v>

1613
01:38:51.881 --> 01:38:56.881
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that we didn't really understand </v>

1614
01:38:56.881 --> 01:38:56.881
<v Speaker 4>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's a way to think about that.</v>

1615
01:38:57.430 --> 01:39:02.430
<v Speaker 4>So imagine you're watching a wolf pack </v>
<v Speaker 4>and wolves compete for dominance.</v>

1616
01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:07.240
<v Speaker 4>And so the way they do that is they </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically have a play fight about it.</v>

1617
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:12.270
<v Speaker 4>Now it's this fairly serious play fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so two wolves that are engaged in a </v>

1618
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:14.740
<v Speaker 4>dominance dispute will sort of sand </v>
<v Speaker 4>sideways to each other.</v>

1619
01:39:15.250 --> 01:39:20.250
<v Speaker 4>You know how cats do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever watched two caps fight cats </v>

1620
01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:20.470
<v Speaker 4>stand sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

1621
01:39:20.471 --> 01:39:22.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why does it cat stand sideways when it's</v>

1622
01:39:22.241 --> 01:39:27.241
<v Speaker 4>fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because a sideways cat is a bigger </v>

1623
01:39:27.241 --> 01:39:30.271
<v Speaker 4>cat than a hand on cat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the cat's trying to intimidate the </v>

1624
01:39:30.271 --> 01:39:33.280
<v Speaker 4>other cats so it stand sideways and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>puffs itself up including its tail.</v>

1625
01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:37.540
<v Speaker 4>And the reason it does that is so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks bigger because one cat isn't.</v>

1626
01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:42.570
<v Speaker 4>The cats don't want to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to threaten until one cat </v>

1627
01:39:42.570 --> 01:39:46.951
<v Speaker 4>backs down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they puff themselves up and they </v>

1628
01:39:46.951 --> 01:39:47.770
<v Speaker 4>make horrible noises and they face off </v>
<v Speaker 4>against each other,</v>

1629
01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:52.950
<v Speaker 4>but they don't want to fight because the</v>
<v Speaker 4>two cats that are fighting my damage </v>

1630
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:53.950
<v Speaker 4>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then a third cat comes in and like wins.</v>

1631
01:39:54.190 --> 01:39:56.780
<v Speaker 4>It's a stupid strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's.</v>

1632
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:57.550
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so.</v>

1633
01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:00.670
<v Speaker 4>Most animals don't like to fight because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might damage to themselves.</v>

1634
01:40:00.671 --> 01:40:02.530
<v Speaker 4>And then another interloper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll just,</v>

1635
01:40:02.531 --> 01:40:06.160
<v Speaker 4>when it's a stupid strategy and human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings are quite a bit like that.</v>

1636
01:40:06.161 --> 01:40:08.890
<v Speaker 4>We do a lot of posturing and defensive </v>
<v Speaker 4>display,</v>

1637
01:40:08.891 --> 01:40:11.700
<v Speaker 4>an aggressive display and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we don't fight very often for the,</v>

1638
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:16.730
<v Speaker 4>for the same reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's only when those other </v>

1639
01:40:16.730 --> 01:40:16.730
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms breakdown that we actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

1640
01:40:17.530 --> 01:40:17.980
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1641
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:28.830
<v Speaker 4>what happens in a wolf dispute is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wolves square off and they amp up </v>

1642
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:35.910
<v Speaker 4>the threats in the hope that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves will back the hell down because </v>

1643
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:39.430
<v Speaker 4>what'll happen is the wolf will chicken </v>
<v Speaker 4>out one of them and then when it does,</v>

1644
01:40:39.431 --> 01:40:43.420
<v Speaker 4>it rolls over and shows its neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1645
01:40:44.050 --> 01:40:45.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because when wolves hunt,</v>

1646
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:47.620
<v Speaker 4>they go for the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Generally.</v>

1647
01:40:47.621 --> 01:40:50.080
<v Speaker 4>Like wolves are quite cruel creatures in</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sense,</v>

1648
01:40:50.081 --> 01:40:53.140
<v Speaker 4>and they'll actually eat moose standing </v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

1649
01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:55.870
<v Speaker 4>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they can manage it,</v>

1650
01:40:55.871 --> 01:40:58.510
<v Speaker 4>they go through for the throat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll bring the animal down.</v>

1651
01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:02.110
<v Speaker 4>And so what the wolf is basically saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1652
01:41:03.130 --> 01:41:04.720
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you scared me half to death.</v>

1653
01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:07.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm a useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a useless moose.</v>

1654
01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:11.470
<v Speaker 4>You might as well tear up my neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And other wolf says,</v>

1655
01:41:11.890 --> 01:41:14.310
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're pretty detestable and you're kind</v>

1656
01:41:14.311 --> 01:41:17.920
<v Speaker 4>of like a moose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I might need you to hunt tomorrow so</v>

1657
01:41:18.730 --> 01:41:20.650
<v Speaker 4>I know I can tear out your neck but I </v>
<v Speaker 4>won't.</v>

1658
01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:26.040
<v Speaker 4>And then the defeated Wolf stands up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not very happy and he's kind of a </v>

1659
01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:29.080
<v Speaker 4>low status wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least he's still got his neck and</v>

1660
01:41:29.081 --> 01:41:34.081
<v Speaker 4>the victor wolf gets to be high status </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolf and he gets to go hunting with his </v>

1661
01:41:34.081 --> 01:41:36.370
<v Speaker 4>partner the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you might think,</v>

1662
01:41:36.371 --> 01:41:41.371
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves have a complex procedural </v>

1663
01:41:41.371 --> 01:41:43.960
<v Speaker 4>morality and morality is don't tear the </v>
<v Speaker 4>neck out of your,</v>

1664
01:41:44.530 --> 01:41:46.870
<v Speaker 4>out of the per of out of the creature </v>
<v Speaker 4>you defeat.</v>

1665
01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:49.270
<v Speaker 4>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you might say,</v>

1666
01:41:49.271 --> 01:41:51.490
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the rule that will follow,</v>

1667
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:56.730
<v Speaker 4>but that's wrong because wolves don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>follow rules because wolves don't have </v>

1668
01:41:56.730 --> 01:41:58.390
<v Speaker 4>rules because they don't have language </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they don't think not like us.</v>

1669
01:41:58.630 --> 01:42:03.630
<v Speaker 4>They act like they have rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They act so that if you watch them act,</v>

1670
01:42:04.090 --> 01:42:06.790
<v Speaker 4>you could label what they're doing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rule.</v>

1671
01:42:07.570 --> 01:42:09.490
<v Speaker 4>That's how we got our rules.</v>

1672
01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:15.480
<v Speaker 4>That's how we got our rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We acted out in ethic and then we </v>

1673
01:42:16.181 --> 01:42:21.181
<v Speaker 4>watched and then we coded it in stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what our religious stories are </v>

1674
01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:27.420
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The consequence of us watching what it </v>

1675
01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:30.121
<v Speaker 4>is that we do when we act ethically and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then transforming that into a story and </v>

1676
01:42:30.121 --> 01:42:34.381
<v Speaker 4>everyone's intent on that story exists </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely intent on the story of good </v>

1677
01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:34.660
<v Speaker 4>versus evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1678
01:42:34.661 --> 01:42:38.080
<v Speaker 4>because that's the fundamental story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And why do you want to watch that story?</v>

1679
01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:43.260
<v Speaker 4>Because you want to know how to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>victor in the set of all possible games </v>

1680
01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:46.890
<v Speaker 4>and that's what that story's about and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what movies are about and that's </v>

1681
01:42:46.890 --> 01:42:48.040
<v Speaker 4>what books are about and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious narratives are about.</v>

1682
01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.060
<v Speaker 4>That's what everything that grips us at </v>
<v Speaker 4>a literary level is about,</v>

1683
01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:56.020
<v Speaker 4>and the reason that it grips this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's what the world is made of</v>

1684
01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:57.610
<v Speaker 4>and that's what we need to know.</v>

1685
01:42:58.630 --> 01:43:01.300
<v Speaker 4>So then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so here's something to think about.</v>

1686
01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:05.050
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you a symbolic representation </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this.</v>

1687
01:43:05.051 --> 01:43:07.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's this idea in Christianity,</v>

1688
01:43:08.210 --> 01:43:11.530
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not talking about this from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious perspective,</v>

1689
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:17.070
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about this from an </v>

1690
01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:19.170
<v Speaker 4>anthropological perspective or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological perspective or a that'll do </v>

1691
01:43:21.611 --> 01:43:24.520
<v Speaker 4>an anthropological or a bylaw or </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological perspective.</v>

1692
01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:29.700
<v Speaker 4>So there's this idea in Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Christ is whatever Christ is the </v>

1693
01:43:29.741 --> 01:43:32.200
<v Speaker 4>king of kings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1694
01:43:32.201 --> 01:43:36.150
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to take that apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So imagine that you have a hierarchy,</v>

1695
01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:38.950
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's someone at the top of it,</v>

1696
01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:45.060
<v Speaker 4>and so that person has the attributes </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary to be at the top of that </v>

1697
01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:48.361
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy and maybe it's a hockey team </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you go home and you tell a story </v>

1698
01:43:48.361 --> 01:43:52.111
<v Speaker 4>about how the best hockey player on your</v>
<v Speaker 4>team played while they were being the </v>

1699
01:43:52.641 --> 01:43:53.480
<v Speaker 4>best hockey player.</v>

1700
01:43:53.770 --> 01:43:58.770
<v Speaker 4>It's a little hero narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a little fragment of a hero </v>

1701
01:43:58.770 --> 01:44:00.860
<v Speaker 4>narrative and maybe it's hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>soccer,</v>

1702
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:02.720
<v Speaker 4>plumbing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>law,</v>

1703
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:04.460
<v Speaker 4>business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>art.</v>

1704
01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.640
<v Speaker 4>There's all these hierarchies and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the thing that's at the top of </v>

1705
01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.871
<v Speaker 4>all of them and the thing that's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that at the top of all of them has </v>

1706
01:44:13.871 --> 01:44:17.951
<v Speaker 4>something in common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's whatever it is that's in common </v>

1707
01:44:17.951 --> 01:44:19.460
<v Speaker 4>across all the things that are at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>top.</v>

1708
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:21.470
<v Speaker 4>So imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1709
01:44:21.471 --> 01:44:26.471
<v Speaker 4>so you could think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that you're a novelist and you </v>

1710
01:44:26.471 --> 01:44:30.611
<v Speaker 4>want to distill some characters and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want the good evil character because </v>

1711
01:44:30.611 --> 01:44:34.631
<v Speaker 4>what the hell good is your book without </v>
<v Speaker 4>a good evil character and you want a </v>

1712
01:44:34.631 --> 01:44:37.961
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good character because the same problem </v>

1713
01:44:37.961 --> 01:44:40.100
<v Speaker 4>applies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want it to just tell a story </v>

1714
01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:40.520
<v Speaker 4>about some guy's Day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1715
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:41.570
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1716
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:46.870
<v Speaker 4>John woke up at six and then he smacked </v>
<v Speaker 4>his lips four times in blank 20 times </v>

1717
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:52.190
<v Speaker 4>and then he swung his feet over across </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bed and walked into the bathroom.</v>

1718
01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.360
<v Speaker 4>Because who cares about any of that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't need to know that because you</v>

1719
01:44:56.361 --> 01:45:00.410
<v Speaker 4>know how to move your mouth and cough </v>
<v Speaker 4>and walk to the bathroom.</v>

1720
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:03.380
<v Speaker 4>It's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want a distillation.</v>

1721
01:45:03.381 --> 01:45:06.920
<v Speaker 4>You want the novelist who have watched a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of people in abstract it out,</v>

1722
01:45:06.921 --> 01:45:11.921
<v Speaker 4>someone who's good in a way that's good </v>
<v Speaker 4>across a bunch of people and you want </v>

1723
01:45:11.921 --> 01:45:16.040
<v Speaker 4>him to have abstracted out someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>evil that's abstracted across a bunch of</v>

1724
01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:18.440
<v Speaker 4>evil characters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you see that in hamlet for example.</v>

1725
01:45:18.441 --> 01:45:23.441
<v Speaker 4>You see that Dostoevsky where the where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the characters are bigger than life and </v>

1726
01:45:23.441 --> 01:45:27.821
<v Speaker 4>you want them bigger than life because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want it distilled so that you can </v>

1727
01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:29.180
<v Speaker 4>learn from it and what you're learning </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that ethic.</v>

1728
01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:35.050
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that imagine that you have 100 </v>

1729
01:45:35.050 --> 01:45:35.050
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just mundane hierarchies.</v>

1730
01:45:35.050 --> 01:45:40.000
<v Speaker 4>Then you take the people at the top of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all those hierarchies and say that you </v>

1731
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:40.000
<v Speaker 4>group them into groups of 10.</v>

1732
01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:42.950
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you take 10 admirable people.</v>

1733
01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:44.360
<v Speaker 4>Then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1734
01:45:44.361 --> 01:45:47.360
<v Speaker 4>we're going to average across them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to come out with the most ad</v>

1735
01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:51.500
<v Speaker 4>with a composite admirable person made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Out of those 10,</v>

1736
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:57.010
<v Speaker 4>you have 100 to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's say you have a thousand to </v>

1737
01:45:57.010 --> 01:46:00.101
<v Speaker 4>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You distill them to 100 admirable </v>

1738
01:46:00.101 --> 01:46:02.531
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you take that hundred admirable </v>

1739
01:46:02.531 --> 01:46:02.531
<v Speaker 4>people in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you distill them into 10.</v>

1740
01:46:02.770 --> 01:46:07.030
<v Speaker 4>Then you take those 10 admirable people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you distilled them into one and what</v>

1741
01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.790
<v Speaker 4>that one is is what's admirable across </v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire set of admirable people.</v>

1742
01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:14.600
<v Speaker 4>That's a divine figure in a mythological</v>
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>

1743
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:20.770
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the Christian idea is Christ is </v>

1744
01:46:20.770 --> 01:46:21.380
<v Speaker 4>the king of kings and that's what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>means.</v>

1745
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:25.670
<v Speaker 4>You go into a cathedral and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cathedral is across by the way,</v>

1746
01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:30.470
<v Speaker 4>and the cross is the place where </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering is accepted and the cross is a</v>

1747
01:46:30.471 --> 01:46:31.200
<v Speaker 4>dome over it.</v>

1748
01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:33.230
<v Speaker 4>Then that's the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1749
01:46:33.231 --> 01:46:37.550
<v Speaker 4>So there's an idea in the cathedral and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that the place of the cross,</v>

1750
01:46:37.551 --> 01:46:41.060
<v Speaker 4>which is where suffering occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the center of the universe,</v>

1751
01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:43.640
<v Speaker 4>which is the Dome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you look up at the Dome and you</v>

1752
01:46:43.641 --> 01:46:48.641
<v Speaker 4>see this figure staring down at you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the king of kings and that's how </v>

1753
01:46:48.801 --> 01:46:53.801
<v Speaker 4>to behave in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what that image represents and </v>

1754
01:46:53.881 --> 01:46:54.600
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1755
01:46:55.290 --> 01:46:56.370
<v Speaker 4>what does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1756
01:46:56.371 --> 01:47:01.371
<v Speaker 4>here's a way of unpacking it and this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with its associated with the </v>

1757
01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:06.420
<v Speaker 4>idea of how to behave across the set of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all possible hierarchies.</v>

1758
01:47:07.410 --> 01:47:08.310
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what should you do?</v>

1759
01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:09.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>according to rule one,</v>

1760
01:47:10.530 --> 01:47:12.960
<v Speaker 4>you should stand up straight with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulders back.</v>

1761
01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the people who have been,</v>

1762
01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.660
<v Speaker 4>some of the people who've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticizing me say,</v>

1763
01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:24.020
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I point out that hierarchies </v>

1764
01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:24.020
<v Speaker 4>exist.</v>

1765
01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:26.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm justifying them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like pointing out that something </v>

1766
01:47:26.210 --> 01:47:29.781
<v Speaker 4>exists is not the same as justifying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just pointing out that it exists </v>

1767
01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:34.200
<v Speaker 4>and pointing it out that it exists </v>
<v Speaker 4>without justifying.</v>

1768
01:47:34.201 --> 01:47:39.201
<v Speaker 4>It is certainly not saying that the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to attain dominance in a hierarchy is </v>

1769
01:47:39.201 --> 01:47:44.001
<v Speaker 4>through power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the other thing that I've been </v>

1770
01:47:44.001 --> 01:47:44.070
<v Speaker 4>criticized for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not what I'm saying.</v>

1771
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:46.370
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that not.</v>

1772
01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:51.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even saying that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly the opposite of what I'm </v>

1773
01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:51.570
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>

1774
01:47:51.571 --> 01:47:56.571
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you stand up straight with your </v>

1775
01:47:56.571 --> 01:47:56.571
<v Speaker 4>shoulders back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that a powerful stance?</v>

1776
01:47:56.571 --> 01:47:59.160
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well actually no.</v>

1777
01:48:00.330 --> 01:48:02.520
<v Speaker 4>A powerful stance is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1778
01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:08.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really because I'm not very good at </v>

1779
01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:08.180
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I knew what I was doing,</v>

1780
01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:12.390
<v Speaker 4>this would be it and I put myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>sideways so I'm not much of a target and</v>

1781
01:48:12.391 --> 01:48:13.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm ready for attack.</v>

1782
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:15.750
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not this stance.</v>

1783
01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:18.540
<v Speaker 4>This dance is different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1784
01:48:18.810 --> 01:48:22.950
<v Speaker 4>And that that isn't this stance either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a defensive Crouch,</v>

1785
01:48:23.250 --> 01:48:25.590
<v Speaker 4>this is what happens if you're depressed</v>
<v Speaker 4>and anxious,</v>

1786
01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:27.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This dance is,</v>

1787
01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:31.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to take what the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>throws at me.</v>

1788
01:48:32.010 --> 01:48:37.010
<v Speaker 4>Right in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might be the trials and </v>

1789
01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:38.931
<v Speaker 4>tribulations that are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchy because that's a tough </v>

1790
01:48:38.931 --> 01:48:42.621
<v Speaker 4>battle in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it also might be all the terrible </v>

1791
01:48:42.621 --> 01:48:45.981
<v Speaker 4>unknown things that are going to come </v>
<v Speaker 4>your way and what's the right attitude </v>

1792
01:48:45.981 --> 01:48:50.090
<v Speaker 4>is stand the hell up with some courage </v>
<v Speaker 4>and take it right voluntarily with </v>

1793
01:48:51.541 --> 01:48:56.541
<v Speaker 4>courage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's actually a stance of maximal </v>

1794
01:48:56.541 --> 01:48:58.980
<v Speaker 4>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerability adopted voluntarily.</v>

1795
01:49:00.090 --> 01:49:02.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what the crucifix represents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just so you know,</v>

1796
01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:07.860
<v Speaker 4>it represents the willingness to take on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the suffering of the world voluntarily,</v>

1797
01:49:08.010 --> 01:49:13.010
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's associated with what's ever </v>

1798
01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:13.230
<v Speaker 4>at the top of the hierarchy.</v>

1799
01:49:13.230 --> 01:49:18.230
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is the best possible </v>
<v Speaker 4>strategy that you have to be successful </v>

1800
01:49:19.231 --> 01:49:24.231
<v Speaker 4>across the set of all possible </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies is to maximally accept the </v>

1801
01:49:24.231 --> 01:49:25.380
<v Speaker 4>fact that your vote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're vulnerable,</v>

1802
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:30.660
<v Speaker 4>to accept that as the price of being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the essential message.</v>

1803
01:49:30.810 --> 01:49:32.670
<v Speaker 4>It's not only the message of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity,</v>

1804
01:49:32.671 --> 01:49:37.671
<v Speaker 4>by the way you see this sort of idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>expressed in all sorts of religious </v>

1805
01:49:37.671 --> 01:49:41.190
<v Speaker 4>structures in the daoists to return to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them say,</v>

1806
01:49:41.191 --> 01:49:45.180
<v Speaker 4>well where should you be in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world is made out of the catastrophe</v>

1807
01:49:45.181 --> 01:49:49.300
<v Speaker 4>of chaos in the tyranny of order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do you stand in that place?</v>

1808
01:49:49.301 --> 01:49:53.680
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is with one foot in chaos</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one foot in order.</v>

1809
01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:57.160
<v Speaker 4>That's the line down the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the Tao.</v>

1810
01:49:57.250 --> 01:49:59.740
<v Speaker 4>That's the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the point of meaning.</v>

1811
01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.620
<v Speaker 4>It's the same place that's at the center</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a cathedral.</v>

1812
01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:03.940
<v Speaker 4>It's the same idea.</v>

1813
01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:09.600
<v Speaker 4>You stand there because you're secure </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you have tradition and the power</v>

1814
01:50:10.811 --> 01:50:15.811
<v Speaker 4>of your civilization behind you and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have one foot in chaos because that's </v>

1815
01:50:15.811 --> 01:50:20.701
<v Speaker 4>not enough and never will be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the instinct that puts you there is </v>

1816
01:50:20.701 --> 01:50:23.920
<v Speaker 4>the instinct of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can use that as a guide,</v>

1817
01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:28.780
<v Speaker 4>and it's a deep neurological instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not some EPA phenomena.</v>

1818
01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:34.590
<v Speaker 4>It's the most real thing there is as far</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I can tell and associated with that </v>

1819
01:50:34.590 --> 01:50:39.091
<v Speaker 4>is a certain attitude towards life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is to venture courageously out </v>

1820
01:50:39.431 --> 01:50:42.460
<v Speaker 4>into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to put yourself on the line,</v>

1821
01:50:42.490 --> 01:50:44.950
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to heed the call of adventure,</v>

1822
01:50:45.250 --> 01:50:50.250
<v Speaker 4>to risk yourself voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have no choice anyways,</v>

1823
01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:54.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you're in this all the way.</v>

1824
01:50:54.570 --> 01:50:56.710
<v Speaker 4>There is no out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That isn't death.</v>

1825
01:50:58.130 --> 01:51:03.130
<v Speaker 4>The full catastrophe is at your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't evade or escape that,</v>

1826
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:07.790
<v Speaker 4>but what you can do is choose how it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're going to confront it.</v>

1827
01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:13.660
<v Speaker 4>And so rule one is to stand up straight </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your shoulders back and to </v>

1828
01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:17.441
<v Speaker 4>manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is the thing that's so amazing </v>

1829
01:51:17.441 --> 01:51:17.441
<v Speaker 4>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1830
01:51:17.441 --> 01:51:21.720
<v Speaker 4>and that what lands are kind of ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 4>reality to the idea of positioning </v>

1831
01:51:22.911 --> 01:51:25.130
<v Speaker 4>yourself properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might say,</v>

1832
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:31.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's presume that you're a very </v>

1833
01:51:31.450 --> 01:51:34.130
<v Speaker 4>pessimistic person or a very realistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

1834
01:51:35.690 --> 01:51:36.950
<v Speaker 4>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1835
01:51:36.951 --> 01:51:39.290
<v Speaker 4>what's the fundamental reality of life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>

1836
01:51:39.291 --> 01:51:42.970
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's suffering and malevolence like,</v>

1837
01:51:42.971 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a hard argument to forestall,</v>

1838
01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:52.690
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true,</v>

1839
01:51:52.691 --> 01:51:54.850
<v Speaker 4>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the final truth.</v>

1840
01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:59.260
<v Speaker 4>The final truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>despite the fact that that's true,</v>

1841
01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:04.980
<v Speaker 4>the ability of the human spirit to </v>
<v Speaker 4>prevail is more powerful than death and </v>

1842
01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:05.440
<v Speaker 4>evil.</v>

1843
01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:12.990
<v Speaker 4>That's the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know that you know that.</v>

1844
01:52:12.991 --> 01:52:17.991
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that because you're ashamed </v>

1845
01:52:17.991 --> 01:52:20.750
<v Speaker 4>that you're not everything you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that because the people that </v>

1846
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:25.101
<v Speaker 4>you admire are people who manifest </v>
<v Speaker 4>courage in the diarist of straights and </v>

1847
01:52:26.011 --> 01:52:31.011
<v Speaker 4>you know that as well because when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet people like that and you're not </v>

1848
01:52:31.011 --> 01:52:31.350
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shame you.</v>

1849
01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.650
<v Speaker 4>That speaks to your deepest possible </v>
<v Speaker 4>instinct.</v>

1850
01:52:34.651 --> 01:52:39.651
<v Speaker 4>You know what you could be and you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>too that you see people contend with </v>

1851
01:52:39.651 --> 01:52:44.151
<v Speaker 4>situations that are so difficult that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's truly a miracle that they can </v>

1852
01:52:44.151 --> 01:52:44.850
<v Speaker 4>contend with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1853
01:52:44.851 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 4>when I of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1854
01:52:46.131 --> 01:52:47.960
<v Speaker 4>I think the people who work in funeral </v>
<v Speaker 4>homes,</v>

1855
01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:50.090
<v Speaker 4>that's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hard,</v>

1856
01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:55.960
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's death and grief every day and </v>

1857
01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:57.980
<v Speaker 4>it's not something that you can avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's right there.</v>

1858
01:52:57.981 --> 01:52:59.570
<v Speaker 4>It's as real as it can possibly be.</v>

1859
01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:04.840
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you a story about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a client who was very afraid of </v>

1860
01:53:05.541 --> 01:53:10.541
<v Speaker 4>being alive and she wanted to sleep all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time and she took sleeping pills and</v>

1861
01:53:11.811 --> 01:53:16.811
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of other things so that she </v>
<v Speaker 4>could evade the burden of being </v>

1862
01:53:16.811 --> 01:53:20.201
<v Speaker 4>conscious and she was a very good </v>
<v Speaker 4>dreamer and she she wasn't doing well in</v>

1863
01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:26.501
<v Speaker 4>university and she had a dream one night</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Gypsy told her that she was </v>

1864
01:53:27.501 --> 01:53:29.450
<v Speaker 4>actually lucid during her dreams by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1865
01:53:29.451 --> 01:53:33.500
<v Speaker 4>and she could ask her dream characters </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they meant and they would tell her,</v>

1866
01:53:33.650 --> 01:53:36.320
<v Speaker 4>which was something I'd never seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone else manage.</v>

1867
01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:39.950
<v Speaker 4>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she jumped up this gypsy that she met in</v>

1868
01:53:39.951 --> 01:53:42.320
<v Speaker 4>the forest and the Gypsy told her that </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless she learned to,</v>

1869
01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:44.900
<v Speaker 4>unless she could learn to work in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>slaughter house,</v>

1870
01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:48.770
<v Speaker 4>she'd never finished her degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so she told me that story.</v>

1871
01:53:49.110 --> 01:53:52.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the classic treatment for people who</v>

1872
01:53:52.671 --> 01:53:56.330
<v Speaker 4>are afraid of things is to expose them </v>
<v Speaker 4>to what they're afraid of.</v>

1873
01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:01.840
<v Speaker 4>Which is a good lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have children because he wanted </v>

1874
01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:03.200
<v Speaker 4>expose your children to challenges </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that makes them stronger,</v>

1875
01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:08.410
<v Speaker 4>it has to be done voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you have posttraumatic stress </v>

1876
01:54:08.410 --> 01:54:09.890
<v Speaker 4>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say you're the victim of a vicious</v>

1877
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:13.040
<v Speaker 4>sexual assault by a stranger until years</v>
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>

1878
01:54:13.041 --> 01:54:18.041
<v Speaker 4>you have posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most effective treatment is to get </v>

1879
01:54:18.041 --> 01:54:22.211
<v Speaker 4>you to relive the experience in is much </v>
<v Speaker 4>vivid detail as you possibly can and </v>

1880
01:54:22.211 --> 01:54:24.290
<v Speaker 4>experience all the emotions that </v>
<v Speaker 4>occurred while it was happening,</v>

1881
01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:26.810
<v Speaker 4>and if the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do that,</v>

1882
01:54:26.811 --> 01:54:30.020
<v Speaker 4>the more upset you get when you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do it voluntarily,</v>

1883
01:54:30.021 --> 01:54:32.720
<v Speaker 4>the faster you get better and the longer</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stay better.</v>

1884
01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:38.500
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a general rule of thumb in </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychotherapy is if someone's avoiding </v>

1885
01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:39.380
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find out what they're avoiding,</v>

1886
01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:44.720
<v Speaker 4>break it into manageable pieces and have</v>
<v Speaker 4>them voluntarily expose themselves to it</v>

1887
01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:46.640
<v Speaker 4>and they they will be cured.</v>

1888
01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:48.530
<v Speaker 4>And that's the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fight in,</v>

1889
01:54:48.650 --> 01:54:53.300
<v Speaker 4>in clinical practice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find what you most want to what you most</v>

1890
01:54:53.301 --> 01:54:56.660
<v Speaker 4>need will be found where you least want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to look right?</v>

1891
01:54:56.690 --> 01:55:01.690
<v Speaker 4>That's a hell of a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she told me this dream and I thought,</v>

1892
01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:07.780
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to arrange for you to </v>

1893
01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:09.080
<v Speaker 4>work in a slaughterhouse that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>seem like a very.</v>

1894
01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:12.320
<v Speaker 4>She wouldn't eat meat by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wouldn't go into a butcher store.</v>

1895
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:16.820
<v Speaker 4>I took her into a butcher store once and</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had a very catastrophic reaction.</v>

1896
01:55:16.821 --> 01:55:20.870
<v Speaker 4>She couldn't handle it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1897
01:55:20.871 --> 01:55:22.880
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can arrange the slaughterhouse thing,</v>

1898
01:55:22.881 --> 01:55:27.881
<v Speaker 4>why don't you go away and for awhile and</v>
<v Speaker 4>come back in a week and see if you can </v>

1899
01:55:27.881 --> 01:55:29.480
<v Speaker 4>come up with an alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1900
01:55:29.481 --> 01:55:31.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she came back and she said,</v>

1901
01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:34.790
<v Speaker 4>I want to see an embalming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

1902
01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:36.560
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1903
01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:38.330
<v Speaker 4>how the hell am I going to arrange that?</v>

1904
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:40.910
<v Speaker 4>So I phoned a couple of funeral homes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I said,</v>

1905
01:55:40.911 --> 01:55:43.200
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got this person who's really afraid</v>

1906
01:55:43.201 --> 01:55:48.201
<v Speaker 4>of death and she had this dream and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>told them the story and they said,</v>

1907
01:55:48.330 --> 01:55:50.370
<v Speaker 4>no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bring her in.</v>

1908
01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:54.120
<v Speaker 4>And so I wasn't looking forward to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

1909
01:55:54.730 --> 01:55:57.750
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we went and she was very,</v>

1910
01:55:57.751 --> 01:56:00.930
<v Speaker 4>very nervous because she certainly </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't think she could handle that.</v>

1911
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:06.350
<v Speaker 4>And as I said already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't exactly thrilled about it </v>

1912
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.350
<v Speaker 4>either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in,</v>

1913
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:07.140
<v Speaker 4>for a pound in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a penny in,</v>

1914
01:56:07.141 --> 01:56:09.060
<v Speaker 4>for a pound as they say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

1915
01:56:09.061 --> 01:56:13.350
<v Speaker 4>we went to the funeral parlor and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>showed us around and we asked a bunch of</v>

1916
01:56:13.351 --> 01:56:18.351
<v Speaker 4>questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the hell did they cope with their </v>

1917
01:56:18.351 --> 01:56:18.351
<v Speaker 4>jobs because that's just a mystery to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

1918
01:56:18.351 --> 01:56:18.600
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1919
01:56:18.601 --> 01:56:23.601
<v Speaker 4>it was actually really useful for them </v>
<v Speaker 4>to guide people through the process of </v>

1920
01:56:23.601 --> 01:56:26.811
<v Speaker 4>grief and that their experience was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that had given them a renewed </v>

1921
01:56:26.811 --> 01:56:30.501
<v Speaker 4>appreciation for life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is well that would account for why</v>

1922
01:56:30.961 --> 01:56:33.570
<v Speaker 4>they were able to do it because it seems</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a very hard job.</v>

1923
01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:38.570
<v Speaker 4>And so we went into this room and watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>this embalming and I was about eight </v>

1924
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:45.201
<v Speaker 4>feet away from this small room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a pretty gruesome operation as you </v>

1925
01:56:45.201 --> 01:56:45.201
<v Speaker 4>might imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1926
01:56:45.201 --> 01:56:50.150
<v Speaker 4>my client was sitting beside me and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was watching her and watching the </v>

1927
01:56:50.150 --> 01:56:53.471
<v Speaker 4>embalming as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for the first while she was just </v>

1928
01:56:53.471 --> 01:56:53.880
<v Speaker 4>looking to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>

1929
01:56:53.881 --> 01:56:56.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here and I certainly can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>handle that.</v>

1930
01:56:56.820 --> 01:57:00.090
<v Speaker 4>And no bloody wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally and so,</v>

1931
01:57:00.091 --> 01:57:05.091
<v Speaker 4>but then she would take the odd glance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say she'd go like this and then look </v>

1932
01:57:05.091 --> 01:57:08.340
<v Speaker 4>away and then as the minutes ticked by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fairly rapidly,</v>

1933
01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:13.580
<v Speaker 4>she was spending more time watching and </v>
<v Speaker 4>less time looking away until she was </v>

1934
01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:17.781
<v Speaker 4>finally doing nothing but watching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then at some point she asked if she </v>

1935
01:57:17.781 --> 01:57:18.780
<v Speaker 4>could come in and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and put her hand on the body.</v>

1936
01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:23.840
<v Speaker 4>And so they gave her a glove and she did</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and then she went and sat down and </v>

1937
01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:27.030
<v Speaker 4>she was quite quiet about all this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite quiet afterwards and well.</v>

1938
01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:30.210
<v Speaker 4>So what did she discover?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1939
01:57:30.211 --> 01:57:33.000
<v Speaker 4>she didn't discover the death was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't horrible.</v>

1940
01:57:34.110 --> 01:57:39.110
<v Speaker 4>She didn't discover that and she didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>discover the death wasn't terrifying </v>

1941
01:57:39.110 --> 01:57:43.850
<v Speaker 4>because it certainly was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what she did discover was that she </v>

1942
01:57:43.850 --> 01:57:44.820
<v Speaker 4>was a hell of a lot tougher than she </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought and,</v>

1943
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:47.670
<v Speaker 4>and much quicker than she would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>believed.</v>

1944
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:50.850
<v Speaker 4>And she went away thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh,</v>

1945
01:57:52.590 --> 01:57:57.590
<v Speaker 4>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did the thing I was most afraid of </v>

1946
01:57:57.590 --> 01:57:58.110
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here I am.</v>

1947
01:57:59.130 --> 01:58:02.370
<v Speaker 4>Not only am I not more damaged than I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

1948
01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:05.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually better than I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so from then on,</v>

1949
01:58:05.881 --> 01:58:08.370
<v Speaker 4>she had a reference point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1950
01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:13.700
<v Speaker 4>Which is an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is why primordial people </v>

1951
01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:14.790
<v Speaker 4>initiate their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially their young men,</v>

1952
01:58:14.791 --> 01:58:16.860
<v Speaker 4>because it sort of happens automatically</v>
<v Speaker 4>with young women.</v>

1953
01:58:17.250 --> 01:58:19.860
<v Speaker 4>They exposed their young men to </v>
<v Speaker 4>something absolutely terrifying,</v>

1954
01:58:20.190 --> 01:58:23.430
<v Speaker 4>genuinely terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that for the rest of their lives,</v>

1955
01:58:23.431 --> 01:58:27.480
<v Speaker 4>they know the difference between what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually terrifying and what's just sort</v>

1956
01:58:27.481 --> 01:58:30.690
<v Speaker 4>of normal catastrophe because you really</v>
<v Speaker 4>need to know that,</v>

1957
01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:35.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you need to know that you can </v>

1958
01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:37.581
<v Speaker 4>prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things she learned as a </v>

1959
01:58:37.581 --> 01:58:39.741
<v Speaker 4>consequence of that exposure was that </v>
<v Speaker 4>she could prevail despite the realities </v>

1960
01:58:40.921 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 4>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1961
01:58:42.131 --> 01:58:45.340
<v Speaker 4>that's what you want to teach your </v>
<v Speaker 4>children mostly by example,</v>

1962
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:49.690
<v Speaker 4>is that they can prevail despite the </v>
<v Speaker 4>realities of life.</v>

1963
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that also means that you have to have </v>

1964
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:54.990
<v Speaker 4>admitted to what the realities of life </v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

1965
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:56.260
<v Speaker 4>But the thing that's so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>

1966
01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:00.850
<v Speaker 4>Here's another story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know the story of King Arthur and</v>

1967
01:59:00.851 --> 01:59:01.600
<v Speaker 4>the holy grail.</v>

1968
01:59:03.850 --> 01:59:08.850
<v Speaker 4>The holy grail is the ultimate value </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's a symbol of whatever the </v>

1969
01:59:08.850 --> 01:59:12.511
<v Speaker 4>ultimate value is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And King Arthur assembles is nights </v>

1970
01:59:12.511 --> 01:59:14.800
<v Speaker 4>around the round table and it's a round </v>
<v Speaker 4>table because they're all equal,</v>

1971
01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:20.220
<v Speaker 4>despite the fact that they have a king,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sit as equals at the round table </v>

1972
01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:21.760
<v Speaker 4>and they all decided to go off to seek </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the holy grail.</v>

1973
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:26.260
<v Speaker 4>It's either the cup that Christ drank </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of at the last supper,</v>

1974
01:59:26.261 --> 01:59:28.090
<v Speaker 4>the cup that held his blood on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cross.</v>

1975
01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:30.220
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really matter.</v>

1976
01:59:30.221 --> 01:59:34.210
<v Speaker 4>It's a symbol of what's redemptive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the holy grail is.</v>

1977
01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:37.000
<v Speaker 4>So it's a representation of the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>

1978
01:59:37.690 --> 01:59:42.690
<v Speaker 4>The question is where do you go to seek </v>
<v Speaker 4>out what's of ultimate value and answer </v>

1979
01:59:42.691 --> 01:59:47.691
<v Speaker 4>in the in the tail of of King Arthur and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the holy grail is that each night </v>

1980
01:59:47.691 --> 01:59:52.201
<v Speaker 4>entered the forest when they began their</v>
<v Speaker 4>search at the place that looks darkest </v>

1981
01:59:52.201 --> 01:59:52.240
<v Speaker 4>to them.</v>

1982
01:59:54.390 --> 01:59:59.390
<v Speaker 4>So that's the thing is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary if you're going to stand up </v>

1983
01:59:59.390 --> 02:00:04.340
<v Speaker 4>straight with your shoulders back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>confront the darkness of the world,</v>

1984
02:00:04.741 --> 02:00:09.741
<v Speaker 4>head on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take responsibility for the tragedy </v>

1985
02:00:09.741 --> 02:00:12.570
<v Speaker 4>of existence and for for malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it means.</v>

1986
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:17.870
<v Speaker 4>That's the what the Christian injunction</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take the sins of the world onto </v>

1987
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:19.560
<v Speaker 4>yourself means it means it's your bloody</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>

1988
02:00:19.950 --> 02:00:22.770
<v Speaker 4>and to confront Satan in the desert is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same idea,</v>

1989
02:00:23.130 --> 02:00:27.000
<v Speaker 4>is that not only do you have to take on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tragedy of the world as if it's your</v>

1990
02:00:27.001 --> 02:00:32.001
<v Speaker 4>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to contend with the spirit </v>

1991
02:00:32.001 --> 02:00:33.360
<v Speaker 4>of malevolence while you're doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's in doing that,</v>

1992
02:00:33.361 --> 02:00:38.361
<v Speaker 4>that you find your destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where you find the highest of </v>

1993
02:00:38.361 --> 02:00:39.420
<v Speaker 4>possible values,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the call.</v>

1994
02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:42.660
<v Speaker 4>That's the call to the nobility of being</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you might think,</v>

1995
02:00:42.661 --> 02:00:47.661
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what could possibly justify your life </v>

1996
02:00:47.661 --> 02:00:50.450
<v Speaker 4>more thoroughly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What could make you the best player of </v>

1997
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:53.421
<v Speaker 4>all possible games than to take the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tragedy of the world onto your </v>

1998
02:00:54.511 --> 02:00:59.511
<v Speaker 4>shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fight with all your ability against </v>

1999
02:01:00.121 --> 02:01:04.920
<v Speaker 4>the malevolence in your own heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2000
02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:19.750
<v Speaker 4>The first one I'll choose here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for coming to speak with us.</v>

2001
02:01:19.810 --> 02:01:21.130
<v Speaker 4>What do you think of Iceland?</v>

2002
02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:31.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2003
02:01:31.930 --> 02:01:36.930
<v Speaker 4>thank you all for coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's quite remarkable to see so many </v>

2004
02:01:36.930 --> 02:01:39.190
<v Speaker 4>people come out for such a serious </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

2005
02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:40.370
<v Speaker 4>It isn't exactly</v>

2006
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:45.370
<v Speaker 3>what you'd expect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everyone has been ridiculously </v>

2007
02:01:46.041 --> 02:01:49.040
<v Speaker 3>hospitable to me and my family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2008
02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:52.520
<v Speaker 3>we've seen some beautiful things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were at the blue lagoon,</v>

2009
02:01:52.521 --> 02:01:57.521
<v Speaker 3>which was very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went to the house today where </v>

2010
02:01:57.521 --> 02:02:00.431
<v Speaker 3>Gorbachev and Reagan met in 1986 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was very interesting.</v>

2011
02:02:00.771 --> 02:02:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I went and saw some rare manuscripts at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the university this morning,</v>

2012
02:02:05.170 --> 02:02:10.170
<v Speaker 3>a goon lager and his crew of people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been very organized and you have a </v>

2013
02:02:12.111 --> 02:02:17.111
<v Speaker 3>beautiful little capital city that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily impressive and you've </v>

2014
02:02:17.211 --> 02:02:22.211
<v Speaker 3>produced this amazing venue and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>country is cruising along on all </v>

2015
02:02:22.761 --> 02:02:25.790
<v Speaker 3>cylinders and it's a hell of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>achievement.</v>

2016
02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:27.850
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2017
02:02:27.851 --> 02:02:30.830
<v Speaker 3>I think that almost all the time when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to a European country,</v>

2018
02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:35.090
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing how well it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2019
02:02:35.091 --> 02:02:36.380
<v Speaker 3>this is a harsh place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2020
02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:41.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you made a lot of what you have and it </v>

2021
02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:45.491
<v Speaker 3>looks to me like it's just getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and so it's peaceful and </v>

2022
02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:49.031
<v Speaker 3>productive and civilized and beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and hospitable and good for you.</v>

2023
02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:54.890
<v Speaker 3>And thank you for inviting me.</v>

2024
02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>This one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next one is regarding the hit pieces</v>

2025
02:03:06.190 --> 02:03:07.580
<v Speaker 1>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2026
02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:13.080
<v Speaker 1>when such an article is written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your interpretation of the costs</v>

2027
02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:19.500
<v Speaker 1>or further what potential explanations </v>
<v Speaker 1>are there for this phenomenon?</v>

2028
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

2029
02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:28.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could start with what I might be </v>

2030
02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:30.981
<v Speaker 3>contributing to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I've had to learn,</v>

2031
02:03:36.591 --> 02:03:41.591
<v Speaker 3>I've had some interactions with public </v>
<v Speaker 3>exposure for probably 15 years because I</v>

2032
02:03:46.010 --> 02:03:50.840
<v Speaker 3>worked a little bit with a public </v>
<v Speaker 3>television station in Ontario before all</v>

2033
02:03:50.841 --> 02:03:55.841
<v Speaker 3>this blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My producer who was someone who was very</v>

2034
02:03:59.051 --> 02:04:04.051
<v Speaker 3>much on my side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I worked for a public affairs show </v>

2035
02:04:04.051 --> 02:04:07.590
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a regular panelist and then as a </v>

2036
02:04:07.590 --> 02:04:07.810
<v Speaker 3>columnist for a couple of years,</v>

2037
02:04:10.570 --> 02:04:12.730
<v Speaker 3>my producer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a level headed guy,</v>

2038
02:04:14.350 --> 02:04:17.740
<v Speaker 3>well versed in what worked well in panel</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions,</v>

2039
02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:23.960
<v Speaker 3>told me to be very careful about </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlling my proclivity towards anger </v>

2040
02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:28.330
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't play very well </v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly.</v>

2041
02:04:29.530 --> 02:04:34.530
<v Speaker 3>And so now I kept trying to learn the </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine of minimal necessary force.</v>

2042
02:04:35.861 --> 02:04:40.861
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I that aggression is a good thing if </v>

2043
02:04:40.861 --> 02:04:42.870
<v Speaker 3>it's controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a good antidote to fear.</v>

2044
02:04:43.110 --> 02:04:48.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one of the things that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>help you maintain your ground in the </v>

2045
02:04:48.110 --> 02:04:50.610
<v Speaker 3>face of resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it has to be applied very,</v>

2046
02:04:50.611 --> 02:04:55.611
<v Speaker 3>very judiciously and it isn't obvious </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I always do that as well as I might</v>

2047
02:04:57.060 --> 02:05:02.060
<v Speaker 3>and if you're going to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult and dangerous and contentious </v>

2048
02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:06.591
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to get punished for </v>

2049
02:05:06.591 --> 02:05:08.700
<v Speaker 3>your failures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm trying to learn too.</v>

2050
02:05:09.190 --> 02:05:09.400
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2051
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Detach myself and to not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in a,</v>

2052
02:05:13.970 --> 02:05:16.810
<v Speaker 3>not in an I don't care way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2053
02:05:16.820 --> 02:05:21.820
<v Speaker 3>but in a watchful way and to keep all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that under control as much as possible </v>

2054
02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:27.260
<v Speaker 3>and to use minimal necessary force and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to learn to do that well.</v>

2055
02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:30.440
<v Speaker 3>And so to the degree that I don't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2056
02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:35.360
<v Speaker 3>then I instigate more opposition than I </v>
<v Speaker 3>might.</v>

2057
02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have hard time with that to some </v>

2058
02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:42.440
<v Speaker 3>degree because I do find some of what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been,</v>

2059
02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:46.690
<v Speaker 3>let's say opposing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2060
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:55.890
<v Speaker 3>what would you say I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me deeply.</v>

2061
02:05:56.480 --> 02:05:59.550
<v Speaker 3>It disturbs me deeply and makes me </v>
<v Speaker 3>unhappy and ashamed.</v>

2062
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:04.520
<v Speaker 3>That's particularly the case when I see </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening at the universities.</v>

2063
02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:10.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not impressed by what's happening in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social sciences and the humanities.</v>

2064
02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:12.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not impressed with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists.</v>

2065
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:18.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not impressed with the Marxists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly not impressed with the </v>

2066
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:21.860
<v Speaker 3>people or the theories that juxtapose </v>
<v Speaker 3>the two in this particularly</v>

2067
02:06:23.310 --> 02:06:28.310
<v Speaker 3>ideological brew that's been fermenting </v>
<v Speaker 3>say since the 19 sixties and so it's not</v>

2068
02:06:30.151 --> 02:06:32.790
<v Speaker 3>easy to maintain equanimity in the face </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>

2069
02:06:32.791 --> 02:06:35.370
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter because it's still</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary.</v>

2070
02:06:36.090 --> 02:06:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Do you think their ideology has </v>
<v Speaker 3>permeated all of media or because not </v>

2071
02:06:43.501 --> 02:06:44.340
<v Speaker 3>all of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2072
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:48.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the other thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is why dealing now,</v>

2073
02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:51.390
<v Speaker 3>now we can turn to what the media might </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring to this.</v>

2074
02:06:51.391 --> 02:06:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological,</v>

2075
02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:58.310
<v Speaker 3>ideological pre commitments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's certainly the case and inability </v>

2076
02:06:58.310 --> 02:07:01.740
<v Speaker 3>to see anything other than in </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicized terms.</v>

2077
02:07:01.741 --> 02:07:06.320
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't view that what I'm doing as</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally political action.</v>

2078
02:07:06.330 --> 02:07:09.900
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't view the battle that's raging in</v>

2079
02:07:09.901 --> 02:07:13.440
<v Speaker 3>the ideational substructure over society</v>
<v Speaker 3>is fundamentally political.</v>

2080
02:07:13.441 --> 02:07:18.441
<v Speaker 3>I think it's deeper than political.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's at least philosophical and it's </v>

2081
02:07:18.441 --> 02:07:22.401
<v Speaker 3>probably theological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the but the people who've been </v>

2082
02:07:22.891 --> 02:07:25.740
<v Speaker 3>pillaring me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say who tend to be the postmodern,</v>

2083
02:07:25.741 --> 02:07:30.741
<v Speaker 3>neo Marxist types,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least leaning that direction </v>

2084
02:07:30.741 --> 02:07:33.450
<v Speaker 3>cannot conceptualize anything that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>political in their world.</v>

2085
02:07:33.450 --> 02:07:35.160
<v Speaker 3>There isn't anything that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>political.</v>

2086
02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:37.720
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 3>consider,</v>

2087
02:07:37.721 --> 02:07:39.600
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you know,</v>

2088
02:07:40.930 --> 02:07:45.930
<v Speaker 3>I've been perhaps represented as an as </v>
<v Speaker 3>an advocate of free speech,</v>

2089
02:07:48.281 --> 02:07:53.281
<v Speaker 3>and of course there's a lot of debate </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what free speech really is from </v>

2090
02:07:54.190 --> 02:07:59.190
<v Speaker 3>the radical leftist types and here's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that you have to understand </v>

2091
02:07:59.190 --> 02:08:03.160
<v Speaker 3>from the collectivist perspective that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominates the radical left.</v>

2092
02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:08.460
<v Speaker 3>There is no such thing as free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that they oppose it,</v>

2093
02:08:10.210 --> 02:08:14.230
<v Speaker 3>it's that it isn't a move in their game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist.</v>

2094
02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:19.530
<v Speaker 3>So if you stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm manifesting my opinion as an </v>

2095
02:08:19.530 --> 02:08:24.301
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's not a acceptable move </v>

2096
02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:30.120
<v Speaker 3>because you aren't an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're an Avatar of your dominant group </v>

2097
02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:37.620
<v Speaker 3>and whatever you otter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of why you think you're </v>

2098
02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:41.371
<v Speaker 3>honoring it or regardless of whether you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's your individual opinion is </v>

2099
02:08:41.441 --> 02:08:46.441
<v Speaker 3>nothing but a power move in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy and so it's not like</v>

2100
02:08:46.721 --> 02:08:47.950
<v Speaker 3>they oppose free speech.</v>

2101
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:52.950
<v Speaker 3>It's that it doesn't exist in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptual framework and so that's one </v>

2102
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:57.601
<v Speaker 3>of the things that drives and they hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces because I do believe in the </v>

2103
02:08:58.301 --> 02:09:03.301
<v Speaker 3>individual and I do believe in free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech and I do believe in a world </v>

2104
02:09:03.301 --> 02:09:07.951
<v Speaker 3>outside the conceptual realm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of propositions that aren't </v>

2105
02:09:08.321 --> 02:09:13.321
<v Speaker 3>part and parcel of the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash neo Marxist game and they're not </v>

2106
02:09:13.871 --> 02:09:15.440
<v Speaker 3>very happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2107
02:09:15.710 --> 02:09:20.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not playing by the rules and so they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what to do about that.</v>

2108
02:09:21.370 --> 02:09:24.490
<v Speaker 3>The simplest thing to do is to call me </v>
<v Speaker 3>far right,</v>

2109
02:09:24.491 --> 02:09:28.300
<v Speaker 3>are all right because then they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2110
02:09:28.330 --> 02:09:30.730
<v Speaker 3>that's an evil category and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispenses with that,</v>

2111
02:09:30.731 --> 02:09:35.731
<v Speaker 3>but it also means they don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>contend with any of my arguments and </v>

2112
02:09:35.731 --> 02:09:39.241
<v Speaker 3>that's convenient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's easier to demonize than it is to</v>

2113
02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:45.600
<v Speaker 3>contend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't seem to help them because </v>

2114
02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:50.340
<v Speaker 3>the more they scream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more people that actually listened </v>

2115
02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:50.710
<v Speaker 3>to you here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not far right,</v>

2116
02:09:51.070 --> 02:09:52.100
<v Speaker 3>you're not all thrive.</v>

2117
02:09:52.150 --> 02:09:54.910
<v Speaker 3>And they stopped believing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2118
02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:59.940
<v Speaker 3>that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked with my wife about this </v>

2119
02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:02.581
<v Speaker 3>because it's been in Vr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's produced a lot of tension in our </v>

2120
02:10:02.581 --> 02:10:05.950
<v Speaker 3>family because it's very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for all sorts of reasons,</v>

2121
02:10:05.951 --> 02:10:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but that's certainly one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2122
02:10:07.781 --> 02:10:12.781
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly not the case that when I </v>

2123
02:10:12.781 --> 02:10:14.911
<v Speaker 3>read a headpiece that I'm very pleased </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and I'm often quite worried </v>

2124
02:10:16.181 --> 02:10:18.310
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the New York Times piece,</v>

2125
02:10:18.311 --> 02:10:21.220
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a good example and it's idiot.</v>

2126
02:10:22.570 --> 02:10:24.070
<v Speaker 3>What would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2127
02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:28.310
<v Speaker 3>insistence that I was promoting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2128
02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:33.660
<v Speaker 3>monogamy with the weapons of the state </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all the insane ideas.</v>

2129
02:10:34.071 --> 02:10:39.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the hell believes that it's like </v>

2130
02:10:39.071 --> 02:10:40.190
<v Speaker 3>some isis guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's about it.</v>

2131
02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:45.280
<v Speaker 3>So it's a completely absurd accusation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it certainly bore no resemblance to </v>

2132
02:10:46.401 --> 02:10:49.040
<v Speaker 3>anything that I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2133
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:54.041
<v Speaker 3>it's a powerful media organization and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of people warned me in the </v>

2134
02:10:54.041 --> 02:10:58.931
<v Speaker 3>immediate aftermath of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be my downfall and including </v>

2135
02:10:58.931 --> 02:11:02.261
<v Speaker 3>people who were less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't fearful people and so it's </v>

2136
02:11:02.261 --> 02:11:05.180
<v Speaker 3>very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one question is,</v>

2137
02:11:05.181 --> 02:11:10.181
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should I be doing interviews like that </v>

2138
02:11:10.181 --> 02:11:12.011
<v Speaker 3>at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the things I've thought </v>

2139
02:11:12.011 --> 02:11:12.080
<v Speaker 3>is no written interviews only live </v>
<v Speaker 3>interviews,</v>

2140
02:11:12.410 --> 02:11:16.940
<v Speaker 3>only the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the one today you had the last one.</v>

2141
02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:22.120
<v Speaker 3>Well see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because there's another </v>

2142
02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:22.340
<v Speaker 3>side of it which is the side you laid </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2143
02:11:22.341 --> 02:11:27.341
<v Speaker 3>It's like this happened with the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of you have seen the channel for </v>

2144
02:11:27.341 --> 02:11:29.180
<v Speaker 3>interview that I did with Kathy Newman</v>

2145
02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:35.520
<v Speaker 2>and thank you.</v>

2146
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:43.000
<v Speaker 3>You know when that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that was a stressful </v>

2147
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.641
<v Speaker 3>interview and I would say that the two </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks after the interview we're also </v>

2148
02:11:45.641 --> 02:11:48.610
<v Speaker 3>very stressful because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2149
02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:53.740
<v Speaker 3>first of all there was the interview and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought they'd just cut it to seven </v>

2150
02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:54.440
<v Speaker 3>minutes and pillory me and leave it at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2151
02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:00.400
<v Speaker 3>but they cut it to seven minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pilloried me and then they posted the </v>

2152
02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.190
<v Speaker 3>whole interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which just shocked me.</v>

2153
02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:06.460
<v Speaker 3>But here's the shocking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people who posted that interview </v>

2154
02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:10.460
<v Speaker 3>thought it went well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they posted it.</v>

2155
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:11.630
<v Speaker 3>They didn't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2156
02:12:11.631 --> 02:12:13.280
<v Speaker 3>this is contentious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We better put it out,</v>

2157
02:12:13.281 --> 02:12:18.281
<v Speaker 3>believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't think that that is not what </v>

2158
02:12:18.281 --> 02:12:20.351
<v Speaker 3>they thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought it went fine and so then </v>

2159
02:12:20.351 --> 02:12:22.781
<v Speaker 3>there was this overwhelming response to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and that was completely unexpected </v>

2160
02:12:22.781 --> 02:12:27.370
<v Speaker 3>and then the counter response was </v>
<v Speaker 3>Peterson's army of alt right trolls is </v>

2161
02:12:27.591 --> 02:12:31.160
<v Speaker 3>victimizing Kathy Newman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was.</v>

2162
02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:34.880
<v Speaker 3>That was the response of her employers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the technical response,</v>

2163
02:12:34.881 --> 02:12:39.881
<v Speaker 3>because that's what they publish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said we had to call him police to </v>

2164
02:12:39.881 --> 02:12:39.881
<v Speaker 3>evaluate the threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2165
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:45.430
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what anybody can call in police to </v>

2166
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:48.461
<v Speaker 3>evaluate a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean that the threat </v>

2167
02:12:48.461 --> 02:12:48.920
<v Speaker 3>justified police intervention or that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a threat.</v>

2168
02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:54.370
<v Speaker 3>It just meant that that's how you </v>
<v Speaker 3>responded to it and then they spun a </v>

2169
02:12:54.370 --> 02:12:56.300
<v Speaker 3>victim narrative for Kathy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was I think reprehensible.</v>

2170
02:12:56.301 --> 02:13:01.301
<v Speaker 3>Given that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what Kathy Newman is </v>

2171
02:13:01.301 --> 02:13:01.370
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's not a bloody victim.</v>

2172
02:13:01.610 --> 02:13:06.610
<v Speaker 3>She's not powerless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's one of the most powerful women in </v>

2173
02:13:06.610 --> 02:13:08.210
<v Speaker 3>the United Kingdom and she has a salary </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's commensurate with that and good,</v>

2174
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:10.070
<v Speaker 3>good for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely fine,</v>

2175
02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:12.470
<v Speaker 3>but you don't get to have that and also </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a victim.</v>

2176
02:13:12.890 --> 02:13:17.890
<v Speaker 3>It's not the right way to play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then a whole bunch of newspapers </v>

2177
02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:22.750
<v Speaker 3>laid out the story that poor Kathy was </v>
<v Speaker 3>being trolled by my,</v>

2178
02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:25.790
<v Speaker 3>my legion of all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry people,</v>

2179
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:29.020
<v Speaker 3>but then the numbers started to mount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2180
02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:34.060
<v Speaker 3>and after it was like 4 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got the whole troll argument got hard</v>

2181
02:13:34.201 --> 02:13:36.180
<v Speaker 3>to sustain unless you think there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2182
02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:41.780
<v Speaker 3>well now it's perhaps 30 million people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have watched either the whole thing or </v>

2183
02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:42.000
<v Speaker 3>major clips from it.</v>

2184
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to sustain the old troll </v>

2185
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.180
<v Speaker 3>argument when it's 30 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was very.</v>

2186
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I thought that narrative was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevail for a while that you know,</v>

2187
02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:56.600
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got victimized and it was all these </v>

2188
02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:56.700
<v Speaker 3>terrible people that went after her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that collapsed.</v>

2189
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:59.070
<v Speaker 3>But it's very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2190
02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:02.530
<v Speaker 3>and this is something that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've learned.</v>

2191
02:14:02.590 --> 02:14:06.580
<v Speaker 3>So I've been obsessing about another </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement in the New Testament for about</v>

2192
02:14:06.581 --> 02:14:11.581
<v Speaker 3>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to figure it out and </v>

2193
02:14:11.581 --> 02:14:13.471
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the statement that you should turn </v>

2194
02:14:13.471 --> 02:14:13.471
<v Speaker 3>the other cheek and that's a tough one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2195
02:14:13.471 --> 02:14:14.620
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2196
02:14:14.621 --> 02:14:16.570
<v Speaker 3>because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wants to do that?</v>

2197
02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Because you want to explode in righteous</v>
<v Speaker 3>anger.</v>

2198
02:14:19.211 --> 02:14:22.600
<v Speaker 3>At least you want to defend yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to do one of those things,</v>

2199
02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:28.200
<v Speaker 3>so what the hell does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And partly what it means is if you're </v>

2200
02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:36.470
<v Speaker 3>attacked and you're innocent and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2201
02:14:36.471 --> 02:14:39.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I'm like globally </v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent or anything like that,</v>

2202
02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:45.490
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not guilty of the accusations </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are levied at me or at least I not </v>

2203
02:14:46.190 --> 02:14:50.600
<v Speaker 3>guilty in the manner that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>accusations would indicate.</v>

2204
02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:56.410
<v Speaker 3>If you're being attacked and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>guilty of the accusations,</v>

2205
02:14:56.411 --> 02:14:57.910
<v Speaker 3>then the attacks</v>

2206
02:14:59.850 --> 02:15:04.320
<v Speaker 3>say more about the attacker then their </v>
<v Speaker 3>intended target.</v>

2207
02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:10.670
<v Speaker 3>And so so far I've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>withstand the attacks and the </v>

2208
02:15:10.670 --> 02:15:15.021
<v Speaker 3>consequence of that is that it said more</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the attackers then about meat and </v>

2209
02:15:15.421 --> 02:15:17.580
<v Speaker 3>then the question is can I tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

2210
02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:23.120
<v Speaker 3>Because it's still very stressful and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>vary our waiver on that back and forth.</v>

2211
02:15:26.630 --> 02:15:31.630
<v Speaker 3>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other issue is is that some people </v>

2212
02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:35.261
<v Speaker 3>in the media have pilloried me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but many haven't been very many </v>

2213
02:15:35.261 --> 02:15:37.850
<v Speaker 3>thoughtful people that have written </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughtful pieces about me.</v>

2214
02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:41.090
<v Speaker 3>There's a Canadian consortium of 200 </v>
<v Speaker 3>newspapers,</v>

2215
02:15:41.330 --> 02:15:44.000
<v Speaker 3>the post media group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they came out.</v>

2216
02:15:44.060 --> 02:15:49.060
<v Speaker 3>The entire group came out in favor of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>stance in relationship to build </v>

2217
02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:51.020
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a speech,</v>

2218
02:15:51.021 --> 02:15:54.490
<v Speaker 3>a speech piece of legislation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelled speech and so</v>

2219
02:15:57.620 --> 02:15:58.760
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2220
02:16:00.190 --> 02:16:05.190
<v Speaker 3>so far in same with the protests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people come out to protest against </v>

2221
02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:09.541
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first video that really went viral </v>

2222
02:16:09.541 --> 02:16:11.521
<v Speaker 3>was a protest at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto and after the protest was over </v>

2223
02:16:12.590 --> 02:16:13.950
<v Speaker 3>the the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2224
02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:19.080
<v Speaker 3>the anti free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people at the protests took the </v>

2225
02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:20.350
<v Speaker 3>microphone away in and blasted white </v>
<v Speaker 3>noise.</v>

2226
02:16:20.351 --> 02:16:24.130
<v Speaker 3>Made it impossible for anyone to speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it was an open mic event.</v>

2227
02:16:26.250 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 3>So that got broadcast and then about two</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the event,</v>

2228
02:16:30.071 --> 02:16:35.071
<v Speaker 3>I went down to talk to the cops to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>if anybody had been hurt or anything </v>

2229
02:16:35.071 --> 02:16:39.121
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then on the way back into the </v>

2230
02:16:39.121 --> 02:16:39.550
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a cost by half a dozen,</v>

2231
02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:45.180
<v Speaker 3>like radical types and about 30 of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>hangers on and then there was a crowd of</v>

2232
02:16:45.641 --> 02:16:48.520
<v Speaker 3>people that I would say we're probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporting me,</v>

2233
02:16:48.521 --> 02:16:53.521
<v Speaker 3>that that gathered around me and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>went after me and videotaped all of it </v>

2234
02:16:53.521 --> 02:16:58.500
<v Speaker 3>on their cell phones and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>posted that and the idea was that that </v>

2235
02:16:58.841 --> 02:17:03.841
<v Speaker 3>was going to do me in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what happened was the comments were </v>

2236
02:17:03.841 --> 02:17:05.950
<v Speaker 3>100 to one in favor of what I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

2237
02:17:06.190 --> 02:17:11.190
<v Speaker 3>So that was another example where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>protests were more damaging to the </v>

2238
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:15.871
<v Speaker 3>protestors then they were to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's been luckily fortunately,</v>

2239
02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:19.450
<v Speaker 3>miraculously all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a recurrent pattern.</v>

2240
02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:25.440
<v Speaker 3>And so the question is whether or not I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can tolerate it and whether my family </v>

2241
02:17:26.231 --> 02:17:27.760
<v Speaker 3>can tolerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so far,</v>

2242
02:17:28.750 --> 02:17:33.750
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're trying to do something </v>

2243
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:35.910
<v Speaker 3>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say the right amount of </v>

2244
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.910
<v Speaker 3>controversy isn't zero.</v>

2245
02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:41.600
<v Speaker 3>The question is how much controversy can</v>
<v Speaker 3>you handle and how much of the mud </v>

2246
02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:45.531
<v Speaker 3>that's thrown will stick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then how much of it deserves to </v>

2247
02:17:45.531 --> 02:17:45.531
<v Speaker 3>stick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of those things,</v>

2248
02:17:45.531 --> 02:17:47.790
<v Speaker 3>you've got to scour your conscience </v>
<v Speaker 3>under those circumstances,</v>

2249
02:17:48.370 --> 02:17:48.690
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2250
02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:56.960
<v Speaker 3>so far I've been fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you've taken on this </v>

2251
02:17:57.361 --> 02:18:02.361
<v Speaker 3>dragon voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like from the beginning you </v>

2252
02:18:02.361 --> 02:18:02.430
<v Speaker 3>have known that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2253
02:18:02.431 --> 02:18:07.431
<v Speaker 3>when you spoke up against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] in Canada,</v>

2254
02:18:08.401 --> 02:18:13.401
<v Speaker 3>you knew that this might become tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Guide taught people to negotiate in</v>

2255
02:18:15.841 --> 02:18:18.180
<v Speaker 3>my clinical practice for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2256
02:18:18.181 --> 02:18:23.181
<v Speaker 3>I've had lots of clients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of those clients were female and </v>

2257
02:18:23.181 --> 02:18:28.100
<v Speaker 3>the are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The goal in my consulting with them was </v>

2258
02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:32.061
<v Speaker 3>to double or triple their salary within </v>
<v Speaker 3>five years and so that wasn't </v>

2259
02:18:32.941 --> 02:18:35.490
<v Speaker 3>necessarily the only goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We discussed all sorts of goals,</v>

2260
02:18:35.491 --> 02:18:40.491
<v Speaker 3>but that was often one and so I was very</v>
<v Speaker 3>accustomed to organizing people to </v>

2261
02:18:40.491 --> 02:18:42.810
<v Speaker 3>negotiate and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to negotiate,</v>

2262
02:18:42.811 --> 02:18:47.070
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first rule is you have to be able to</v>

2263
02:18:47.071 --> 02:18:52.071
<v Speaker 3>say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what no means is there isn't </v>

2264
02:18:52.071 --> 02:18:54.330
<v Speaker 3>anything you can do to me to get me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

2265
02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:57.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what no means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No like you can be.</v>

2266
02:18:57.180 --> 02:18:59.670
<v Speaker 3>You can have different degrees of </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriousness about no,</v>

2267
02:18:59.671 --> 02:19:01.740
<v Speaker 3>but if you're going to negotiate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your boss,</v>

2268
02:19:01.741 --> 02:19:06.741
<v Speaker 3>say for a substantial raise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no means if I don't get it,</v>

2269
02:19:07.171 --> 02:19:12.171
<v Speaker 3>then I will leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fundamentally and leaving will </v>

2270
02:19:12.171 --> 02:19:12.420
<v Speaker 3>cost you more than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a threat,</v>

2271
02:19:12.450 --> 02:19:17.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be the observation that me </v>

2272
02:19:17.450 --> 02:19:20.631
<v Speaker 3>leaving will cost you substantially more</v>
<v Speaker 3>than giving me the race.</v>

2273
02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:25.880
<v Speaker 3>You have to be in a position to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>that case or you don't win the </v>

2274
02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:29.121
<v Speaker 3>negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I always put my clients in a </v>

2275
02:19:29.121 --> 02:19:29.720
<v Speaker 3>where if they went and asked for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2276
02:19:30.050 --> 02:19:33.530
<v Speaker 3>they were in a position to win because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't go and ask before that.</v>

2277
02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:37.190
<v Speaker 3>So when I made the video criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>bill c 16,</v>

2278
02:19:37.191 --> 02:19:41.000
<v Speaker 3>I thought I'm not abiding by this damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of legislation.</v>

2279
02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:42.440
<v Speaker 3>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2280
02:19:42.441 --> 02:19:45.770
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean that I'm not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

2281
02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:52.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had multiple sources of income so I </v>

2282
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:54.341
<v Speaker 3>was re.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reasonably position to tolerate a </v>

2283
02:19:54.341 --> 02:19:56.400
<v Speaker 3>fair bit of push back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could've got wiped out.</v>

2284
02:19:56.401 --> 02:19:59.240
<v Speaker 3>He had things gone sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would have been difficult to take</v>

2285
02:19:59.241 --> 02:20:02.090
<v Speaker 3>me out completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

2286
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:06.890
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I'm abiding by this piece</v>
<v Speaker 3>of legislation.</v>

2287
02:20:07.210 --> 02:20:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I was willing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought through the negative </v>

2288
02:20:12.210 --> 02:20:12.800
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I didn't of course think that any of</v>

2289
02:20:12.801 --> 02:20:16.460
<v Speaker 3>this would happen because this is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely preposterous and no one could</v>

2290
02:20:16.461 --> 02:20:17.960
<v Speaker 3>have possibly foreseen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

2291
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:23.210
<v Speaker 3>So I would say there were certain things</v>
<v Speaker 3>I faced in doing that,</v>

2292
02:20:23.211 --> 02:20:28.211
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't have foreseen the </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely explosive consequences.</v>

2293
02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm not unhappy that I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do it again.</v>

2294
02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:34.310
<v Speaker 3>I am still doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose.</v>

2295
02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:39.880
<v Speaker 3>So which of your 12 rules to break?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of?</v>

2296
02:20:42.250 --> 02:20:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

2297
02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:56.720
<v Speaker 3>I could probably still be better at </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to people I like.</v>

2298
02:20:56.721 --> 02:21:00.110
<v Speaker 3>I have these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do interviews with people.</v>

2299
02:21:00.111 --> 02:21:02.510
<v Speaker 3>I call them discussions because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not really interviews.</v>

2300
02:21:03.310 --> 02:21:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Probably they're not interviews because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked too much,</v>

2301
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:11.590
<v Speaker 3>so I had to call them discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say the most common </v>

2302
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:13.430
<v Speaker 3>criticism of those discussions is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2303
02:21:13.770 --> 02:21:18.770
<v Speaker 3>I interrupt the people that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussing things with and until the </v>

2304
02:21:19.011 --> 02:21:22.250
<v Speaker 3>conversation probably a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards me,</v>

2305
02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:27.520
<v Speaker 3>my thinking than there is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of that I think is my natural </v>

2306
02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:31.310
<v Speaker 3>tendency towards like I've always talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot ever since I was like three,</v>

2307
02:21:31.850 --> 02:21:35.330
<v Speaker 3>like continually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2308
02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:37.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm verbally fluent,</v>

2309
02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:37.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2310
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:40.040
<v Speaker 3>it's part of my nature and extroverted,</v>

2311
02:21:40.930 --> 02:21:41.560
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2312
02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:46.230
<v Speaker 3>you can always get better at listening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2313
02:21:46.810 --> 02:21:51.160
<v Speaker 3>and so I can listen and I practiced that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a therapist.</v>

2314
02:21:51.161 --> 02:21:52.510
<v Speaker 3>But I would say that's probably the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rule.</v>

2315
02:21:52.511 --> 02:21:57.511
<v Speaker 3>I break that rule nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like assume that the person you're </v>

2316
02:21:57.511 --> 02:21:59.911
<v Speaker 3>listening to know something you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm not as good at that yet as</v>

2317
02:22:00.071 --> 02:22:05.050
<v Speaker 3>I could be because I wouldn't get that </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticism if I was like,</v>

2318
02:22:05.051 --> 02:22:08.470
<v Speaker 3>it's not every comment or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably like every 20th comment or</v>

2319
02:22:08.471 --> 02:22:10.000
<v Speaker 3>every 30th comment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

2320
02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:12.040
<v Speaker 3>But it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's consistent.</v>

2321
02:22:12.041 --> 02:22:13.750
<v Speaker 3>And so every time I have an interview I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

2322
02:22:13.751 --> 02:22:15.430
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to shut up a little bit</v>

2323
02:22:15.431 --> 02:22:20.431
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I get excited about what's </v>

2324
02:22:20.431 --> 02:22:22.300
<v Speaker 3>happening and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk too much.</v>

2325
02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:32.520
<v Speaker 3>One thing related to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you seem to go off on a </v>

2326
02:22:33.691 --> 02:22:36.210
<v Speaker 3>tangent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're discussing something,</v>

2327
02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:38.130
<v Speaker 3>you'd go into a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2328
02:22:38.131 --> 02:22:40.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something related to it,</v>

2329
02:22:40.570 --> 02:22:43.770
<v Speaker 3>then you come back to a greater </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of things.</v>

2330
02:22:44.140 --> 02:22:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>

2331
02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:50.360
<v Speaker 3>have you laid all this out before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>say it or do you just go from one topic </v>

2332
02:22:52.201 --> 02:22:57.201
<v Speaker 3>to another and they somehow relate </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and become whole and both.</v>

2333
02:22:57.420 --> 02:22:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2334
02:22:58.490 --> 02:23:02.230
<v Speaker 3>but so before I do a talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have to,</v>

2335
02:23:02.610 --> 02:23:04.680
<v Speaker 3>I think about the talk all day before I </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

2336
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:06.870
<v Speaker 3>like not 100 percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2337
02:23:06.890 --> 02:23:11.890
<v Speaker 3>it's in my mind all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I'm trying to get is the basic </v>

2338
02:23:11.890 --> 02:23:15.981
<v Speaker 3>narrative and it's something like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can only use a metaphor to really </v>

2339
02:23:15.981 --> 02:23:19.461
<v Speaker 3>describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine you wanted to cross a swamp </v>

2340
02:23:19.461 --> 02:23:20.310
<v Speaker 3>and there were stones under the surface.</v>

2341
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:26.030
<v Speaker 3>You need to know where the stones are to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get from one side of the swamp to the </v>

2342
02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:29.001
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then that's what I do in my </v>

2343
02:23:29.001 --> 02:23:29.001
<v Speaker 3>imagination I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2344
02:23:29.001 --> 02:23:32.181
<v Speaker 3>well there's this area I have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>traverse and there's stepping stones </v>

2345
02:23:32.181 --> 02:23:34.890
<v Speaker 3>along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to know where they're located.</v>

2346
02:23:35.580 --> 02:23:38.880
<v Speaker 3>And so that might be like 12 points or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2347
02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:44.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the rough path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I have a whole corpus of </v>

2348
02:23:44.180 --> 02:23:48.921
<v Speaker 3>stories that fit each of those points </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I can choose how I'm going to </v>

2349
02:23:50.011 --> 02:23:55.011
<v Speaker 3>weave those together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have to remember where I'm going </v>

2350
02:23:55.011 --> 02:23:55.110
<v Speaker 3>and if I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2351
02:23:55.320 --> 02:24:00.320
<v Speaker 3>like if I'm healthy and functioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>property then I can go way out on a </v>

2352
02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:02.010
<v Speaker 3>tangent and I can still remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>

2353
02:24:02.011 --> 02:24:05.400
<v Speaker 3>I have to tie that back to this point </v>
<v Speaker 3>and move to the next step.</v>

2354
02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:07.350
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2355
02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:10.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like jazz improvisation </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially,</v>

2356
02:24:10.111 --> 02:24:15.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the melody and it has to </v>

2357
02:24:15.111 --> 02:24:16.250
<v Speaker 3>organize the melody has to organize all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the improvisation.</v>

2358
02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:19.440
<v Speaker 3>And then I have all these stories that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2359
02:24:20.190 --> 02:24:25.190
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I tell this story I try to </v>

2360
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:27.060
<v Speaker 3>vary it so that it brings in something I</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't brought in before.</v>

2361
02:24:27.061 --> 02:24:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Integrate something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2362
02:24:28.831 --> 02:24:31.050
<v Speaker 3>like what are the things I was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do tonight?</v>

2363
02:24:31.530 --> 02:24:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to figure out for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time is how to integrate the idea </v>

2364
02:24:36.530 --> 02:24:40.430
<v Speaker 3>of the good player of games with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of voluntarily shouldering you're </v>

2365
02:24:41.490 --> 02:24:44.850
<v Speaker 3>the catastrophe of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know those are the same thing,</v>

2366
02:24:45.330 --> 02:24:50.330
<v Speaker 3>but it's not obvious why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm still not completely obvious to </v>

2367
02:24:50.330 --> 02:24:54.741
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that the connection exists </v>

2368
02:24:54.741 --> 02:24:57.141
<v Speaker 3>and I got a fair bit of fairways tonight</v>
<v Speaker 3>farther than I had it stacking those </v>

2369
02:24:57.141 --> 02:25:02.061
<v Speaker 3>concepts on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the other thing I'm always trying to </v>

2370
02:25:02.061 --> 02:25:05.151
<v Speaker 3>do is to take each of these sets of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas and to weave them together more </v>

2371
02:25:05.911 --> 02:25:10.911
<v Speaker 3>tightly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also to push them further in their </v>

2372
02:25:10.911 --> 02:25:10.911
<v Speaker 3>development.</v>

2373
02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:13.680
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've been doing that on this tour.</v>

2374
02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Have you been developing your ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

2375
02:25:18.031 --> 02:25:19.620
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

2376
02:25:19.621 --> 02:25:24.621
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't give an effective lecture </v>

2377
02:25:24.621 --> 02:25:27.080
<v Speaker 3>without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you don't deliver a talk to an </v>

2378
02:25:27.641 --> 02:25:29.920
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2379
02:25:29.921 --> 02:25:34.000
<v Speaker 3>it's not at talk second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't deliver it.</v>

2380
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Third,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

2381
02:25:35.570 --> 02:25:40.570
<v Speaker 3>An audience like all of that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talk to individuals in the audience </v>

2382
02:25:42.250 --> 02:25:45.730
<v Speaker 3>one at a time and they're representative</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the whole,</v>

2383
02:25:45.731 --> 02:25:48.940
<v Speaker 3>but you're not talking to the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're afraid of public speaking,</v>

2384
02:25:48.941 --> 02:25:50.470
<v Speaker 3>it's because you're talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>

2385
02:25:50.471 --> 02:25:51.630
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget about that.</v>

2386
02:25:51.650 --> 02:25:53.740
<v Speaker 3>You just talked to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how to do that,</v>

2387
02:25:55.010 --> 02:26:00.010
<v Speaker 3>and then you're not delivering a talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>because then it's a canned product.</v>

2388
02:26:01.031 --> 02:26:04.180
<v Speaker 3>He muscled just hand people pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper that they could read.</v>

2389
02:26:04.850 --> 02:26:06.940
<v Speaker 3>It's more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not do that?</v>

2390
02:26:08.170 --> 02:26:13.170
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing if you address people </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly,</v>

2391
02:26:13.271 --> 02:26:18.271
<v Speaker 3>is that you involve them in the process </v>
<v Speaker 3>of furthering exploration of important </v>

2392
02:26:19.361 --> 02:26:21.280
<v Speaker 3>concepts and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2393
02:26:21.310 --> 02:26:22.120
<v Speaker 3>how can you do that?</v>

2394
02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Because they're sitting there passively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2395
02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.140
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not passive.</v>

2396
02:26:26.970 --> 02:26:30.130
<v Speaker 3>You're not verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not passive.</v>

2397
02:26:30.131 --> 02:26:35.131
<v Speaker 3>Like I listened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listened to whether or not everyone's </v>

2398
02:26:35.131 --> 02:26:36.070
<v Speaker 3>rustling around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're rustling around,</v>

2399
02:26:36.071 --> 02:26:39.490
<v Speaker 3>then I'm not balancing chaos in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

2400
02:26:40.090 --> 02:26:43.000
<v Speaker 3>You're not gripped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're.</v>

2401
02:26:43.090 --> 02:26:45.490
<v Speaker 3>If I can hear noise in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not right.</v>

2402
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:50.910
<v Speaker 3>I watched people one by one and I see </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they're shaking their head </v>

2403
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:51.190
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they're nodding.</v>

2404
02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they look confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If if people look confused,</v>

2405
02:26:55.271 --> 02:26:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2406
02:26:55.661 --> 02:27:00.661
<v Speaker 3>I haven't got that right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to be watching people and seeing </v>

2407
02:27:00.661 --> 02:27:03.541
<v Speaker 3>that they're understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're following along and that </v>

2408
02:27:03.541 --> 02:27:06.241
<v Speaker 3>indication that they're following along </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps me figure out if I'm in the right </v>

2409
02:27:06.241 --> 02:27:07.240
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so there's a dynamic that goes along</v>

2410
02:27:07.241 --> 02:27:12.241
<v Speaker 3>with it and so all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what you're doing if you </v>

2411
02:27:12.241 --> 02:27:15.040
<v Speaker 3>engage the audience properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you shouldn't be talking about things</v>

2412
02:27:15.041 --> 02:27:16.780
<v Speaker 3>you don't know enough about to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2413
02:27:17.170 --> 02:27:18.880
<v Speaker 3>So if you have to read your notes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2414
02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:21.250
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know enough to talk about that</v>

2415
02:27:21.490 --> 02:27:23.020
<v Speaker 3>because you need notes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2416
02:27:23.021 --> 02:27:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe when you're first starting to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about something,</v>

2417
02:27:24.941 --> 02:27:27.460
<v Speaker 3>you need notes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you need notes,</v>

2418
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:32.790
<v Speaker 3>you haven't prepared enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should know like 10 times as much </v>

2419
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:36.061
<v Speaker 3>about the topic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're going to talk about in the </v>

2420
02:27:36.061 --> 02:27:36.061
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>

2421
02:27:36.061 --> 02:27:37.480
<v Speaker 3>who the hell are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so while right,</v>

2422
02:27:37.481 --> 02:27:42.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be the authority so </v>

2423
02:27:42.481 --> 02:27:44.371
<v Speaker 3>you need to know these things and so and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then knowing these things,</v>

2424
02:27:45.311 --> 02:27:48.670
<v Speaker 3>you want to stretch them further because</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're.</v>

2425
02:27:49.350 --> 02:27:52.270
<v Speaker 3>This is a theater in a lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Theater.</v>

2426
02:27:52.510 --> 02:27:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Theater is drama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so why is it a lecture?</v>

2427
02:27:56.201 --> 02:27:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Theater?</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] lecture is drama.</v>

2428
02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:02.890
<v Speaker 3>What's the drama?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drama delivering a talk.</v>

2429
02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:05.720
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no drama in that.</v>

2430
02:28:05.721 --> 02:28:10.721
<v Speaker 3>A tape recorder can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The drama is to engage with the ideas </v>

2431
02:28:10.901 --> 02:28:15.901
<v Speaker 3>actively in real time and to discover </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the audience what the consequences </v>

2432
02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:19.480
<v Speaker 3>and that's what makes a novel great.</v>

2433
02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:24.480
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that Dostoyevsky is great is </v>

2434
02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:24.950
<v Speaker 3>because Dostoevsky did not know where he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going when he started.</v>

2435
02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:27.010
<v Speaker 3>He had problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2436
02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:28.970
<v Speaker 3>like crime and punishment is a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>

2437
02:28:28.971 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 3>He went to explore the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>between crime and punishment.</v>

2438
02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:33.590
<v Speaker 3>He didn't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2439
02:28:33.591 --> 02:28:35.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm a postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neo Marxist,</v>

2440
02:28:35.241 --> 02:28:40.241
<v Speaker 3>and I have a solution to the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime and punishment and I'm going to </v>

2441
02:28:40.241 --> 02:28:41.480
<v Speaker 3>write a novel describing what the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution is.</v>

2442
02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:43.220
<v Speaker 3>He thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a problem,</v>

2443
02:28:43.221 --> 02:28:44.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a major problem.</v>

2444
02:28:44.810 --> 02:28:49.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to divide myself into 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>characters and I'm going to have a war </v>

2445
02:28:49.810 --> 02:28:54.430
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to see what prevails and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he takes you along on that voyage and </v>

2446
02:28:54.430 --> 02:28:57.170
<v Speaker 3>it's what makes Dostoevsky different </v>
<v Speaker 3>than Ayn rand,</v>

2447
02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:02.560
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Ayn rand already knew who the </v>

2448
02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:05.441
<v Speaker 3>good guys and the bad guys were and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe she was right and maybe she </v>

2449
02:29:05.441 --> 02:29:05.441
<v Speaker 3>wasn't.</v>

2450
02:29:05.441 --> 02:29:08.180
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What matters is that what she did wasn't</v>

2451
02:29:08.181 --> 02:29:11.270
<v Speaker 3>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just sophisticated propaganda,</v>

2452
02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:12.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it.</v>

2453
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:15.740
<v Speaker 3>It taps into literature upon occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2454
02:29:16.460 --> 02:29:19.580
<v Speaker 3>but she knew where she was going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Dusky Dostoevsky,</v>

2455
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:25.000
<v Speaker 3>he discovered it along the way and so he</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes you along on the journey and </v>

2456
02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.530
<v Speaker 3>that's any great artists does that takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>you along in the journey.</v>

2457
02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:32.770
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's so rare vivifying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>encounter anything that's genuinely </v>

2458
02:29:32.770 --> 02:29:36.551
<v Speaker 3>artistic is because you're along for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict between chaos and order and </v>

2459
02:29:37.221 --> 02:29:41.240
<v Speaker 3>that's way more interesting than having </v>
<v Speaker 3>a talk delivered to you.</v>

2460
02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:44.690
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that that journey might </v>
<v Speaker 3>lead to a bad place?</v>

2461
02:29:44.691 --> 02:29:49.691
<v Speaker 3>In some cases you've spoken of Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was speaking to audiences and he</v>

2462
02:29:49.851 --> 02:29:54.851
<v Speaker 3>was listening to the audiences and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he started to find what really </v>

2463
02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:58.810
<v Speaker 3>engaged them and made them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2464
02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:01.000
<v Speaker 3>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying,</v>

2465
02:30:01.250 --> 02:30:03.710
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that you might get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong?</v>

2466
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a terrible threat to get it </v>

2467
02:30:10.750 --> 02:30:13.810
<v Speaker 3>wrong because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in rule three,</v>

2468
02:30:13.970 --> 02:30:16.280
<v Speaker 3>make friends with the people who want </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best for you.</v>

2469
02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:20.090
<v Speaker 3>There are other rules that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with that that I didn't write</v>

2470
02:30:20.091 --> 02:30:23.860
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like make friends with people with own.</v>

2471
02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:25.070
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

2472
02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Be Very careful with who.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be Very careful about who you share good</v>

2473
02:30:29.841 --> 02:30:34.841
<v Speaker 3>news with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one rule and another rule was </v>

2474
02:30:34.841 --> 02:30:38.261
<v Speaker 3>be very careful about whom you share bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>news with and those are sort of </v>

2475
02:30:38.721 --> 02:30:40.820
<v Speaker 3>hallmarks of friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have friends,</v>

2476
02:30:40.821 --> 02:30:45.821
<v Speaker 3>you can tell good news too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what it's like to tell good </v>

2477
02:30:45.821 --> 02:30:45.821
<v Speaker 3>news to someone that you shouldn't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good news too.</v>

2478
02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:49.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're not happy about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>good news.</v>

2479
02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:52.100
<v Speaker 3>There are bitter about it and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll show it in some way.</v>

2480
02:30:52.101 --> 02:30:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they'll trump your good news or </v>
<v Speaker 3>they won't listen,</v>

2481
02:30:54.411 --> 02:30:58.190
<v Speaker 3>or they'll bring up another topic or </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're secretly angry or whatever.</v>

2482
02:30:58.190 --> 02:31:03.190
<v Speaker 3>You walk away from sharing the good news</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking you should have kept your damn </v>

2483
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:05.120
<v Speaker 3>mouth shut and that's not a good sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

2484
02:31:05.180 --> 02:31:10.180
<v Speaker 3>But some people you can tell a good news</v>
<v Speaker 3>too and they'll be happy because they </v>

2485
02:31:10.180 --> 02:31:13.331
<v Speaker 3>have enough sense to know that life's to</v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe and if something good </v>

2486
02:31:13.331 --> 02:31:13.331
<v Speaker 3>happened to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then hooray.</v>

2487
02:31:13.331 --> 02:31:18.161
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because and then bad news is the same </v>

2488
02:31:18.161 --> 02:31:21.611
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you tell news to someone </v>

2489
02:31:21.611 --> 02:31:22.950
<v Speaker 3>they need to let you suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2490
02:31:22.951 --> 02:31:27.951
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't make you feel better </v>
<v Speaker 3>quick because they're upset because </v>

2491
02:31:27.951 --> 02:31:27.951
<v Speaker 3>you're upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of that.</v>

2492
02:31:27.951 --> 02:31:28.980
<v Speaker 3>They just have to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's hard.</v>

2493
02:31:29.490 --> 02:31:34.490
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I forgot what the hell the </v>

2494
02:31:34.490 --> 02:31:38.721
<v Speaker 3>question was here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting tired so I'm losing my </v>

2495
02:31:38.721 --> 02:31:42.531
<v Speaker 3>ability to go back where you may get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong when you're interacting with the </v>

2496
02:31:44.531 --> 02:31:45.480
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2497
02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Look</v>

2498
02:31:50.010 --> 02:31:53.070
<v Speaker 3>what Hitler did was this far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell,</v>

2499
02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:58.480
<v Speaker 3>and I've talked to politicians whose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who've built grassroots political </v>

2500
02:31:58.480 --> 02:32:01.371
<v Speaker 3>parties about how they did it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the audience talks to you when you,</v>

2501
02:32:02.850 --> 02:32:04.470
<v Speaker 3>when you deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

2502
02:32:04.530 --> 02:32:08.170
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you speak publicly and they talk to</v>

2503
02:32:08.470 --> 02:32:13.470
<v Speaker 3>their emotional reactions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you can learn how to say what </v>

2504
02:32:13.470 --> 02:32:18.231
<v Speaker 3>produces a given emotional reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if that's what you want.</v>

2505
02:32:18.571 --> 02:32:19.380
<v Speaker 3>If you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2506
02:32:19.381 --> 02:32:21.240
<v Speaker 3>control over the crowd or maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

2507
02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:24.810
<v Speaker 3>you want to harness the anger of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowd,</v>

2508
02:32:24.811 --> 02:32:26.910
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because your own motivations.</v>

2509
02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:31.860
<v Speaker 3>What were Hitler's motivations?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the psychoanalytic answer.</v>

2510
02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:34.650
<v Speaker 3>If you cannot understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivations,</v>

2511
02:32:34.770 --> 02:32:37.470
<v Speaker 3>look at the consequences and infer the </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation.</v>

2512
02:32:38.490 --> 02:32:43.490
<v Speaker 3>What's the consequence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler blows his brains out in a bunker </v>

2513
02:32:43.490 --> 02:32:44.430
<v Speaker 3>under Berlin when Europe is info on </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>

2514
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:49.050
<v Speaker 3>What was the motivation as suicidal </v>
<v Speaker 3>apocalypse?</v>

2515
02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:51.210
<v Speaker 3>That's the motivation.</v>

2516
02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:54.030
<v Speaker 3>How do you generate a suicidal </v>
<v Speaker 3>apocalypse?</v>

2517
02:32:54.260 --> 02:32:58.170
<v Speaker 3>You aim at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you get the crowd to go along?</v>

2518
02:32:58.620 --> 02:33:03.620
<v Speaker 3>You speak in that manner and you watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the emotional response and when you </v>

2519
02:33:03.620 --> 02:33:06.981
<v Speaker 3>get the anger that you're after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you facilitate it and you let your </v>

2520
02:33:06.981 --> 02:33:11.330
<v Speaker 3>imagination dwell on that and you become</v>
<v Speaker 3>a master of that and that's what Hitler </v>

2521
02:33:11.491 --> 02:33:16.491
<v Speaker 3>did and it wasn't like the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't angry and they had their </v>

2522
02:33:16.491 --> 02:33:18.330
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>World War One was brutal.</v>

2523
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:23.310
<v Speaker 3>They lost the Versailles treaty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a catastrophe in the 19 twenties.</v>

2524
02:33:23.370 --> 02:33:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Every decent hardworking German lost all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their savings in hyperinflation and </v>

2525
02:33:30.511 --> 02:33:33.900
<v Speaker 3>the entire country was threatened by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>radical leftist revolution.</v>

2526
02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:39.740
<v Speaker 3>It was rough and people were not happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and many of them had been terribly </v>

2527
02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:43.851
<v Speaker 3>brutalized by world war one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there was no shortage of anger to </v>

2528
02:33:43.851 --> 02:33:46.530
<v Speaker 3>capitalize on and Hitler was just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy annoyed as he was,</v>

2529
02:33:46.531 --> 02:33:51.531
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was rejected from art school </v>

2530
02:33:51.531 --> 02:33:52.800
<v Speaker 3>three times despite despite having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair bit of artistic talent.</v>

2531
02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:58.230
<v Speaker 3>He had his reasons for resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anger and hatred,</v>

2532
02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:00.840
<v Speaker 3>and that's just a tiny part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2533
02:34:00.841 --> 02:34:03.720
<v Speaker 3>these things can go terribly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends,</v>

2534
02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:05.910
<v Speaker 3>at least in part on what you're aiming </v>
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>

2535
02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:09.300
<v Speaker 3>People ask me what I'm aiming at and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>

2536
02:34:09.850 --> 02:34:10.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>

2537
02:34:10.771 --> 02:34:15.771
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you don't know yourself and I </v>

2538
02:34:15.771 --> 02:34:16.020
<v Speaker 3>don't know myself not to the final </v>
<v Speaker 3>depths,</v>

2539
02:34:16.650 --> 02:34:21.650
<v Speaker 3>but I think what I'm aiming out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping is exactly what I say.</v>

2540
02:34:23.471 --> 02:34:28.471
<v Speaker 3>I'm aiming out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that what I'm aiming at is to </v>

2541
02:34:28.471 --> 02:34:30.040
<v Speaker 3>tell people stories</v>

2542
02:34:32.220 --> 02:34:37.220
<v Speaker 3>and provide them with clinical </v>
<v Speaker 3>intervention in information that's </v>

2543
02:34:37.220 --> 02:34:41.811
<v Speaker 3>derived from the best literature and </v>
<v Speaker 3>science that I know so that they can be </v>

2544
02:34:42.241 --> 02:34:47.241
<v Speaker 3>fortified in their ability to contend </v>
<v Speaker 3>with tragedy and malevolence and the </v>

2545
02:34:47.311 --> 02:34:52.311
<v Speaker 3>reason that I'm doing that as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned is because when I wrote my </v>

2546
02:34:52.311 --> 02:34:52.890
<v Speaker 3>first book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was maps of meaning,</v>

2547
02:34:53.430 --> 02:34:55.650
<v Speaker 3>the audio version of which is out next </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

2548
02:34:55.651 --> 02:35:00.651
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'll be easier to understand </v>

2549
02:35:00.651 --> 02:35:01.920
<v Speaker 3>because it's red and the intonation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>all there.</v>

2550
02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:07.670
<v Speaker 3>I concluded after studying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological dynamics of the Cold War,</v>

2551
02:35:09.210 --> 02:35:14.210
<v Speaker 3>that the only proper medication to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical collectivism was the </v>

2552
02:35:16.711 --> 02:35:19.920
<v Speaker 3>sovereignty of the individual and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a consequence,</v>

2553
02:35:19.950 --> 02:35:22.560
<v Speaker 3>the sovereign individual needed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>strengthened.</v>

2554
02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:26.850
<v Speaker 3>That that was the path forward was least</v>
<v Speaker 3>harm and most potential.</v>

2555
02:35:26.851 --> 02:35:31.851
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what I'm doing my </v>

2556
02:35:31.851 --> 02:35:34.050
<v Speaker 3>evidence for that is that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it for 30 years.</v>

2557
02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:38.640
<v Speaker 3>I taught courses based on that at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard and at the University of Toronto</v>

2558
02:35:38.910 --> 02:35:42.960
<v Speaker 3>consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lectures were made into a television</v>

2559
02:35:42.961 --> 02:35:47.961
<v Speaker 3>program in Toronto that was popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lectures became explosively popular </v>

2560
02:35:48.451 --> 02:35:51.660
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can see what I'm saying as far</v>

2561
02:35:51.661 --> 02:35:55.140
<v Speaker 3>as I can tell and apart from the hip </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces,</v>

2562
02:35:55.290 --> 02:35:58.800
<v Speaker 3>which are perhaps valid criticisms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I don't believe so,</v>

2563
02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:04.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the overwhelming evidence as far as I </v>

2564
02:36:04.340 --> 02:36:06.000
<v Speaker 3>can tell is that it's having a positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence.</v>

2565
02:36:06.510 --> 02:36:11.510
<v Speaker 3>So when I'm hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have people watching me and </v>

2566
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:14.480
<v Speaker 3>criticizing me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like friends of mine and my family </v>

2567
02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:17.180
<v Speaker 3>trying to make sure that this all works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so hopefully I'm not doing something</v>

2568
02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:21.720
<v Speaker 3>that isn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see.</v>

2569
02:36:22.050 --> 02:36:23.910
<v Speaker 3>But yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2570
02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:30.700
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

2571
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:34.770
<v Speaker 3>The last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last question,</v>

2572
02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:37.950
<v Speaker 3>what did you think of the last star wars</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie?</v>

2573
02:36:42.970 --> 02:36:45.640
<v Speaker 3>I've gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I saw the last star wars</v>

2574
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:48.700
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I saw one of the last.</v>

2575
02:36:48.910 --> 02:36:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I've probably seen three of the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>five star wars movies I would say.</v>

2576
02:36:52.990 --> 02:36:56.350
<v Speaker 3>And I thought they were all the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie as the First Star Wars movie.</v>

2577
02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:58.290
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2578
02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:02.650
<v Speaker 3>so I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they haven't been my cup of tea,</v>

2579
02:37:02.651 --> 02:37:06.100
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having said that,</v>

2580
02:37:06.101 --> 02:37:08.040
<v Speaker 3>it's obvious that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2581
02:37:08.050 --> 02:37:10.420
<v Speaker 3>the superhero movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the star wars movies,</v>

2582
02:37:10.421 --> 02:37:15.421
<v Speaker 3>the star trek movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fantastic success that marvel in </v>

2583
02:37:15.421 --> 02:37:17.500
<v Speaker 3>particular has had their Superhero </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pantheon.</v>

2584
02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Like those are the most expensive </v>
<v Speaker 3>artifacts that people make those movies.</v>

2585
02:37:20.901 --> 02:37:22.420
<v Speaker 3>That's something to really think about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2586
02:37:22.470 --> 02:37:24.640
<v Speaker 3>people put $200,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a movie like that.</v>

2587
02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:26.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not the most expensive thing we </v>
<v Speaker 3>make,</v>

2588
02:37:26.571 --> 02:37:28.670
<v Speaker 3>but it's bloody well up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you.</v>

2589
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:34.030
<v Speaker 3>And it's pretty interesting to realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well that making the special effects </v>

2590
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:37.250
<v Speaker 3>for those movies which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a form of artificial reality,</v>

2591
02:37:37.251 --> 02:37:42.251
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is part of what's driving computational </v>

2592
02:37:42.251 --> 02:37:44.801
<v Speaker 3>sophistication forward because the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>processors are being used most </v>

2593
02:37:44.801 --> 02:37:45.800
<v Speaker 3>intensively to render reality.</v>

2594
02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:51.220
<v Speaker 3>And so whatever's happening in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies is something far more significant</v>

2595
02:37:51.651 --> 02:37:56.651
<v Speaker 3>than you might think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it all speaks to the </v>

2596
02:37:56.651 --> 02:38:01.030
<v Speaker 3>unquenchable power of mythology and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>proclivity to manifest itself in a </v>

2597
02:38:01.551 --> 02:38:03.980
<v Speaker 3>multitude of forms and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2598
02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:09.280
<v Speaker 3>and to be eternally compelling to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so generally that seems to be a </v>

2599
02:38:10.581 --> 02:38:15.581
<v Speaker 3>really good thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean the Harry Potter series I </v>

2600
02:38:15.581 --> 02:38:19.040
<v Speaker 3>think is a better example than the star </v>
<v Speaker 3>wars series because I think that I think</v>

2601
02:38:19.610 --> 02:38:24.350
<v Speaker 3>that the star wars series is a bit too </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciously contrived.</v>

2602
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the Harry Potter series is </v>
<v Speaker 3>genuinely,</v>

2603
02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:33.860
<v Speaker 3>to my way of thinking anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a genuine intuitive production and </v>

2604
02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:37.070
<v Speaker 3>rolling got her mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She so good at that.</v>

2605
02:38:37.071 --> 02:38:39.860
<v Speaker 3>I just can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just absolutely unbelievable.</v>

2606
02:38:40.260 --> 02:38:42.050
<v Speaker 3>And you think of the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2607
02:38:42.051 --> 02:38:47.051
<v Speaker 3>She wrote seven books about wizards like</v>
<v Speaker 3>teenage wizards and child wizards and </v>

2608
02:38:48.171 --> 02:38:53.171
<v Speaker 3>magical castle Trenton by giant snakes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and portrayed the battle between good </v>

2609
02:38:53.271 --> 02:38:56.240
<v Speaker 3>and evil on a landscape of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 3>order and you know,</v>

2610
02:38:56.300 --> 02:38:56.810
<v Speaker 3>sold.</v>

2611
02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:02.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's her empire worth in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of total financial consequences?</v>

2612
02:39:02.411 --> 02:39:05.930
<v Speaker 3>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the tens of billions of dollars.</v>

2613
02:39:05.931 --> 02:39:10.931
<v Speaker 3>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got all these kids to read 600 page </v>

2614
02:39:10.931 --> 02:39:11.090
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They produced all these movies that were</v>

2615
02:39:11.091 --> 02:39:14.810
<v Speaker 3>fantastically expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody read them and went and watched</v>

2616
02:39:14.811 --> 02:39:15.440
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2617
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:20.590
<v Speaker 3>and what do you see there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dying and resurrecting hero </v>

2618
02:39:20.590 --> 02:39:22.460
<v Speaker 3>fights is satanic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure and attains final victory through</v>

2619
02:39:22.461 --> 02:39:24.290
<v Speaker 3>death and resurrection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

2620
02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:27.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't contrived that came out of</v>

2621
02:39:27.501 --> 02:39:32.501
<v Speaker 3>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the mythologies seeps in no </v>

2622
02:39:34.041 --> 02:39:35.280
<v Speaker 3>matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

2623
02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:40.600
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is something I learned from </v>

2624
02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:42.251
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's time for us to understand </v>

2625
02:39:42.251 --> 02:39:44.681
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't just live by it unconsciously </v>

2626
02:39:44.681 --> 02:39:48.641
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to understand that as well as </v>

2627
02:39:48.641 --> 02:39:50.270
<v Speaker 3>living by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the task of the 21st century.</v>

2628
02:39:50.540 --> 02:39:54.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we understand it,</v>

2629
02:39:54.321 --> 02:39:58.430
<v Speaker 3>then maybe we can fortify ourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>against collectivist ideology,</v>

2630
02:39:58.431 --> 02:40:01.730
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping because that's a bad pathway.</v>

2631
02:40:02.390 --> 02:40:07.390
<v Speaker 3>So you were able to turn that question </v>
<v Speaker 3>into very good final words somehow.</v>

2632
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thank you.</v>

2633
02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>

2634
02:40:10.890 --> 02:40:11.660
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
