Speaker 1:          00:00:32       Hello Vancouver. Thank you. Alright, so we have an interesting situation here. Um, obviously this is part two and a few of you were here for what took place last night. We're going to find a way to catch you all up pretty quick on what took place, but before we do that, I thought it might make sense to talk to you about where we are in this discussion and why it matters and it matters not just for those of us on stage, but it matters very much for you all in the audience. The point is basically this, we've arrived at a place in history where the sensemaking apparatus, that usually helps us figure out what to think about. Things has obviously begun to come apart. The political parties, the uh, the university is journalism. All of these things have stopped making sense and alternative sensemaking networks have begun to rise.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       And the one that we ended up being a part of seems to be beating the odds with respect to staying alive and being a vibrant part of the conversation. But that depends on something. It depends on our ability to upgrade. What we can discuss and navigate and Sam and Jordan have run a foul of each other in the past, as you all know, and so our ability to upgrade the conversation such that they're able to find common ground and for us to move forward together is potentially very important. A very important upgrade. Now that upgrade in the modern era includes you all because our conversation and your conversations are all now linked through the Internet. So the ground rules for tonight involve you not filming what takes place on stage tonight. And the reason for that is because what takes place on stage tonight has consequences and the freer that Sam and Jordan feel to use new tools to try out positions that maybe they haven't explored before.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       The more likely we are to succeed. So please don't film, but that does not mean that we don't want you talking about what was discussed here tonight. In fact, we're very excited to see what you all make of this conversation and where it heads so in an effort to get you up to speed on where we got yesterday. And I think the evidence is strong. We all felt and the discussion online suggests that we actually accomplished quite a bit yesterday that we made headway in an effort to attempt to keep that momentum going, but we're going to do is we're going to have sam and Jordon Steele, man each other's points from last night so that you can hear what that sounds like.

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       Now,

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       for those of you who have ever tried steel manning, somebody point with whom you have a severe disagreement, you know just how hard this is, so let's give them some leeway. Sam, would you be willing to start? Sure, sure.

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:03:42       Well, first let me just make the obvious point that that probably isn't so obvious once you take the time to put yourself in our shoes, but just imagine how surreal it is for us to be who we are. Simply having a conversation about ideas and to be able to put a date on the calendar and have all of you show up for this. I mean, it's just an amazing privilege.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       Thank you for coming out.

Speaker 3:          00:04:11       So, so here's what I think, Jordan, things I'm getting wrong. I think that was grammatically correct. Maybe there's another note in there, but clearly I don't understand how valuable stories are, how deep they go, how did the degree to which story is in code, not only the wisdom of our ancestors, but quite possibly the wisdom borne of the hard knocks of evolution of the species. Right, so there's no telling how deep the significance of the information encoded in stories goes and there's a class of stories that are religious stories and their religious for a reason because they're dealing with the deepest questions in human life. They're questions about what constitutes a good life, what's worth living for, what's worth dying for. These are things that if each individual just thrust from onto the stage of his own life not knowing where he is and tasked with figuring out how to live all on his own or even in a collection of of others who are similarly unguided by ancient wisdom, this is not knowledge we can. We can recapitulate for ourselves easily and so we we edit or ignore the these ancient stories at our apparel at some, at minimum, and some considerable risk because we don't know how much we don't really know what baby is in the bath water and so we should have immense respect for these traditions and the,

Speaker 3:          00:06:02       this is well, this has yet to be discovered tonight. I'm still not quite clear about how this links up with, with more metaphysical propositions about the origins of these have certain of these stories, but at minimum my criticism of religion because it tends to focus on the most obvious case of a zero sum contest between religious dogmatism and scientific open ended discussion is doesn't address this core issue of the significance of religious thinking and religious narrative because I am, for the most part just shooting fishing in a barrel, criticizing fundamentalists, uh, and the kind of God that the fundamentalists believe in the God who is an invisible person who hates homosexuals. Obviously that's not the deep, the deepest version of these religious, this or this. This essentially what is a narrative technology for orienting human life. In the cosmos, so maybe I'll leave it there, but that's I think what Jordan thinks.

Speaker 2:          00:07:19       Thanks

Speaker 4:          00:07:22       for use steel man. Sam's point. How did you feel about his encapsulation of yours? Well, I'm convinced.

Speaker 2:          00:07:30       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:07:33       I mean, well, I got a couple of things to say about it. It's like, first of all, I think it was accurate, concise, fair. I also think that this is a more technical note in some senses that if, if you ever want to think about something that's exactly what you have to do, right? You want to take arguments that are against your perspective and you want to make them as strong as you possibly can so that you can fortify your arguments against them. You don't want to make them weak because that just makes you weak. And so, you know, Sam and I are both scientists and it really is the case that what scientists are trying to do. And I think what we're actually trying to do in this conversation genuinely is to try to find out if there's something that we're thinking that's stupid, you know, because when, when I'm laying out the arguments that Sam just summarize so well, I've tried to generate a bunch of opposition to them in my own imagination.

Speaker 4:          00:08:25       And the arguments I put forward are ones I can't undermine. But that doesn't mean they're right. It doesn't mean that at all. And so if someone comes along who is, and this is certainly the case, if you're a scientist who's worth his or her salt, if someone comes along and says, hey look, you made a mistake in this fundamental proposition, it's like, yes, great. That means I can make progress towards a more solid theory of being so. And that's what we're trying to do. And I do think it's working. And so I thought that was just fine. Exactly dead on. And I hope I can do justice to your position as so. Okay. So to summarize Sam's argument briefly and then I'm going to tell him lately that you guys know why he thinks I'm things. At what things I'm not taking into account, so sam believes that there are two fundamental dangers to psychological and social stability, religious fundamentalism essentially on the right and moral relativism and nihilism on the left and so the danger of the right wing position is that it enables people to arbitrarily established certain revealed axioms as indisputable truth and then to tyrannized themselves and other people with the claims that those are divine revelations and he sees that as part of the danger of religious fundamentalism and maybe religious thinking in general, but also as something that characterizes second or totalitarian states that also has a religious aspect.

Speaker 4:          00:09:49       So that's on the right and then on the left. Well the problem with the, with the moral relativism nihilism position is that it leaves us with no orientation and it also flies in the face of common sense observations. That there are ways to live that are bad and that there are ways to live that are good, that people can generally agree on. And that statements about those general agreements about how to live can be considered factual. Now so and then the next part of Sam's argument is that we require a value system that allows us to escape these twin dangers. One stultifies us and the other leaves us hopeless, let's say, and that value system has to be grounded in something real and the only thing that he can see that actually constitutes real in any provable sense and there's a certain amount of historical and conceptual weight behind this claim, is the domain of empirical facts as as they'd be manifested in the sciences and technologies that have made us incredibly powerful and increasingly able to flourish in the world, and so we need to ground our value propositions in something that we've been able to determine, has genuine solidity to so that we can so that we can orient ourselves properly so that we can make moral claims and that we can avoid these two endangers.

Speaker 4:          00:10:59       We can begin with some basic facts that we can identify, as I mentioned very briefly, what constitutes a bad life. Endless pain, suffering, anxiety, tremendous amount of negative emotions, short term lifespan. All the things that no one would choose voluntarily for themselves. If, if we would all agree that they were thinking in a healthy manner and we can contrast that sort of domain of horror with the good life which might involve while certainly freedom from privation and want and undo threat and anxiety and hope for the future and all of that, and that we can agree that those are polls, good, bad and good, and that that's a factual claim, so he, Sam also claims that we can define the good life. This is an extension of it with reference to flourishing and wellbeing and that that that can actually be measured and that we should and can inform the idea of flourishing and wellbeing with empirical data.

Speaker 4:          00:11:51       Having said all that, he also a what would a domain of inquiry open that would be centered on the possibility that some of the ideas that have been encapsulated in religious phenomenology, if not in religious dogma, it might be worth pursuing as well. That there might be wisdom that can practically be applied in terms of perception too, to spiritual practices. Although those become dangerous, dangerous, increasingly dangerous as they become ensconced in dogma. And so that's Sam's position, and then his criticism of my ideas I'm take, he would say that it's facts, not stories that constitute the ground for the proper science of wellbeing and that we don't need to be connected to stories, ancient stories in particular to thrive and the reason for that or that these ancient stories are pathological in certain details, especially in this specific claims they make up, which, which looks outrageous in some sense from a modern moral perspective.

Speaker 4:          00:12:52       And he believes that it's hand waving to ignore those specific topics. And with, uh, with uh, what would you call it, an optimistic overview of the entire context that they're dangerously outdated now, if they ever were useful, that they're subject to too many potential interpretations for any modern usage to be reliably derived. And so he believes that attempts to interpret these stories, let's say, are rife with so many potential errors of bias and interpretation and subjectivity that all the interpretations in some sense are unreliable and perhaps equally unreliable that their day is that worse than that. Not only are they unreliable, but they're dangerous in so far as the claims they lay out our pose, a threat to scientific and enlightenment values, which are the true saviors of humanity as evidenced by our progress, let's say over the last two or 300 years, and that they're also susceptible to the totalitarian interpretation, which I described earlier, which confer upon the interpreter a sense of and then a claim to reveal truth. And so I would say that Sam's argument and his and his criticisms of my position, so.

Speaker 2:          00:14:07       Okay, so you write my next book. All right, thanks Sam.

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       Feel about that characterization of your position.

Speaker 3:          00:14:20       Uh, certainly close enough to get the conversation started. I met. There's a few the grounding stuff we have yet to talk about and I'm not as, I'm not as much a stickler for materialistic scientific empiricism as I heard implied there, but we can, can,

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       we can come to that. Okay. So hold on. I think from the point of view of the audience, this is a, this is a good barometer of where we got to last night and I think actually the gains are really impressive, which I have to say is me because there's something called regression to the mean. Now if I catch either one of you regressing to the mean tonight, I will hunt you down and I will ridicule you on twitter tomorrow so you have a warrant. Okay. Right. So do either one of you wants to now talk about what was missing from the other characterization or how do you want to move? I think we should

Speaker 3:          00:15:14       touch this issue of, of metaphorical truth because I think it still gets at the distance between us. Sure. As a. and it's happily this is you're afraid that you have. You might want to do

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       prop up this phrase, why not? So the idea of metaphorical truth, which I think actually is the reconciliation between at least the points that you guys each started out with, is the idea that there are concepts which are literally false, that we can falsify in a scientific rational sense, but that if you behave as if they were true, you come out ahead of where you were if you behave according to the fact that they are false. And so to call these things simply false is an error in effect. The universe has left them true in some sense other than a purely literal one. And so religions with them according to actually what you heard from both Sam and Jordan, religions would fall into this class of things. These are encapsulations of, uh, stories and prescriptions that if you follow them, irrespective of whether they literally describe the universe, you end up with certain advantages that you may not know why they are there. But nonetheless, you are ahead of your, uh, your, your head of your position if you were to navigate just simply on your, your perceptions. That's the concept.

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       Yeah. So I think there's a good analogy that you and I stumbled onto after we did a podcast together. You had a, an analogy about a porcupine that could shoot its quills, which many people balked at, but listener and gave us a better one, which was the idea that anyone who's worked with guns at all must've heard this admonishment to treat every gun as if it is loaded. Right? And you actually last night when I alleged that you believed in God, you corrected me. He said, no, you live as if God exists. Right? And so this seems like a, there's a connection here. So if, if, if I had a gun here that I wanted to show Brett, if I know anything about guns, I'm going to make damn sure that is unloaded, right? I'm going to pull back the slide. I'm gonna, drop the magazine, pulled back the slide, check the chamber and do this in a redundant fashion that that really looks like I'm suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder.

Speaker 3:          00:17:39       Maybe if it is truly redundant and then I'll hand it to Brad and Brett knows anything about guns. He will do the same thing, having just seen me do it and if he hands it back to me again, I will do the same thing even though there, there may be no ammunition around. Right? So it really is crazy at the level of our explicit knowledge of the situation and yet absolutely necessary to do. And it's, it's not merely, it's, it runs very deep. I mean, I would even add to that whole time, you were careful not to point the barrel of the gun at anything you would be afraid to shoot. And when people fail to live this way around guns, they with some frequency actually shoot themselves or people close to them by accident. Uh, so it is really the only proper hedge against just the, the, the odds of being in proximity to, to loaded weapons.

Speaker 3:          00:18:35       And yet if someone in the middle of this operation came up to us and said, you know, actually there's a casino that just opened across the street that will take your bets about whether or not guns are loaded. Would you like to bet a million dollars as to whether or not this gun is loaded? Well, of course I would bet those million dollars every time that it's not loaded because I know it's not loaded. So there's. There's a, there's a literal truth and a metaphorical truth where you know otherwise known as a very useful fiction, which in this case is actually more useful than the truth. Right? But the only way I can understand its utility is, and, and even utter the phrase metaphorical truth in a way that is comprehensible is in the context of distinguishing it from literal truth. And

Speaker 5:          00:19:25       Go ahead. This is fascinating Sam. Actually this is, this is I think next year.

Speaker 3:          00:19:30       I'm a little worried by how excited you are.

Speaker 5:          00:19:34       So I have a story that might be helpful about that. And so you could, you could tell me what you think about. Okay. Think about this. Okay. So, so one of the things that I've been reconsidering since we talked last night is, is the nature of our dispute about the relationship between facts and values. Because I think I can make a case that what I've been trying to do, especially in my first book, was to ground values in fact, but I'm not doing it the same way that you are. Exactly. So. So I, I don't want to make that a point of contention so. And I'll get to that moment. But with regards to this metaphorical truth, let me tell you something. You tell me what you think about this. So one of them, things that's been observed by anthropologists worldwide is that human beings tend to make sacrifices. So I'm going to spend two minutes, three minutes laying out a sacrificial story. And the reason I want to do it is because see what I think happened with regards to the origin of these profound stories is that people first started to behave in certain ways that had a survival significance. And that was selected for. And as a consequence of, of, of, of, of this standard

Speaker 4:          00:20:47       selection practices. And so that was instantiated, didn't behavior. And then because we can observe ourselves because we're self conscious creatures, that we started to make representations of those patterns and dramatize them. And then encapsulate them in stories, so it's a bottom up from the. So it would be sort of like chimpanzees or wolves become aware of their dominance hierarchy structures and the strategies that they use. So a wolf, for example, if two wolves are having a dominance dispute, one the wolf that gives up first lays down and puts his neck open so the other wolf can tear it out. And then the other wolf doesn't. And you could say, well, it's as if a wolf is following a rule about not killing a weaker member of the pack. Of course wolves don't have rules, they have behavioral patterns, but a self conscious wolf would watch what the wolves were doing and then say, well, it's as if we're acting out the idea that each wolf in the pack has intrinsic value.

Speaker 4:          00:21:42       And then that starts to be maybe that wolves would have a little story about the heroic for bearing wolf that doesn't tear out the neck of its opponents and that that's good. Well, that's good wolf ethics and, and, and so, but it's grounded, but it's grounded in the actual behavior. Okay. So let's, we'll put that aside for a second. Now here, here's the sacrificial story to human beings have made sacrifices. It seems to be a standard practice all around the world and in the biblical narratives, they would often sacrifice something of value like a, like a valuable animal or like a child start. Well, no, no, no. Look, look, I'm not. I'm not making light of this. I know that human sacrifice was a part of this.

Speaker 3:          00:22:19       Yeah, but that again, so just to give you a crib on where my mind goes, there is human. Human sacrifice is as old a religious precept as we know about as a cultural universal. The other sacrifices are derivations from Ed and circumcision is a surrogate for the far more barbaric act of human sacrifice and you know it, it answers every test you would put to it with respect to its archetypal significance and it's, it's compelling a presence in stories across all cultures, but the horror is that it actually has taken place in all these cultures based on explicit beliefs in the presence of just just right Arthur scientific ignorance.

Speaker 4:          00:23:08       Flirt used that as the argument for the essential insanity of humanity.

Speaker 3:          00:23:12       We have nobody. It's not just the insanity of humanity, it's the misapprehension of the causal structure of the cosmos. You don't know what the weather. You don't know why people get sick. You think your neighbor is capable of cast a magic spell. It's on you. You're ignorant of everything and you're trying to force some order on things, and so when you don't in the absence of engineers and you don't know why bill certain buildings fall down, you actually can agree with your neighbor that maybe you should barrier first born child into every post hole of this new building, which in fact has took place and it's the consequence of ignorance and so that the problem is if you're only going to talk about this notion of sacrifice, very strange consequence of ignorance like you. It's the notion that we're in relationship to invisible others that can, that can mistreat us based on not having offered enough were we are. We're not precisely those others well, but we're in relationship to the invisible others who will judge us in the future. So again, you're changing, you're changing the noun in important way, but I'm also trying to understand, I'm not trying to argue against the horror of child sacrifice. No, I would never imagine, but I'm also. But I'm also find out what my work would be much easier if you did that.

Speaker 5:          00:24:31       Yes, yes, yes. And, and the work of journalists as well, they've tried that. Pretty much anyone,

Speaker 5:          00:24:42       right? That would be, that would even be worse than enforced monogamy. Hypothetical. So, okay. So see, I'm, let's say that I'm trying to give the devil his due and I'm trying to understand from an evolutionary perspective, like cognitive behavioral evolutionary perspective, let's say why that particular set of ideas would emerge and in many, many, many places perhaps autonomously or once having emerged would spread like wildfire. It's like, because I'm not willing to only attribute it to ignorance, now we can attribute it to ignorance. No problem man, but, but there's more going on there because it is a human universal and like there's all sorts of things that happened in nature as a consequence of biological and evolutionary processes that don't work out well for our current state of moral intuition, like saying, okay, so one of the things, because I've been thinking about this sacrificial motif for a very long time, trying to figure out what that, what, what the hell's the idea here?

Speaker 5:          00:25:35       Exactly. And so, so here's, here's one way of thinking about it. If you give up something of value, now you can gain something of more value in the future. Okay? So let's think about that idea for a minute. So the first thing is that's an, that's a hell of an idea. That's delayed, delayed, delayed gratification, right? That's the discovery of the future as well. And so you might say, well, the notion of sacrifice is exactly the same thing as the discovery of the future. If we give up something we really value, now we can make a pact with the structure of existence itself such that better things will happen to us in the future. Now, okay, now what's weird about this, and it's hard to understand is that it works. So when I talked to my students, for example, and I say, what did your parents sacrifice to send you to university?

Speaker 5:          00:26:27       Many of them are children are first generation immigrants and so like, man, they're on that story in a second, right? They know all sorts of things that their parents sacrificed and they're delaying gratification in the present for a radically delayed return in the future. Now you think animals, generally speaking, they might act out the idea of delayed gratification as a consequence of running out their instincts, but they don't conceptualize it. It's not obvious that animals give up something they valued right now in order to thrive in the future. There's an old story about how to catch a monkey, right? So you put a jar up with rocks in it. Then you put little candies and it's a narrow neck jar. You put little candies on top of the rocks, but if you candies in front of the of the jar, then the monkey comes along and picks up the candies, puts his hand in the jar, grabs the candies, and can't get it out.

Speaker 5:          00:27:14       I still don't know if this actually works on monkeys or it's just a great story. I don't know. I don't know either and that I've heard. I've heard, I've heard various claims, but. But the point is you can go pick up the monkey. He won't let go of the candidates. Now perhaps he would, but the. The, the issue is, is that it's not obvious that animals will forgo and immediate gratification for a future gratification. Now that don't think. I don't think that's right actually, and I actually want to hold the question is, will they do it consciously? They might act it out. They act it out. That's not the issue. It's very hard to know if it's conscious because they won't respond to the questionnaires, but I know, I know obviously the, the line between acting it out and becoming, starting to consciously represented is a tenuous one.

Speaker 5:          00:27:55       But what looks to me like what happened is that after we observed that people who were capable of delaying gratification, sacrifice things that they valued in order to obtain a future goal, and it work, that we started to codify that as a representation and then started to act it out. And so, so the story and, and you'd say, well that produced strange variance, but, but there's a reason for that too, as far as I can say. So imagine this, imagine that there's a rule of thumb sacrificing what you find valuable now will ensure certain benefits in the future. Well then the question becomes how good could those future benefits be? And so that might be heavenly, let's say in the archetypal extreme and what's the ultimate sacrifice that you have to perform? And then I would say, well, the child sacrifice fits into that category.

Speaker 5:          00:28:48       And so it's, it's as if those ideas were pushed to the radical extreme. And you could say, well that's a pathological extreme. It's like, well it is, it is a pathological extreme. But, but I think we also have to understand that some of the things that we've learned as we've evolved towards our current state of wisdom such as it is, is that they were learned in a very bloody and catastrophic way. They were learning with incredible difficulty and delay of gratification was certainly one of those because it's a hell of a thing to learn when you're in conditions of privation. Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:29:21       Yeah. I think that the issue here for me is that you don't need a conception of. You don't need any kind of positive gloss on human sacrifice as a meme or as an archetype in order to form a coherent picture of the future that can motivate you. So delayed, delayed gratification is fully separable from a notion that it might ever be rational or good to sacrifice a child as an offering to an invisible other

Speaker 5:          00:29:55       that doesn't exist. How do you know it's separate will? Because that's the developmental history, as you said.

Speaker 3:          00:30:00       Well, that so sacrifice, and I think it is in fact historically separable, but let. Let's just say it's not. Let's just say as a matter of our origins, they're united, they're of a piece, it's just, it is the genetic fallacy to care about that origin. I mean to say that the that is the only path forward toward an ocean of the future, given where we've come from or that it's somehow necessary to to venerate now or that it's.

Speaker 5:          00:30:32       But we do venerate the idea of sacrifice now, but I would say

Speaker 3:          00:30:36       we do a to to the detriment of our moral intuitions in the religious context. So for instance, I think that the notion that Christianity, Christianity is actually a cult of human sacrifice. It Christianity is not a religion that repudiates human sacrifice. Christianity is a religion that says, actually no human sacrifice is necessary and there was only one that in fact was necessary and effective and that's the sacrifice of Jesus. And I think that is when you dig into the details, a not only a morally uninteresting vision of our circumstance and how we are, how we can be redeemed, it's morally a parent, right? So I think there's a better version.

Speaker 5:          00:31:19       Okay. Let me ask you a question about that. So in, in, in, in the moral landscape, you lay out this pathway, there's the bad life and there's the good life, right? And you described what they were at. The bad life is a variation of hellish circumstances. In the good life is a variant of hypothetically the life that we would like to lead. And your conception is that, and correct me if I'm wrong, your conception is that the proper pathway forward. So that would be the moral endeavor is to move away from the bad and towards the good.

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       Yeah. And so far as we understand which way is up, yes, yes, yes. The basic claim is that we can be right or wrong with respect to, to release.

Speaker 5:          00:31:59       We don't necessarily know how to do that in an uncaring manner and we could subject that to approximation correction along the way and we should. But we can outline the broad scheme which is progressive way from hell towards something that's positive. Yes. Yes. Okay. So I would say that there is an implicit claim in that, that you should sacrifice everything in you that isn't serving that to that. And I would say that that's essentially the same claim that's made in Christianity.

Speaker 3:          00:32:29       Well, again, that is a, I understand the impulse to up level these ignorance derived beliefs, right? To something that is morally that is interesting and palatable in the current context. And I understand you can do that. My concern there is you can do that with everything. I mean you could do it with witchcraft. Why not do the exact same thing you're doing with religion to the history of witchcraft. Witchcraft is as, as, as well, Margaret Lynch's would do that. So that's a perfectly valid yet. But so it's. But it's a. That should be of concern me that there are reasons why we don't want to endorse them. Modern witchcraft, right? Absolutely. And so, so you know, when you're talking to and monitor witchcraft currently exists. I mean, you go to Africa, they're there. People are hunting albinos for their body parts because they believe in sympathetic magic kit and kids get killed as witches. So this belief endures in certain pockets of humanity. And we're right to it. I just think at a certain point you have to acknowledge that some ideas are not only wrong, but they're, their effects are disastrous or have been disastrous or will likely be even if good in certain circumstances will likely be disastrous in the future. And then we shouldn't be hostage to these, these ancient memes. We shouldn't have to figure out how to make the most of the worst idea that anyone's ever had, which is you should make,

Speaker 6:          00:34:00       you should sacrifice your first born child to

Speaker 3:          00:34:05       and you've never seen.

Speaker 1:          00:34:06       Hold on Sam. I want to hold your feet to the fire here. Okay. Two points. One interesting observation. When you presented the example, so on your podcast, I had argued that, uh, believing that porcupines can throw their quills might protect you from a porcupine. That might we'll around even though porcupines can't throw their quills, your listener sent the better example, which was all guns are loaded. When you presented it, you didn't say all guns are loaded. Well, you said treat all guns as if they are loaded, which is I think, the same or reflects that you have faced with any metaphorical truth, which is that it can always be unpacked,

Speaker 3:          00:34:47       but it's actually. That's the way Jordan talks about believing in God as well.

Speaker 1:          00:34:50       Right, and actually so, so this is. But then if we take something like a you, so you say, right, sacrifice of children is abhorrent, let's say it is, and then you say, well, Christianity hasn't a foregone the sacrifice of children. In fact it's described one child who is sacrificed for everybody else, but arguably that's an upgrade of some metaphorical truth that freeze those who are adhering to this tradition from ever considering sacrificing your child and what it does is it provides a motivational structure that may in fact have very positive outgrowths though not literal. The idea that someone would have sacrificed their own child for the benefit of everybody else, not to have to. That idea might engender a large amount of good work that would result as Jordan.

Speaker 3:          00:35:48       Let me just concede that the hardest case for me, I met with, which I did up top just in defining when after you define metaphorical truth and I use the gun example, there's certainly cases where the useful fiction is more useful than the truth. I would grant that, but I think those cases are few and far between, but handling guns is one of them. It's just not useful when the. When the casino opens across the street and you can play some million dollar bet, right? Then you want, you want to have some purchase on the literal truth so you want to be able to. And again this is psychologically interesting because, and I keep coming, coming back to the gun example because the one that that is viscerally real to me, like if I have a real gun that I know to be unloaded, I still emotionally can't treat it as a harmless object.

Speaker 3:          00:36:40       I can't pointed at my child just for the fun of it because you know that we're going to play cops and robbers and now with a real gun, right? This, this. I have A. I have a superstitious attachment to always being safe with a gun, right, edit, and it's important. It's important that that gets ingrained and yet it is not strictly raw if it's not irrational because it has good effects, but it's not actually in register with what I know to be true factually in each moment. Right? So very low cost, very low cost, very low cost. It's not divided societies and causing people to go to war

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       and if you were going to teach a child gun safety, you would want to encode this so that they would automatically know never to behave as if a gun is unloaded because that's what gets you into trouble as an adult. Every, every gun owner recognizes the distinction between the metaphorical truth in the literal truth here, but I guess what I suspect is going on here is that your mechanism for dealing with the world involves unpacking all of these things and I think it's highly productive, but it also means that you have a hard time understanding why anybody would do anything different. And that's the question is just because we can track fully the difference between guns. Actually all being loaded and behaving as if all guns are loaded, right? That one, there's no leftover, there's nothing, there's no mystery there, right? But there may be many of these things for which there is some difficulty lining up the metaphorical truth with the literal truth and operating according to the metaphorical truth might have advantages, which I think is what your getting at so well. So here's, here's another situation, because you know, we have to remember what kind of catastrophic past we emerged from.

Speaker 3:          00:38:30       How much privation ruled the world prior to 18, 95 essentially, and certainly

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       the farther back you go, the more bloody and horrible it was. I mean, how often do you think it was necessary, and this is not obviously something I'm in favor of and this is also one of these situations where we get to play with ideas that we might not otherwise play with. How often do you think it was necessary for people in the past who had absolutely no access to birth control and who didn't have enough food to sacrifice a child for the survival of their family mean God only knows and that's it? Well, but that's worth thinking about. It's like, you know, life is unbelievably cruel and difficult and one of the problems that comes when you discover the future is that you might have to make the most painful of sacrifices and lots of lots of archaic people do this sort of thing.

Speaker 5:          00:39:20       They do that with their elderly people. They do that with sick people. They do that with infants that they deemed too fragile to survive like so part of child sacrifice, and I know the literature on child sacrifice reasonably well. Part of child sacrifice seemed to emerge out of the observable necessity to leave someone behind so that everyone else didn't die and we don't know how often that had to happen in the past. It might've had to happen a lot. Right now, obviously just just in the interest of kind of conceptual clarity here, human sacrifice is a larger horror than that, so you have. It was very common is the sacrificing of other captives. They didn't take the Aztec sacrifices where you, you now have slaves, some of whom you're going to have. The aztecs sacrificed about 25,000 people a year. Yeah, look, I mean it's clearly a bloody mess.

Speaker 5:          00:40:10       There's no doubt about that, but you know, one of the things that you see happening in the biblical narrative, which is extraordinarily interesting is that you see echoes of child sacrifice at the beginning, but what happens is the sacrificial notion gets increasingly psychologized as the story progresses. So you know, you see that transition with Abraham and Isaac were the were the sec or the child sacrifice is actually forbidden, although previously demanded by God and then you also see it as you already laid out in the substitution of the circumcision for the idea of sacrifice itself and then what seems to happen. See, I'm trying to figure out how these ideas developed site psychologically from their behavioral underpinnings is that eventually it becomes psychologized completely so you can say, well, we can. We can conceptualize a sacrifice in the abstract so my parents can sacrifice to send me to university without anything or anyone having to die.

Speaker 5:          00:41:00       It transforms itself from something that's enacted out as a dramatic ritual into something that's a psychological reality, but all that blood and catastrophe along the way as part of the process by which the idea comes to emerge. So what is the connection of all of this because so there there is this history and I would argue we are busily trying to outgrow much of it, if not most of it, and whether its evolutionary history or just trying to transmute it so that it becomes. We can, we can maintain as you suggested, we do. We can maintain what's useful in the tradition and throw out everything that's pathologic.

Speaker 3:          00:41:37       Yes, but we're constantly discovering a lack of fit between both our, what we perceive ourselves as biological imperatives and the cultural legacies of just what Mommy and daddy taught me was true, right, which we have now. Every reason to believe might not be true and we're trying to optimize our thoughts and institutions and and relationships with one another for our current circumstance, and yet we have this legacy effect of certain books and certain ways of speaking have a completely different status and they have the status because they may in fact it's imagined not be the products of merely previous human minds, but they may be the products of omniscience and that this is where the respect accorded to religious tradition is totally unlike the respect we would accord to anything else. Mythology, literature, past science, past philosophy. I mean people can read Plato and aristotle for their entire lives without ever, without ever being fully captured by the kind of dogmatism that, that every religion demands that you be captured. If you're really going to be an adherence.

Speaker 5:          00:42:58       I say that's actually an archetypal truth. You know the idea that the pathological tradition stands in the way of update. That's an archetypal truth. I mean, one of the reasons why in creation myths, one of the variants of a creation myth is that the hero has to slay a tyrannical giant in order to make it make the world out of his pieces and it's a metaphorical restatement of the idea that tradition can become hidebound and when it becomes hidebound and too rigid that it interferes with current adaptation. But the problem is, and this is, I think this is something we really need to hash out. The problem is the problem that you're describing is the problem of a priori structure. Now, some of that's textual, but some of it isn't textual. Some of it resides in us as our psyche in so far say

Speaker 3:          00:43:41       no problem. I'm I'm describing here is that we have two categories of, of books in this case, right? We have those written by people like ourselves just endlessly open for criticism and and conjecture and those written by invisible omniscient.

Speaker 5:          00:44:00       But I would presume that if these religious systems weren't codafide in books, if they were still just enacted or dramatized, you'd have the same objection. It's not the fact that they're in books that's relevant, but it is the dogmatism is the fact that we can't. We can't jettison bad part. Okay. It's the dogmatism. Okay. So to me that's the same as the problem of structure. Now here, here's the. Here's the problem. I think with the way that your argument is laid out, and I'm not saying it's wrong, it seems to me that this is a place where it needs to be developed because I see that the attempt that you make to derive the value from the world of facts as as justifiable given what it is that you're attempting to do, which in principle is to make the world a better place. But there's a massive gap in there. It's like how do you do it? Because the objection that you place on my, my reasoning, let's say, which is. Well, the problem with these texts is that there's an infinite number of interpretations and which of them can you. How can you determine which of those is canonically correct is exactly and precisely the same criticism that can be levied against your attempt to extract the world of value from the domain of facts. It's the same.

Speaker 3:          00:45:03       It's not an infinite number of interpretations in either case, but I allow for enough to infinite. So that might be. I mean that's why the moral landscape for me is a landscape of peaks and valleys and so, you know, I am totally open to the possibility in fact certainty that there are different ways for similar minds and certainly different ways for different minds to be constellated so that they have equivalent but irreconcilable peaks on the landscape. So you, there's, there's a lot of wellbeing over here and there's a lot of wellbeing over here and there's a valley in between. And so it's, it's a kind of moral relativism. It's kind of like, you know, this is, this is great and this is great, but these are irreconcilable.

Speaker 5:          00:45:46       Well, I'd like to see that made more concrete and I need to know how that fits in with your conception because one of the claims that you make in the moral landscape is that the distinction between the bad life and the good life is normally it's like it's a factual distinction. Yes, it's universally, universally apprehensible and true. It's your. I think it's your fundamental axiomatic claim and I don't see how that's commensurate with the position that you just put forward.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       Was it? So here's the position and you can forget about morality as a concept for this man. I think the starting point is deeper than morality. The starting point, and this is all, this is our starting point, all of us right now in the universe, the starting point is we are conscious, right? We have a, we have a circumstance that admits of qualitative experience, and again, this is true. Whatever, however we understand consciousness, whatever is actually happening, they could be living in a simulation. This could be a dream. You could be a brain in a Vat. A consciousness could just be the product of neurochemistry or we could have eternal souls running on on, so how he is somehow integrated with the brain. Whatever is true, something seems to be happening and the Siemens can be really, really bad or really, really good. We know each one of us in our lives have experienced this range of possibility and yes, there are caveats here and there are hard and painful experiences that have a silver lining, right?

Speaker 3:          00:47:18       That give you some other capacity where you can say, well, you know, that really sucked, but I'm a better person for it. Right? And we can understand what it means to be a better person for it. In terms, again, of this range of experience, which I, you know, I'm calling subsuming all of this, the positive end of this as well being, which is to say that you now I'm a better person for it because now, you know, having endured that ordeal, I am capable of much greater compassion where I appreciate my life more. You know, the cancer made me a better person. Now that I've, I'm cured. I value each moment of life more than I ever did. All of these claims are intelligible within a context of an open ended context of exploring this space of possible experience. So what I'm saying is forget about morality.

Speaker 3:          00:48:03       Forget about right and wrong and good and evil. What is undeniable is that what we have here is a navigation problem. We have a, a space of possible experience. And again, this is not just a human problem. This is a problem for any possible conscious mind. We have a space of possible experience in which we can navigate and we and things can get excruciating and pointlessly horrible where there are no silver linings. And we get this. This can happen individually in some episode of madness that never ends. If there really is a Christian hell to go to, well then it can. It's going to happen to me after I die, right? Given what I've said on the stage, uh, if, uh, so it matters who's right. Obviously, if I knew that a, uh, an eternity of fiery torment awaited somebody who didn't make the right noises about one or one faith or another will, then it would only be rational to make those right noises, right?

Speaker 3:          00:49:02       So it's, it's my bet. I'm placing a bet on certain pictures of reality being wrong. But the reality is, is we're navigating in this space and morality and ethics are the terms we use for how we think about our behavior affecting one another is experienced. So if you're in a moral solitude, if you're on a desert island or if you're alone in the universe, morality is not the issue you need to worry about. But wellbeing still is an ever present issue. It's possible to suffer and as possible to experience bliss and, and perhaps something beyond that. And we, the horizon in both directions is something we will, we'll never fully exposed, explore, very likely in the way we don't know how good things can get and we don't know how bad they can get, but, but that there's a spectrum here is undeniable. And I, I would say that, that my moral realism simply entails that we acknowledged that it's possible not to know what you're missing is possible to be living in a way where you are less happy than you could be and not to know why. Right? And to not have the wisdom to make the changes and that matters if anything matters that matters and it matters to us individually and it matters to us collectively. And that mattering is our, is that subsumes everything we can intelligibly want in this domain of value. And that's. And so again, it's, it's the, the, the cash value of any value claim is in the, the actual or potential change in consciousness for some conscious system somewhere sometime. And that's, that's my claim. And that's.

Speaker 2:          00:50:44       Can I try to get, would like to clarify something.

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       So it sounds to me, Sam, like you are hypothesizing that a rationalist approach will always beat a traditional metaphorical approach with respect to the generation of wellbeing.

Speaker 3:          00:51:05       Well, not always, but there's so many obvious downsides to the traditional sectarian dogmatic approach that we should want to get out of the religion business as fast as possible.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       Okay. So, okay. But as fast as possible. But do you mean that it has always been true that we should always have gotten away from it as fast as possible or do you mean now we should get away from it as fast as possible, but there is a point somewhere in the past where it might have been true that actually the best, the most, the richest path to wellbeing might have been encoded metaphorically.

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       Oh yeah. That's certainly possible. And in fact you might even say it was likely based on the fact that we have all of these systems still around.

Speaker 5:          00:51:48       We still have the systems around in part because our, like we still, we still think in metaphor and we actually can't help it because half of our brain is oriented towards metaphor. But

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       can I get you to clarify something now? Yes. Okay. So you have argued, and you've actually quite surprised me by doing so. You argued that the dogmatism is a bug and not a feature. You've argued it's a bug and a feature. Okay. It's a bug and a feature. Good. So yes, but what I thought I heard you say was that the resistance to update, yes, was a problem that effectively it was an obstacle yet. So his lack of resistance to update. There's problems everywhere, man. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:52:31       there's a tension. There is a tension. Is tension. Terrible. Look at it this way.

Speaker 5:          00:52:38       Most new ideas are stupid and dangerous, but most some of them are fighter as well. Some of them are vital, right? And so we have. We're screwed both ways. It's like, well, if we stay locked in our current mode of apprehension, all hell's gonna break loose. If we generate a whole bunch of new solutions, most of them are going to be wrong and we're going to die. And so what we need to do is it's a Darwinian claim in some sense, is that despite the fact that most new ideas are stupid and dangerous, a subset of them are so vital that if we don't incorporate them, we're all going to perish. That's the bloody existential condition and so now and part of the issue here and see, I think that this is the problem is, is that let's take the dogma idea. Okay, so there's the dogma incorporated in the books, but I'm gonna throw away the books because the dogma was there before the books and then the question is where it was the dogma and the answer was the dogma was in the cultural practices but and in and in the agreement that people made with regards to those cultural practices, but it was also part and parcel of the Inter psychic structure that enables us to perceive the world as such.

Speaker 5:          00:53:42       Now the problem is, and I think this is the central place where we need to flesh out these ideas, is that you cannot view the world without an a priori structure and that a prior structure has a dogmatic element, and so you can't just say, well, let's get rid of the dog one, because you can't perceive the world

Speaker 3:          00:53:59       structure has an uninspected element. Because if you're talking about just perceiving the world, yes we have. We have perceptual structure that allows for us to perceive the world and we know that there are failures states, right? So we know, we know for instance, that we are, we are, we have evolved to perceive visual space based on a literally neurological expectation that light sources will be from above. Right. And so we know that we can produce visual illusions based on gaming that expectation. Right? But that's not the same thing as a, a dogma we subscribed to by some, some subset of humanity that is antithetical to another dogma subscribed to by another set of humanity that has nothing to do with underlying biology. That's something that is changeable, obvious. Nobody's changeable in real time based on just conversations like this. Like, you know, we could, you know, I get emails from people who can point to these, the paragraph where they lost their faith, right?

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       Where in reading somebody's reading, reading Richard Dawkins or newborn hearing, a debate between between me and some theologian where it's just a was a collision against rationality, which is so useful in every other context suddenly proves its utility in this context where they think, well, okay, clearly I know the Muslims are wrong about the status of the Koran. Let me, let me take that. That that spirit of criticism in the internal space of my own culture and what moves well, a dogmatic attachment to Christianity has to move by that same standard and that's and and it's possible to do that and that's not a matter of getting into the brain and changing your perceptual apparatus. That has.

Speaker 5:          00:55:44       Well the distinction between different levels of what would you call it, structure related processing in the brain and the relationship to the underlying biology isn't clear. Like it isn't clear when that's biological and when is it, when it isn't. So you know, your, your, your comments about our a priori perceptual structures not withstanding, there's no clear line between what constitutes and instantiated accurate biological perception and something that shades more into a cultural. A presupposition, so it's a. it's a gray area. Now here, let me ask you a question. So this is one of the things I've been thinking about. So this is. This is designed to point out difference. I'm not making the claim that the idea that we should ground values in fact is wrong. I'm not going to make that claim, although we think it's way more complicated than we've opened up so far, but I would say is I can relatively easily demonstrate a situation in which you cannot find the value from the fact. Let's say you own an antique, it's valuable and you think I'm going to take this antique apart and I'm going to find out where the value is. Good luck. It's not valuable in that sense where I'll. Wait a sec, wait a sec. So we need to know. So that's right. It's not valuable in that sense because the value of the antique is a social agreement about its position in a hierarchy. It has nothing to do with the material substrate at the end.

Speaker 2:          00:57:07       Yeah, but it's not

Speaker 5:          00:57:11       claim already that you can derive value from fat. It's like, then what are you willing to.

Speaker 3:          00:57:16       These are facts about again, so there are facts about the facts exist in intersubjective space. Right? So if I, if I tell you, well, this glass, this isn't just an ordinary glass. I know it looks just like that one, but this is the glass that Elton John Drank from his last concert here. Right? So what do you want to pay me for it? Right. It could be that, you know, you're just the biggest Elton John Fan ever and it's worth quite a lot to you now. That is, it's a kind of evidence is not value intrinsic to the glass, but it is, it is, it is a. where's the value located? Was, is a measure in the change. This provokes in your experience, right? There's the idea. I mean we value ideas as much as anything else and that's, that's hence the, the mad work done by religion, right? I mean because it's not. These aren't facts on the ground. These are ideas that rural people's lives. People spend their whole life afraid of. Hell,

Speaker 5:          00:58:12       okay. It seems to meet that it's easier in some sense rather than to relate the value of that, and I love the Elton John's class example to use Elvis Presley is here. I will. I will tell you, it's like where in the guitar is the fact that it's Elvis Presley's and guitar, while it's nowhere in the guitar. Well, what is it in? Where is it that, and the answer is it's in the dominance hierarchy values that's been socially constructed around the guitar. It's located at an interpersonal space and that that location, so value is located in interpersonal space and if you want to say, well, that's also a fact. It's like, okay, but

Speaker 3:          00:58:47       we're starting to stretch the beliefs and desires and conscious dates of all the people involved. That's the only place where it exists. That's the only fair enough with the idea of Elvis' guitar can show up.

Speaker 5:          00:58:59       Well, I'm trying to figure out then you see, because what seems to me to be happening at least in part is that we can stretch the the domain of what constitutes of facts so that the domain of fact starts to incorporate the domain of values, but we do that with some doing some damage to the domain of fact. No, no, no, no. Hang on. Don't, don't say, don't just say no, I'll more. This is really complicated because you see, part of what the postmodernists have done is they've pushed away the domain of facts entirely and they say, well, the only thing is is that the only thing that actually exists is that this domain of intersubjective agreement and

Speaker 3:          00:59:36       no. Yeah, you and I are on the same page with respect to postmodern.

Speaker 5:          00:59:39       Right? But, but, but you have to give, but you have to give them. You have to give the devil his due as well. They're pointed out something and what they pointed out is that it's not so easy to localize the structure that attributes to fax their value. It's not a simple thing that we were way. Yes. You would surely agree that if we had Elvis Presley's guitar, that that guitar would have a material impact on people. We could tell them this is Elvis Presley's guitar. Some fraction of them would disbelieve it. Somebody might be able to establish it based on a picture or something like that, and the point is it would have a value that would alter the behavior of people with respect to that object in a material way. Yes, it would alter the behavior of the p values manifest in physical space. Which part of it? The detective. We could figure out what the value of this guitar is based on some intersection.

Speaker 3:          01:00:32       Sure. We can take a behaviorist approach and we could see how much work people were willing to do to contact. We can scan their brains and see what we can do that well. Well, clearly I ran it evolved. Hypothetically. We can do it, but practically we're not so good because the MRI data, generally speaking is junk. Well, the way we can table that, that's controversial statement in Mri circles. It's fair enough. I don't think we need it. We need it, but we go with that. A market will establish the brain. The brain as yet incompletely understood is surely involved in the value of this object. Right? And so if I take, if I tell you that this is, and again we can take it out of intersubjective space because it couldn't you, you could be in a value solitude with respect to any given object, so it could just be, you could have a sentimental attachment to your watch that's worth exactly $25 because that's what you paid for it, but this is the watch that you know, this is your first watch or whatever it is and you wouldn't sell it for any amount of money.

Speaker 3:          01:01:31       That's a measure of your but behavioral measure of how much you value it. And if I told you, oh well, you know, sorry, I brought your watch and lost it. What the cascade of negative effects that I see on your face as correlated with something that's happening in your head and the brain is involved. Right? So that the quality of that picture basically state is devalued.

Speaker 5:          01:01:50       Tell us that there'd be a socio cultural agreement as to the value of whatever this entity is and that would find it's mirroring the brain and that's a noncontroversial stated, Ecos, all socio cultural phenomena that are experienced find a reflection of the brain. The fact that you can say that that's reflected in the brain.

Speaker 3:          01:02:07       Yeah. Continually run into with religion is that there you have a domain of so called sacred values where people who are otherwise rational ceased to be rational actors, so the reason why Israel and the Israelis and the Palestinians can't negotiate as though their problems could be solved by a real estate transaction is because they have irrational and irreconcilable claims upon land and building. Do you think there are any more irrational than the claim that that class is worth something when no one knows that it's like that, but I'm not irrational by your own definition. You just said that that was actually constituted a fact. It's a fact about people, right? So this is okay. Just be a little careful here because it gets confusing. The there are. We can make objective claims about subjective experience, right? It's not as, it's there are, we use this word objective and subjective in, in different ways.

Speaker 3:          01:03:12       We use it in an epistemological ways and ontological ways, and give me just one sec to make sure I'm on the same, uh, by. I can illustrate it by way of example. If I say no, that's just your subjective opinion, right? I'm saying I'm denigrating. I'm saying that this is an expression of your bias. This is this, this is true for you, but it's not true out in the world, right? That's one way I can use the, the subjective objective distinction, and that's an epistomological way. Like you're, you're, you're ruled by bias. You're not thinking straight. You know, I don't have to take your opinion seriously. That's subjective. I'm worried about objective facts, but people get confused. They think that objective facts only means the material world. And what's the, what's really in this glass as a material object. No, we can be much more objective than that.

Speaker 3:          01:03:59       We can, we can make objective claims about the subjective experience of, of people like ourselves. I can, I can, I can make an infinite number of objective claims about the experience of. This is the example I always use, but I just happen to love it. What, what was jfk thinking the moment he got shot right there. That's it. We don't know that we'll never get the data right. So the, the, the truth or falseness of, of what I'm about to say can't be predicated on actually getting access to the data because because he's not around and his brain's not around to scan. Uh, so, but we, you and I both know an infinite number of things he wasn't thinking about. We can make an objective claim about his subjectivity. I know he wasn't thinking, well, I hope Jordan Peterson has Sam Harris' work it out on stage that night and an infinite number of things like that. He was thinking something. He was experiencing something but we don't know what it is that. So I saw what I'm talking about. This domain of value. I'm saying that it exists in the this landscape of actual impossible conscious experience for human beings and any other system like us, they can experience this range of suffering and happen. Well. So partly

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       what I'm trying to do is to actually determine what that structure is.

Speaker 3:          01:05:21       So in our case it's certainly connected to the evolved structure of our brain by everything else.

Speaker 5:          01:05:29       They want to go way deeper into to the idea then it's connected with brain states because it's. Yes, it's definitely connected with brain states. The question is at least in part how and what does that mean? And I think that the neuroscience has progressed far enough so that we can do quite a good job of this. And so what I want to return to one thing, and maybe I'll outline a little bit of this and when you talked about the Israeli Palestinian conflict, you said that that was irrational. And so look, you know, fair enough, people have been locked with their hands around each other's necks there for 3000 years. But there's a problem there and the problem is that people are looking at the landscape from a contextualized perspective, right? It's not just a piece of land, it's their piece of land. It's like your house or your favorite shirt. It's like, what? You say, well, I have a favorite shirt. It's like, well, there's nothing inherent in the shirt that makes it your favorite. No, it's a subjective judgment. It's like, well then is that a fact? Well, yes, it's a fact. It's a fact about subjective judgment. It's okay. While the Israeli claim on the land and the Palestinian claim on the land is a subjective judgment that

Speaker 3:          01:06:32       it's like, so how is it saving it? Because it is the. The true analogy here. The complete analogy is rather like we're about to fight over Elton John's glass and Elton John was never here.

Speaker 2:          01:06:50       Right?

Speaker 3:          01:06:58       Not saying it clearly still matters to us. In our misapprehension of our situation, we still really care. And these are. These are objectively true claims about the level at which we value things and hence the impasse. But it matters if it's counter productively dismissive, like you could say, well, when you look at this specific claim, there's really not.

Speaker 5:          01:07:21       Look you took, you took the contextual interpretation to its absolute extreme. You said, well there's multiple reasons why different people who occupied the same piece of land are going to feel about it in different ways. Sure. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:07:33       And those reasons are amenable to some kind of rational compromise actually studies on this. I mean there's studies done by people who, when you say this rewrap it,

Speaker 5:          01:07:43       you say the word rational in that context, you're using it as a black box that contains the concept proper way of thinking about it. It's like it's not so obvious in most situations what the rational approach is.

Speaker 3:          01:07:54       I always have an obvious one here and that's that whatever the Christians and the Muslims and the Jews think they're getting from their attachment to their dogmatic and irreconcilable and religious worldviews can be gotten just as well by a deeper understanding of the, of our universal and non culturally bound capacity for ethical experience, spiritual experience, community building. And we can. What's that? We can touch that specs without. It's almost like the status quo is, it's almost like your content to live in a world or your at least your content, not to judge too harshly a world where fans of rival soccer teams or baseball teams regularly kill one another over their fandom. Right? Like, oh, like what if that were the status quo? So He's been this way for thousands of years. There must be a reason for it, but I really like sports. I'm not trying to justify the Israeli Palestinian conflict. No, but I'm saying that too quick to judge the sanctity of their, of their differences of opinion. Okay,

Speaker 5:          01:09:00       but wait a minute, Sam, there you made a claim. Your claim was that if the Christians and the Jews and the Muslims would just stop their stupidity and adopt this universal ethic, then everything would be okay. It's like, okay, what's the basis for the universal ethic like that sets.

Speaker 3:          01:09:14       That's the truth isn't. But that's an interesting problem for philosophers and for scientists. That's not actually where the rubber meets the road for people living their lives. Well, I mean, is this analogous to me, the difference between the band? I really care about all of this and I and my job as a, as a philosophy, as a moral philosopher in that case is to make the best case I can for these ideas, but the truth is it is analogous to when when you get into a debate with a Christian fundamentalists in the states, very often this per this person will pretend to care about cosmology as or evolution as though it's the most important thing in the world as though you can't get out of bed in the morning and figure out how to treat your friends and family well unless you figure out what happened before the Big Bang, right? No one really lives their lives that way and yet we have convinced ourselves that this is a sensible way of talking about the conflict between religion and science.

Speaker 1:          01:10:20       I think you have arrived at the core of your conflict right here, and I actually hear you both loud and clear. Your point is that if the people faced with the question where to start with a fresh sheet of paper, look at the Middle East, they could arrive at a compromise that they as individuals might find a put them way ahead and is more profitable than the situation that they are continually finding themselves and that might be the case. On the other hand, the reason that they don't is that historically those who have have been out competed by those who haven't, so the point is the universe and the fact that it refuses to solve that conflict is telling us that there is some reason that people who take that prospect seriously are not actually correct in some at least metaphorical. So in other words, what is it to have a sentimental attachment to some piece of territory somewhere that sounds completely irrational. On the other hand, that sentimental attachment may result in you continuing for 500 or a thousand or 2000 years. Whereas if you surrendered it because it was irrational, you might go extinct. Now, should you care that your lineage is going to go extinct? Maybe, arguably not. On the other hand, it's hard to imagine that what you're saying is so thoroughly grounded that it can justify causing people to alter their perspective on value in such a way that it might actually drive them extinct. It's not clear that that's good.

Speaker 3:          01:11:50       Clearly secularism made. You were talking about the fringe here. We're talking about that when you're talking about this case, the Israeli settlers and the Palestinian terrorists, right? Like that is that is it. We should all breathe a sigh of relief that that doesn't, that, that, that kind of passion, that attachment to land doesn't characterize most of humanity if you're trying to defend your house. So, but, but that's.

Speaker 1:          01:12:20       Can I kind of different topic on Jordan, because I think this is. This is where, this is where the crux of it is. If, if we follow the idea that this is actually some, that the seemingly sentimental and irrational attachment to the piece of land is some sort of Meta rationality, which sounds like your perspective than we are now confronted with the question of, all right, if it is an evolved kind of a rationality that is being manifest in stories that cause people to behave in ways that Sam sees as clearly irrational, then we are stuck with the naturalistic fallacy, which is to say so for those who don't know, the naturalistic fallacy says that just because something is doesn't mean it ought, right? The fact that selection favors something doesn't make it good and the aztecs sacrificed their enemies. It is good for continuing as Technis, but it may not be good in some absolute moral sense.

Speaker 1:          01:13:15       So here's the question for you. You're arguing for an I think an evolutionarily very viable explanation for religious belief and dogma, but aren't you stuck with the downside of it? Where much of what is encoded in that way may actually be abhorrent, morally unconscious? Absolutely. Okay, so what are you doing about it? What do we do about what this is? This is exactly how a sorting algorithm. Yes. What is it? Trying to get to it. Okay. Okay, so this is actually why I asked Sam this question. It wasn't. It wasn't an attack. It's like, okay, so look, people have these belief systems, Christian Muslim, Jew will say for that, and you're saying abandoned analysts, let's say two to and move towards this transcendent rationality. It's like, okay, two problems. It's not so easy to abandon the belief system because you ended up in the morally relativist nihilist pit problem. One doesn't have to tend to and so

Speaker 5:          01:14:13       they don't have to claim that. We would be. We'd have to find out whether that is true. There's a lot of evidence against that. Well, there's plenty of evidence for it too, but it's beside the point to some degree because that isn't. That isn't something that I want to quibble about. The perhaps there are trends. There are transitional paths and sometimes people find a collapse of their faith. Actually freeing. It's certainly the case that many of the people who are are are happy about what you're doing have found exactly that in what you've been saying and more power to you and so I'm not willing to dispute that, but what you said was, okay, here's these belief systems that are ancient and complex and we can step outside of the men. There's this transcendent rationality that we could all aspire to that would solve the problems. It's like, okay,

Speaker 3:          01:14:59       what is it? Well, what is it exactly? It is at a minimum to value all of the variables that conspire to make the one life. We know we have key value. All those variables. Well, no, we were doing it right. We do it every day in how we organize ourselves.

Speaker 5:          01:15:17       Why an a priori framework to the variables to say, to reduce them to a tiny subset that we can manage and it's the nature of that. A priority framework that we haven't been able to have a discussion about. We have an API framework that narrows our perception to almost nothing. It's built into us. It's partly socially constructed. It has a deep neurological substrate and we actually understand how it emerges to a large degree and the thing is is that I don't

Speaker 3:          01:15:41       think that's actually our difference. So this is a priority for framework, operates in many different spaces, which again, we can't necessarily analyze, but it makes it no less true. So if you, if you put your hand on a hot stove, you will immediately feel a good, a very good reason. In fact, in unarguably good reason to remove it. Right? And that's, it doesn't require a moral philosophy to get you there. You don't need a, you don't need to inspect your a priori framework. You just have to feel, Holy Shit, this is the worst thing I've ever felt. Right? And there's so many moments like that in life that we dimly under that we understand that sometimes to rescue your child from a fire. Well, exactly. Then you have, you have some other goal, right? Cause you to brave that, that suffering, right? And, but again, trying to rescue your child from a fire is pretty close to as the hot stove in not needing to be analyzed.

Speaker 3:          01:16:36       Right? The imperative to rescue your it, it becomes harder when you have to rescue someone else's child from a fire and you're and you're worried about orphan in your child who's standing next to you on the sidewalk, right? Then we get into the domain of moral philosophy and then you can say, well, what do what? How much do each of us? Oh, the children of other people, right? How much did I risk my life and risk orphaning my child to rescue your child? That's when things get interesting in a philosophy seminar and that's where people begin to hesitate. People begin to w we we are biased toward protecting, protecting our kin, protecting our friends, and only then do we begin to extend the circle and again and again, moral, but it's not a mystery where we w, W, we want to go here. We want to extend the circle more and more and build institutions and societies that, that, that implement our best selves at our best moments. More and more. It makes it more effortless to be good in the defendant. Take your example seriously here for a sec. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:17:38       Alright, so you are built to be more likely to rescue your own child in someone else's child from a fire we in society, might like for the minimum number of children to die in fires as possible, which gets you to sideline that consideration in favor of is there a child, uh, who, who's faced with a fire, who I'm, who I might rescue religions, do exactly this restructuring of values because they say something like, actually your goodness in risking your own life to save that other child from a fire is observed and it is, it is calculated and you will be rewarded for it in some way.

Speaker 3:          01:18:17       That's, that's one possible benefit of some religions. Right? Good. And okay, so he put that on the balance. But I have a lot to put on the other side of the boundary. Do I know you list? I want to, I, which that's what I'm trying to point out to Jordan here, which he actually

Speaker 1:          01:18:35       knowledges, which is that he's got a big stack of good things that come from this heuristic, but

Speaker 3:          01:18:42       he's also acknowledging, get this. This is our core of disagreement here, which is however you want to, however the balance is going to swing. The difference between us here is that I think we read the utility of real, of, of anything, but in this case, religious thinking as evidence of you, you read it as evidence of something perhaps is literally true inevitability, and I view that as a kind of version of either genetic or naturalistic fallacy that is just telling you the weather, whether that's it's, it's useful. Now here for us, it doesn't, doesn't argue that it's the best way of getting those good things. I mean, my argument here is that religion gives people bad reasons to be good. We're good reasons are available. So that's a problem, right? Because good real good reasons. Scale better than bad reasons, and I think we can under even if you take the case where religion is clearly useful, Leah, in a life saving utterly benign way, uh, in, in virtually all of those cases, I think I can, I can get you there by some other way without the downside or if not, that's just one of those cases where yes, the fiction was more useful than any possible.

Speaker 3:          01:20:04       Distinguish a religious system from an eight perceptual

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       structure.

Speaker 3:          01:20:09       Well, if you can convert to it or away from it in a single conversation, I would say if it doesn't go very deep,

Speaker 5:          01:20:15       well you're, you're only. I would say that for much of that, you're only converting at a very superficial level. Well, no converting at the level of conscious apprehension and most of your cognition is done through unconscious process.

Speaker 3:          01:20:27       It's just a fact about us that most of people's religious attachment is born of having it drummed into them by their parents. Right? If I made it, but the truth, they don't know their parents and their parents' parents and their parents aren't exactly. But if we did the same thing with Batman and Spiderman, they would have the same effect, right? Like if, if you relentlessly told children, right? I mean, I've, I've got two little girls who were dressed up like bankroll right now. They love batgirl. There's nothing. I don't have to do anything to make them more enthusiastic about superheroes apart from just showing them the pictures of superheroes, right? If I told them, in addition to how, look how fun this is to dress up like batgirl. In addition, you're going to burn in hell for eternity. If you lose your emotional attachment to batgirl even for a minute, right? Well then it's going to be bad girl for the rest of their lives, especially if the entire culture is, is doing likewise. And again.

Speaker 5:          01:21:26       Well, as Brett pointed out already, a bad tool is better than no tool at all. And if batgirl is the closest approximation to a divine sacred that you can conjure up at beats the hell out of none at all. And if bad girl didn't partake of certain archetypal structures, no one would give a damn about you

Speaker 3:          01:21:42       after. Okay, I'm going to fight a minute, Batman. I'm going to spare you

Speaker 2:          01:21:45       play a role in the car because accidental, not accidental,

Speaker 5:          01:21:52       that superhero stories have a structure and to say that, well, Batman and Spiderman are obvious fictions and we could use

Speaker 3:          01:22:00       picking the wrong end. You're taking the wrong into this. I'm not. I'm not minimizing the power of stories, right? I'm saying we can understand their power without recourse to believing things we shouldn't believe now and

Speaker 5:          01:22:13       21st century, we still need an answer to the question about what it is that's this transcendent, transcendental rational structure without an an a priori don't want, because I don't see it.

Speaker 3:          01:22:26       Again, we. We touched on this a little bit last night in that I freely admitted that in every domain of human inquiry, no matter how the most hard headed, so mathematics, logic, physics, at some point we have to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps. At some point we make a move that is not self justifying and is not justified by any other move that's more rudimentary, right? That's a statement of faith that callow use of the term faith. Same precise definition of an axiom, my faith, my faith. That two plus two makes four. That's not what? No, it didn't. No. Is My intuition that this is a valid and replicable and generalizeable principle, right?

Speaker 5:          01:23:14       Neither your statement that that's a useful claim is a statement of faith. But neither of those two were statements of faith. No, it was their statements. Tuition.

Speaker 3:          01:23:22       None of those. These are intuitions. These are because and their intuitions that can run a foul of other discoveries and other intuitions as you know. Which.

Speaker 5:          01:23:31       Well, if mathematical facts or intuitions then what are we doing with? Take a tape. So we've arrived. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We have to decide. The super important that we don't lose it. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:23:43       So we, for what 2000 years people have been studying geometry and had a very well worked out set of mathematical intuitions with respect to Euclidean space, you know, flat geometry and then some brilliant guy. You know, Remonde might've been the first said, well they actually, you can curve space. I can bend this triangle and all of a sudden it has more than 180 degrees. Right? That's an intuition that people tuned up pretty quickly, but all of humanity was blind to it for the longest time. Right? These are what I mean by intuition is it's the thing you're using to understand something that you. You are not in a position to analyze. Now that's, but that's not faith of the sort which is. Listen, I know the Bible was dictated by the creator of the universe. I know Jesus was his son. I know he rose from the dead. I know he'll be coming back

Speaker 5:          01:24:40       and a thousand other propositional claim statement. It's a highly valuable. If it's a statement of faith and it's in a value domain, how is it drivable from fact?

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       So we've arrived at the point where we have to decide whether to go to q and a or to continue the discussion. While you all are thinking about that, I would like to level the challenge to each of you and then I will pull the audience and see what they think about q and a. okay? Okay. So Jordan is arguing to you that you cannot ground the values that would undergird the modality of increasing wellbeing in anything factual and you are arguing in response to that.

Speaker 5:          01:25:25       Not Without an intermediary. Let me just argue in a whole lot of sense. Not Without an intermediary struck. What I've heard you argue is something that I, that I agree

Speaker 1:          01:25:33       with, which is that you can ground many things in a nearly, um, objective observation of the universe, but it doesn't say anything about the value part of the equation. And in fact, I think having thought about the question from an evolutionary point of view, that in order to do what you're talking about, to increase wellbeing, you are going to have to accept that. That is going to leave you with an arbitrary grounding. There is no absolute grounding for it. And you're going to have to just simply accept that it's going to you arbitrary that you are in fact going to have to do inconsistent things like decide to honor the love of a mother for her child and dishonor the love of country that causes one population to gas another population. That's inconsistent and then will need to embrace that in kind of inconsistent.

Speaker 3:          01:26:22       I've it. It's just a different. I don't think we even have the grounding problem. I think it's a pseudo problem. I think what you just said, we have to put your stuff in somewhere. We have a navigate. The way it's grounded is the acknowledgement that what we have is ms dot. It's analogous to what people do with the notion of of meaning in life like what's the meaning of life? How do you find meaning in life? What? What's the purpose of life? These are bad questions. These are questions that when you pose them, they seem to demand. They suggest a space in which an answer must be put, but it's. It's just you put an answer. They'll. People should work towards the good. Yes, there's a different. There's a different way of framing it, which is what we have. Here is an opportunity. It's not about.

Speaker 3:          01:27:07       It's not a matter of meaning. It's not a matter of purpose and it's not a matter of grounding. It's a matter of we are in a circumstance where that where we have consciousness and its contents in every moment and all of this is that the light the lights are on and they're on for reasons that we dimly understand right there. These are the reasons that are biological in our case, but perhaps at bottom there just based on information processing and their platform independent and then we would build machines for whom the life of the light is actually on or not. Right. This is, it remains to be seen whether we could actually build in our computers, conscious minds that can thrive or suffer, right, and that the difference matters, but we're in a circumstance where we are trying to understand how conscious consciousness and it states arises, but one thing that is undeniable is that the lights are on and being on.

Speaker 3:          01:28:11       They reveal a spectrum of experience that w, w, W, which has one end that we the, the, the worse it gets, the more compelling it is to move away from it. That reading that's meaning, right? Yeah. Okay. So and then and all of our meaning talk and value talk relates to navigating in this space. So there's, there's one end of it where things get needlessly horrible without a silver lining and there's another end where it gets better and better and non zero sum that all boats are rising with the same tide and the Israelis and the Palestinians, the landscape cable and good. So okay. So these are compelling ways to talk about this space of, of navigation. What do you do? So

Speaker 1:          01:28:54       when you accept your space of navigation and there's a conflict between wellbeing for the living population, earth versus wellbeing over the maximum populations that could possibly live into the future when there's a big conflict between how much wellbeing we're going to feel now versus how much wellbeing future human beings will get to feel.

Speaker 3:          01:29:14       Yeah. Well that, that those are legitimate ethical problems which we, I think we often live in the space where we know there's a right answer, that we are too selfish to fulfill or too short sided to fulfill. Like so I know there are things I do every day that not only will other people as yet unborn, wish I hadn't done, I might wake up tomorrow wishing I hadn't done those things right, so like I'm a, I'm a bad friend to my future self in some respect to say nothing of the rest of humanity so we can be so we can have failures, we can have weakness of will, we can have failures that we can just be wrong about certain things, but it's nowhere written that is easy to be a good person. Right? In that case, it's not even clear what good means is clear.

Speaker 3:          01:30:02       I'm saying cases really knows the answer. It might be hard to be motivated by that knowledge and that because we're not a unity, right? I mean, part of, part of what wisdom is morally is an ability to be, to live integrated enough with your own, you know, better self. We have the advice you would give to a friend of this. This just falls right out of your work as well as live as though, but basically treat yourself the way you would treat. I think this is your line, so you know someone you you're you're responsible for, or there's somebody, a friend of yours, right. If you can, if you can do that, you're already ahead of who most people are most of the time, but there's no. There's no reason to say that because it's difficult or because sometimes we're looking through a glass darkly and can't figure out what the answer is. The answer doesn't exist or there is no right one.

Speaker 1:          01:30:52       Okay. Now let me try with you.

Speaker 3:          01:30:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:31:00       so Jordan, you have argued for a and evolved framework of religious belief in which there are elements that are morally defensible, that will be carried through time. There are elements that are morally reprehensible that will be carried through time by virtue of the fact that they are effective and you have argued that these things, because they have withstood the test of time, have some kind of value, which is not necessarily something that we should honor, but some large fraction of it must be, but that would seem to suggest that the degree to which these belief structures has value is contingent on the degree to which the environment in which we attempt to deploy these structures matches the environment in which they evolved. Absolutely. Now, I would argue that no population of humans has lived farther from its ancestral environment,

Speaker 5:          01:32:01       and we do think that's a fallacy. You think so because, well, it isn't. It isn't. And look, I think that's an absolutely valid point. Okay, so, so this gets esoteric relatively rapidly, but the question is, let's say at the highest levels of adaptation, we're adapted to the things that last the longest periods of time. Those are the most permanent things. Now the question is what are those most permanent things? And you know, one answer would be the fundamental material substrate of the world, and that's true. I'm going to leave that be like we were evolved to deal with gravity. Okay? But there are other elements that are higher order abstractions in some sense that are also apparently hyperreal. So for example, there's. There's a problem that we have a bifurcated, right? The question is, well, why did we have a bifurcated brain? And the answer seemed to not just us.

Speaker 5:          01:32:54       Animals to Nasser seems to be, well, there's two necessary ways of looking at the world and they have to be in conflict to some degree in order to work properly. The right hemisphere and the left hemisphere, the right hemisphere mode is a lot more metaphorical than the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere is the hemisphere that seems to deal with exceptions to the rule, and it seems to deal with the exceptions to the rule by men, by treating them, by aggregating them, and then trying to recognize patterns that unite them as a corrective to the totalitarian system in some sense that the left hemisphere imposes. You could say that the right and the left are adapted for something like explored territory for the left and unexplored territory for the right. I've characterized that is order versus chaos and I think the religious landscape is good versus evil to Sam's point that we should strive for a good life on a landscape of chaos versus order, and I think that landscape is permanent. Now I know we moved from our African ancestral homeland, but these, this underlying abstraction, this underlying, this underlying reality is so profound that it it, it maintains its validity across all sets of potential environmental transformations.

Speaker 3:          01:34:03       Okay? Okay. Can I just jump in here because here's why.

Speaker 3:          01:34:09       Just to see is on one piece you put in play there. Here's why good and evil can't be permanent in the usual sense. Certainly not in the Christian Judeo Christian sense. One is the Judeo Christian notion of good and evil doesn't even map onto to eastern religion. You made a good evil versus good claimed in the moral but it, but it's also in an eastern context and a Buddhist or Hindu context. The evil isn't really evil. It's just ignorance. Now you might dispute that you might say, well that's not really. They haven't met a sufficiently evil person to if they can think that, but the reality is that billions of people who have a different rubric under wisdom make the case, but let's let. Let me add another another piece here. We're just going to ask them, okay, we need. You guys need to go guys want this to continue?

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       Or do you want q and a to begin?

Speaker 2:          01:35:01       I don't know which one you're fearing for. Give them. Give them

Speaker 5:          01:35:05       first group is the group that wants this conversation to continue.

Speaker 2:          01:35:18       Now the group that would prefer

Speaker 5:          01:35:21       q and a,

Speaker 2:          01:35:25       it was the former. What?

Speaker 5:          01:35:28       What's disturbing is that many of the same people were laughing. Proves what Jordan was saying about the two hemispheres, the brain metaphor. So I mean it seems to me, and again, correct me if I'm wrong, is that you made an absolute world claim in the moral landscape and that's what grounds here argument

Speaker 3:          01:35:50       these because it'll be interesting if it's not totally on point. The reason why evil is susceptible to total deflation is if you agree with me, evil is a category of human misbehavior, human intention that we don't understand significantly at the level of the brain, but if we did understand it totally at the level of the brain than every evil person we had in the doc at trial would be just like Charles Whitman with his brain tumor after he shot up everyone at the University of Texas. Right? So like he, he is, he's the prototypically evil mass murder, but he's complaining about this change that overcame his personality and he thinks it would be good. A good idea that if after the cops kill me, you autopsy my brain because I don't know why I'm doing any of this. Right. And Lo and behold, he had a glioblastoma pressing on his amygdala and all of a sudden it made sense of his behavior in a way that a full understanding of psychopathy or every other variant of human evil would make sense of it in a way that would be deflationary ethically.

Speaker 3:          01:36:58       And then you would look at. So then you look at someone like Saddam Hussein or the worst evil person you could imagine, and you would say, well, he's actually unlucky you know there, but for the grace of biology, go on. Because if I had that brain, if I had those jeans, if I had those influences that gave me those synapses, I would be just like him. Now if you think there's some other element that gives us free will and now then, then, then you and I are disagree that that's a factual claim. That's at variance with mind. But, but if we are just on some level now a malfunctioning biological systems when we're being evil than a complete understanding of evil would cancel that category. Can you define evil? So we know what you're talking about. Well just take, take the just the worst people who have statistically victimized the most people and those are the evil, evil people.

Speaker 5:          01:37:53       So when you say, so I think this is actually really important. So I think actual evil of that kind is pretty darn rare. And there's a lot of badness that email from one of the most troubling thing or all the good people doing evil because they're ruled by bad ideas, but that I think is more consequential than we actually. We introduced a whole set of other things here in the last little round with freewill and evil, but, but, but just to

Speaker 3:          01:38:16       want to make it clear why I went there, you were saying this is, this is, this is, I forgot the word. You used inevitable or ineluctable Lloyd's permit applications that this category is permanent. And I'm saying that I don't think but equal in that sense as a permanent category for us. They do weights more information and insight.

Speaker 5:          01:38:37       Okay, we're going to distinguish for a minute. Good versus evil and good versus bad. Just for the sake of conceptual clarity in the moral landscape, you make a fundamental axiomatic plane, looks like a moral claim. Maybe it's claim of fact. And the claim is there are bad lives and good lives. Sure. And the claim you make is that, that's universally true. It's true for the requisite lines, Buddhist, Hindu, it doesn't matter. Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:39:06       but evil, so yes, I'm not. I'm not telling you that you should purge the word evil from your your vocabulary. I use the word all the time and I think it's useful to motivating word. I'm just saying that it's there. We can understand this continuum of good and bad or positive and negative in ways that don't use the. The. Certainly don't use the Judeo Christian framework for value in these things because if you. If you take the Buddhist framework and map it onto this, this continuum, you don't get good and evil. You get essentially wisdom and ignorance in an evil is ignorance of all the wellbeing you would you and others would experience if you behaved another way. Right? That's the Buddhist game and we're even within Hinduism and they get this connects to your. Your, your love of stories. You take the, the, the, the Hindu texts.

Speaker 3:          01:39:58       The Ramayana, which is just a foundation, is doing the work that the Bible is doing for Jews and Christians in that. The worst guy in the Ramayana, the 10 headed Demon Rovena, the prototypically evil person is at bottom. Really not a bad guy. He's a great sage who is just in a bad mood essentially. Right? He was was. He was obscured by ignorance and so it isn't the Buddhist cannon, the Buddhist, the Buddha made say a serial killer who knows wearing a garland of human fingers around his neck, named ongoing on Gooley Mala, but he was just one conversation away from being fully enlightened. Right? I mean, he was like, this is a different picture of a possibility. I'm not saying one is right or wrong. Let's be agnostic about that. I'm just. I'm challenging your claim that there's something so precious and useful and durable about the Judeo Christian

Speaker 5:          01:40:49       I wasn't making. I wasn't making what we're stuck with it for all time. You see making that claim. I was making the claim that in the moral landscape you laid out a distinction between the bird life and the good life. Forget about rutten evil, the bad life and the good life Hell and heaven, bad life and the good life, and that that distinction was not only factual but universal

Speaker 3:          01:41:11       and so you the right mind so that we could imagine a mind. I mean, this is an example. I think in a right mind you we can, we can create circumstances that seem perverse to us that we were would recoil from. You could you could create a universe of perfectly matched, say this and masochists say right, so you have the people who are real sadists who in our world would be terrible actors, but in their world they're surrounded by people who want to be mistreated. Now again, this may

Speaker 5:          01:41:40       real estate is you never mistreated masochist when he asks you, okay,

Speaker 2:          01:41:43       well these are not

Speaker 3:          01:41:53       for the human categories even exists, but in some we undoubtedly we could create something like an artificial intelligence that could be google. It could be paired this way and that would be weird, but on my, in my framework, it is a conceivable space of equivalent wellbeing and if it's not matched at all to our space, right? It's, but it's if, if in fact we could inspect the conscious minds of all parties participate in that. It is not obviously absurd by in my view to say that they are just as happy as we are in this conversation. In fact, some moments in this conversation I would say that they might be happier.

Speaker 5:          01:42:37       No, it's been good. It's been good. So let me, let me ask you a question here about wellbeing because this is something I've wanted to ask you about but we never seem to get to is. So you think that we should maximize wellbeing and that's part of your proposition, which which I don't entirely disagree with by the way that we should ground our value starches in fact, but, but, but there's a black box problem. They're like, I think the black box problem about the April restructure that we use to extract the facts of the world out and the black box problem is if we could measure wellbeing, it's like, yeah, that's a big problem Sam. Like we have measures of wellbeing and their terrible. Yes they are.

Speaker 3:          01:43:17       No, no, I'm agreeing. I think. I don't think it's, but it's not a problem for my thesis is we don't have measures for anything we care about.

Speaker 5:          01:43:25       But I mean, if you're, if your thesis is that if we had the measures of wellbeing that were appropriate, we could use them in a positive way and the responses, but we don't have those measures. It's like, okay, well then what do we do?

Speaker 3:          01:43:37       Oh No, no, but we have measures. I mean, this conversation is a measure. I don't like that. That's a measure, right? You step on my toe and I say out, that's a measure. Don't do that and get

Speaker 5:          01:43:47       for your wellbeing. It might be a measure of your treat. Neuroticism.

Speaker 1:          01:43:50       What it is a measure of. I mean there's technically, if you look at the wellbeing measures that we have, they degenerate it to measures of neuroticism. No, we don't. We don't. But we don't have measures of certainty, of belief, of compassion, of joy, of, of any, any of these conscious states we have. We have neural correlates of some of them, but we don't have. We got, there's no. Well then how helmet writes about them to Orient Ourselves in the world, Dan, because we're doing that. We're doing this all the time. If you've got an instantaneous measure though, you've got an instantaneous measure of wellbeing, we can all check with ourselves, see how we feel, but it's possible to be wrong about that, but, uh, it degrades as you get away from the individual's ability to check internally on the internal, the internal thing isn't reliable or happy when you're doing things that will take a drug that would make you feel very good and would cause you to take apart your own life because it would be like cocaine.

Speaker 1:          01:44:57       It would destroy the motivational structure that gets you to do stumps, stuff of value that, uh, that your rights, we can't use emotion. That emotion as an indicator of instantaneous is not good, but you have a parallel problem. It looks to me like the exact mirror image, which is that you've got an integrative long term measure of wellbeing instantiated in an evolutionary belief system, but it's coming apart because we are living in circumstances that are less well mirrored. The president does not mirror the past and therefore these truths which you believe are timeless or degrading. Yeah, rapidly. That's part of. That's exactly right. Yeah. Okay, so what Sam is arguing is that the tools to pivot in order to improve our way of interacting, those are not the tools of long standing tradition. Those are the tools of rational engagement, respect for that process as part of the longest standing tradition.

Speaker 1:          01:45:54       Yes, that's true. Yeah, but that's a big truth, man. That's a major league truth. In fact, I would say the fundamental tradition that most fundamental tradition of the West says that respect for the process, that updates moral judgment is the highest of all possible values and that's also built into the tradition. Strangely enough, I agree it's built into the, into the tradition, but I would argue that it is very likely to be compartmentalized. In other words. I was a little bit struck when you said that. Um, what did you say about scaling? You said that, uh, the good reasons scale and batteries is don't, isn't that the opposite of the truth calling if you're calling these stories that give prescriptions for how to behave bad ideas. The point is those stories propagate very easily, was so. Whereas, so if we want to talk about the gun and whether it is loaded, the idea that the gun is definitely loaded that scales really easily, right? You can pass that along in one sentence.

Speaker 3:          01:46:59       I'm wrong about a loaded gun also scale, right? So no, no, they're not. Want to talk to

Speaker 1:          01:47:05       about very small possibilities of very dire things happening. They trip over it. It's hard thing to get. It's almost impossible for them to get it. So the point is the one thing does scale story that says yeah, every gun is loaded. It's a false story, but that one definitely scaled this statistical reality of guns and the fact that they may indeed beyond loaded, but you don't want to play around with the remote possibility that one day you'll get it wrong, right? That doesn't scale because it requires you to have experienced with stuff that is not common.

Speaker 3:          01:47:38       Right? Well, so, so the two things there, one of you bring up as an ancillary but very important point, which is that moral progress here is often the result of moving from our story-driven protagonists driven intuitions to something far more quantified. Right? So I mean, this is a classic, you know, moral study done by Paul Slovako, I'm sure you are aware of where you tell people about one needy little girl in Africa and you give her a name and, and, and show her picture, and what you elicit is the maximum, our truest compassionate response from subjects. You go to another group of subjects, you tell them about the same little girl, give her the same name, but also tell them about her needy little brother, right? Who has the same need and their response diminishes, right? That just the addition of a single person diminishes the response.

Speaker 3:          01:48:35       And this is just, this is a moral fallacy that we're all living out every day because if you care about this one little girl, you should care at least as much about the fate of her and her brother. And when you ask statistic, no, no, you shouldn't because this is a man. You'll exhaust yourself in the attempt. No, because we need. What do you wanting to know for 100 people? This is what this, this is what this software flog gets us. It gets us people who will watch four hours a day with, with, with effortless and and Peter Tear, stained compassion, the saga of the little girl who fell down the well, but who will blindly turn the channel when they're hearing about a genocide that is raging and there's a thousands have already died. Listen guys, if you have something, we have to. If you for this know I'm not talking about you're misunderstood.

Speaker 3:          01:49:31       You're misunderstanding me to great effect here. That if I'm not saying that you should personally be overwhelmed by the death toll every day you. I'm not saying that it's functional for you and I to each personally get up each morning and just drink deep of the full horror of all the bad luck that is spread. No, maybe it is, but maybe we can't have that, but as societies we need. When you're talking about how we report, how we spend our money, how we get a portion foreign aid, the kinds of wars we fight or don't fight, it had to interpret. Then we have to correct for what is in fact a moral illusion, which is we know that if we tell one little, we tell one compelling story about a little girl, right. We could go to war over that. Right. Whereas we won't be motivated by a genocide.

Speaker 3:          01:50:20       That's the kind of thing that moves whole societies now and if, if, if it's. If you add to it the bogus religious sanctity, he's, if you, if, if you, if we burn the Koran on this stage tonight, the rest of our. Yeah, the rest of our lives would be spent in hiding, right? Because of how motivated people would be to, to, to address that pseudo problem. Right. That's the world we're living in and we're at civilization so far as we have a purchase on. It is a matter of correcting for those errors and religion for the most part, not across the board, but for the most part is standing in the way of those course corrections.

Speaker 2:          01:51:00       Thank you.

Speaker 4:          01:51:04       Well, okay. There was a tremendous amount to unpack in that. I mean and, and like in some sense, a surprising amount. It's like, well, we have, we're, we're wired to feel intense empathy for individuals who are close to us and we can be told stories in a manner that that makes that system manifest itself and everyone and their dog thinks that that's a wonderful thing and we call that empathy, right, and empathy has a narrow domain of utility as it turns out, because how? I mean maybe if you were all who you should be, you'd be weeping constantly for the catastrophic fate of sentient beings on the earth, but you can't handle it. You know what I mean? It's that you can barely handle your own suffering and maybe you can handle a bit of the suffering of your family and more power to you. If you could rectify that and if you were better human beings, maybe you could expand that outwards, but the fact that our empathy doesn't scale up to the level of genocide with the same intensity that we treat instances of individuals, suffering isn't an indication that we're irrational. It's just an indication that we're limited.

Speaker 3:          01:52:11       I think this is an indication of exactly

Speaker 2:          01:52:14       the problem

Speaker 1:          01:52:15       of our evolved structure is not matching the present because the point is match because we take care of our families know, but they don't match because if you encountered the starving girl that's some sort of a. it's a crude measure of suffering in your local environment. Were you in the past now that you can encounter this girl on the television? It's not clear what it should mean to you. Right? Right. You can't calibrate how many your act together. Right, and so the. So the point is your indifference

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       to a genocide, which is an abstraction, right, is altered. Should you see pictures of the bodies, for example, you shouldn't actually feel differently about the genocide in the abstract case versus the the case that you're looking at the bodies and the fact that we have access to photo realistic representations breading.

Speaker 3:          01:53:08       Of course that was actually a rational because I can show you the case where you care at level 10 about the little girl named Lila and you care at level eight about the little girl named Layla and her brother named Jaunty. Right? And you care at level four if I've added a few more kids, but the little girl named Lila who you was ostensibly care about is there and each one of these, right, so nurses are diminished, diminished nobody beautification of the sufferer. You have $10 to give away every month to help start struggling in humanity and you tell me you'll give 10 to lila this month and I, and then I catch you in another moment. And I say, well, you know, it's Leila and her brother. So it's like, if you only can give 10, I understand, but you know the problem is actually worse than I suspected. And you say, well actually album's going to give eight. Right? You, it's not coherent with your how much you cared about Leila and the first place

Speaker 5:          01:54:08       we do know we do know quite well. The risks that we use to orient ourselves in the world can be placed into frameworks where they produce contradictory outcomes. But that doesn't mean that the heuristics themselves are deeply flawed. It's that it's a problem with the work of people like condiment and diversity

Speaker 3:          01:54:22       is that we need to correct for that we need to correct for them because they're producing reliable results that we recognize that you can put them in a situation where they

Speaker 5:          01:54:30       produce a counterproductive response, but that doesn't mean that generally speaking, in most situations they don't produce a useful outcome because the question is why in the hell would they evolved if they didn't?

Speaker 3:          01:54:40       Most of the time evolved to live with 150 people with whom we're related and to be terrified of the people in the next valley who may want to kill and eat us. Yes, and that's, I mean, that's our ancient circumstance which doesn't map onto a common humanity of 7 billion people trying to figure out how to get to Mars without killing each other. Well, it does map onto it sometimes, unfortunately, because there are many times when we still face the same kind of effect, but hence, look at maps. Sean does the hierarchy. You wouldn't be concerned about the fundamentalists, terror of Islam if you weren't driven by those essentially tribal considerations suggesting not trauma. It doesn't require if my a mere identification with humanity, it can ground not wanting to be murdered by people who are identified with a subset of humanity. Right? Like I don't need to be part of a smaller tribe to care that people will murder me over burning the Koran.

Speaker 3:          01:55:40       Right? It's, it's, it's just, it's clearly counterproductive that we live in a society where some objects are held with such totemic attachment for irrational reasons, by many, many millions of people were, you know, you should be sympathetic with this. Our free speech is actually canceled on this point, right? We literally can't produce cartoons. I have scholarly words about the cartoon price if we don't show the cartoon, no argument whatsoever. So if we miss about the lack of utility of you, you don't have to be identified as a, as a Christian or a Jew to push back against that. You just have to be a human being that sees the dysfunction of a smaller kind of provincialism.

Speaker 5:          01:56:23       Well, the thing that I'm struggling with is that I still can't understand in what your ethos is, is is grounded because you claim like a transcendental rationalism, but you won't identify the structures that produce it. It's a black box and when I tried to push you on the absolute nature of your ethical claim, which is that the bad life is worse than the good life and that we should in fact university work towards the good life. It doesn't seem to me that you'll accept the proposition that that's a universal claim.

Speaker 3:          01:56:50       It. No, it is. It is. Well, I should is irrelevant here. It's just the fact that there is the possibility of moving in this space. If you move in the wrong direction, if you move far enough, you'll like it less and less, but why is it relevant? Give given the given the mines you have.

Speaker 5:          01:57:09       Well, what if you had to accept moving in the wrong direction and experiencing less and less wellbeing in order to get to a better place it. Well, and maybe even just to survive, suppose the, suppose the population has to endure a generation and a half of misery in order to persist

Speaker 3:          01:57:28       ethically, that's a perfectly intelligible circumstance that people have had to face and it's in my, on my moral landscape, it's analogous to what we were were we might be at one local maximum or some high point, but we're moving in a down a slope to get to yet some higher place. Right? So certain things, some things may only be possible if we made some painful and net unpleasant sacrifice for sure. Yes. And so that, but that's, that can be rationally apprehended. There can be an argument for that. It could be a way. Well, you know, we all have to go on a diet, otherwise we're going to, we're going to die of this problem, right? We all have to stop eating whatever it is, wheat, right? It's a hard sacrifice for. People will have to stop it as you know, uh, if that were just true wealth and there'd be an argument for it, there'd be evidence that would convince us we would stop, we would feel the pain and we would, we would get whatever benefit with that was on the other side of that sacrifice.

Speaker 3:          01:58:29       But again, you don't have to, if the utility again to come bring it back to stories at which is, as you know, not my emphasis, but it is yours. The, the utility of stories is not something I'm arguing against. I mean there's no question that certain stories are incredibly compelling. And in our conversation with one another, the moment you begin to frame something in terms of a story, people become much more interested right now if, if, if 90 percent of what we said together tonight, we're afraid each, each point we were making as a matter of philosophy or, or, or science were framed in will. Actually, you know, yesterday I was walking down the street and I met this guy, the terrifying looking guy and all of a sudden people become much more interested. Right? And then that's not an accident and that says something deep about us that we could understand that in evolutionary terms and we might in fact one to creatively leverage to be better people, to have better conversations.

Speaker 3:          01:59:29       Definitely, yes. So that's what I think. There's nothing. There's nothing that I say in opposition to religious dogmatism and religious sectarianism that discounts that reality and that's a psychological reality is a cultural reality. And I'm not against making the most of it. My, my basic claim, however, is that we never need to believe that one of our books may not have a human origin. In order to do that effectively, you can. You can be just as compelled by the example of somebody like Jesus or some more modern person who strikes you as a moral hero and a deeply wise without believing anything on insufficient evidence. And if, as I, as you alluded to, purely fictional stories about superheros can have immense effect on us and that's something we could understand and also leverage. But again, that takes us out of the religion business and that's, that's all I've been arguing for. So do you really believe

Speaker 2:          02:00:33       that's

Speaker 1:          02:00:37       the belief in the supernatural aspect of these stories, never alters the calculus of what people should do, that the divine nature of a story about Jesus doesn't motivate people to do something that they might not have the courage to do otherwise. The belief that they might end up in heaven because their good work is going to be observed, doesn't alter their behavior.

Speaker 3:          02:00:57       Well, yeah, I know it alters their behavior, but rather often for the bad. Well, I mean this is why this is what worries me about. Hey, I think there's something there. There's a profound net negative that we are paying the price for everyday by believing in paradise, right? The belief, a belief that this life, it probably doesn't matter very much at all because we get what we really want after we die is forget about the evidentiary basis for that belief. It is. It's ruinous for prioritizing what we should be prioritizing in this life. And if I agree with that, by the way. Yeah. Okay. Well that's interesting.

Speaker 1:          02:01:42       So let me ask you this, I hear from you what might be a kind of confirmation bias where I hear that, you know, we've got a mixed bag, you've got supernatural claims, these supernatural claims, we all agree have effects on the way people actually behave and you're quite focused on the negative and you tend to discount the positive which might be an artifact of the fact that we're talking about the present and therefore maybe something that's not well matched to these stories or it might be from the idea that you have the sense that there is actually a bias that these belief structures do and have always produced more harm than good.

Speaker 3:          02:02:25       And also my sense that the positive can be had without those structures. So they, if you're talking about the, the, the, the contemplative experience like is it possible to feed the wake up tomorrow morning feeling like my heart right? Feeling like you're just inseparable from the pure capital b being that is consciousness, right? And there's no separate self, their, the self transcending union with everything you can proceed. Right? I think that can be had without any kind of religious dogmatism masters that matter of paying close enough attention to the nature of consciousness, so the contemplative life is the bay is one baby in the bathwater. We can save the ethical life is another baby. We can say if you don't have to presuppose anything on insufficient evidence to argue about what is right and wrong and good and evil in in the 21st century.

Speaker 1:          02:03:17       Is it fair to call that a hypothesis that not just for some people but for everyone. The level of wellbeing can be enhanced through rational interaction with the questions that dictate what we do. Is that a hypothesis? Whoa.

Speaker 3:          02:03:34       That's a hypothesis that the one additional fact that we that makes that more or less mood is that on certain points, even if we felt that really believe in the fiction were what was it was advantageous to people. Depending on which fiction you're talking about, there's simply just. There's too much evidence against it. You can't. You can't decide to believe something for which you have no evidence simply because of the good effects. The good, the good experience. It will give you or you imagine it will give you. I mean, that's. That's why Pascal's wager never made any sense. We can't say the only way you can believe something to be true, really true, not just metaphorically true, is to believe that if it weren't true, you wouldn't believe it. They you stand at some relationship to its truth such that that is the reason why you believe it. Now you can't say, you can't be telling yourself, you know, I have no evidence for this thing, but I know life would be better if I believed that to true, and so therefore, I really believe it's true. You don't think people do that all the time? I don't think they do. I think they do things much more like we're talking the metaphorical truth. We're talking about you. We act as if things are true without forming any strong propositional claim and that's fine. That's fine. That has its own utility. You don't think this is

Speaker 1:          02:04:57       basically. I mean, we all suspend disbelief when we go and watch a movie and we sort of entitled a movie maker to, to set the ground rules of the space and if it's Harry Potter, than there are magic magical things that can happen and if it's some other story, maybe there aren't. So we all have a mechanism whereby we know we can suspend disbelief and it's interesting to me that you seem not to imagine that people are doing that with respect to metaphysical beliefs that have implications for what the right actions that they should take art. Why? Why wouldn't it be the case that that same sort of mechanism would apply?

Speaker 3:          02:05:34       Well, it does apply, but there are people who are clearly doing much more than that. So I'm not. If, if that's all people were doing under the ages of religion, I wouldn't spend much time worrying about religion, but that to some degree that's what people do. You know, as you say, go into caring about things that I bought them we really shouldn't care about. So the World Cup is on right now and we literally billions of people care care down to their toes. What happens to this little ball as it traverses a lawn. Right? And if it goes into the net, it really matters if it fails to, it really matters and always matters if we hit the target Sam. But this is, this is something we have manufactured to care about, right? It speaks to us. It's quite literally a game, a game that people are playing.

Speaker 3:          02:06:26       But some people take it in taking it further than you, than, than seems truly rational is part of the fun. That's but, but the fee that the people who can't turn that off metaphor soccer's a metaphor but there. But there are people who there, you know, there are people, you know the, the fullback who kicks an own goal and then goes back to his South American village and gets murdered. Right? He's surrounded by people who are taking the game too seriously. Yeah. Okay. I agree. Yeah. And so my problem with religion is that so much of a time we're meeting those people and we're at work and we're not criticizing those people. We have no place to stand to criticize those people because

Speaker 7:          02:07:06       so attached to the game. Fair enough. Why don't we do this? Why don't we each take three minutes to sum up.

Speaker 1:          02:07:14       So I think, yeah, we are there. We're at the end of time. So why don't you each take three minutes, some up and then we'll call it. Good. Okay. I'm sure Sam went last. Do you want to go first here? Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:07:26       So there's lots of things about which seminar. I agree,

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       but the devil's in the details. Of course. Now I, I'm very sympathetic to his claim that we need to ground our ethical systems in something solid and demonstrable. My problem is I'm not sure how to do that when I don't believe that you can derive a value structure from your experience of the observable facts. There's too many facts. You need a structure to interpret them and there isn't very much of you. And so part of the reason, part of the way that that's addressed neurologically is that you have an inbuilt structure. It's deep, it's partly biological, it's partly an emergent consequences of your socialization and you view the world of facts through that structure and it's a structure of value. Now that structure of value may be derived from the world of facts over the evolutionary timeframe, but it's not derived from the world of facts over the timeframe that you inhabit and it can't be.

Speaker 4:          02:08:41       So. The problem I have with our discussion so far isn't really any of Sam's fundamental ethical claims because I do believe there's a distinction between the hellish life and the heavenly life say the life that everyone would agree with absolutely not worth living and the life we could imagine as good. And I do believe that we should be moving from one to the other. The question is exactly how is it that we make the decisions that will guide us along that way. And I don't believe we can make them without that April to restructure. In fact, I think the evidence is absolutely overwhelming that we can't. And I mean also the scientific evidence and I would like to go further into the devil that's in those details. And so that's my situation.

Speaker 2:          02:09:37       Thanks.

Speaker 3:          02:09:43       Hope part of these conversations. And now if you, and I've had I think four conference done, two podcasts in this or a second live event. And thank you for doing this. By the way, this is, hey, it's my pleasure, honor to do this. And it's, uh, it comes with risks for both of us to do this. I think you can sense we don't have precisely the same audiences. All of you are sort of rooting for one or the other of us to some degree for the spirit of truth. And

Speaker 2:          02:10:21       yes, but clearly

Speaker 3:          02:10:28       the conversation is the point, right? This is not though this conversation, the character at many moments of a debate, I don't think either of us view it as a debate in, in the trivial sense is not about point scoring. It's about making sense in a way that's consequential because we're talking about issues of great consequence and you obviously care about these things and it matters whether we converge on the most important questions in human life and as you know, I'm worried that religion doesn't give us the tools we need to converge what does give us the tools is a truly open ended conversation and then you simply have to look honestly at the obstacles toward any conversation. Being open ended and religion presents those first and most readily. It's. It is a had the idea that certain things have been decided for all time and there's no future evidence or argument that is admissible on those points.

Speaker 3:          02:11:39       Now that is clearly bad. Everywhere in science. It's bad everywhere in in how we renegotiate our proximity to one another in society. It a new laws and new ideas are born all the time about how to structure institutions and social relationships because new things happen. I mean, we didn't have an internet and then we did, so our old laws and our old expectations of human communication simply don't work in the presence of this new thing. Right? So we have to figure out. We, again, it's a navigation problem and what I'm perpetually in contest when even in conversations like this is the sense that the rules need to change just a little bit for this class of books that literally this side of the bookstore, right? There's like any other part of the bookstore will then there's no barrier to honest conversation, but you move over here.

Speaker 3:          02:12:37       They got this shelf of books there. You have to hold your tongue right there. We can't pick and choose. We can't say that. While we can say that Shakespeare wrote some fantastic players, the best players ever written and some are actually not that good, right? We can't say that about God, right? We have to find some tortured way to make the most of his diabolical utterances. Right. That's the thing we have to outgrow and so what I'm continually intention with you is the degree to which your style of talking about religion and narrow the power of narrative and the meaning derived from it aligns that point and seems to let people off the hook on that very point and that's the. That's where we need to hold the line. In my view, we need to. We need to

Speaker 2:          02:13:26       sure

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       that, that it has to be clear to us at this moment in history that no one has the right to their religious sectarianism. Really. I mean it it up to the point. Clearly there's a soccer, there's a World Cup version of it that has benign, but once it gets taken past that point, we we have to figure out how to pull the brakes and that becomes a real problem. If your. If you going to dignify the foundational claims of these faiths claims like revelation and paradise and blast swimming and apostasy, and these are things that you come up against and I think conversations like this are incredibly important because we need to convince the better part of humanity that is possible to live the best life possible without recourse to divisive nonsense and where we draw the line between divisive nonsense and reasoned, unnecessary discourse is what we're, we're dickering over and I think, I think it's important that we continue.

Speaker 2:          02:14:43       Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          02:15:00       In closing, let me say, first of all, I'm tremendously honored that you asked me to moderate these debates.

Speaker 2:          02:15:09       Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          02:15:16       It was a truly remarkable experience. As for what was accomplished, I think it was a tremendous amount. I saw both of you move. I saw both of you exhibit tremendous generosity of spirit towards the other and I think, um, this has exceeded my expectations of what might've been possible in these discussions by quite a bit. Um, and that also I will say, has a lot to do with the fact that for reasons I think none of us can explain a huge amount of people, a huge population seems to care about these issues because they matter a great deal. So anyway, I think this has been a very successful exercise and I think you both justly be quite proud of what you've done.

Speaker 2:          02:16:00       Alright, let's give a huge round of applause. Thank you. Thanks.
