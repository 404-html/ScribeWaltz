Speaker 1:          00:00:00       So this is going to be a live recording, well, not alive, a recording of our podcast before a live audience. These are the interns, right, of the American Enterprise Institute. Senior staff. We didn't actually invite them, but they heard you were here and in their way, they just, all, we ended up in this room. We were going to be at our dark studio. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       no. Well, this is nice. It's good to have. It's nice to be in front of all your people. So hypothetically, we'll see how civilized.

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       Sure. Yes. Is Antifa here? No aunties. No, it's good. Good. All right. So we ready? Yeah, it's really nice to see you. So nice to see you. Okay. Start. Go. Welcome to the FAM. Xplaners I'm Danielle crittendon and I'm Christina Hoff summers and we are thrilled to have the father of all mansplainers in our studio today. You know, I think he's actually more of a man whisperer. Yes, a man whisperer and the mad genius behind the intellectual dark web, whatever. Welcome to the FIMS planers Jordan Peterson. Thank you very much. So delighted to have you. And it's an honor to have you honor and a note to our listeners. We're recording this in front of a live audience at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC where Christina is a resident scholar and there'll be video of the podcast as well and we will let you know where to find that when it's ready.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       And we're also grateful to Aei every week for the use of its recording studio for the podcast. And now for an introduction though he needs no introduction to the people here, but Jordan Peterson is a professor at the University of Toronto and author of many books and and poster of many fantastic lecturers and his most recent book has, I can't keep track of how many languages it's been translated into and the sales. Just a phenomenally successful book tour. In fact, my first question is really about your tour. You look pretty good for somebody who's visited what a hundred cities in the past years, January 23rd I don't know how you do it, and mostly flying. What do you do for fun? What do you ever get to relax? Even brief moments. And what do you do? Go on twitter and,

Speaker 2:          00:02:19       Oh God, yes. Although I've been qualified that is relaxing. Um, I tried to forestall that temptation as much as possible. Well, I have the auto mode bit of time that I can spend with my wife. She does travel with me. And so, you know, we've had, we, we tried to take some time to walk around the cities that we're in, um, and see what we can, we're usually not at any given place for more than a day or two. And they're usually pretty packed up with, well, whatever is associated with the lecture. And then with press that the publishers usually arrange.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       Well I heard you interviewed in Sweden, you were in Stockholm and you were, had a, had a half an hour to visit the city with your wife. Yeah. And you loved it. But that,

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       you know, it's very tricky breaks where you get them. Well, the thing is is that the, the lecture to her is unbelievably positive. Yes. And a lot of this has is ridiculously positive. You know, like, so if I'm going out on the streets now or in cafes or you know, airports, I meet people all the time and they're always polite and they're always happy to see me and they always have some very touching story to relate and, and then the audiences themselves are very positively predisposed to whatever it is that we're doing together. And so that makes it a lot easier to stay motivated and to continue. You know, I mean it's demanding because everything's scheduled so tightly and, and I do a different lecture every night, every, every time I go.

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       I find that amazing because I give a lot of lectures that I anguish over everywhere. And then I have another one and it I it you go up without notes.

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       Yeah. Well I have a large collection of, you know, things that I know what, how to talk about. And usually what I try to do is to formulate a problem before the lecture. So I'm addressing a specific problem and then I can track how I would set up the argument and then I walked through it. But part of it's also an attempt to formulate the argument on the fly, you know, to, to make the question, what would you say to formulate it more precisely and to make a more precise and engaging answer. And then I can use the audience to judge whether or not that's, that's happening. And so it's also a real challenge to do that. So I enjoyed that and it's an excellent intellectual workout and I've been recording the lectures and I'd been using fair some of them to write the first draft of the chapters for my next book and for books after that. And so, you know, I'm, I'm able to maximize the, what would you say the utility of doing this at each event. And, and my wife seems to be particularly well suited to traveling like that. She actually enjoys it quite a bit and, and is very stable person. And so, um, that's also helpful. So, uh, and you know, it's nice to have an extra brain along because things are scheduled so tightly that we don't ever have any room for error.

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       Well we're going to, I can't, I don't know how intellectually rigorous we plan to be with you today because we know that when you ever year on one of these platform, you're talking about your ideas, but on the fence planners, we want to hear more, a little bit more about Jordan Peterson, the man desk desperately and definitely want to hear about your wife Tammy. And also you're so well known for your views on men or how your ideas have been taken up. So enthusiastic or by young men. But we want to talk to you about women. Yep. That's good. So, but what is it, one of the things you and I share is that we both grew up in Canada. Um, I promise Christine, I would not do my Canadian accent while you were here. Um, but you grew up in rural Alberta. I grew up in Toronto. Um, and you are what? The country's most famous grew now since Marshall Mcluhan. Um, and uh, but it's the fact that you came from Canada have any effect on your views, do you think, has it formed you in any way? I mean, what did, what would it, would, would it be the same if you think you'd grown up in rural Texas? How was Canada contributed to your worldview? She's always looking to, for the Canadian angle?

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       Well, I think the particular part of Canada I grew up in probably was formative to some degree. I mean, the town I grew up in was only 50 years old, you know, and, and the particular part of the world that I grew up in was really the last settled part of the North American prairie. This was outside of Edmonton, correct? Yeah, about 400 miles north of Edmonton. Oh, 400 miles. Yeah. Yeah. It's right at the tip of the shorts. So the prairie, the prairie stretches up that far north. It's stretches up farther north in Alberta than it does anywhere else in the North American continent. And so we were at the tip of viable farming essentially. And so it was, um, it was a new place and it was a rather raw place. And it was, it was a rather harsh place in many ways, especially because of the winter. And it was fundamentally a working class place, although a prosperous working class place, right. Because most of the industry there was related to the oil and gas industry on, on. Although it was cyclical, when things were good working class people could make a very good living. This is during the 70s. So through the goal. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       To be a kid in 400 miles outside a small town, but

Speaker 2:          00:07:59       liked it when I was a kid, I wouldn't say it was as fun when I was a teenager. Um, but I'm not convinced that, you know, the majority of people who are teenagers necessarily have the most wonderful time of it. Um, I think adults often look backwards at the pass through rose colored glasses. I think that's what the cartoon is Trudeau accused Reagan of doing continually. Um, Gary Trudeau,

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       the American Enterprise Institute tone. Mister man. No, no man, I'm getting input used for it. In your book was teenage wasteland, what you call it? Yeah, but it's Canadianness does, do you, how does that formed you or affected you, if at all? Maybe it did.

Speaker 2:          00:08:44       It's hard to say. I mean I've, I've lived in lots of different parts of Canada and Canada is quite different. I lived in Alberta for a while and it had this particular flavor of existence. I mean, mostly in fairview. I was striving to leave and to move ahead, let's say, or to move,

Speaker 2:          00:09:04       I hesitate to say up at somewhere different somewhere more urban. But that's the case with many people. I mean the small towns all across the West in the u s and Canada are dying. They're down to nothing because everyone's moved to the cities. I lived in Montreal for a good while and that was interesting because it was a very, very different culture. Um, it was a culture that was to some degree stratified by language and by class. None of that was true in Alberta because it was so new that there's no class structure. Right. So that was quite interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:09:34       Right. And you worked, um, what I loved, I pulled a passage because I think as you say, people are born in small places everywhere and someone to leave and some don't. You said I want it to be elsewhere. I wasn't the only one. Everyone who eventually left the fairview I grew up knew they were leaving by the age of 12. I knew. And my wife who grew up with me on the same street knew what was that thing, what would you call that? What's the thing that makes you want to leave and, and set you off because you point out there was no class system education with cheap in Canada compared to states. It wasn't cost, it was stopping people. You were from a what? Middleclass or you worked in other words,

Speaker 2:          00:10:13       teacher and Mario and my mother was a librarian though. She had trained as a nurse. So you know, we had a comfortable, I would say a suburban lifestyle essentially, you know, um, moderate, middle class suburban lifestyle. That's what trevor you looked like. It looked like a surface hub that was built mostly in the ninth save between the 1950s in the 1970s. So

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       the young Jordan and the then young Tammy and you have to tell us that story, how you met but wanted one and more.

Speaker 2:          00:10:40       Well, you know, I think that's one thing that is different to some degree about

Speaker 4:          00:10:45       class. Um Hm.

Speaker 2:          00:10:49       My father and my mother had both left the towns they were from and they were forward future looking people. And you know, most of my friends who quit school and who didn't attend university, they didn't have,

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       they didn't have that sense. I would say that more developed sense of a world outside of what they knew. And the other thing is that my, my father took us on long trips when I was a kid. He was a teacher and so he had summer holidays and we drove all over western Canada and down into the u s long driving trips, thousands of miles. And you know, that also gave us the sense that the world was a bigger place. But I knew way before I was 12 I believe that I was off at least to university. And I think generally in your family, if you're liable to go to university, people don't even really talk about it. It's just a given that that's what's going to happen. It's, it's something that, that you take in with every breath almost. It's, it's an, it's an often an unspoken expectation and maybe people make casual reference like, well when you go to college, but it's not like there's a question about it. Whereas if you're from a working class background, especially if your family hasn't pursued postsecondary education that isn't in the realm of unspoken or spoken expectation. And it wasn't like, like lots of my friends, including many of them who dropped out before they hit high school, they weren't by, they were by no means the dumbest people in the class. Like they were plenty smart but they weren't oriented towards the idea of, of pursuing a career that, that involved intellectual, um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       what intellectual engagement wasn't in their worldview. And you know, when you hear people on the, let's say more socialists end of the distribution, talk about barriers to education, they are often talk about cost and sometimes cost is a barrier and, and, and it's more of a barrier. Yeah. And it's more of a barrier, although there's still plenty of community colleges, state colleges where you can get educated for a perfectly reasonable amount of money. But for my friends, it was never a reason that money was never a reason. They didn't pursue post secondary education. It was more like a truncated view of time, I would say. You know, there was more of an emphasis on the here and now and there were jobs aplenty well there was also that, yeah. And, and well paying jobs, like it wasn't obvious that you were in better shape economically to go to university then. Oh yeah. Loss. Especially if you were doing something like working on the oil rates. Right. But,

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       but

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       you know, that was rough, cold, harsh work and it wasn't, it wasn't once you had an inn you could stay employed, but it wasn't that easy to land an entry level job either. And so,

Speaker 4:          00:13:36       mmm.

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       Yeah. Well it was wise for lots of working class people to, to work in those jobs because they were unbelievably lucrative. So, and they should have been because they were very difficult and dangerous and frigid cold. And, and, and rough. So, you know, it's not like the people didn't earn your money. Let's just tell us quickly how you met your wife. You were, you met her when you were seven or eight are in grade three and grade three yeah. And you, did you fall in love with her in grade three and grade three and was it mutual?

Speaker 4:          00:14:10       Mm,

Speaker 2:          00:14:11       not in the beginning. She wouldn't admit it if it was, there were lots of the boys in grade three. We are in love with her. She had a whole little crew of guys that were perfectly willing to follow her around and she was perfectly willing to exploit that. She was very good at it. Yeah. She was very popular and a little girl so wonderful that you met his children. They were friends for a long time. You know, we used to play chess together and croquet and she was a vicious croquet player. She would, I don't know if you've ever played croquet, but if it's your balls touch then you can stand on European whack it and then the other person's ball will vanish off into the stratosphere. She liked it, knock it all the way down the street and then she laughed. No. So she always had a good sense of good, vicious sense of humor. It's one of the things actually admire about my wife when we're not, when we've had our verbal disputes, which you know of certainly happened. She can string together a sequence of insults. That's so hair raising.

Speaker 1:          00:15:11       You have to laugh. I was like, did she have brothers? Um, she did. She hasn't brother much older age, eight years older. Quite a peaceful person. And she had two brothers to can get along with guys, guys, guys. Yeah. They would, they show love and affection by insults. Yeah. And Jabs and jeers and yeah, and if you and I had brother and I started learned, okay, I get it, but if you don't have brothers, girls like, oh, that's so rude. That's so, yeah. So she was, yeah. Well she, she, she has a, naturally, it was maybe a case, she came by it naturally, she should get

Speaker 2:          00:15:46       farther is, uh, quite sharp. Witted and, and, and um, well, he was a real town character. He's still alive, Huh? He was a real character and the tone in real hyper extrovert, everybody knew him and he had a pretty good with torn him and she had some of that while it still does have some of that. So she was uh, you know, aside from her acerbic yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:08       Humor and her ability to whack balls and yeah. I just don't want to go further on that description and that could have many, many things that tells us about you. What else? What else attract. I mean, you've known her pretty much your whole life, so some of the other qualities that not just attracted you but enable you to sustain. I mean, I think every young person in this room will want to know, and maybe there isn't one, but what's the secret? What's it like to be with someone that long? How do you sustain that?

Speaker 2:          00:16:38       You're fortunate. Some of it's, some of it's good fortune. Um, you know, and I would say this is true. I've watched people in the relationships, you know, personally for a long time, but also as a professional because I've done a lot of clinical counseling and I mean there's some things that need to be a given about the relationship. I would say. Um, it doesn't hurt to find the other person very attractive, you know? And, and that's a mysterious thing. We're not exactly sure what it is that produces, let's say chemistry between people. Although chemistry is definitely part of what produces it. There's subtle things that attract people to one another that are way below the level of consciousness. So for example, women don't like the older of men who have rh blood factors, who if they had children with would be likely to produce a stillborn infant.

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       That's definitely a category of match.com well, it's so strange though, because you even know that's a good question. And you know, you know, by older apparently, and so, um, there's all wearing cologne. Well, that then it would depend on what type of colonias are h what was the smell is a strange

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       sense. And it's very deeply tied to very profound emotions, including memory. And so you find people attractive for reasons that you can't always determine. And so, so that, that was part of it. I mean I've always found her very attractive in that continues and I liked her combativeness you know, like I think that there's, you want someone, I think in a relationship that you can spar with and it's partly because you have hard problems to solve and if the person that you're with isn't willing to put forward their opinion, then you only have half the cognitive power that you would otherwise have no one. Hopefully you find someone who's interestingly different from you, like not so different that you can't communicate and you have to be careful of that. But interestingly different. And then hopefully they have the ability and the will to express their opinion and then all, then it's, you know, then then your interest stays heightened and there has to be that tension in a relationship.

Speaker 2:          00:18:57       You know, people think, well I want to get along perfectly with my partner. It's like, no, you, you probably don't. You just get bored. And then you'd go looking for trouble. And so you want it a little bit of trouble in the relationship and a little bit of mystery and a little bit of combativeness and, and the ability to exchange opinions forthrightly and, and I trust her, which is a huge element. I mean, when, when we finally did decide to get together permanently, we're both in our later twenties. And you know, one of the things that I had learned by that point and insisted to her about was that we had to tell each other the truth and she took to that wholeheartedly, you know? And um, for better and for worse, because truths can be harsh.

Speaker 1:          00:19:49       Does that include like, does this, how fit?

Speaker 2:          00:19:54       Yeah. Well, the truthful answer to that is I don't answer questions that are likely to get me in trouble.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       Yeah. So I have a son who will answer honestly, and it's infuriating. But then I realized if you want the truth, talk to Tamworth telling you, well, that's the thing, you know, it's, it's useful to know truth is empowering truth. Tellers are charismatic and he never actually, both my sons are like brutally honest, which is disconcerting. Yeah. But it's, I can see that it has made them very formidable. And, and because of the people trust them and the friendships and just, it gives them a, and you've written a lot about that.

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       Well, you know, if, if I tell my wife that she looks good in that outfit, she knows that I mean it. Yeah. And so there's some utility. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:41       And then if you're silent and say, I don't answer questions that she, she goes and change, well sometimes sometimes know, she'll say,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       you know, do you like this? And I'll tell her that I don't, you know, and that doesn't necessarily make her happy in the moment, but, um, but if I do say, I like it, she knows that I mean in, and you know, I actually liked her sense of style a lot. So it turns out that 90% of the time it's pretty easy for me to say, look, I think you look great and mean it. And, uh, you know, she's a fairly harsh standard bearer to like, she's, she's insisted that I stay in whatever reasonable physical shape I happen to be in. You know, that was, that was something that she's very demanding of it. I would say that it's the same from my side and um, and we've been good at negotiating, which is, you know, what do you want from a partner? Fundamentally? What, what do you want need, I mean the first thing is, is that we'll hopefully you, like I said, you're blessed with the fact that you find each other attractive and I think it's very difficult for the relationship to begin or proceed or sustain itself without that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:50       But having that, then what do you want while you want someone that you can trust, do you want someone that you can build a view of the future with and you want someone that you can negotiate with? And that's very hard to negotiate with people because they have to tell you what they think. They have to know what they want or figure it out. They have to tell you what they want. They have to be satisfied when they get what they want, which is also a very difficult thing to manage. And you have to continually update that because your life goes through different stages and well in your attraction. Wayne's, as we all know at our stage of like not Badaliya necessarily player's health, but, but no, but you will go, I mean you will not be 25 forever, so, so that that has to be renegotiated.

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       Yeah, well then you have to work at that too. Right? You know, and, and that's something that people also don't understand because they tend to think that well that that all romantic interaction should be spontaneous. It's like, well, if that's your theory, then you might as well just give up right now if you're going to get married because that like the only reason you can think that is because you don't have enough responsibility to make romantic entanglement virtually impossible. And what happens when you're married, especially when you have little kids, is that, and you both have a job, let's say, is you're so busy that the probability that you're going to find time for spontaneous mutual interaction is decreases to zero. And so if that's what you're hoping for, then you're never going to have it. And so what you have to do is you have to make time for each other.

Speaker 2:          00:23:19       And you know, if you're dating, um, when you're establishing a relationship, while you put some effort into it, you know, you, you decide that you're going to go out for dinner and you dress up to some degree and you know, you try to present yourself to each other in some halfways mutually acceptable manner and you hope that there's going to be a positive consequence of that, that you're going to find each other attractive. But then as people somehow think that once they're married, that the same amount of effort isn't necessary. And that's wrong. I would say more effort is necessary on the same front and you have to think it through. It's like, you know, if you don't want to be bitter about the intimate element of your relationship, how much time do you have to spend together each week? And My, my rule of thumb, sort of derived from clinical observations is that you need to spend 90 minutes a week with your partner talking.

Speaker 2:          00:24:12       And that means you're telling each other about your life and staying in touch, you know, so that you each know what the other is up to and you're discussing what needs to be done to keep the household running smoothly. And you're laying out some mutually acceptable vision of how the next week or the next months are going to go together. Right. So that, that keeps your narratives locked together. Like, uh, like the strands in a rope, you need that for 90 minutes or you drift apart and you need to spend intimate time together at least once a week and probably more like twice. And that has to be negotiated. And if you don't negotiate it, and if you don't make it a priority, then it won't happen in all likelihood. And then, well, well then you don't have it. That's a catastrophe because there's not that many things in life that are, you know, intrinsically, what would you say?

Speaker 2:          00:25:00       Engaging in meaningful and pleasurable and also bonding, all of that. And if you let that go, then well part of you dies and part of the relationship dies. And while then there's always the possibility of becoming attracted by alternative entanglement, which, which you would do if you had any spirit left. Right? I mean that's the thing is if you're not, if you're, if your relationship at home is entirely unsatisfying sexually, what are you supposed to do with that? Nothing. He was supposed to just bear it. I mean, in one way the answer is yes because it's your marriage, but another way as well, what, that's all the fight you've got in you. You're going to just let the erotic element of your life die and accept everything that goes along with that because you're not willing to causing a bit of trouble to ensure that it's maintained. And you know, and we're not very good at thinking these things through consciously and it, I mean, people are bad at negotiating period. As far as I can tell, but they're particularly bad. It negotiating things that are deeply private. How much do you want your partner to know about you anyways, it takes a lot of trust to have a real conversation about what you need and want.

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       Now you have it in the press. People read that you are, uh, you have a following of young men. And I went to hear your lecture in Washington DC and there were a lot of women there and your book, I am, first of all, men don't buy books that often compared to women. So I'm presuming you have a lot of female readers. And I found it, Jay, Danielle, and I found it completely readable. And it wasn't a ribbon for men. No, it was one. So you have more like a delusional

Speaker 2:          00:26:45       desire on the part of the radical leftists that the only people that could possibly be attracted to me or angry men. Exactly. It'd be better if they were angry young white men, you know, because then that fits the narrative.

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       But you have a diverse audience, a diverse following, including many women. And they're also not particularly angry. I mean, I've talked to 200 fusing the anchor. That's the point of your book is stopping angry, stomping, resent.

Speaker 2:          00:27:09       All right, well, resentment is that that's absolutely crippling, right? Get resentment. Just zenman deceit, arrogance. That's part of, I'm writing another book and one of the rules is don't allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, deceitful, and arrogant or those two things together. But it could be red.

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       Right? Well, that's supposed to be a good thing. So yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:27:33       there's been 250,000 people, as I said, come to the lectures and there hasn't been a single negative incident.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       Not One. This is what I find fascinating is that I found you early on. I said I had no idea you were just that. It was like butch cassidy and the Sundance kid. Like who is that guy? Who is that guy? Like you were pretty good. And we were covering a lot of the same topics later on. Yeah. Wow. And then, you know, I found out who you were. What is astonishing to me is that there's this amazing, it just split between the positivity of your audience and diversity of your audience, the, the intellectual content of your message. And then you get with a snarky journalist with an agenda, and I'm not mentioning names, but this, no, maybe no, this, this young woman from Gq and it was just me on site and I'd say, and it was just like few lady. Gotcha. Gotcha. For, we didn't want to blame the BBC, it was two or a saint and then I, and she seemed, you know, like as often she seemed intelligent and capable of insight up to a point. But it's almost as if something gets seized her mind and show you something, had something happen. I think people enjoy the meal. Polyols it. Can you a Polya says that a whole generation, some of our most talented young women are incapable because of this idea. Maybe you mean, or just an openness to, she couldn't, and you were saying completely like interesting, fascinating, original things even to me who've studied these topics and wow. And

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       No, it was quite the day. So I went to Baltimore. You survived. It made me think a lot that day because I went there and I have to go out of my way to do it. Not that I'm complaining, but there's a reason for saying that, you know, so I go up there in Baltimore. Yeah, well I was talking in Baltimore. Oh, okay. So where's the aquarium? And I showed up to the, to the hotel room where this was all occurring. And you know what you expect, generally speaking, even from journalists who aren't, you know, who are more of the attack dog variety or who may be, aren't positively predisposed to ideologically or personally, you expect a certain modicum of professional politeness. Right. You know, because, well, you don't have to be there. And you came and you accepted an invitation and all of that. And so even with the channel for journalists, Kathy Newman, um, she was quite polite and, and forthcoming in the, in the green room before the interview.

Speaker 2:          00:30:18       So she would have had at least that professional persona, which is, it's not nothing right there. There's something to be said for, for going through the motions professionally in an inappropriate manner. But when I walked into the hotel room in Baltimore, it was obvious that this interviewer had already made up her mind about me 100% and that she was absolutely, you know, negatively predisposed to me with a personal animus. Animus is exactly the right word. And there was about a half an hour photography session because it was Gq. And so I was in that atmosphere. The photographers were fine. I was in that atmosphere for about 45 minutes before we started to talk. And part of the reason that I'm so, uh, I'm not as calm during that interview is I usually am, I'm a little bit harsher. And the reason for that is that, you know, it just started off instantly combative and, and what I, what I should have done, you see, it's very, very difficult to be awake enough to do these things properly and to end the interview progressed fine. Although by the end of it, I thought that I had maybe done enough interviews for a while because I didn't think I had regulated my temper as well during that interview as I might've, I was harsh. Good. Well for the first two minutes,

Speaker 3:          00:31:37       so you were getting at and then she brought up a question about anger and I just saw you kind of adjust and then after that it was smooth.

Speaker 2:          00:31:45       Well that's good because it was touch and go, you know, and I thought, boy, you know, maybe you're running out of patients, maybe you, you know, maybe it's time to dial back on the interviews because you know, I've had many interviews like that and they're very, I find them like, and it takes me like three days to weeks

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       and then you start thinking of yourself like what I should have said, I should have said that and I drive myself mad. No, but you did very well. But it's so interesting that what it told me was how parochial she was and she lives in her own little world and Stina isn't that more a little bit about the ideology of our time and Gosh, you encountered this everywhere. And when I used to write about this wisely, I would, I would encounter it. I mean, I think part of the issue is that you will acknowledge that there are differences between the sexes. That seems to be, I know that's a hell of a no, that's a heresy because when I was reading your book, um, there's nothing about it that is anti female affecting you. You do a lot of examination of the Adam and Eve story and you have this wonderful passage about like, um, Adam being the originally aggrieved man who

Speaker 5:          00:32:56       throws the woman under the bus. The original fault you made her. I'm hiding. That's really funny. So, so, so there's nothing in there

Speaker 3:          00:33:08       and, and the, the rules such as they are, you know, they seem very common sensical. They could apply to anyone. Um, so is that a fair surmise of why you get so attacked? Uh, that just the very fact that you're willing to speak about the sexes as being not unequal but different. Funny. Cool. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:33:32       Well, you know what, I would say that that's part of it because there's a threat there. So one of the things that happen when I was in Scandinavia, I just wrote a column about this actually, um, was interesting being in Scandinavia, especially in Sweden because they've pushed the equality of opportunity doctrine farther than any other country.

Speaker 3:          00:33:51       They invented it. It almost started there like in the UN and the original, you know, the charter, the Swedes were there and they, they've never given

Speaker 2:          00:33:59       no, no. And so, and the week that I was there was the same week that two articles were published on gender differences, um, in, in temperament and in interest. And the biggest sex differences that we know of that aren't morphological are in interest. So women are more interested in people by and large and men are more interested in things by and large. And the difference is actually large. It's one standard deviation. And so that means if you're a man, you would have to be more interested in people than 85% of men to be as interested as 50% of women. And if you're a woman, you'd have to be more interested in things than 85% of women to be as interested as the 50th percentile male. So the difference is actually quite substantial and it's certainly large enough to drive occupational choice differences, which is does it explains a lot about the configuration of people in the workplace? Absolutely. Well, and you know, we're approaching approaching parody in terms of workplace overall workplace distribution of men and women, but there's massive differences in occupational choice. Like it's very interesting, for example, to go to the website of the u s labor department and look at male and female dominated industries. And you know, there's the top 10 male dominated industries have basically zero women in them. People, brick layers like

Speaker 3:          00:35:28       people. There are people free zones according to Camille Paglia that you find you're just a lot of men in the people free zones. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And the women are in ask a group of women

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       and men, would you rather spend the next three weeks taking a part of machine and putting it together or helping a group of people work out their problems and the pool of people who want to do them. It's just far more men than women. There's more men and women dominated industries than there are women and men dominated industries at the extreme. So that's, would that be like nursing? Nursing is way more male nurses. The male nurses, I've studied these male nurses and they already, uh, you know, gender activists are upset because they earn more than women. And, uh, a professor of nursing at University of Pennsylvania tried to find out why and she found out they immediately find out what's the best paying field subfield. So they go into like nurse anesthesiology, it pays a lot more than men are there and disproportionate number. And they're willing to work and cry, you know, insane hours.

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       They're far more willing to move to a higher, same thing. Farrell phone with, with gender differences is that men are more willing to move. Maybe they're more willing. We're willing to call me yours. They're more willing to to uh, work outside. They're more willing to take on dangerous tasks. They're more likely to work in scalable industries. So we'd like, you can't scale personal care. It's really, it's very, very difficult. They're much less likely to work part time. If they have small businesses, they're much more likely to work full time in the small business rather than this than part time. And I mean women have the reasons to want to work part time and feral also pointed out that if you work 10% longer hours, you make 40% more money. A non linear nonlinear return on overtime had something that's really useful to know in terms of your career to an employer that have somewhat also marks you out.

Speaker 2:          00:37:18       You know, like if you have 10 employees and they're all doing a reasonable job, let's say, but one of them is working an extra half an hour a day or 45 minutes a day and you can observe that every day, then that gives them an edge with regards to potential promotion. And so, and the return on those edges is nonlinear. And so anyways, so I went to Scandinavia and it was the same week that two studies were released showing what had already been established beyond a shadow of a doubt that the personality differences between men and women and the differences in interest as well actually get bigger as your society gets richer and as it gets more egalitarian and, and not just a little bit either. That's the other thing that's so interesting is you might think, well the effect is it's the opposite of what the social constructionists would predict first of all. So that's the first thing to point out is it's not only that their hypothesis wasn't supported, it was decidedly refuted and, and none of them have come to terms with that. And, and, and it's not a small effect. The, the difference between personality between men and women in Scandinavia is a lot larger than it is in Noni. Galitary and contract can rural Botswana true in the United States. The richer the democratic your household demographic, your household, the more likely the woman to take

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       town timeout and be at home with the kid. Right? Because she can afford, she can afford to do it and she can afford to major in odd, you know, low paying fields like a, I don't know, feminists dance therapy

Speaker 2:          00:38:48       you use, you see to, one of the things that's also interesting I think is that, you know, there's this idea that mate, that marriage is a patriarchal institution, you know, that's primarily put there for the, for the utility of the, of the mail and think, well like I think that's complete bloody rubbish. And I don't think there's any evidence to support it at all. But I think the best counter evidence is that, well, if that's the case, then rich people shouldn't be getting married because they don't have to oppress themselves. But the truth of the matter is, is that the higher your demographic position, the more likely you are to be married. So marriage has fallen apart among,

Speaker 3:          00:39:23       you know, in the more likely the wife is staying home and not, I mean, she has all sorts of pursuits, but she's not well, there's an old saying, anyone, any woman who marries for money earns it. Um, but now let me just, okay. This is where you might get in a little trouble because in your book you call men order and women chaos and you say order, the known appears symbolically associated with masculinity and chaos. The Eternal Feminine is also the crushing force of sexual selection. Yeah. What's up with that? Yeah. We chaotic chaos. Men and women,

Speaker 2:          00:39:58       order and chaos. It's masculinity and femininity symbolically. And so what's happened fundamentally is that we're, our brains are wired for social cognition. So we're not natural scientists were natural sociologists. That might be a better, even though I shutter to think that that might be true, especially given the stage associates as well. That's it. Okay. Triggering or maybe rick or, or may him or maybe we're more, we're more naturally, uh, people who observe through the lens of fiction and that what we see as the world as characterized and the world, obviously it's made out of men and women and children and those seem to be our fundamental cognitive categories. Masculinity, femininity and, and, and, and then the category of children and those categories have expanded to take on connotations outside of, of pure person perception. And so, you know, it's for this reason that if you go to a movie and then maybe it's a Disney animated movie and I like to talk about those because they draw on a very deep symbolic, well it's perfectly reasonable to see a witch that lives in a swamp because those go together.

Speaker 2:          00:41:13       Like it makes sense. You know, the which doesn't live in a gleaming chrome high rise, you know, she lives in a swamp cause that's a maybe an a shock for her room. I think she could just fly up. Well that's it. That's where the high rise would be better for the brand. We can take off if you could take off better. But there are categories of, of symbolic association that are natural to the way we think. And the fundamental elements of those categories seem to be gendered. And so this is partly why I make reference to Taoism, for example. So for the Dow is the world is made out of chaos and order and chaos is the domain that you don't understand. And that emerges unpredictably but also the domain from which new forms emerge, right? Because it's from novelty that the new emerges. And I think the fundamental association between femininity, it chaos is the association between what's unexpected and novel and what's new.

Speaker 2:          00:42:06       Because new forms emerge from chaos. And it's not that chaos is, is bad in order is good. That that's, yeah, no, both have their pathologies. Both have their pathology. Yes. And, and, and what you're looking for, and this is, this is the book concentrates on above all, is that you're looking constantly to find the balance between those two. So, for example, formerly speaking, the domain of order is that place that you are with. What you're doing is producing the results that you want, who have produced. So imagine, imagine you think about the preconditions for not being anxious. Okay? So the preconditions are that you're constantly making predictions about what's going to happen next. And those predictions are tied tightly to your behavioral output. So you act in a certain way and you presume that a certain thing is going to happen. And if your actions produced the results that you desire, then you assume that you know where you are and you know what you're doing and that your plan is intact and that the environment is secure and that keeps your anxiety under control.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       That's order. And then you know, maybe you're at a party and you don't know anybody and you tell a joke and everybody looks at you like what you said was not only not funny, but also downright offensive. And then all of a sudden you've moved from the domain of order into the domain of chaos because you thought you were somewhere and you thought you were someone. And you thought you were with people that were of a certain type and you got all that wrong. And so it causes the guessing is going to be the woman who says, I find that really open. I'm not suggesting that it probably is, nevermind, but women are also more sensitive to negative emotion, right? So there is some slightly higher probability that that might be the case. But then I think women are also associated, at least in men's imaginations with nature, which is part of the chaotic domain say as opposed to culture because they're sexually selective.

Speaker 2:          00:44:04       So you gotta think what? What is nature? When we have that as a cognitive category, right? We think of the natural world, we think of nature versus culture. It's a fundamental opposition. What is nature? Well, nature is trees and landscapes and animals and all of that. But that isn't what nature fundamentally is. Nature fundamentally is that which selects from a genetic perspective, that's nature. That's the fundamental definition of nature. And it is the case that human females are sexually selective and it's, it's a major component of human behavior. So the, the evolutionary theory, roughly speaking, is that the reason we diverged from chimpanzees 8 million years ago, 7 million years ago, is at least in part because of the differences between sexual selectively between female humans and female chimpanzees. Female chimpanzees are more likely to have offspring from dominant males, but it's not because of their sexual selectivities.

Speaker 2:          00:45:08       So a female chimpanzee has periods of fertility that are marked by physical, uh, by observable physiological changes, not the case with human females. Human female ovulation is, is concealed. So that's a very profound biological difference between human females and chimpanzees. And the chimpanzee females will mate with any male, but the dominant males chased the subordinate males away. But human females are sexually selective. And so, and it's not a trivial fact. So you have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors. You think, well, how can that be? Well, imagine that on average, every single human female has had one child throughout the entire course of history, which is approximately correct by the way. Then imagine that half of the men had zero and the other half had to. Okay. And that's roughly the case. So half of males historically speaking, have been reproductive disasters. And the reason for that is because of female sexual subjectivity.

Speaker 2:          00:46:09       So it is actually the case that female humans are nature. It's not only that they're, that they're associated with nature symbolically as far as rep production is concerned. They are the force of nature that does the selection. And so their nature in the most fundamental way, and there is a chaotic element of that at least in relationship to men and also in relationship to women. Because a lot of the um, female on female competition is competition. That's chaotic for the right to be sexually selective, right? Not only with regards to men, which drives a lot of politicking but also in relationship to each other because part of what human females do, his jockey for position in the female dominance hierarchy for the top position, which is the woman who gets to be most sexually selective. And so that drives female female competition. And it's a different dynamic. There's, there's similarities between female female competition and male male competition. But there are also differences and they're pronounced. So men, for example, are, well, men are more likely to compete, compete for socioeconomic status. And that's partly because that drives female mate choice. So the correlation for men between socioeconomic status and sexual success is about 0.6. And for women it's zero, zero, in fact, it's actually slightly negative. So, and that's a huge difference. Men and women.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       But do you know that? Do you know the anthropologists? Sarah Hrdy, h, r, d y, and, and she's like my favorite feminist theorist, although she would say I'm a theorist who happens to be a feminist, but she studied primate behavior and she watched, she looked at the women very care. They're the females in not with walking very carefully and looked at it, uh, chimpanzees and gazelles and, and found that, um, the female initially like male primatologist would look and say, oh, the females, the males are dominant and the females are so cooperative. She looked more carefully. And so the females weren't exactly cooperative. Like they would pass around their infants, their baby, you know, whatever they were and would find it. And so the male primatology will say, oh, they're, they're so kind. And caring. She found out that when it was not your, it was not hers, they would take like little tufts of hair, you know, it would come out or they do something to the eyes, you and the baby would like be injured and she saw all this violence.

Speaker 2:          00:48:35       That would be true in her status. Differentiation. Yes. It's much more likely that it'll happen when a higher status female is taking care of lower status infant.

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       Exactly. And she said the great tragedy, well not tragedy, she had the reality of our species and in fact the subtitle for the book is that the woman who never evolved, we didn't evolve for niceness and cooperative. There's immense competition and we can, according to her, we are, it's indelibly marked in our nature to compete for the dominant males and no doubt about that. There's so,

Speaker 2:          00:49:13       and that seems to cross culturally as well. That does flatten out a little bit in the morning, Gail, the tarion societies. Yeah. So instead of being exaggerated, it does flatten to some degree. Right? So you could imagine that there's a biological component and the cultural component of course, both in, in, in that case, if you modify the cultural component then that seems to decrease the overall. So like, let me meet, be more clear about this. Women are less prone to mate up across an up status hierarchies in Scandinavia than they are in lessie Galitary and countries. But there are still prone to do it. So worldwide for example, women, young women find men who are about four years older than them maximumly attractive and they tend to mate across and up status hierarchies. And so one of the consequences of that, for example, is that as women have entered the workforce, they've have actually driven in equality because rich women will only marry rich men. Men rich as them or Richard. Whereas rich men will marry women who are poor than them, but women won't. And so what that means is it's another factor that's pooling wealth in the hands of fewer and fewer people.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       This is all its assorted of mating know and you just find someone with your background here. Whereas the doctor might have married his secretary.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       You now marries another doctor. Yep. Well, can I ask then stepping a little bit back from primates as well, how does this um, selection work in the era of swiping right

Speaker 1:          00:50:38       and unless

Speaker 2:          00:50:40       how, what is your reaction to the way young people did

Speaker 5:          00:50:44       today? Oh, that's a good, I was really hoping we'd get into that. I was really, you were very into the monkey so I didn't want to interrupt. No. Well I should close off to Scandinavia

Speaker 2:          00:50:54       discussion just by pointing out, and this is something that the scandinavians are already going to have to wrestle with, is that if you institute effective policies to promote equality of opportunity, which the Scandinavians have done, you're going to produce some equality. So like a 50 50 distribution of men and women in the workplace, but you're also going to exacerbate certain kinds of inequality and you can't get out of that. So you cannot have equality of opportunity and equality of outcome together. They don't work together. And equality of outcome, the essentially quality of outcome doctrine, which is often described with the code word equity, is that at every level of every occupation, the people have to be represented by the same number that they're represented in at the population. So if it's not 50 50 men and women at each in each occupation I need, and in each strata at each occupation, then that sort of prime of Fossi evidence for discrimination and for systemic discrimination, it's like, no, sorry, you have to factor in choice. And choice actually turns out to be a very important determinant. And as the society gets flatter and flatter, choice becomes a more important and more and more important determinant. And so you, so what that essentially means is that the most radical end of the left wing political agenda is logically impossible. Apart from the fact that it's impossible for a variety of other reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:52:17       And they should look at the data. I mean it, it's just a cliche now of in any group of activists and they'll say, oh well we need to, in order for women to achieve the quality, we need government funded daycare and we need, they have it in Sweden. Sweden has fewer women in managerial levels in American women are ahead. In fact now they have jen, oh they have quotas over there so they need a female ceos and females on boards and made any differences in bringing in member American women because we're so much further ahead. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:52:53       It's called no difference in the distribution of men and women lower in the herd. It's called the Nordic paradox and say you guys are so wonky. I want to get back. Okay. You all want to get back to, I want to get back to those monkeys. Well thinking

Speaker 2:          00:53:08       this morning about, I was talking to a variety of political types and we were talking about this morning. Yeah. In DC and hard to believe. Hard to believe. No I'm not. I'm not telling you. Okay. Bunch of Republicans here. And I've been talking to Democrats as well, but it was mostly Republicans here. And we were talking about abortion and um, I made a case that that's really not a very productive discussion because you're talking about a problem way too late in the sequence of problems. So, um, by the time the discussion starts to be about abortion, there's 50 problems that have already emerged that no one has addressed. And some of those problems are the fundamental problem is how human beings should regulate their sexual behavior. And that's a big problem. And you think, well, there's an interesting thing that's happening because you know, the people on the right would say, well, that's easy.

Speaker 2:          00:54:01       It's like don't sleep around and, and get married and have sex with your marital partner and that solve the problem. So there's strictures on sexual behavior and those would be the traditional ones. And what you see on the left is that there's this weird paradoxical demand, let's say, um, that people should be allowed to express their sexuality in any manner that they choose whenever they want, but that sex is so dangerous that it has to be carefully regulated at every single stage of the interaction. And so, you know, that many state legislatures have now followed the example of university campuses and put it in affirmative consent legislation so that every move you make towards physical intimacy has to be proceeded by the instantiation of a verbal contract. Essentially. It's like, well, can I take your hand? Yes, you actually hit, from what I understand, you actually have to say yes, like nodding is not sufficient.

Speaker 2:          00:55:03       And so, and so each stage has to be, has to be proceeded by affirmative consent and uh, you know, which, which, well, I won't, I won't say anything about, yeah, I will. It's absurd. It's absurd to assume that that's how human intimate relationships are supposed to proceed. And then you have complicated laws emerging that are part of that, that, for example, this is the case in California as I understand it, is that you cannot give affirmative consent if you're intoxicated. Okay. So you think about that, it's like, well what does that mean? It means that like a lot of sex is illegal. Been illegal for a long time, including marital, marital, yes. That's the one that's next to me on my honeymoon. Okay, well that is thinking it, it's, it seems, it seems to me, it seems to mean, and I'm, I'm, I'm not, no, I'm, it seems to me, to me in the California legislation that if you have sex with your wife or husband and either of you is intoxicated, then you're either one of you or both is guilty of rape. That's what it looks like to me. Actually, I was in a debate a few years ago at the University of Virginia Law School and I turned to my debate partner in his head. So if what you're saying is right,

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       um, two people can rate one another, right? She said yes. And I thought, Oh shit. I mean, how can that be? That's the question.

Speaker 2:          00:56:37       Well, okay, so then I would say, well it's interesting because I think that a lot of this confusion has emerged fundamentally as a consequence of the birth control pill. So you know, cause you got to think situationally before you think it theologically or psychologically it's like, it seems to me that the 20th century will be remembered for the hydrogen bomb, the transistor and the birth control pill. And those are unbelievably radical technological innovations and maybe the most,

Speaker 5:          00:57:06       yeah, but that's dependent on the transistor, you know, cause it spawned off with that. So that, that's

Speaker 2:          00:57:14       technological innovation that spawned all that. Of the three, I would say the, the birth control pill is probably the bigger hydrogen bomb. So, and because it, it changed the fundamental biological nature of women and men and because it gave women for the first time in biological history, the, the option of choosing their,

Speaker 5:          00:57:39       the status. And that's, that's abs. Well, yes and no. Like, yes, we like it, but it, it's not something that's come without a tremendous w h it's come with your mind, complexity. A fellow can anything reading? No, no, I haven't that, well I'm not, I'm not making it in your

Speaker 2:          00:58:00       case for the abolition of the birth control pill by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm pointing at its complexity. And so because one of the questions is, well, once you can regulate your reproductive function, what attitude should you have towards sex? And one answer might be the more of it under the more varied circumstances, the better because why not? And I would say that was actually part of the attitude that emerged in the aftermath of the birth control pill in the 1960s. Right. And it was, it was a reasonable response in some sense because it's such a cataclysmic change that you don't know what it implies. Well, what's the consequence of that? Well, first of all, people aren't reliable enough to use birth control in an entirely reliable manner. So even though it can work at near 100% efficiency, you have to take it extraordinarily regularly and in a disciplined manner for that to work.

Speaker 2:          00:58:54       And so, um, there was still the problem of unwanted pregnancy, let's say. And then there was the problem of the proliferation of sexual epidemics and that culminated in aids, which, you know, could have easily wiped all of us out but didn't. But there's other sexual epidemics that could have had the same effect. But we've, we've been fortunate enough to escape them. And, and then, and then more recently there's been this weird inversion, especially on the radical left that points to the reemergence of something like a set of sexual taboos. You know, like, I think the idea that sex is casual and that it's a form of entertainment is, I think it's an absolutely preposterous idea. I think that it's psychologically shallow beyond belief to hold that as a core, uh, proposition. Because it forces you to, first of all, if, if, if it's repetitive sex with multiple partners, it, it forces you to treat people as if they're interchangeable.

Speaker 2:          01:00:00       And I don't see how that's good for you psychologically or for the people that you're using interchangeably. Um, it, it implies that you can divorce sexuality from play, from the desire for more, for a relationship, from emotional fragility, from love, from family, from responsibility. All of those things that are part and parcel of every one. And I don't think you can, and I don't think people's experience indicates that you can, and especially on the emotional front. And I think that's partly what's driving. And there was also a residual sense that there's something about sex that's fundamentally dangerous and maybe it's dangerous emotionally and personally and maybe it's dangerous socially and psychologically, which most certainly is because it's a powerful force. And the way the left is reacting to that is by insisting that all forms of sexual behavior are valid and, and, and that it's reasonable to manifest all of them, but that it's simultaneously so dangerous that absolutely every aspect of it has to be state regulated and in an increasingly draconian form. And so I think what needs to happen is that the left and the right have to get together and have a, like a real discussion about what constitutes felid sexual morality. And that's the conversation you have to have way before you worry about solving. Like the abortion debate, which you know, is very divisive and very, and very intractable.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       Well, one of the things we talked about actually just last week on the podcast, does this cover story in the Atlantic about the sexual recession among young people that despite the advent of the birth control pill, abortion is, is going down. Um, uh, there's a, there's lexus, there's blessing is going down. Okay. And what have you looked into that worry about opinion on that?

Speaker 2:          01:01:49       Well, if you raise the cost of something, you'd decrease its prevalence. You know, and, and I think that it's, it seems to be, you know, dangerous nowadays. Well, I kind of think that it's also a reflection of the same thing that Bloomberg reported on just a few days ago. He said that across businesses, men are thinking, I'm not spending any time with a single woman that isn't, you know, associated with me in some formal manner like my wife, I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to mentor young women. I'm not going to be in a room alone with them. I know I couldn't face career

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       annihilation. And instantly they, they're frightened of

Speaker 3:          01:02:23       the young women. Now that was kate. Julian said that's part of it. But we can overexaggerate the part, I mean, anxiety and depression is going up amongst, uh, both young men and young women. A suicide is going up, um, that, that there's, it's not just a, you know, most people I think are not, we're talking about an elite demographic who is into the consent and political correctness and work with the, this is across the board and it's global. Um, it's in, it's happening even in Sweden, it's really happening in Japan and Japan.

Speaker 5:          01:02:56       Exactly. So, so, and that speaks to, and especially in Japan, they have, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:03:01       People, especially young men have given up on intimacy and having sex is actually, I mean, that had too much trouble. Sex robots. Right. Well, right, right, right. Well, hello question. Well, and there's pornography.

Speaker 5:          01:03:14       Yeah. There's pornography, basically zero risks when you allow for pornography.

Speaker 3:          01:03:19       Three the, that, that the men and women will sort of separate that from their actual cyclic. Like maybe we were seeing a whole, I guess, collapse of intimacy. Hmm. Let alone sex. And, and, and, and, and I don't think that's just explained by the political nature. Um, so I'd be interested in your thoughts.

Speaker 2:          01:03:39       Yeah. Well, I don't know that, I don't know the literature on the decline in sexual activity well enough to know if it's valid or reliable. But I mean, I think that, you know, in a stable society you take lots of things for granted. You take, you take the fact that men and women are going to be sexually attracted to one another for granted. And even though it's more fragile than it appears. No. And it's suppressed more easily than you might think. Um, and you take the idea that men and women are going to move together towards the establishment of longterm intimate relationships for granted. But that's partly because you don't understand what invisible preconditions exist to make that self evident, you know? And when those invisible preconditions are disrupted by rapid technological or sociological change, then things shift underneath you when you don't know why.

Speaker 3:          01:04:31       A lot of it is traced to the advent of the smartphone, especially in the generation z that, that kate was explaining this to us, that you could see it was broadband internet and the smartphone that led to this. You know, increasing fall off of relationships. Maybe the abstract is more interesting than right proximal.

Speaker 5:          01:04:51       Well you see that I just want to, I want to know the truth. Have you ever been with somebody who would have loved, if I'm fascinated and all that, but

Speaker 3:          01:04:58       you really wanted to get back to your smartphone. Has that ever happened? Yeah. Well it happens all the time.

Speaker 5:          01:05:04       No Tab is during our podcast. I tell you to put your phones. I know I'm climbing. I'm researching for the printers of the pot. Very addictive, very addictive. You know, I read the other day that

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       um, they're very laurie, they are kind of going together. The preferred method of interpersonal communication between young people know is texting rather than face to face communication. Right. And the swiping the apes. That's, that's, that's, that's a very interesting topic to the, the uh, like the tinder phenomenon. That's right. Cause that that's an also right. Major technological revolution. Because what it's done, I would say for the first time is reduce the cost of rejection. Two males, two zero, because it hides it. You're the only people you ever hear from our people who haven't rejected you, although, although they, true. But, but there was one man who had to make 300 he key actually tallied it. Yeah. You have to make 300 requests of swiping right or whatever one replies. So I think he had the sense of, sure, sure, sure. But it's massively attenuated and observer.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       You're not being humiliated. Not at all. Not at all. It's really, it's really at arm's length and you know, you can swipe very, very rapidly and so you can get all that rejection over within a very short period of time. It's like losing a video. Gamers or well last be worse. I mean not nearly as bad. Yeah. So, and you know, I, I, I don't know what, I mean, tinder also reduces the, one of the other things that, things that you want to think about with regards to sex, and I think this is probably particularly true for women, is that to what degree is it in women's interests to allow the cost of sex to fall to zero? Because with pornography certainly does that. And it just seems to me that that's not a very good long term strategy for relationships between men and women because whatever sex is worth, the cost of zero is the wrong price, and so that's, you know, oh, you heard of the bunny ranch and pay quite a bit for it.

Speaker 2:          01:07:04       Well true, true. That's true. But you, you know, you don't have to, no. You know, I've heard from a number of women what written read blog reports on their frustration with their attempts to be relatively sexually selective. Like let's say they decide that they're not going to sleep with their new partner on the first date. You know, they're frustrated by the fact that to the degree that they're being cautious in their sexual behavior, which I think is actually an admirable idea, that they're instantly out competed, especially if their partners are somewhat impulsive by women who will say yes at the drop of a hat. And so, well, again, I don't think you know what depends on what the goal is. That's the thing is that there's the short terms, there's short term sexual gratification, but the literature indicates that married couples, for example, or couples in a permanent long term, monogamous relationship or more sexually satisfied than single people, and maybe the single people have to be parsed out into those who were sexually successful and those who aren't.

Speaker 2:          01:08:09       But I suspect that wouldn't make that much difference. But whatever. There's utility of relatively immediate sexual gratification for whatever that's worth and the adventurousness that goes along with that. Let's say the hunt and the excitement of having a new partner and all of that, and maybe even the danger that's associated with that because people like to have a little bit of danger in their life. But what's the goal? It's like what do people want? And I mean there's a great book called a billion wicked thoughts that was written by Google engineers. And so it contains great psychology because Google engineers don't care about political correctness and they just write down what they find. They don't even notice that it's politically incorrect. Hence James Demora for example. And what they found was that women use pornography just as much as men, but the pornography that women use is verbal.

Speaker 2:          01:08:59       It's not even just stick. And the pornographic novels essentially follow the same extraordinarily standard plot line to the degree that publishing houses like Harlequin, which was going to say it's the, it's the bodice rippers that's right. Right. So in the Harlequin series, you have, you know, the ones that were published like in the 1970s, that are pretty tame. There's a small, big, or they're pretty hot actually. Well, there's a variety. They range from, they range from rep, weebly team to essentially to hardcore pornography. But the, but, uh, the plots are quite similar and the plot is, um, you know, young, relatively innocent woman finds powerful, interesting, dangerous male tames him and then they live happily ever after love. Yeah. Yeah. And it's the beauty and the beast plot, which is a fundamental

Speaker 1:          01:09:45       fuck, is search for women on porn hub. We discovered, we did an episode on Porn was, uh, for women it was getting rape. Wasn't that like the no lesbian aneurysm or at least that was your port. Yeah, that was your search on me. Oh, okay. I don't know. I don't know. I didn't like porn is going to the William Sonoma store. I know it is. It is female. All those pumps. Oh, the no longer philosopher, Bill Maher one said that men and women should never tell one another their fantasies because when are outraged by what we say and we're totally bored by what they say. And I thought like women have kind of these scenarios and you know, I don't know Unicorns, I don't know what they're doing. Storylines, storylines and men are just like, uh, I don't want to say this to you, but there's a lot of just close ups of female body parts.

Speaker 1:          01:10:35       Yeah. Well men are much more visually oriented sexually and, but now they're being shamed. I mean, now that it's called the male gaze and so there's all of this sick. Oh my God. The sports illustrated is exploiting the female it. Yeah. Baby men like it. And I, I'm, I'm worried that now sort of the way in the past, um, sexual sub, you know, gays were shamed. We're now reversing it in shaming like heterosexual. Yes. That's definitely, remember we had the young woman who complained about being whistled at and I said, don't worry, it stops. Yeah. Um, do we have a little bit of time for a couple more topics with you? Uh, because one of the

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       things that just coming out of this younger generation and you have a chapter of it in your book, which I wanted to finish what the line that we were pursuing with sexual behavior. The question is what's the end game? And this is what people have to ask themselves is like one of the corollaries to the female pornographic romance is actually the establishment of a longterm relationship. And the question is, you know, it's so funny cause I got pilloried in the New York Times, um, for, for talking about enforced monogamy, which is quite interesting because I talked to, again, that gets brought up like in every, it's so ridiculous. I talked to that woman for two, two days. I know. It was just like a little side comment. And then that became like the like, like enforced monogamy. You mean forced marriage or, no, I mean that was an anthropological term, which she knew perfectly well because she's a very smart person.

Speaker 2:          01:12:05       Um, and all it means is that there's a pronounced proclivity in human societies around the world to enforce monogamous relationships at multiple levels of the sociological hierarchy. You'd do it culturally do you do with an expectation you do it illegally, you know, an enforced monogamy. So my son was just married and if he came to me next year and he said, you know, hey dad, guess what, I've managed to have four affairs in the last year with hot women and my wife hasn't found out about any of them. I'm not going to pat them on the back and say, good job kid, you know, I'm going to say, what the hell is up with you? You know, you violated the vow that you took your putting your whole future, riskier, betraying yourself and your wife. Well that's enforced monogamy. You know, the, uh, the idea is that the social norm is the establishment of a long term monogamous relationship and that there are strictures put in place to support that.

Speaker 2:          01:12:56       But also to punish deviation from it. And you'd say, well, you know, maybe, maybe not so much on the punishment in, but you could, it depends. It's like what do you want? What, what is it that you want? You want a longterm stable relationship or not. And if that's the goal, then your behavior should be devoted to whatever it is that facilitates that goal. And I don't see that. I certainly don't see that casual and impulsive sex fits that bill now, not in the least. And all of the evidence with regards to living together shows that that's actually detrimental to the establishment of a longterm relationship. So first of all, common law marriage, people who are in common law marriage are much more likely to be be divorced. So that's the first thing. The second thing is people who live together before they get married are much more likely to be divorced after they get married.

Speaker 2:          01:13:43       So the idea that while you can try someone on for size and see how it works and then you're going to see if you're compatible, it's like that's one story. Another story is, well, how about you? And I lived together for a little while and you know, if you're, you're not so bad, but maybe I can find someone better. And if I do, you know, in the next year and a half or so because we're not hooked together in any formal way, I can just trade you in. It's okay, you can do the same to me. But I don't really see that as the sort of complimentary mutual interaction that leads to the formulation of long term trust. And I think it's a better story for interpreting what constitutes living together then. Well, you know, we're going to try each other out because that's what mature people would do. A store rental.

Speaker 2:          01:14:24       Yeah, well that's right. Wash the rental cars Reagan uses. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's, that's it. But what more, most importantly, the data indicate that it doesn't work is that you're more likely to get divorced, not less likely because maybe the right attitude is, well, you're probably about as flawed as me. And you know, we're lucky that we found each other. And so let's see if we can make a commitment because we're engaging in something that's very risky, you know, an intimate relationship and we're going to commit to each other and see if we can build something of value across time. And there's a definite a risk in that. But there's a compliment to your partner. It's like, well, I think you're worth making a sacrifice for. And what's the sacrifice? Well, it's everyone else. It's a big sacrifice and there's, and if you don't see that as a compliment, then I don't think you're thinking because not only is it a compliment, it's sort of like the ultimate compliment. And maybe you don't get to have a marriage that works without that compliment. Maybe it's so difficult to establish a longterm relationship that's functional that you have to make a walloping sacrifice very early on in the relationship in order for that to even be a possibility. And you know, maybe not because what the hell do we know about what binds people together? But, but it's not that easy to stay with someone for a long period of time. You know, it's, it's a real, it's a real commitment. It takes a tremendous amount of effort.

Speaker 3:          01:15:42       Yeah. But that actually you're bringing us back to the beginning and that your time with Tammy and um, one of the things about, I think, I'm going to guess this is a bit of an overlooked part in your chapter in your book, but I just was like one of my favorites. It was your book on modern parenting. No. Yes. And that was the goal and I thought I would get most trouble for, I know, but it reminded, it's don't read that far into the book. Well, well it, it, my mother, when I had my first child gave me a 1950s copy of doctor spock and he was considered so controversial and yet he's just like the most sensible person may new children very, very well was a pediatrician. And you, your rule for parenting is do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.

Speaker 3:          01:16:26       And you kind of in that one chapter, and it's not even one of your longest chapters, just did this wonderful sweeping overview of modern parenting and the problems. And in some ways that we're producing maybe some of these kids who are prolonging adulthood, prolonging the markers of adulthood, um, that, that you feel that parents, uh, you said you see today's parents is terrified by their children. Not least because they've denied credit for their role as benevolent and necessary agents of discipline, order and conventionality. And then you told some hilarious stories about when your wife ran a daycare center out of your house and you would, you would get into test of wills with some of the two year olds. But the tough man [inaudible] son is ordinary. I'm glad to hear he got married to Greg.

Speaker 2:          01:17:16       He still doesn't want to do anything he doesn't want to do. Yes, very charming and very emotionally stable. So it's like he's easy to get along with, but trying to get him to do something he doesn't want to do. It's like he had my wife defeated when he was nine months old and she's tough. Like, seriously, she, she's no pushover, but he would just sit there with his mouth closed and glare at her. It's like I'm not eating out and I can take more than you can dish out. It was really something to see, you know, to see that kind of force of will and someone not small.

Speaker 3:          01:17:44       Let's talk a little bit about that. And just the modern roles between men and women. I mean we're less, you know, you don't really, you're not really supposed to distinguish between fathers and mothers even though that seems to inevitably happen in most [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:17:59       Well it happens in large part because the children differentiate between them. Like parents are under the delusion that most of what you do with your children is driven by what you want to do with your children when in fact it's driven to a massive degree by what your children want you to do with them. And so there were studies done 30 years ago on feminist parents who decided that they were going to raise their children in non gender differentiated manners. And when they were studied they found that the parents who had that explicit philosophy, we're just as gender differentiated with their children as the parents who didn't have with the philosophy. And the reason for that is that if you're a parent that has any sense at all, you don't re respond to your children as a rigid idiot log. You respond to them as whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          01:18:43       The child man manifests himself, him or herself as like, you know, with any individualized relationship, you take your cue from the person and you might think, well a child has no intrinsic nature. But you know, if you think that you either don't have children or you've never seen a child or you're so blinded by your radiology that you don't have a child, you just have a blank projection screen onto which you project your presuppositions and then heaven help your child. You know? Um, so, so a lot of the gender differentiation is actually driven by the children's demands and that's all for the good. That chapter, I thought I would get into tremendous trouble for writing that chapter because it's contentious right on the surface just to the rule because the rule first implies the children can be dislikable and then I would say again, you know, like have you met children?

Speaker 2:          01:19:33       Exactly. We have a very child where their children, you didn't like obviously, and so lots of children or dislikable, but it's taboo to admit that because they're all sweetness and light and innocence ever since Rousseau. But you know, we so put all five of his children in an orphanage where they all died. So maybe we won't. So we won't talk too much about Rousseau. And um, and then the next taboo is, well, that parents can dislike their children, right? But if you're a clinician and you don't think that parents can dislike their children, then well then, well then you're not a clinician because one of the things you constantly see is that pathology within families is an incredibly con common source of psychological destabilization, right? And it's terrible tension between parents and their children in between siblings. What I suggest in the, in the book, which I think is radical by today's standards, is that your fundamental job as a parent is to ensure that by the time your child is four years old, that they are maximally desirable to other children and to adults. Because what happens is that after the age of four, you aren't the primary agent of socialization. The social world becomes the primary agent of socialization and if your child is the sort of child that's invited to play by other children because your child is capable of for stolen gratification and taking turns and playing someone else's game when, when it's necessary and abiding by the rules and not having a temper tantrum when they lose and not getting to, you know, high on their horse when they win, then many children, we'll invite them. Sorry.

Speaker 5:          01:21:17       Oh wait, wait. I don't know what you mean. Just say it. What do you want me to know? I, I know we have, we have our limited time and so I just wanted to, I was actually saying

Speaker 2:          01:21:27       any more.

Speaker 5:          01:21:29       This is great. I was selfish of me because I really wanted to hear you talking about, I know. I just want to let them all take 15 seconds to wrap that up and then stop. Please. Well. So look,

Speaker 2:          01:21:39       you get married when you have your children and you're flawed and your partner's flawed and hopefully you're flawed and different ways. And so you put the two of you together and you make one approximately normal person and then hopefully, and then your child has to interact with that dyad. That is a reasonable representative of social norms. And if they disappear, if your child disappoints you with their behavior, the probability that they will disappoint other people is very high. And so you have an ethical obligation to ensure that your child is behaving in a manner that makes them optimally desirable to their playmates and also to other adults. Because then the kids invite them to play and they get to be socialized, right? They get, they have friends for God's sake. It's like, what do you want for your kids? How about some friends? Wouldn't that be nice?

Speaker 2:          01:22:31       And maybe what you'd like is that they regulate their behavior well enough so that when you take them places, restaurants to see your friends, to see your relatives, they behave in a manner that's sufficiently civilized. So their intrinsic charm wins over the adults and everywhere they go, people are smiling and welcoming instead of wishing with fake smiles that the damn Bruh would leave along with their foolish parents, which is not a good, that's not a good environment to have your child constantly exposed to no friends because they're too selfish and immature and irritated era irritating to adults so that they're barely tolerated under the mask of false smiles. It's like you have an ethical obligation to regulate your child's behavior so that they're optimally acceptable socially. And that is not how people look at children in the modern world. They think, well you raising their self esteem or you're enhancing their creativity or you don't want to put constraints on their behavior because you're going to interfere with the flowering of their intrinsic self. And you know, it's all Bruce Soliah nonsense and, and, and, and there's no evidence that's rice. Yeah. Father, yeah, he was straight

Speaker 1:          01:23:42       am such a corrupt and he had these babies with this poor scullery maid and left them all in a actually a place where they would just languish and die.

Speaker 2:          01:23:52       Yeah. Right. Five of them. Rousseau. Yeah, no, I know. Yeah, exactly. Oh, and Ben. Ben Is intrinsically good.

Speaker 5:          01:23:59       Yeah. What external? Sean, Sean,

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       a few weeks ago I was reading about you in and somehow I got onto somebody's twitter feed whom I will not mention because, oh my God. But anyway, a difficult person and she was attacking you and had a, a selection from your book a bit where you had called two-year-olds little monsters. And so suddenly all of these distraught twitter followers of this feminist we're saying, ah, called the monster.

Speaker 5:          01:24:33       Yeah. Little monsters and nobody, and then occasionally there'd be a parent

Speaker 1:          01:24:37       who would take, they kind of two year olds kind of our monsters, you know, and then there'd be eh, and they can kind of art and they had taken this out of context and shown it like just something to deplore in a bit. And it was so amusing to me this little,

Speaker 2:          01:24:52       hopefully they will soon be cursed with some too.

Speaker 5:          01:24:58       I won't tell say which one was two years old. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:25:00       Had, he was a good boy, but he had an insane meltdown in a supermarket. I was with my mother. We both pretended we didn't know.

Speaker 5:          01:25:07       No, I don't want to be the parent. Oh yeah. Watch. And we heard people say, oh my God, look at that. A child watching a two year old having a Tantrum is, it's so terrifying. I didn't want to be associated with you. The

Speaker 2:          01:25:21       boy who used to be like, when my wife was taken care of more kids than ours, there was a little boy who, who, who had learned to throw a pretty decent town and uh, and he would do that and it didn't work in our house because we just leave him, have his tantrum and going into to a different room and then he'd kind of wake up out of it. There wouldn't be anybody around. And so that, like if you put all that words audience, dramatic display and you have zero audios, it's not, you're not going to sustain it anyways. He could actually turn, hold his breath until he turned blue. So you should try that. You go home and see if you could do that in front of the mirror man. Like it's hard. It's very, very good. You have to hire it will you do.

Speaker 2:          01:25:57       It was impressive. It was. And you know, two year olds are very impressive. They're there, they have unbelievable of rage and dis-inhibited emotion. And your job is, you know, they're, they're driven by these underlying motivational systems that are unbelievably powerful. And it's part of what makes them delightful because when they're happy, they're insanely happy. And when they're playful, they're incredibly playful. And so the positive end of them is, is way exaggerated compared to, you know, a rather drab adult. And, and so it makes two year olds extraordinarily interesting. But the same is true on the negative emotion side. They're completely dysregulated and it's really hard on them. Like to have a two year old who isn't in control of their emotions means that you have a child who's developing central personality, you know, their, their ego, for lack of a better word, is constantly being swamped by these powerful underlying emotional systems.

Speaker 2:          01:26:48       You know what it's like if you are enraged for any period of time or if you're engulfed by grief, like it's exhausting. It's, it's, it's demeaning and it's exhausting. And it's the same with a little kid. It's like it's a real defeat for the developing integrated individual to be subjugated by those catastrophic, powerful emergency motions. And part of your job as a parent is to scaffold the part of the child that can regulate and inhibit those powerful underlying systems. So with my son, for example, when he used to misbehave, I would count, let's say you're going to go sit on the steps. He'd say, oh no I'm not. I say, Oh yes you are. And then usually I'd have to chase him around because he wouldn't go sit on the steps. And so I put him on the steps. Say you're going to sit there until you've got yourself under control.

Speaker 2:          01:27:36       And so he'd say, no, I not say yes you are. And then he tried to get up and I just told them, say you're going to sit there, I'm going to hold you until you sit there. No, I'm not. It's like I could out wait a two year old. So I usually won those battles and then he'd sit there and I say, look kid, this is the deal. Let's say two things, like you want to have a bad day or you want to have a good day, you think about that because if you want to have a good day, no, you can just have a better idea. If you want to have a bad day, we could have a bad days. You sit here and as soon as you can control yourself and you're ready to be civilized than you can come back and we can have a good day. So He'd sit there just, just, it was unbelievable to watch.

Speaker 2:          01:28:14       Just the developed with rage, you know, just trying to get himself under control, you know? And so I'd come back 30 seconds later and I'd say, you know, but it's got yourself, got your act together yet. No, no. I wait. And usually it took them two or three minutes and he'd calm down and then he'd come back out and you'd say, I'm ready to have a good day. And he meant it, you know? And I can tell he meant it too, because whatever resentment I was harboring towards him for his misbehavior. And you have to watch that when you're an adult would vanish because he'd come and he'd, he was done. He was ready, just, you know, to proceed on a civilized basis. And it was really interesting to watch that because it took him every time he sat on the steps, it took them a shorter and shorter period of time to attain mastery. Right. Until, you know, it got to the point where he could only have to sit for 15 seconds or so when he would bring himself under control. And that was a victory. Like you, if you imagine the neurological systems develop that are responsible for personality integration, it was a victory for those systems because they were attaining the ability to regulate the lower order, spontaneous emotions and you know, and, and he, he turned into an individual who's capable of a tremendous level of self control and you know, when he had

Speaker 5:          01:29:32       large gaming with, yes, absolutely. And, and while it didn't turned out well for my daughter to be,

Speaker 2:          01:29:38       cause she ended up being very ill and he ended up being extraordinarily levelheaded, dead reliable, and thank God for that.

Speaker 5:          01:29:45       Could you, could you come to my house and do that for my little multiple izzy? Because I can't, I can't, I can't eat. I can't train her. She's like a woman and ice. The next book a dog. I would love to have rules on how to train your dog. You like cats. What? I, that's the one role I objected to like what's with petting the cat. I wrote about dogs for two pages to begin with, just to satisfy the dog that didn't satisfy. They're not, they got a score. You can't satisfy them. No. Right. Well, we can't thank you enough for coming here. Um, I know the Aei audience is just so delighted to have had the chance to hear you. Well. I'm really personally got the chance to talk. I've only met you once. We met in DC, but I've just seen you pass the electronics. Yes. Yes. Oh, you've swiped past. Oh yeah. Well, there was that. We're not going into that. Okay. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you Jordan.
