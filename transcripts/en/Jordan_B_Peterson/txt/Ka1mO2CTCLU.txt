Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Tell her where everyone. Hello everyone. Where do we go? Good to see all of you. So first question, well, I guess I could catch you up on what's been happening first in case you were vaguely interested, most of you probably know or some of you know anyways, about what happened at Wilfrid laurier university this week or two weeks ago, a teaching assistant named Lindsay Shepherd was interrogated, I would say, by the typical suspects, the kind of postmodern, Neo Marxist that I've been talking about, holder into an inquisition and,

Speaker 2:          00:01:09       um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       proceeded to rape her over the coals for having the goal to show a video that featured me about a year ago on our Canadian TV show called the agenda.

Speaker 2:          00:01:23       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       they accused her of violating the criminal code essentially, and the Canadian human rights code,

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       under the provisions of Bill [inaudible], which was the bill I warned about last year and accused her of transphobia and making an unsafe environment. And then they accused me of being Hitler, which was really quite interesting because I've never been accused about being Hitler. So I modified my kermit puppet here. Um, which, see, you can probably see that I guess, and I've done a response video which I'm going to launch pretty soon. So this is a Hitler, the frog and the spokes frog by the way. And He, uh, well this is what we've come to.

Speaker 2:          00:02:14       So.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       All right, let's answer some questions. I'm going to start with Pigeonhole, which, uh, is the site that allows people to vote on questions. And so the top voted question is, how do you identify, how do you justify a rejection of identity arianism when a pillar of the neo marxists strategy is to demographically replaced the indigenous people of Europe? London, it's less than half ethnically English. Um, okay. So let's take that question apart. First of all, it isn't self evident to me that it is specifically a neo Marxist strategy to demographically replaced the indigenous peoples of Europe. And um, I don't think that's the strategy anyways, even if that's the outcome because you have to distinguish strategy and outcome. Um, the strategy and principle is to bring in immigrants to balance out the declining birthrate. Now I'm not saying I agree with that, I'm just saying that that's what the strategy is a and then the next part of the question is predicated on the assumption that identity Arianism is necessarily the answer to the problem of the problem that's being identified, which is characterized as excess immigration.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       First of all, we'd have to figure out exactly what identitarianism means because it isn't clear if it means radical, right wing ethnic nationalism. I don't think that that's going to be particularly constructive if it means having a sensible discussion about what the appropriate limits might be on immigration, uh, and to think about that over the long run and also to have a serious discussion about the degree to which say Islam and the West, the values of Islam and the West are actually commensurate. Then that has to be obviously has to be done. But I'm so I'm afraid that to answer that question, I'd have to know more about exactly how these terms were being were being defined. Especially with regards to identitarianism because it's a vague word. And so that's all I can do with that. I lose my ability to think straight or intelligently in confrontational or unfriendly social situations.

Speaker 1:          00:04:34       Any suggestions for adoptation or improvement? Well, a couple. I suppose. One is that when you get nervous in this kind of situation that you're describing, what often happens to people is they start paying attention to themselves. They get self conscious so you know, let's say I got self conscious all of a sudden during this q and a. What would happen is that I'd start paying attention to the questions and the screen and what I'm doing and I'd start paying attention to how I was feeling and to the nervousness and then I'd start to get aware that I was not responding properly and that would make me more nervous and then I would get more aware of that and that can just shut me down entirely. And that's happened to me now and then in a lecture and sometimes almost happened when I was talking to Sam Harris the first time.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       I'm all right. I paused for a long time and then became aware of the pause and then anyways, what you have to do in a situation like that is it's not so much that you have to stop attending to yourself because if you start thinking, I should stop attending to myself, then you'll just think about yourself more. What you have to do instead is pay more attention to the situation and to the people that you're talking to. So you have to increase the degree to which you're at attending outwardly and that'll stop you from attending inwardly. Um, that's a very effective technique. You can practice that. Generally speaking, every time you get nervous, start paying more attention and that'll, that'll, that'll help you out a lot. Um, the, a really good suggestion for social anxiety in general is that if you see most people, but not everyone, but most people have enough implicit social skill because they were reasonably socialized when they were children so that they do know how to act in social situations, but they get anxious and then that interferes with them implementing what they know.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       Just like if you're a pianist and you get anxious and self conscious while you're playing, you'll forget what you know because while you've activated a different part of your brain, if you can remember to pay attention and you can direct your attention outward and you attend hard enough, then what will happen and try to put the other person at ease and try to ask them questions. Then that'll kick in the automatic because you're paying attention to what the person is doing into their facial expressions and all of that. That will clue in the automatic and implicit knowledge that you have and make things much more smooth and, and uh, and anxiety free. So attention really attention really plays a huge role in regulating anxiety.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       I would. Lauren asks, I would love to hear you do a lecture series on raising children properly. Is that something you would consider? Well, in my new book, I've written a chapter on that called don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them. And I've laid out a bunch of, uh, I've laid out a philosophy of care and discipline that's predicated partly on a French philosophical legal notion, which is do not multiply rules beyond necessity. It's sort of like a legal equivalent to [inaudible] razor and an English common law principle is which is used minimal necessary force. And I think the Union of those two, which is don't have too many rules, but make sure that you properly enforced the ones that you do have is a good start for how you might consider your attitude with regards to raising children. The other thing you have to figure out is exactly what's your aim.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       And you know, one of the aims that people have had most recently pushed by clueless psychologists, I would say, is that you want children to have high self esteem and a, that's actually a large part trait neuroticism anyways, but it can be modified to some degree. Jerome Kagan has done some very interesting work on that. But, um, the best thing to do, the, I think, the best thing to orient yourself towards with regards to children is that you're trying to make your child your children or help your children to be delightful in the eyes of others. And so that means they have to be reasonably well socialized. And that really takes place between the ages of two and four because what you want for your children is that when they go out into public, when they're away from you or even with you for that matter, what you want for your children is for other people to genuinely like them. Because if they behave reasonably and they attend properly to adults and they know how to play with other children, then wherever they go, they're going to be,

Speaker 3:          00:09:33       um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       unless they encounter someone truly malevolent, they're going to be welcomed with smiles and open arms. And that's not going to be fake because almost every human being actually likes children if they're reasonably behaved. And so your job is to make your children highly socially desirable because that opens up the world to them. So they're, that's not a lecture series, but it's a little lecture looking at myself, honestly, John says, I'm deeply envious and resentful of others happiness. How do I turn this around? Well, John, I would say you've started to turn it on around already because you have at least come to the conclusion that you're deeply envious and resentful of others happiness. So you do have the damn problem diagnosed. So one of the things you might do is figure out what you would like instead. Like how would you like to feel about the world, you know, because you're implying that being deeply envious and resentful isn't for the best.

Speaker 1:          00:10:34       So let's assume that you would rather be pleased about other people's successes and not envious. Well, you know, the first thing you might think is, well maybe you have to do some writing or at least some thinking. It's like maybe the alternative would be happy, be happy about other's success and happiness. Well maybe you should start by thinking about why you might be happy about their happiness. It's not like happiness is a zero sum game, you know, it's not like, it's not an, I believe me, I'm taking your question seriously and I think that what you're saying characterize is plenty of people and I think that you're being deeply honest, noticing it, happiness isn't a zero sum game, you know, lots of people can be happy at the same time. And do you really want to live in a world where other people are less happy in what possible manner without be useful and good for you in the medium to longterm? It might make you feel, you know, grudgingly,

Speaker 3:          00:11:34       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       satisfied, you know, in a dark way temporarily, but it's not a very good long term strategy. So I would say you got to think it through, you know, what, how is it that you would like to view the world? How do you think that would be best for you? I mean as if you were taking care of yourself, like you, like you're someone who deserves to be taken care of. Think about how you'd like to have the world, how he'd like to view the world. And one of the ways you can do that too is to think about some people that you admire and try to figure out how they look at the world or even ask them, you know, because maybe then you can find out what it is about your thought patterns that are driving you down this dark road. So

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       why are you now Francoise St Onge asks, why are you hiding the amount you receive from Patriot? And I found it very motivating to see the amount skyrocket and tell cloud to be part of this as if you were an artist. I now feel more like I'm buying a product and I find it less appealing. Yeah. Well it's one of those things where I'm kind of damned if I do and damned if I don't, you know, and I don't know what's correct. I guess I probably got tired of the sort of more left leaning, let's say radical left leaning press people jumping up and down on me every chance they got because people were donating money for, for services that I particularly rent, you know, that I render essentially for free. Um, you know, I, I, there must have been 10 articles in the last week following the Lindsay shepherd a incident pointing out that I'm somehow being manipulative and, and, uh, evil in a capitalist sort of way for daring to allow people to donate money to help support what I'm doing and it gets kind of tiring. And so I don't know, I just. And I guess I also thought that maybe there's a part of it, it's like, well, I wouldn't exactly call it bragging, but because it's not, but

Speaker 1:          00:13:45       ah, that's about good enough. I mean, it was an appeal to privacy I suppose in part two. I don't know if it's the right thing. I could do a poll on twitter and find out. I guess I did that first of other things this week. So anyways, that's, that's the answer to that user in. Okay. Says I love you man. Keep it up. Well, that's a pretty good question and uh, I'm trying to keep it up. I'm actually feeling quite a bit better. I was actually happy today and it's been so rare for the last while that I could hardly even recognize what it felt like so, but I'm definitely feeling better. I'm getting some energy in the morning and so I'm, I'm really happy about that. So thanks. Anyways, I appreciate it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:30       Thoughts on the radical left and they're superficial view, belief and value on the environment. How has this influenced by their own raw emotions? Inviting, questionable, immoral, and dangerous actions despite good intentions? Well, I don't really buy the whole good intentions thing. I mean, I think that it's really hard to have good intentions. Like John, the question are just answered. Uh, you know, John said, looking at myself honestly, I'm deeply envious and resentful of others happiness. Well, if you listen to the Lindsay shepherd recording at Wilfrid laurier university and you listen to the professors and the administrators, I think that it's, uh, it's, it's absurd to start with the presupposition that they have good intentions. I don't think they have good intentions at all. So, um, but you know, we could give the devil his due and say that there are people on the left end of the spectrum, like, like there are all parts of the spectrum who are, are trying to do good things, but having good intentions and figuring out how to do well in the world are our good intentions are only the beginning and people are always influenced by raw emotions and fuzzy thinking and it's hard to think critically and it's hard to plan strategically and it's hard to, to intervene in the world in a way that doesn't cause trouble, which is partly why I recommend to people that they start local.

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       You know, you can't even trust your own good intentions to some degree because you have to test out what you do when you have good intentions and see if it actually produces the result that's intended. But I wouldn't make the case to begin with that, especially on the radical end of the left. I think it's unbelievably motivated by resentment. So

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       how does one save a marriage when it seems that there is no longer attraction both physically and intellectually? There are kids involved, which is the main reason for wanting to save the marriage. Huh? Well, alright. I know a couple of things about that. I mean the first thing I would say is that if you haven't had any intimate interaction with one another for quite a long period of time, that can put both people into a stagnant state where desire starts to slip away. What what sex therapists recommend under such conditions is to, well essentially start in some ways, start dating again so you could ask your partner to go out to a movie or something like that and you know, maybe when you come home you could, you could neck for a little while, like teenagers. That's probably a word no one uses anymore, but kinda pull back and you got to agree.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       Say not to engage in full sexual activity for a while, but to tease each other and to play a bit. Even if you're not attracted, you have to act. Acted out for awhile and hopefully you can get the motor running again. The other thing I would say is that you guys might want to sit down and make a joint plan. It's like what a marriage is like a story that two people are acting out simultaneously and you have to have shared goals and because you're both rowing the same boat, let's say if you don't have a destination in mind, then, well, maybe you're rowing in circles or maybe you're just standing still. So I would say work hard to put some romance back in the relationship, you know, you could say to each other, look, let's try this for six months and just see how it goes. We'll have two dates a week for the first month. We won't have any sex, but we'll play around and then, you know, we'll see how that goes and, and, but we'll try it out for the, for, for the whole, for the whole six months. There are reasons to save a marriage. I mean, it's hard on kids. Divorce is really hard on kids and it's hard on the adults involved too. Um, so I would say

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       you have to negotiate an agreement and you, you know, you could try the future authoring program, both of you, what, what I would recommend for example, is that you each do the future authoring program separately. So that's that self authoring dotcom because then you both have a life plan and then you could sit down and read each other's future authoring plans and see if you have some things in common and then see if you can figure out how to support each other with regards to each of you obtaining what you want. So Paul Maloney asks, you edited out a disagreement with Camille Paglia. What was it? No, no, that's not the case. There was a piece edited out, but it wasn't because there was a disagreement, it was because there was some glitch in the video or something like that. Generally speaking, and you know, I can't say this with absolute certainty, but I do. And so does my crew do everything we possibly can to leave the videos alone except for getting rid of things that would be of no interest to anyone that are mistakes. So there was no disagreement. Are you interested in coming to Australia? Yes. I've been invited a couple of times but it hasn't worked out yet. But um, my book will be published in Australia I think sometime in January as well. And uh, I imagined that all becoming there at some point in order to talk about my book and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       Tray says, how can a person go through the future authoring process of imagining a future for yourself as though you or someone you care about when you barely don't care about yourself or even hate yourself? Yeah, well I would say that go through the exercise anyways and act as like try to extend to yourself some courtesy. You know, sometimes you have to act something out before you can start to believe it. And so I would say sit down and pretend that you're your friend, you know, trade the probability that there's something so wrong with you that you don't deserve any regard whatsoever is zero, you know, so, and I would say if, if you just can't get it together, you know, maybe you were depressed and maybe you need to go talk to someone because you don't have to be depressed. You talked to a physician, you know, there are treatments for depression if you happen to be depressed and if you actually hate yourself, then it's a possibility that that's what's going on. I don't know how old you are, but you know, there are effective treatments for that sort of thing. You might want to find out if there's actually something wrong physically or, or psychophysiological. He, you know, because you don't have to trudge through life absolutely miserable. Their antidepressants, for example, work really well for some people. Not for everyone but for some people. So. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       Were the Nazis left wing?

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       Um, that's a good question. It depends. See the problem with any question that says is a, B is a equivalent to be, is that it depends on how you define a and B. Right? And I'm not trying to weasel out of the question. I'm, I'm very, very serious about that. The Nazis regarded themselves as national socialists, you know, so they, they, they weren't free market capitalists, let's say. So they certainly weren't right wingers in the way that free market capitalists are right wingers, even though they're probably more centrist, um, they differed from the international socialists, which were the Marxists because they were much more concerned with national identity and racial identity. And to the degree that you regard nationalism and racial identity as primarily right wing views than the Nazis would have been right wing. So let's say that they, maybe they pulled from the worst of both extreme, something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       But I do think it's reasonable to note that there extreme nationalism and ethnocentrism and racial identity probably has more in common with the radical right than it does with the radical left, which tends to be utopian universal. So I'm one of the things I thought would be an interesting research project would be to take like 100 Nazi policies and to turn them into a questionnaire and asked people either how much they agree with them after I figured out whether they were left to right wing to begin with or whether they thought the policies were representative of the left or the right because that could be studied empirically and I don't think anyone's done it. But that would be a very interesting, uh, that would be a very interesting research project is left for Helgason probably Matt, Matt massacred that name, says who has a higher Iq at really gifted mathematician or a really gifted painter.

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       Very difficult to say. Um, but I would say that gifted math, because if they're both gifted, they both have high Iq. So you can be certain that it's very difficult to do anything that's truly gifted, say above the average, above the norm without being, without having a very high Iq. And in a creative realm. I mean, you hear about these idiot savant who have like one area of extreme expertise, but generally in those cases it's not so much that they have one area of extreme expertise, it's that they have one area of above average expertise that really contrast with the rest of their impairments, but they rarely if ever make it into the, you know, the very short list of true geniuses. Mathematicians are kind of an odd bunch though because you. They peek really, really early. Like if you're going to be a mathematician and truly gifted, then you're going to show signs of that when you're like 17 to 20, something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       Whereas painters can, can be creative through their entire lifespan. I would say probably on average, I would guess this is a guest that if you took 100 really gifted mathematicians in 100 really gifted painters, that the mathematicians would have far higher nonverbal Iq, but the painter's might have higher verbal Iq. So that also complicates things. See with Iq also, you know there's. There's this factor called the g factor, which is the central element of intelligence and it seems to be associated with such things as head size and brain size relative to body and neural conduction speed and simple reaction time, like really basic physiological markers, um, and it's a pretty tight single factors say as opposed to the personality dimension d domain where there's five quite clear factors, but I think it was earl hunts research indicated that as people get smarter and smarter, the variability between the subsets of their intelligence starts to increase. So it's sort of like there's a lot of ways to be really smart, but there's only one way to be not very smart. So that's another little tidbit of information with regards to ICU. So hello doctor, I am a 23 year old male with paranoid schizophrenia. However, I feel like controlling 95 percent of it. Okay. So let's say I think you mean that you're controlling 95 percent of it. I decided to seek a partner, but I am afraid how to reveal it. Any advice on how to approach it? Oh God. Steven, that's a really hard question.

Speaker 1:          00:26:24       Well, look, you're not under any obligation when you first meet someone to drown them in information about your identity. So I would say

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       the devil's in the details. Fundamentally, if you have a relationship with someone and it's progressing and you're being honest, my suspicions are that it will come up with its own accord. You know, that you'll be able to tell in this situation when the right way to introduce it is, um, you know, if, if you're asking me this because you've been in a relationship for a long time and you haven't revealed it, then I don't know what to tell you about that because, and because I wouldn't give someone general advice about that, you know, if, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:27:12       sorry

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       if I, if I, we speaking to a client and I had some real detailed information about their current situation, I would sit down and help them strategize about that. Ask about the person you're telling. Figure out how long you've gone out with them, figure out a way that it might be revealed that you would be comfortable with. I suspect probably what you should do is find someone you trust to talk about it if you're already in a relationship and if you're not, then assume that if going into the relationship, your basic goal is honesty, that you'll handle it appropriately when the situation comes up. So

Speaker 1:          00:27:59       how would you address accusations that you are creating another ideological group identity which is equal in its capacity for destruction to post Modern Neo Marxism? Well, uh, I would address it the way I've been addressing it for the whole last year, which is that I'm not trying to produce a group identity of any sort. I'm trying to get people to act locally in the confines of their own environment and to sort things out that are under their direct control. So it's, it's an elaboration of one of the ideas I suppose that's in the New Testament, which is that you should take the log out of your own eye before you worry about the dust speck in your neighbor's eye, which I think is a really good general maxim. And so there's nothing about that that's associated with group identity. Now people have tried to, um, what would you call it, attribute to me some identity with the right or the alt right, or even the far right more recently, even Hitler, which is what came up in at Wilfrid laurier. But I think the reason for that is twofold. One is,

Speaker 1:          00:29:09       look, if you're imagine that there is a radical left that's not very difficult to imagine, and then imagine that everyone to the right of the radical left is our all in opposition to the radical left. So then you have a group and the group is all those in opposition to the radical left and that'll include people on the radical right. And so then when you look at that entire group, so let's say a thousand people or 1500 people come in here, a talk that I give on free speech that happened on November 11th. First of all, there's 1500 people in a room, like 15 of them are going to be completely out of their mind, probably more like 30, but at least 15. And that's just base rate. And so to demonstrate that the group was somehow pathological, you'd have to show that the base rate of pathology was higher in the group than it would be in a randomly selected group.

Speaker 1:          00:29:59       And I've seen no evidence of that. But also even if there are a number of people say on the far right in that group that doesn't indicate at all that that's characteristic of the group. But it's very hard to distinguish that because what tends to happen is that a group is defined by the most egregious behavior of, of its most extreme members. So anyways, the other way that I did address the accusation is that, and I have done this as well, and I think it's what really protected me this whole year, is that I have all these youtube videos online, you know, 600 hours of them. And the message is pretty stable. The more the newer manifestation is, you know, a fairly focused critique of the university, which I think is entirely justified. But everything around that is focused on the individual and the role of the individual and the responsibility of the individual. And so I don't believe that that is an ideological group identity, so that's how I would address it. So. All right, let's see what else we've got here. What is the evolutionary reason for having consciousness? I think that was toby who asked that

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       God only knows

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       that's been a problem that people have been hammering on for a long time. I mean, that's the so called Zombie problem that David Chalmers is as described, which is something like, how do you know that other people aren't exactly like you except acting in a completely determined manner and devoid of consciousness. This, um, I don't know what the evolutionary reason is for consciousness. I mean, I can speculate like what consciousness seems to be, at least in part, is a, a mechanism of repair. So a lot of the things that you do are unconscious. You know, like when you're driving, if you're an expert driver, you're, you're using your eyes to watch the road and your eyes are moving your hands and your arms, but you're not really thinking about what you're doing. You're not attending to it consciously because you've built circuitry already, specialized circuitry that handles all those tasks.

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       Now what happens when you're driving? Let's say that you make a mistake. Well then what happens? You consciously attend to the mistake and you attempt to revise the part of the automatic structure that produced the error. So let's imagine this. Imagine you're playing the piano and you're playing a very complicated a sequence and you stumble over part of it so you're zooming along and you stumble over part of it and then you attend to that. You'd go back and you slow down and you move your fingers slowly and you try to reprogram those little automatic units that have handled that part of that. You repair them and, and reprogram them and you get faster and faster out of it as they automatize and then you go. So consciousness seems to be something that watches what you do, automatically checks for errors and then repairs it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       And so that's its function. Now you might ask why a repair mechanism like that would have to be associated with awareness announced that is, uh, not only do I not know, I don't think anyone knows if I was speculating and which I've done, I think consciousness actually plays an integral role in being itself because I'm not convinced that there would be any being of any recognizable sort without a conscious observer. So I think consciousness is actually like a center point of the cosmos in some sense, and I think it's because of ideas like that, that the, the grand archetypal idea of the soul has emerged and I think it's correct. So, but how to precisely integrate that with evolutionary theory. Um, apart from the description that already provided, I just don't, I just don't know. So let's see, what else have we got here? Would you consider a more official consultancy role with Andrew Scheer's Conservative Party? Um, it's very difficult to say what I would consider. It isn't obvious to me that Andrew Scheer would particularly like to have me as no official consultant time, kind of what might you describe a controversial? Yes, that's the word right now. And so, you know, it's funny though, because I was making this new video today, which I alluded to earlier, using good old. What's this character here? Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:34:59       Hitler though Hitler the spokes frog. And uh, I, I went back and looked at my comments on bill [inaudible] last year, which, which were the comments that originally got me in hot water and had me accused of all the things I've been accused of Transphobia, bigotry, racism. Um, what else? Oh, you fascism being on the far right. Then finally, and to top it all off, Hitler himself. And one of the things that I realized was that, that I was really calm during that video. You couldn't have really. I couldn't have offered a more mild mannered criticism of bill [inaudible]. And it's pretty funny because, you know, I'm this scandal that engulfed Wilford laurier this week is the worst scandal that I remember involving university in, in, in my memory, going back to the 19 seventies. And what happened at Laurie was exactly what I predicted would happen except it was actually worse because they did accuse Lindsay of breaking the law spill, see 16 specifically, and have contravening the Ontario Human Rights Code, which I, you know, for all I know she might've done.

Speaker 1:          00:36:11       So we're, we're at this situation where a Ta showing a video of someone discussing pronouns in candidate can now be termed a hate crime and illegal provincially and federally. And like all the usual suspects have come out of their caves, let's say, uh, like Brenda Cossman, the lawyer I debated last year and said, well, it's a real stretch to assume that what Lindsay Shepherd did was, was sufficiently reprehensible to actually constitute a violation of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. A guidelines, policies hits a stretch. So I guess we're supposed to feel good about that. But, um, I'm probably a little bit too hot right now to serve in any official consultant role, uh, that doesn't mean that I wouldn't be happy to speak to, you know, political figures who might be interested in speaking with me because, you know, I generally speak to people who asked me to speak to them. So as reprehensible as that might be, recently moved up and was promoted and not liking it because I have to adjust massively.

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       Is there a difference between liking your job and the lack of discipline to perform a change? Are there, are they connected? Yeah, well, they're definitely connected. It's a tough one. Um, the first thing I would say is that if it was a real radical change, you know, it takes people, unless they're very young, it takes people about a year to adjust to a really radical change, like to move to a new city, to, to adjust to being married. That can take longer than a year to adjust to having a new baby to, to getting over a relatively serious loss, like a death in the family a year, you know. And so the first thing you might ask yourself is, are there things that are good about the promotion? The second is, do you have the capacity to do the job or to learn how to do it?

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       You could talk to someone about that. And then the third thing is have you given yourself enough time to adjust because one of the things I often recommend to people when they've made a radical change like going leaving home and going to university, is don't pay any attention to how you feel for a year because everything is so much up in the air that you can't really trust your own judgment. So you have to give yourself time to adapt and you can't expect that that's going to happen overnight. It, it's certainly not. And to put that expectation on yourself increases the probability that you're going to feel bad about it. So, um, let's see.

Speaker 1:          00:38:58       Atomic Carlos says, my Iq is north of one slash 30. Yet I questioned my own intelligence all the time. I feel big cognitive dissonance between what people expect of me and what I considered myself capable to do. Well, you know, Carlos would, I would recommend there is that if, if you haven't done it, just go do the personality test and understand myself.com because what you're describing sounds very much like high levels of negative emotionality or neuroticism and you might want to find out if that's the case because if you're much higher than average in neuroticism, then you're going to be questioning yourself all the time and you might want to figure out if that's actually a trait and if it is a trait, well then that gives you an explanation of it. And then you might also note that your levels of negative emotion are not well matched to your likely skill.

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       Now that doesn't necessarily help you learn to cope with it, but sometimes identifying the reason it's useful and there's another possibility too, is that your mood is dysregulated and that you're depressed. So that's another thing to consider. Um, if you, if you do find that you have high levels of neuroticism but you're not depressed, then one of the things you might do is write down all the reasons, like really think them out. You know, I mean, really get serious about this, write down all the reasons why you might give yourself more credit for intelligence than you have, and part of that could be like a really deep reconsideration of successes you've had in the past with complex intellectual issues because imagine that you are serving as your own defense attorney against a very critical part of your mind. Um, that can help a lot. That can help. Marlene hibbs says, my little girl loves you. Uh, well that's, that's good. I guess you can say hi to her for me. I hope that she has a great little life. So give her a pat on the head and tell him that cognizant of the modern art scene. So

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       it isn't easy to figure out how to, how to answer that question. So, um, I haven't been thinking also about art for quite a long time because I've been so engaged in all this political and philosophical materials. So, but music, as far as music goes, I really liked the last recordings of Johnny cash. Who else springs to mind? I like a very large variety of a lot of different genres of music as well, so I'll have to leave it at that. I think

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       Richard Boyle says, hi, Dr Peterson, how does the score of 91 for compassion and one for politeness equals a score of 35 for agreeableness? Yeah, well it's because 91 in one aren't ordinary numbers. Their percentiles and you can't just average percentiles. It doesn't work that way. What it says is that, let's see, I don't know if I can generate it, just a description on the fly because I'm not, I wouldn't say I'm particularly mathematically gifted, although I know that the answer I just gave you is correct. Let's see. There's one in, there's a one in 10 chance that a person would be that compassionate and a one in 100 percent chance that a person would be that, that, that uh, nope, I can't generate it on the fly, but that's the answer. So if you want to point to the proper literature, you'd look up,

Speaker 2:          00:42:38       I'm, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       how to transform percentiles into CSI scores. They were called CSI scores. Then you can, if you, oh, that's how it works. You convert the percentiles in disease, scores, you some disease scores, and then you reconvert them into percentiles, and so if you take the z score for not for compassion 91 and the z score for politeness one, add them, divide them into and reconvert them to a percentile, you'll get 35. I know it's weird, but that's, that's how it, that's how it is. That's how it's done.

Speaker 2:          00:43:12       So

Speaker 1:          00:43:16       let's see. The opioid crisis. This is army hat or hateful. The opioid crisis in my community in the midwest of America greatly bothers me. I've been thinking about becoming a police officer. The culture has been very favorable towards cops lately. Maybe maybe majoring in law in Grad school instead. Advice, please. Thanks. Well, if you're, if you're going to be a police officer, you should be very emotionally stable, so low in neuroticism and very high in conscientiousness. If you're going to be a lawyer,

Speaker 1:          00:43:56       you better be very bright. First, you need to be extremely bright verbally in particular. You need to be extremely conscientious. You need to be emotionally stable and you need to be fairly disagreeable. That's, that's what characterizes lawyers. If you're high in openness and creativity, let's say. I would say neither nor law is a good occupation for you. So I wouldn't worry about the culture not being too favorable towards cops. That's, I don't think it's really any worse than it was. It's probably not as bad as it was in the sixties and I don't that it will necessarily continue. I don't think you should let that stop you because you know, the police have their own brotherhood and you'd find your community within that. Um, you what I would say you should think more about what you want then how other people view the occupation. I know that's irrelevant, but you should think about what you want.

Speaker 1:          00:44:51       And I think if see if you can figure out if the life of a policeman would actually interest you or the life of a lawyer. Like lots of people go into law and don't like it. You have to be argumentative. You have to really be literate because there's so much reading and writing. You have to be able to write, you have to be able to lay out clear arguments, you have to be really orderly and detail oriented because there's so many things to keep track of. Um, so you've got to make sure you got the right temperament for that so you could try the big five personality scale at understand myself. I'm, like I said, the good lawyers are high in conscientiousness, low in neuroticism, pretty disagreeable, and then extroversion helps to some degree because it makes you better in the court and it also makes you better at generating sales leads, which you know, growing your business, which is super important if you're a lawyer, like lots of people are competent lawyers, but only a small set of competent lawyers are also good at generating new business. And that makes you extremely valuable. So if you've got a salesmen aspect to you as well as those other traits, which makes you a pretty rare person, then you know you could be a bang up lawyer. So

Speaker 1:          00:46:08       link with a light saber, says, hey man, as a Canadian, I just wanted to say thanks candidate short on heroes these days and I'm glad to see you filled that role. Thanks again bud. Hey, well thanks a lot man. I don't really think of myself as a hero. I think of myself as someone who's on a relatively small raft perched on a relatively large wave paddling like a mad dog and trying not to be submerged so and so far. Well, I haven't drawn yet, so hooray for that. So, hey guys, I'm going to read you a little bit of my book if you don't mind, somewhere near the end of this. Uh, let's see. I'll probably go for about two hours. So we got about another hour, so I figured I'd read something to you for about 15 minutes and if you're interested in that, why don't you just say so in the comments section, that would be good. Then I could see what people think of that idea.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       Um, let's see here. Sorry, it's taken me just a little while to good. Someone says,

Speaker 1:          00:47:10       well, I'll, I'll, I'll, uh, go for that.

Speaker 2:          00:47:13       Let's see.

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       Hi Jordan. What are feelings and why do we have them? Well, here's a way of thinking about it. So look, let's say you were walking down a pathway. I actually saw this happen one day, so I'll you this story. So I was walking along the cliffs near, I think it was San Diego La, I don't remember. I think probably, I think it was, I think it was San Diego. Anyways, I was walking along there with some friends and a and a brother of a friend of mine who was quite a tall guy. He's about six foot five, something like that. And he was walking along the path on the edge of the cliff, kind of sandy and with with scrub pine around overlooking the Pacific Ocean. And it was march I think, so it was warm but not too warm. We were walking along and all of a sudden, his little girl who I think was like four or five, she was walking in front of him and in front of me and I guess we were going round a little bit of a corner and all of a sudden she jumped right up on his shoulders, which I'd never seen a child do that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       It was like watching, you know, if you, if a cat sleep and you and you and you go out and it'll jump up and puff out its hair and can jump straight up. Well that's what this kid did and there was a rattlesnake at the side of the, of the path. Now it was cold, which was probably good, but you know, there's a guy named, uh Oh, I can't read. He wrote a great book on fear. It'll come to me. It'll come to me. It's a book that I should have on my booklist actually. And he showed that there are circuits in your brain there reflects circuit. So this had been demonstrated to some degree much earlier that map. So imagine that a snake is a pattern. And then imagine that there's a pattern on your retina that constitutes the snake, and then imagine that that can be transformed into another pattern which is a muscular output pattern.

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       And that muscular output pattern is to jump you in the air, so your eyes make your, your make your muscles move in a particular way that happens before you see the snake and before you're afraid. And the reason for that is that so it's, there are not many neural connections between snake detection and leaping in the air. And that's because if you waited to feel fear and waited to see the snake, that would take between a quarter and half a second, something like that, and the snake would have already bitten you. So unless you had those really short neuropathways that have been conserved in the evolutionary process since like the beginning of time, anything super fast and simple would be able to kill you. So now, so let's say that you do encounter something unexpected. Well first you have these bodily reflexes that are really fast.

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       And then the next thing that happens, generally speaking, is that you feel an emotion. Like maybe you're frozen, so if you hear a real girl behind you, you'll freeze and then you'll feel fear and that'll keep you frozen. And so the fear is, uh, an indication of that physiological state. And then only after that will you start to think and strategize. And so you need reactions at multiple levels of temporal resolution in order to keep you safe in the world. And the fast reactions are muscular and reflexive. And then the next ones generally speaking, are something like emotions and they're low resolution, but quick, you know, like if you're afraid it means there's something that may be dangerous. It's vague and it's not until you explore it, that you know exactly what the danger is. But the fear is a good enough initial category. So you could think about feelings as instinctual categories, things to love, things to eat, things to run away from, things to run towards their low resolution categories. And that's how animals categories the world. They use emotion and motivation to categorize the world. So we have to keep ourselves properly oriented in the world and to react quickly and so that we can stay alive. So.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       Okay, let's see here. What else have we got? Recently? I took a job working at a camp with at risk boys were. Well there I will live at work as a counselor and a house with the kids. Any advice for working with young people with behavioral issues? Uh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       It depends on what the behavioral issues are. So I don't know what our risk means, but uh, so I can't be too specific, but what I can tell you is that almost nothing beats listening, you know, like take a kid for a walk, let them talk, like listen to them, ask them questions, you know, because most disturbed people and maybe even most people don't actually have anyone they can talk to and they need to talk first of all to find out that someone actually cares enough to listen. So it's sort of like a validation of the fact that they exist and second so that they can sort out their own thoughts. So as a beginning counselor, the best thing you can do is listen, you don't want to give advice really, you know, because what you want, you can ask questions that might lead someone in an advisable direction. But the problem with giving advice is that people are much more likely to remember something and to implement it if they've thought it up in their own words. I think that actually produces a kind of neurological transformation. The idea has to be engendered from within. It's one of the prime dicta of, of psychoanalytic theory, for example. And I think it's a really good one. So yeah. With, with regards to. So Brendan Crystal says trippy snakes and retinas. Yeah. Like it's really specific. So this woman named um,

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       no, I probably can't remember her name. Me It either. She, she wrote a book about trees and serpents. Uh, she's a ucla professor. Um, the fruit, the tree and the serpent, I think it's called. She showed quite clearly that not only do our retinas say directly detects snakes, but they do a better job in the bottom half of the retina and that we're really good at detecting the camouflage patterns that are characteristic of snakes. Snakes have these like patterns which are very, very rare and we have specialized circuitry for detecting those. And there is recent research conducted that showed that children six months old who had never been exposed to anything even resembling a snake, had an automatic response to snakes. And so it actually seems to be innate, not just, uh, not just easily learned. So that's really quite interesting. So. Okay, let's go back to the pigeon hole thing here. How do you clean your room when your spouse doesn't share that goal? Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       Well, that's another one of those questions. It's really hard to answer because I don't have the details, you know, how do you clean your room? What goals does your spouse have? That's the first thing. I mean, is there some commonality? I mean, it might be maybe you're exposed as much more disorderly than you or less conscientious or irritated at you for all sorts of reasons. You know, the first thing you could do is try to lead by example and see how that works, but you may have to argue and fight it out, you know, um, break it down into sub tasks and, and see if you can distribute the tasks and negotiate. You have to negotiate. And without further information, I can't say much more than that, you know, you can say why you're doing it, what you think the goal we're and goal was and that you'd like some help and maybe there's something you could offer in return.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       Um, if you can't negotiate at all with your spouse, then you have a much broader problem than how do you clean your room when you were supposed doesn't share that goal because the real problem would be how do you learn to negotiate with your spouse? I could talk about that a little bit. I mean, the first thing that you have to do, if you want to negotiate with someone is be able to say no. The second thing is to have something to offer. The third thing is to find out what they want and to know what you want. You know, because often people, especially with people that love them, they say, well, if you really knew, if you really love me, then you'd know what I want. It's like, no, that's just wrong. The person that you are in love with or that living with isn't any smarter than you.

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       And so you pretty much always have to tell people straight out what you want and then you have to let them be really stupid about giving it to you for quite a while. You know? So sometimes I've recommended to my clients that they take their wife or husband out on a date and of course they're all skeptical about that and cynical about it. And uh, then they go on a date and they have a terrible time and they come back and say, oh, I told you that was a stupid idea. And I tell them, that's it then a, you're not gonna do anything romantic with your spouse for the next 40 years. That's your plan. That's the plan is that it's like you might have to go out to a movie after you haven't been good to each other for like five years. You might have to go out to movie 10 times movie and dinner, say before it starts to become fun again. It's like it's hard to do that sort of thing, right? You don't. People think those things are easy and they're not. So anyways, you have to. You have to learn to negotiate with your spouse. And that's a very difficult thing to do. So I'm figuring out what you want is a good way to start. So. Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       What advice would you give the parent of an only child? Well, I'll make sure that the child, your child has lots of time for free play with other kids. And by free play, I mean play with no electronic gadgets, not sitting in front of the TV. The kids have to be able to learn how to amuse themselves and to especially to engage in pretend play, say if they're between three and probably 11 damn near that time with other kids is extremely important and kids don't get enough time for free play. So that's what I would say is get them around other kids as much as you can and not under situations where the parents are going to just sit them in front of the TV or something like that to amuse them so they don't make too much noise. It's not like there's anything wrong with seeing them and letting them watch a movie, but there's nothing wrong with the movie.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       But there is something wrong with not giving the kids enough time to engage in spontaneous play. It's a catastrophe. So how has the GRANDPA and going? I think it's going pretty well. It's quite a lot of fun to have a little baby around again. I mean I think like most man, I'm somewhat nonplussed, let's say by infants. Um, it's easier for me to deal with kids after they were about, once they get mobile la, once I can sort of throw them around a bit more than I know what to do with them once I can play with them, but it's really fun to watch my daughter be a mother. She's really good at it and it's good to have another young thing in the family and you know, because babies are very, they're kind of like fire you, you can't help but watch them and it's great. It's great and she seems healthy and um,

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       she's cute as can be. Of course babies are sneaky that way, but it's working. So yeah, I think it's really going well. So I constantly cannot verbalize my thoughts written and focal regardless of topic and my level of knowledge. Tips for verbalizing thoughts to get them into writing and therefore speech. Well, what I would say lauren is do this like read something, put a decide, try to summarize it in writing and talk while you're doing it. And then write down what you say and don't edit while you're doing that. See, one of the problems that people have when they're trying to write, as they try to write a good sentence, they, they not only tried to write a sentence, but they try to write a good sentence and you can't do that. You have to write a sentence that's hard enough and then you have to edit it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:42       So allow yourself to write badly. I'm dead serious about this, like write a bad, bad, bad first draft and then edit it if you get rid of 70 percent of it. So what? That's exactly what should happen. So like if you want to write a thousand word essay, you should start by writing a really bad 2000 word essay and then you should get rid of the worst 50 percent. You can do that iteratively. I have a document online. It's, it's. If you go to my website, I'm under courses, there's psychology for 30 is the course. I should make this more public, but under a cycle psychology for 30. There's a template for writing and if you went looked at that template, it tells you it answers your question. I, I produced this little guidebook for, for writing that will help and if you write enough, you'll learn to speak. The other thing I would say too is that it might be anxiety that's do you might think about joining a club like toastmasters or maybe if you're a university student to public speaking, uh, something where you'd get in front of people and then when you're in front of people, don't talk to the group, talked to the individuals within the group and let yourself be bad at it. You'll get better as you practice. What is your plan if Youtube deletes your account?

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       Alright. Cause as much trouble as I possibly could. And um, I don't think they will. I do have it. I do have most of my videos on Vimeo, I think I haven't had, I did try to do that. I set up an automated service to duplicate them. I've never checked to see if it worked, which is probably stupid, but I've been so overwhelmed with, with this, with, with this surreal position that I found myself in that I haven't been able to be sufficiently diligent. So, um,

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       how to be less afraid of death. I have a better suggestion. You should be more afraid of not living properly. I don't know if you can be less afraid of death. Exactly. But I think that here's a hypothesis, and this is a socratic hypothesis. I write about this in my book too, by the way. Um, maybe if you live your life thoroughly, thoroughly, right? You take use of the advantage is make use of the advantages that are put in front of you. Make use of your talents. Say Yes to things. Tell the truth like stand and get out it. I'm assuming that you can do that, you know, because some people are very ill and, and hurt. But assuming you can do that, I think the only way to combat fear of death is to live fully. And I think that that might actually work.

Speaker 1:          01:02:35       I kind of wonder, I've talked about this with my father too. He was getting pretty old. You know, I've asked him if, for example, if he could be transformed back into an 18 year old, knowing what he knows now, would he do it? And he was ambivalent about that, you know, he didn't say no, but he didn't say yes. And we talked about this idea that if you lived your life fully, you know, maybe that would be good enough because, you know, I loved having kids, but I don't feel that I would have kids again, you know, because in some sense I've already done that. And so maybe there's a set number of adventures that you have to go on in your life. Let's say you have to be married, you have to have kids, you have to have a career, you have to have friends, you have to have something useful to do with your time outside of work. Those are all things that are covered in the future authoring program. By the way, maybe if you do all those, it's like, that's good enough. You've had your life. And, and that's enough. I mean, I don't know, 10 years ago I thought, you know, if I could extend my life radically,

Speaker 1:          01:03:42       then I would. And I'm not so sure about that. Now that I'm, I'm 55, you know, I'm getting older. I kind of have a suspicion that you might come to an end, you know, that's what it looks like. I mean, I don't want that to be sued, but maybe you exhaust yourself in your life, you know, maybe you can so that there's nothing left of view really. It's a good goal anyways. So. Okay, let's find out. Let's go back to this other Dr Peterson. I have an interview for medicine coming up very soon. It's structured in the I format and it's intensely competitive. Any tips on how to stand out from the rest? Well, the only thing I can say is that

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       two things. One is really pay attention to the interviewers, right? Super attention, like don't glare at them like you're aggressively paranoid, but like make sure you're focused on them. And then the other thing I would say is say what you really think, like tell the truth. It'll make you, first of all, if you tell the truth and it doesn't work, then you know, maybe that's not the school for you. That's something to really think about. Um, and if it doesn't work anywhere and you tell the truth, maybe medicine isn't for you, and I know that might be a terrible shock, but let's assume that you are genuinely properly motivated to study medicine. Then tell them what you think. You know so many people when they go into an interview, try and they do this when they write essays too, is try to tell the interviewers what you think they want to hear it, but you can bloody well be sure that virtually everybody who's being interviewed is going to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       And I don't think that's very advisable because if you don't manifest yourself the way you are, then there's no way that the path that's proper for you can reveal itself. I know that sounds sort of mystical, but I don't know how to put it any better. The best way to stand out in an interview always assuming you're competent and that you've done the preparation, you know and that you're not living a lie is to actually say what you think. And hopefully what will happen is that there will be other people on the panel that's, that's, that are looking at you, who are of the same type and that would characterize a good position for you, a good place to be. If there are people like that and they'll know what you're doing and that will that, then they'll think you know that person, you know they're there, they'd be good.

Speaker 1:          01:06:23       There are straightforward, they're honest, they're, they're tough. They're, they can say what they think. And if there aren't people like that on the panel, then I would say you probably don't want to go there anyways. So that's what I would. That's what I would do. Be True to yourself, you know, but that also assumes that you've done your homework and that you're prepared and all of that. Because if you're useless jackass and you're yourself, obviously that is going to work. So good luck. Good luck with your interview. But I always think that like you, the other thing too is don't treat the interviewers as enemies. You know, if that's hard because if you're kind of petrified about the potential outcome and you feel intense judgment, then you're likely to go in there and kind of afraid and nervous and and and maybe even resentful. It's like

Speaker 1:          01:07:15       you've already done enough so that you're going to get interviewed. So in some sense the interviewers are hoping that you'll be great already. You know, there might be the odd cynic in there who's trying to figure out a reason to give you an x and and check you off the list, but most of the people sitting there, if they have a clue, are going to be looking for good candidates and they're going to assume that you're. You've hit threshold and so it's not like they're not on your side. And so that's a good thing to keep in mind too. You're not going in there to, to face a panel of enemies, you're going in there to face a panel of the sort of people that you're likely to be in 10 years. So that's another thing that's really useful to keep in mind with interviews in general. I would say so.

Speaker 1:          01:08:00       Okay. Many of my friends seeing the wonders of diversity, I try to tell them diversity isn't a moral good, but I ended up looking like some terrible racist. Why isn't diversity a moral good? Well, diversity is a moral good, but you can't. Diversity by race doesn't produce diversity. That's, that's called racism. That idea or diversity of gender doesn't produce diversity unless that's how you define diversity. Look, let's say that you get diversity partly as a consequence of personality, which is a good way of looking at it. There is more diversity within groups of people then between, so like men and women differ to some degree in their personalities, but there's far more difference between men within the male group and women within the male group than there is between the average or typical male and female. So it's a stupid wait. Let's assume that what you want the organization is pursuing your complex goal and you want a variety of skills that would be suited to that goal. Then you want there to be enough diversity of ability within the group so that the goal can be achieved in a efficient and, and uh, and inexpensive manner, right? Because what do you want?

Speaker 1:          01:09:19       Inefficient and expensive, obviously not. So there's a presumption that you get diversity by using identity politics categories, but there's absolutely no evidence for that whatsoever. So that's why diversity defined by race or ethnicity or gender is not only not a moral good, it's actually a moral evil because it dispenses with the whole idea of the individual dispenses, with the idea of competence. It just replaces it with the assumption that if you randomly select from the population, because that's how you would get real equity, you randomly select from the population that that gives you the best qualified group of people. Well that's just that. You wouldn't do that to select the plumber. It's the stupidest possible way of selecting for anything randomly, you know, there's no difference between selecting randomly and selecting accidentally. So it's moral diversity defined properly is a moral good. Diversity based on identity politics.

Speaker 1:          01:10:22       Categories is a positive evil, you know, true to our. Our prime minister's great example of that, so back, I think it was in 2015, he announced that half of his cabinet was going to be women because it was 2015 or some like muddle headed virtue signaling, signaling excuse for not thinking. I think only 20 percent or 25 percent of the elected mps were female. So the proper balance on average would it be 25 percent female, 75 percent male. What he should've done was figured out who, what qualities would make for a competent cabinet minister because it's actually quite important to have competent cabinet ministers and then selected from among his people for nothing other than competence, but he could virtue signal and then he set up the most important board, let's say, of the entire comp country on a random basis. Jesus, how pathetic. He should've been pilloried by Canadians for that.

Speaker 1:          01:11:24       But we're so clued out and also in this situation that you described is like if I say, well, 50 percent of Trudeau's cabinet shouldn't have been women. It's like, oh, you're a misogynist. It's like, no, only 25 percent of the elected officials were women. Now you might say, well, it would be better if 50 percent of the were elected. It's like maybe it would be better, but it didn't happen, so you can't. You can't fix it at the top end. It was appalling. So it's a hard argument to make because you need to know that there's more difference within groups then between them in order to be able to come up with a credible argument, you know, and then so yeah. Yeah. How does one distinguish a statement coming from oneself rather than from ideology? Hey, I got a good hint about that. If you're saying something that almost anyone else could say, then it's likely to be either cliched or ideological.

Speaker 1:          01:12:23       Where as if you're speaking from yourself, then in some sense you're the only person who could be saying that, and so what that means in some senses that you've taken ideas, philosophical, even in theological, and you've made them personal so that you're speaking from a position that only you can speak from, and then then you have something original to offer in Solzhenitsyn's Gulag archipelago. He talked about the like radical communists who were thrown into the Gulag and they used to play comrade with them. It was a game. And what they would do is bait them into making continual propagandistic communists statements. It was an attempt to try to educate them out of their possession, but it's a good. See if you can predict what someone is going to say on the basis of their set of beliefs, then they're not speaking. The ideology is speaking.

Speaker 1:          01:13:14       And if the ideology is speaking, you don't even have to listen to them. You could just read about the ideology and make up your own mind now. So that's, that's sort of the, um, what would you call it? That's the objective view of this. The subject of view is that statements come from yourself that come from yourself. I think first of all, frightened you to some degree because you actually open yourself up to the world by saying something genuine, but they also make you stronger. They make you feel stronger put because I think you're confronting your vulnerability properly, you know, because if I tell you something that I really don't believe and you criticize, it's like who cares? Because I don't really believe, believe it anyways, so maybe I have an ideology that's like a mask or a persona, which is generally the case personas, a youngin concept that means mask and it's often the thing that people confuse with their real identity.

Speaker 1:          01:14:05       Well, if I have a persona and someone criticizes it, it's like, well, you haven't got to the real meat, but if I say something that I really believe deeply believe and then it gets criticized like I've really put myself on the line, and so people don't do that. It's kind of frightening, but it's. It's still the way to genuine strength because you need. And also not just strength but also value. You need to manifest yourself in the world because you're a unique thing and people bite need what's unique about you? Everybody else might really need that. I believe that you don't because each person has something that's unique to them to bring into being and if they hide that they hide their light under a Bushel, that everyone is poorer for it and you do that in part as social units and says by turning in, you're turning over your God given sole to human dogma. It's a very bad idea. Very bad idea. So okay, let's see what else we've got here. What time is it? Two 21. Someone said, daddy read for us. Yeah, no problem man. I'm going to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:35       David Maxwell. I scored the zero percentile for conscientiousness and the 84th for neuroticism. How do I improve these scores? Well, okay, so the first thing David you might want to think about is like if all of your scores were low, then there's some possibility that you're being too hard on yourself. And what I would recommend Danny's, get a couple of friends to fill out the questionnaire for, for you to describe you and then see if, first of all, if there's any agreement, see if they've, they are easier on you than you are yourself. So, but let's assume that you are rather low in conscientiousness. The next question would be, well, how young are you? Because younger people tend to be lowered conscientiousness. So if you're like 16, well that's low, but it's not catastrophic. If you're 40 and you're not depressed and zero is, you know, that's low anyways.

Speaker 1:          01:16:24       If you are that low in conscientiousness, one of the things I would recommend is a, make a plan and be learn how to use a schedule a calendar and do it badly to begin with, like electronic calendar, like Google calendar. That's the best thing I know of to improve conscientious, make a plan so that you've got something to aim at and um, use a scheduler and maybe you have to, you know, talk to someone to help keep you on track. Now the other question would be do you have other personality traits that are really high, like openness, because if you're really high in openness, then it might be that you're more inclined towards being motivated by spontaneous interest and in the artistic direction and if you're really high in extroversion, then you could be motivated by being around people. So it also may be that in order to be conscientious about something, you have to pick a domain that you're suited to like socializing or artistic endeavor and try to work on being conscientious in those domains. So that's it. So James Montgomery says, how can you be confident and courageous if your father was emotionally absent and narcissistic? I'm 21 and very creative. My mother is a people pleaser who isn't confident in herself and uses me as emotional support. Help.

Speaker 1:          01:17:55       Well, look, you're confident about some things. You said you were very creative. So you're confident enough to say that. And you know

Speaker 1:          01:18:14       I don't see the problem with questions like this. I'm not criticizing your question by the way, is that you're linking your lack of confidence and courage to the absence of your father and his narcissism and also associating it with your mother being a people pleaser. So, and you know, there may be something to that. It could be James, that you could, could stand to talk to somebody you know for awhile on a regular basis and see if they can help you sort this out. You obviously seem to think that this is a problem with you moving forward in your life. If you don't want to talk to someone about it, then I would say the other thing, you need a plan. I knew that. I always refer to that, but it's the case. You need a plan and then you need to break the plan down into this, into small steps that are somewhat challenging that you have a high probability of nonetheless obtaining. And then I would say by observing yourself move forward properly that your confidence will increase. You're only 21, you know, so you're not that old. But, um, that's the best I can do without having more information about the specifics of your situation.

Speaker 1:          01:19:51       Can't increase your Iq in any significant way. Eat healthy, do the right thing. Best potential. Well, one of the things you could do if not to increase it, is at least to maintain it, is that because your Iq tends to decline as you age. It's quite depressing. You read the relevant literature, uh, your crystallized Iq, which is an indication of your accumulated knowledge doesn't decline in. Sometimes it even increases, you know, unless you get dementia or something like that. But your fluid Iq, which is more like the program or of the brain declines a lot. The best way to deal with that is to exercise both aerobic and weight lifting can really stave off cognitive decline. And that's because your brain is a very car. It's very demanding. It has a very demanding set of cardiovascular requirements. And so if your cardiovascular system is in good shape, then your brain is healthier. And since, at least in principle, your Iq depends on your brain than having a healthy brain is really a good idea. So Jerry Newton says, I often don't do very well, don't very well and doubt my ability to stand up for myself and discussions and aggressive situations. Hi. Do I know when I've incorporated my shadow?

Speaker 1:          01:21:30       I guess I would say, Jerry, that practice makes perfect. You know, one thing you could do is start keeping track of situations like that. You know, where you you walk away thinking that you should have said something and so then I would say write down the situation and then think through and write down what you think you should have done and that because that's going to help you be sharper on the draw and more ready when and then so. So write down the situation, write down what you think you should have done. Then sit and imagine the situation as vividly as you can, right? Get the pictures in your head and imagine yourself doing that and, and try to get the psychophysiological response is up as well so that you make it as realistic as possible and that will actually help you practice. So Edna Foa, who, who's a very good clinical psychologist, has demonstrated quite clearly that when treating post traumatic stress disorder, for example, if you get people to sit and imagined being back in this stressful situation, they have to do that voluntarily and after at least 18 months after the trauma had that she did psychophysiological recording of heart rate and skin conductance and that kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          01:22:41       She showed that the people who showed the highest levels of stress reactivity to the reimagining were the ones who got better, fastest, and stayed better longest. So you have a situation that you know you haven't mastered, define the situation repeatedly. Define your proper action repeatedly. Practice implementing that in your imagination, and then start, do that in your real life. And that'll, that'll, uh, see if you write down what you should've said. You'll find out what you really want and what you really think. And that's, that'll be your shadow talking it, dude. That's the best way to think about it. Is that the part of your brain that wishes it would have done something different is the shadow associated with the aggression. Who's integration would strengthen your character? That's, that's a very good way of, of thinking about it. So Matt says, Oh, this is an. Okay. Oh, Matt says I need to ask you something. Can you please release your new book as an audiobook as well in your own voice? Yes, I'm doing that. I'm starting to record it on Monday. Um, I'm kind of surprised that people want me to record it in my own voice, which is kind of scratchy at the moment, but I'm looking forward to it. I've been practicing reading it with my wife, puts her to sleep at night. Hopefully that's not because of the book. She does get quite tired at night. So I'm.

Speaker 1:          01:24:12       Let's see here.

Speaker 1:          01:24:16       Would you ever consider having a dialogue with legitimate Muslim scholar? Yes, absolutely. And I know a number of them and I'm hoping that I'll get to that. Uh, it's a big thing to take on, you know, and I'm trying to deal with this biblical lecture series and with, well all the other things that I'm involved in, including starting to lay the groundwork for this online university, which is which, and I've started looking for an office where a team could work on that and we've sketched out some of the ideas. We're gonna use competitive writing exercises to help teach people to write, which I think would really be fun. So one idea is, um, so imagine, remember this is just the outline of idea. Imagine we present you with a paragraph that someone else wrote and then you have the opportunity to do a better job of writing it and then people get the opportunity to vote on who's is better. You could see that the paragraphs could compete and that you could get a academic points based on the quality of your writing. Um, anyways, uh, that's all to say, especially also with this book coming out is that I'm going to be very occupied and I want to start a dialogue with legitimate Muslim scholars because I would also like to learn more about Islam. So hopefully that'll happen in the, uh, in the relatively near future. So

Speaker 1:          01:25:55       Jake says, I've been incredibly inspired by you. Love what you do and would like to enlightened people in a similar manner, be careful what you wish for it is, is appropriate to aim to have as much as an impact as you or more so. Um, I think it's the idea formulated wrong in some sense.

Speaker 1:          01:26:16       I think, I mean, it's good to have people that you admire, let's say who can serve as models and I'm not claiming that I'm necessarily in that category, but it's good to have people like that. But what you want to figure out to do, to do, to do is how to manifest the ideal within the confines of your own life, right? Because you're a particular sort of person and so the way that you're going to live your life best, it's very unlikely that it would be associated in any important way with the way that I've chosen to live my life unless we have very similar temperaments, which is possible, but you know, relatively unlikely because the odds against that are, you know, extraordinarily high.

Speaker 1:          01:27:04       The odds of any two people having the same temperament are very, are very high. So what you can do is aim to, to Orient yourself towards high good that you can conceive up to discipline yourself to tell the truth and all of that. And then what I would say is that as your life unfolds, you'll have the amount of influence that you should have. Whatever that happens to be. You know, some people live pretty local lives. Like my life for example, is much more public than my wife's life. But that doesn't mean that her contribution is somehow lesser. I mean, she's been unbelievably good with our kids. My daughter was very ill and my wife was extraordinarily good with her and was a great mother and has been a tremendous help to me as a very honest person and a wise person and you know, that all has an impact.

Speaker 1:          01:27:54       It's just not as obvious because while the kids really love her and now she's got grandkids and God only knows what the consequences of that is going to be across successive generations and you know, she isn't interested in public life. I'm a journalist too vast to interviewer like quite recently about what the last year has been. Liking her preferences to not do that and that's fine. Like she has her own destiny and her own way of being in the world and there's nothing to say that it's lesser in any sense of the word at all. So should artists wastes their time in art school? No. You shouldn't waste your time ever. I think your question is, is it necessarily a waste of time to go to art school? And I would say it depends very much on the art school and are on what you do while you're there.

Speaker 1:          01:28:44       Um, if you go to art school and you really work at it like mad and you devote yourself to it and you're in the library and you're studying the great masters and you're crafting your technique and you're at a school where that's actually possible, then you can educate and going to art school can give you an identity that allows you to investigate that possibility free from undue social pressure for some period of time, which is really the case with an arts degree or something like that as well. So if you can take advantage of it, if you're disciplined enough and if you can find a school that isn't completely appallingly postmodern and and social justice oriented instead of oriented towards art and I don't think it has to be a waste of time, but I think there's a high probability that it will. So serious. Respectful question. Why did you have a problem with Lindsay Shepherd being criticized for being non critical but you criticized faith Goldie for being non critical? Well, the fundamental issue. I really listened carefully to faith's interview, the interview that was conducted I think with the daily stormer. I really listened to it and I sat down and listened to it with my son whose judgment I respect a lot and

Speaker 1:          01:30:10       the thing that differentiates the two is that faith is a journalist and my sense was that

Speaker 1:          01:30:18       in this situation that she found herself, it was incumbent on her as a journalist to ask at least one or two probing questions given the nature of the people that know nature and the fact that she knew the nature of the people that she was talking to and I don't feel that she did it and you know, I was obviously not alone in my assessment of that. So her employer who was very favorably predisposed towards her also let her go as a consequence of that. And so I know that and I've been accused of being hypocritical as a consequence. And I should also say that the decision to restructure the panel wasn't mine alone. It was actually while it was divided up amongst the panel members essentially. But

Speaker 1:          01:31:06       that's what we decided. That's what we decided and you know, faith herself had offered to bow out of the panel because she knew that her presence would be controversial in a way that might not be productive. So whereas Lindsey was just a student, you know, and, and she was doing what she was supposed to do. Now I'm not trying to denigrate faith as a journalist in it. Some general sense, but you know, Charlottesville was very touchy and, and it was, and it required an unbelievably deft hand to go into that sort of rats nest and come out unscathed and you know, maybe we should think Kudos for her to her for having the courage to even attempt it. But there's a difference between, it's not that easy to distinguish between brave and foolhardy and you know what they say? Well anyways, like I said, we thought about it a lot. I listened to it a lot. We made the decision we made. I'm not trying to say that, you know, it was right in some omniscient sense, but I don't think that the situation that Lindsay shepherd found herself in is sufficiently comparable to that of faith to make the question,

Speaker 1:          01:32:28       to make the comparison fundamentally valid. So Ethan, beyond, she says, I'm a liberal. Hi. Hey Ethan. Um, you know, I've considered myself a liberal for a very long time. So a welcome.

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       Do you think I publicly disassociate yourself enough with my neo Nazi followers that, that use your work as justification for violence and propaganda. Well, you know, what kind of question is that? First of all, you're, you're making the unwarranted assumption that I definitely have neo Nazi followers, followers, you know, and that they use my work as a justification and that they're engaged in violence and propaganda. It's like how about a specific example or, or how about 10 specific examples? You know, I already pointed out that, imagine that. So 30 million people have watched my videos, so let's add 500,000 of them are youtube subscribers. So let's say I have 500,000 followers just for the sake of argument. Okay. Like a thousand of them are going to be completely out of their minds because that's one in 500. So what does that proof, you know, you'd have to demonstrate that there's a higher rate than average of pathology among the people who claim in some manner to be my followers. You know, you have to do that because as I said, everyone who's to the right of the radical left is a group and in that group that was going to be people on the far right. That doesn't mean everyone in the group of non radical leftists is a radical right winger, obviously. So anyways, you know, I don't.

Speaker 1:          01:34:16       I think that that's a loaded question. I think it's loaded in a bunch of ways. Do you think you publicly dissociate yourself enough? Well, that's a loaded question because the implication is that I don't publicly dissociate myself enough. Then the next implication is that I have more neo Nazi followers than a random person with 500,000 followers would have. And then the next like loaded bit is that they use my work as justification. I'd like to see that happen because I can't see it, how it can possibly be used as justification and that they use it as a justification for both propaganda and violence. It's like really? Come on. Yeah, you know, maybe it's possible. And if this is the case, I apologize. It's possible that you wrote that question because you were favorably disposed towards me and you know, wanted to give me an opportunity to address that question and you know, I can't tell but, but it is definitely the kind of question that, that sort of journalists who have been coming after me have been, you know, it's like, have you stopped beating your wife yet? It's like, how are you going to answer a question like that? You losing their way. So. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:35:36       Well I think what I'm going to do, I'm starting to run out of energy here, so I'm going to read some of this.

Speaker 1:          01:35:47       Okay. All right. What the hell addressed the Jewish question? That's a hell of a thing to ask. So that's Jack Linter, you know, I mean really that's a hell of a thing to ask, but I will say something about it, you know, and I've thought about this a lot. So there is evidence that Ashkenazi Jews, so those are the Jews of European heritage, have iqs that are about 15 points higher than the population average. So that's a lot 15 points. It's about the average difference between the typical high school student and the typical state college student. It's a lot. And one of the things that means is, so imagine there's two distributions and that they overlap and that the Jewish one is, uh, is the mean is 1:15. So the whole distribution is shifted to the right. What that means is if you go up into the Higher Iq strata, 1:30, 1:45 way the hell up there, that Jewish people are overwhelmingly overrepresented at the high end of the ICU distribution.

Speaker 1:          01:36:41       Now the price they paid for that is some increased propensity for neurological diseases that seems to be associated in some sense with that heightened Iq. Now, you know, the science on this isn't settled but, but it, it's reasonably solid. It all given the standards of such things. Okay, so Jews are going to be over represented at the high end of cognitively complex disciplines. So then I would say, and that's the case, like they're way over represented among outstanding scientists and among Nobel Prize winners and and so forth. And so you know, people look and they think, well why are there a disproportionate number of Jewish people in positions of authority? And they say, well, it must be a conspiracy. You know, it must be systemic in some sense. It's like, no, it can be simply accounted for by that relatively large ICU differential. Now the next criticism would be, well, don't the Jews tend to lean left?

Speaker 1:          01:37:37       Well first you might say, well, you know, given what happened in Nazi Germany to the degree that that was right wing as we discussed earlier, that's the nationalism and ethnocentrism. It's hardly surprising that they might, you know, in this historical period of time tend to move towards the left. But more than that, Iq is associated with trait, openness and trade. Openness is a strong predictor predictor of political liberalism. So, and it's the strongest predictor of political liberalism. So, you know, it's very difficult. So that's what I have to say about that. It's like. And the other thing I would say is, you know, the fact that there's a population of sub population of people who are much smarter than average, not on average, right? On average, I've got to get that straight on average is actually of great benefit to the rest of us because why do you want fewer geniuses?

Speaker 1:          01:38:32       Fewer people with Iq of 145 or 160. That's and you know, and it's no conspiracy that puts people who are smarter, higher up in competence hierarchies because I accused the best predictor of movement up in a complex con competence hierarchy. So there, I've addressed the Jewish question. It's like it's a confusion between ethnicity and and ICU as far as I'm concerned. So I'll probably get like painted six different shades of black for that answer. But it's, I've thought about a long time. It's the best that I can manage. So. Okay, I'm going to read this. Oh, what huckleberry says, should I start with past author three? If I am 40, I feel that I have so many unsolved issues from my past that prevents me from accomplishing my potential from accomplishing my potential. Mostly fear. Yes. They, the way that you wrote that indicates very clearly that you should do the past authoring first because you already know that you have unpleasant incidences or incidents in your past that are impairing your function. So. Alright, so I'm gonna read. I'm gonna. Read this. Hopefully you can see that there's an illustration there. Um, I'm going to hold it up so that I can see it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:50       There's a lag. So I don't know if it's in focus. So give me about 10 seconds.

Speaker 2:          01:40:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:08       Okay. So this is chapter four rule for. So the book has 12 rules in the book is called 12 rules for life and it's published by penguin random house and it'll be out January 23rd. And so this is a book, this is chapter rule six. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:40:36       there's 12 rules, pence, the title, and they were taken from a subset of 42 rules that I wrote for a quora article called what are the most important things that everyone should know, something like that. A very popular cora article. Now, the illustration was done by Ethan van skiver, who's a comic book artist and a good one. So you can look up his work if you want. It's v a n, s, C I v e r Ethan. This chapter is about the motivation behind the actions of people like to call them by and killers. And the illustration is of a very, very criminally oriented individual called named Carl Pans Ram. You could look him up, p a n Zed r a, m who was a very resentful, vicious, violent, destructive and intelligent person because those things can all go together. So rule six is called set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world. And the chapters all have little sub chapter. So the title of this chapter is a religious problem. It does not seem reasonable to describe the young man who shot 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut in 2012 as a religious person. This is equally true for the Colorado theater gunman and the columbine high school killers, but these murderous individuals had a problem with reality that existed at a religious depth. As one of the members of the columbine duo wrote, the human race isn't worth fighting for only worth killing. Give the earth back to the animals. They deserve it infinitely more than we do. Nothing means anything anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:42:33       People who viewed people who think such things, view being itself is inequitable and harsh to the point of corruption and human being in particular as contemptible. They appoint themselves supreme adjudicators of reality and find it wanting. They're the ultimate critics. The deeply cynical writer continues. If you recall your history, the Nazis came up with a quote, final solution and quote to the Jewish problem, kill them all. Well, in case you haven't figured it out, I say kill mankind. No one should survive. For such individuals, the world of experiences insufficient and evil, so to hell with everything. What is happening when someone comes to thinking in this manner, a great German play, foust a tragedy written by your hand. Wolfgang von Gurta addresses that issue. The plays main character, a scholar named Heinrich Faust trades his immortal soul to the devil Mephistopheles. In return, he receives whatever he desires while still alive on earth and this play, Mephistopheles is the eternal adversary of being. He has a central defining credo. I am the spirit who negates and rightly so for all that comes to be, deserves to perish wretchedly. We're better. Nothing would begin. Does everything that you term sin, destruction and evil represent. That's my proper element.

Speaker 1:          01:44:15       Dirt. The considered this hateful sentiment, so important, so key to the central element of vengeful human destructiveness that he add. Mephistopheles repeated a second time phrase somewhat differently in part two of the play written many years later, people think often in the memphis to and manner, although they sell them, act upon their thoughts as brutally as the mass murderers of school, college and theater. Whenever we experienced injustice real or imagined, whenever we encountered tragedy or fall prey to the machinations of others, whenever we experienced the horror and pain of our own apparently arbitrary limitations, the temptation to question being and then to curse it rises Fowley from the darkness. Why must innocent people suffer so terribly? What kind of bloody horrible places this anyways?

Speaker 1:          01:45:10       Life is in truth, very hard. Everyone is destined for pain and slated for destruction. Sometimes suffering is clearly the result of personal faults such as willful blindness, poor decision making or malevolence. In such cases when it appears to be self inflicted, it may even seem just people get what they deserve. You might contend that's cold comfort. However, even when true sometimes if those are suffering, change their behavior, then their lives would unfold less tragically, but human control is limited. Susceptibility to despair, disease, aging and death is universal. In the final analysis, we do not appear to be the architects of our own fragility. Whose fault is it? Then? People who are very will ill or worse, who have a sick child, will inevitably find themselves asking this question whether they are religious believers are not. The same is true of someone who finds his shirt sleeve caught in the gears of a giant bureaucracy who is suffering through a tax audit or fighting and interminable lawsuit or divorce, and it's not only the obviously suffering who are tormented by the need to blame someone or something for the intolerable state of their being at the very height of his fame, influence and creative power. For example, the towering Leo. Tolstoy began to question the value of human existence. He reasoned in this way.

Speaker 1:          01:46:44       My position was terrible. I knew that I could find nothing in the way of rational knowledge, denial of life, and in faith I could find nothing except it did not have reason and this was even more impossible than it denial of life. According to rational knowledge. It followed that life is evil. People know it. They do not have to live yet. They have lived and they do live. Just as I myself have lived, even though I had known for a long time that life is meaningless and evil tracy might told story, could only identify for means of escaping from such thoughts. One was retreating into child like ignorance of the problem. Another was pursuing mindless pleasure. The third was continuing to drag out a life that is evil and meaningless. Knowing beforehand that nothing can come of it. He identified that particular form of escape with weakness. The people in this category know that death is better than life, but they do not have the strength to act rationally and quickly put it into the delusion by killing themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:47:49       Only. The fourth and final mode of escape involved open quote, strength and energy. It consists of destroying life. Once one has realized that life is evil and meaningless, close quote, tall story relentlessly followed his thoughts, only unusually strong and logically consistent. People act in this manner. Having realized all the stupidity of the joke that is being played on us and seeing that the blessings of the dead are greater than those of the living and that it is better not to exist. They act and put it into this stupid joke. They use any means of doing it. A rope around the neck, water, a knife in the heart. A train toy story wasn't pessimistic enough. The stupidity of the joke being played in us does not merely motivate suicide. Good motivates murder. Mass murder often followed by suicide. Now it's a far more effective existential protest by June of 2016. Unbelievable as it may seem, there had been 1000. Mass killings defined is far more people shot into a single incident excluding the shooter in the US and 1,260 days. That's one such event on five of every six days for more than three years.

Speaker 1:          01:49:08       Everyone says, we don't understand. How can we still pretend that tall story understood more than a century ago. The ancient authors of the Biblical story of Cain and Abel understood as well. More than 20 centuries ago, they described murder as the first act of post identic history and not just murder, but fratricidal murder and murder. Not only if someone innocent, but if someone ideal and good and murdered unconsciously despite the creator of the universe. Today's killers tell us the same thing in their own words, who would dare say that this is not the worm at the core of the apple, but we will not listen because the truth cuts too close to the bone even for a minute, as profound as that of the celebrated Russian author, there was no way out. How can the rest of us manage when amount of tolstoy stature admits defeat for years, he hit his guns from himself and would not walk with a rope in his hand in case he hanged himself. How can a person who is awake avoid outrage at the world?

Speaker 1:          01:50:22       The next sub chapters called vengeance or transformation well, and the rest of the trap chapter attempts to answer the questions that I posed in that beginning and hopefully I've managed it at least in some small way anyways. Now it's a bit from one chapter of this book, 12 rules for life, an antidote to chaos. It comes out January 23rd. It's available for preorder. For those of you who might be interested on Amazon.com and Amazon.ca, and it's quite heavily discounted at the moment. I think it's 50 percent off on the Canadian site, 35 percent off on the American site. Um, maybe I'll put a link in the description. Um, I hope that the book is helpful. Um, I, I, I put a lot of work into it and I think it's advanced my thinking quite a bit and,

Speaker 1:          01:51:22       and I think it's readable. I've a lot of people have looked at it now and I've had good editors and so on and I think that I tried to make it as accessible as possible. I mean it deals with ideas that are pretty sophisticated, but um, I'm hoping I got the balance between complexity and sophistication and ease of access. Right. Tight. I certainly hope so. And I hope it's kind of poetic, you know, because I tried to make each sentence scan properly and have a rhythm and all of that. Anyways, um, my wife has made thanksgiving, it's not Canadian thanksgiving, American thanksgiving, but we celebrate both of them because my son is American and we lived in the states for quite a few years. So I'm going to go and see my grandkids and my son and my daughter and all the other people that are around me. Thank God. And um, thanks for listening guys and for being interested in. I hope you get your acts together and fix up the world a till next time. Bye. Bye.
