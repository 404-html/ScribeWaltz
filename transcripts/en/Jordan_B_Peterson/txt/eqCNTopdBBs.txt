Speaker 1:          00:00:15       So I'm here today with author Greg. Greg is president of fire foundation for individual rights in education and Jonathan Heit is an eminent social psychologist and professor of ethical leadership at New York University's Stern School of business. They have coauthored a new book called the coddling of the American mind, which is an elaborated version of a famous Atlantic monthly SSA. They published a while back and so today we're here to talk about their new book and about the state of the universities and I suppose society at large. So thanks guys very much for joining me today. So I thought maybe we'd start talking about the book. So do you guys want to provide some background? Maybe you could talk about the Atlantic monthly essay and what led up to the book and then we'll get into the details. Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:01:12       It all started in 2007 when I was lucky enough to have a full on medical level of depression. Really, really bad. I talk about it in some sort of detail in the, uh, in the book I realized it's actually a level at which I realized I wrote about it with details that my wife doesn't know. There's a weird privacy thing that sometimes happens when you're dictating into a computer. This is just between me and the computer and now I realize it's probably the most public thing, but the thing that saved me, the thing that ultimately helped me deal with my depression general, well as cognitive behavioral therapy, um, in a sense it's sort of like applied stoicism. You just look at your own thoughts. You talked back to the really exaggerated ones. You've labeled them as cognitive distortions that these include things like generalization, catastrophizing, binary thinking, thinking, everything has to be there, all good or bad.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       I'm actually particularly guilty of these. And Amazingly, if you just actually learned what these distortions are and practice everyday to sort of talk back to sort of the more anxious or depressed voices in your own head. It's an incredibly effective treatment for depression and anxiety. And it changed, absolutely changed my life. Meanwhile, as this is changing my life, I'm still working, I'm still the president of fire, which means I defend free speech and due process and academic freedom on campus. And um, while I was learning all of these intellectual habits, all of these ways to sort of talk yourself down, I was looking around at what administrators we're doing and an ask and saying to myself, wow, it's actually kind of like the administrators are saying, oh, by the way, you do engage in cognitive distortions, do engage in binary thinking, do overgeneralize and most of all catastrophize all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:02:54       And I remember thinking something to the effect of, well thank goodness the students don't seem to really be buying it. And that's what changed in 2013, 2014 prior to 2013, 2014 since I started in 2001, the worst constituency for free speech on campus was actually administrators. The best, most reliable fans of free speech you could run into on campus were generally the students themselves. And then sometime around 2013, 2014, we saw a. suddenly they were demanding everything from trigger warnings to microaggression policies to December stations for even people, but, but both on the left and the right on the spectrum and it seemed like we said it seemed to happen almost overnight and this, uh, and when I went to talk to John about it, we'd become friends through a mutual friend and I said, it's almost that I talked about my whole theory that we're teaching a generation the habits of anxious and depressed people from cognitive behavioral therapy. John got really excited about the idea, um, and asked if I wanted to write about it. And I was already a fan of John's work. So I was like, absolutely.

Speaker 3:          00:03:58       Yeah. So I thought that his insight into what had changed was absolutely brilliant. Uh, I had just begun to notice this in my own teaching. I've been teaching since 1995 at the University of Virginia originally and it was seemingly overnight, right around 2014. These new ideas, you know, students of course are political. They protest, they object to things, but what was new Grad? Put his finger on it. What was new was the idea that these words are going to harm me, not just defend me, not just be unjust, harm me. We have to protect. It was this idea that students are fragile and need protection and the protection should come from administrators, from adults. That's what was new and disturbing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:36       Yeah. Will you guys talk in the book about concept creep and the overgeneralization of the idea of trauma and you know, one of the things that's really struck me as interesting about the safe space movement and the microaggression policies and all of that is that it does run so contrary to what every clinician worth his or her salt knows about treating anxiety or depression and it one so. So that's kind of a remarkable. A phenomenon in itself is that what we know clinically has been absolutely inverted by people who are hypothetically agitating on the part of students' mental health. And it's not as if the mental health community has stood up on moss and denounced this. So. And I also don't. I don't understand that. I also don't understand how we got here. You guys talk in the book a little bit about your little bit of, you hypothesize a little bit about the internet generation. Right? And those are the kids born after 1995. You don't put the finger on the millennials but. But let's talk a little bit about why you think things changed in 2013 and 2014.

Speaker 3:          00:05:47       Let me just first say your point about this whole, these whole, these new ideas are not clinically supported. Something that we suggest in the book. We know, we don't know if this is going on. To what extent is this a sincere desire for protection and a sincere belief that students are fragile and to what extent is it the pursuing of a political agenda and, and, and making political points and using mental health as a cover. I think both are operative and and so, and it may depend on the context.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       Why do you think the first one is operative? Because this runs so contrary to everything that's known about the actual protection of mental health. I'm very skeptical about attributing a positive motivation to it. Like, it seems to me that it's fundamentally driven by resentment. Well, it's

Speaker 3:          00:06:39       so, uh, so you're absolutely right that the psychological community does not support this, but yet has not stood up very vocally to condemn it. So we are hopeful that psychologists and psychiatrists, everyone we spoke to, agreed that ends over only exactly the worst thing to do for someone who suffers from ptsd is to sweep clean their daily life of reminders, thereby denying them the chance to situate, to decondition the, uh, the power of these quotes triggers in the real world.

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       It's worse in some sense too because one of the things you do when you expose people who have anxiety disorders to the things that are anxious about is not make them less anxious, but make them more courageous. Right? And that's why it generalizes because the psychoanalysts thought that exposure would just mean the fears would pop up somewhere else, but they don't. And it's because people learn that there's more to them than they thought. And then when you protect them, not only do not expose them, which is a big problem, but you also teach them to generalize. The idea of their weakness, which is a really terrible thing to do to people so you couldn't invent more counterproductive mental health movement and instituted on campus is if you set out to design it.

Speaker 2:          00:07:59       That's something that we always try to emphasize. So interesting for us to look at was the one thing, because, you know, the third anti free speech movement is coming from students, uh, in the relatively recent past, so late eighties and early nineties for example. But the thing that was so striking was that they were medicalizing all, all of these claims, you know, of course I'm sitting there going like, that doesn't sound right. And I talked to John and he was like, I haven't sound right. And we interviewed for the original article, maybe seven different clinical psychologists, cbt experts, uh, you know, for example. And the thing I keep on trying keep on explaining it as it's, as a fraternity up what could be a minor version into something more like a phobia because we're giving it so much more power. And the worst thing of all that we're doing, so much of our campuses, we're turning it into a Schema. We're turning the idea that I've, that I'm broken into, um, into, uh, a permanent sort of self definition. So that's why I do think that there's sort of a mixed motive thing going

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       on here. I think that we have a self fulfilling prophecy going on to some degree because I do think that some of this kind of hopeless ideology is actually genuinely Harvard students actually making them more anxious and depressed. And of course it's really incompatible with

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       statistics to that end. So one of the things you guys concentrate on the book is, is statistics indicating that there has in fact been there is evidence of a decline in mental health over the last. What is it about the last decade

Speaker 3:          00:09:26       since around 22,000? Nine to 2012 is when the elbow, that's where things begin to, to arch up. And then they go steadily up to about 2015, 2016. We don't know if they're still going up or if they're plateauing, but this is what's going into a little bit of detail because it was just an article in the New York Times. Richard Friedman psychiatrist wrote an article, something about how the idea of a wave of increased anxiety is a myth. He said, he said it's just based on one or two, you know, there've been some, a couple of self report studies in which students say that they're more anxious. And he dismissed that and said, don't worry America, you kids aren't becoming more anxious. So we thought we dug into this in detail. We did not want to catastrophize. We did not want to foment a moral panic. So we didn't want to say, you know, oh my God, the sky is falling.

Speaker 3:          00:10:14       Kids are, are, are depressed and anxious. So we looked into this in great detail. Uh, and we were. So we were looking for this data in our art Atlantic article and it wasn't there. Uh, that is the anecdotes everywhere. People were saying the mental health centers are swamped. So there were plenty of reports from mental health centers, but isn't this just because kids these days are more comfortable seeking treatment. That's why the mental health centers is swap. Maybe there's no real increase. So in Atlantic article we could not make a strong case and we left it very speculative, but just two years later, uh, when Jean [inaudible] book came out, I aged and she brought in data from, for national nationally representative surveys showing that it really is an increased out. Again, those were almost all self report. What convinced us, but convince us that it's real is that there was a, there was a major study done published in Jama, Journal of American Medical Association looking at hospital admission data.

Speaker 3:          00:11:09       So they broke it down by gender and you always have to look male, female, separate. They broke it down by sex and by age group within teenagers and for all of the age groups, for four of the girls, teenage girls hospital admissions for cell part from cutting yourself, taking voice. This is nonfatal. Um, it's flat, flat, flat. And then right around 2011, 2012, 2013, he starts going up and up and up, and of course the rate is lowest for 11 to 13 year old girl. So let's let the do this. But the increase was the largest and 20 says that social media is social comparison seems to be hardest on the youngest girls. So the self harm data confirms this is behavioral data. This is not self report. Uh, and then the real kicker, it's suicide. If you look at the suicide statistics, they showed the same pattern as the self report of depression data, which is, um, if you look at the first decade of the century, so 2000, one to two to 2010, the average, a number of kids who killed themselves successfully commits suicide.

Speaker 3:          00:12:12       The rate for boys from that decade, uh, through Twenty 15, 2016, those two years of data, it goes up and up and up up 25 percent, which is gigantic. There's been an enormous increase in voice suicide. The increase for girls is 70 percent, seven zero. So boys, the rate is higher for boys because girls make many more attempts, but boys methods, so the. So the increase is actually fairly parallel, but as a percentage is much higher for girls. Social Media, at least this is his argument and we think there's some validity to it. Twenties argument is that the spread of of iphones and social media has brought boys into play video games. They play a lot of video games, but those aren't actually that harmful. It's the social comparison sites. It's a instagram and and other things where girls are comparing their lives to other girls and feeling left out that we think we don't know for sure, but that we think is the most powerful reason why the girls rates have increased so much. Oh sorry. John Greenberg. That data too, because even since 2007, if you just pick 2007, we're talking about a doubling in terms of suicide in 2007. That was the. That was the lowest year. So if you just. So it's, that's why it's best to not take 2007. It's best to just take the average bounces around. No trend in the first decade.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       Okay. So we could hypothesize perhaps that there's something approximating a positive feedback loop going on here. So imagine because I'm trying to figure out why things have gone out of control, say since 2013, it's like there's been a tipping point. And so I'm going to offer a few ideas and you guys can tell me what you think. Okay. So let's, let's think of four or five reasons. So I think there's an increase in political perceived political polarization and maybe real political polarization because the mainstream media, mainstream media is dying and as it dies it gets, it gets more attracted to quick bait journalism and exaggerates the degree of extremism on both sides. And that's a consequence of a technological revolution that the threat that they're under from probably from Internet media sources. So that's one. The next one would be the UN. I'm opposed, rise of the postmodern Marxist doctrines that characterize disciplines, particularly like women's studies.

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       Now you guys talked about a woman who generated, um, intersectionality theory, Kimberle crenshaw, and I'd been looking into Kate Millett who established patriarchy theory or one of the people who established it and she was a radical lesbian for political reasons and had an alcoholic and abusive father. So I think that's quite interesting and I think that these theories, crenshaw and, and millets theories were basically ignored by serious scholars in the, in the academic world, but they've spread and have had a disproportionate effect on the universities and their combined with a kind of Marxist viewpoints that divides the world into victimizer and victim. And then maybe we have the, what you just said.

Speaker 3:          00:15:25       Yep. You Bet. On the political polarization. Absolutely. We have a whole chapter on that. The way to think about this as universities are complicated institutions nested within a broader society and they're changing and the broader society has changed. And so we document how the rise in political polarization and here the thing to focus on is not polarization of attitudes about abortion or things like that is how much do you hate the other side that has been going up steadily since the 19 nineties. And so if you have a left right battle, it's getting more and more intense at the same time as the professoriate is going from leaning left to being much further on the left. So we document this in the book, um, that the, the overall left right ratio for a variety of reasons went from a two to two, one overall putting everybody to, to one of the early nineties, two, five to one left, right ratio by 2010. So if you have a more politically purified institution at a time when the electromagnetic forces of crossbars and hatred are ginning up, then yes, you have a more politicized institution. So there's a lot going on there. It's not unique to the left. It just so happens that universities have been polarizing, left other institutions, polarized, right? If you believe in diversity, if you believe that diversity makes people think better because it challenges thoughts in a loss of political diversity is harmful and it's a contributor,

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       echo chambers that we agreed on the Internet. Social media does go to pat you on the back for having those thick of an echo chamber as possible. Um, I'm definitely a big proponent of sort of the big sort of hypothesis certainly lived this experience that we increasingly live in a politically homogeneous communities now. Big Sort of course talks about us living in more politically homogeneous counties, but Charles Murray and others have done research about how we actually live even more politically homogeneous city blocks that actually we are sort of self sorting. Tyler Cowen talks about this too, and of course if you have sort of a social circle where you practically never run into anybody who disagrees with you. The, all the different sort of tribalism experiments that they've done, polarization experiments they've done over the years shows that you attend to sort of spiral off into the distance. So that's one of the reasons why I think of, this is what we call him the book of problem with progress, but if you think about the idea that we can live in communities that reflect our values going back around late 19 seventies, that sounds lovely. That sounds great, Ray, to live in communities for my values, but if you've ever lived in a, that reflects just one political point of view and virtually none of the other. It does have a tendency to become a virtue signal, a contest more than an actual place where you discuss ideas.

Speaker 3:          00:17:59       Okay. So now let's move on to the services of Marxism. Um, so I think you and I both agree that that postmodernism Marxism, uh, that these are lenses that tend to amplify conflict. These are somehow involved. Uh, I think you and I may disagree a bit on the dynamics here and the extent of it. So I'll just leave it. The way that I think about it, these ideas, this way of looking at things, even these ideas of of trigger warnings, matrices of oppression, those ideas existed in feminist circles going all the way back to the nineties as a professor at Nyu and previous that Uva, I have not seen that postmodernism or Marxism or in any way spreading across the disciplines. They've always been there in a few disciplines. There's a lot of of Marxist analysis and sociology. I have not noticed that spreading at all among the professoriate or across disciplines.

Speaker 3:          00:18:49       I think what has happened is that social media and the Internet, especially social media has knocked down the compartments a good society needs a lot of compartments, needs a lot of walls, were different norms and different practices flourish that you can do different jobs. I think social media is knocked down the walls so that certain ideas that maybe some students get from their gender studies or anthropology or sociology classes, those ideas can spread among the students and they're often not even really the accurate ideas. That's a sort of a bastardized version, a modified in ways that I don't really even understand that can spread around. This is how you can get bad psychological ideas that political ideas spreading around among the students. That's what's been most striking to us is that this is really the change is really student led. It's a generational thing. You can blame faculty and in certain departments for. You can certainly disagree with their ideas, but it's not that there's this conspiracy as far as we can tell a conspiracy, one of the professors to take over. Maybe you'll disagree with that. We see it. I see it as more student led.

Speaker 2:          00:19:53       I didn't want to talk a lot about John and I talk a lot about, but it didn't quite make it into the book. What we've dubbed it is the fortress. And what we mean by that is if you look at the way, like I, I went to Stanford for law school, I worked for the Eclu of Northern California. Um, and I saw this sort of happening even in the early nineties that one of the things that some of these postmodern theories, particularly privileged theory allow is a matter of arguing in which you never ever have to get to the substance of the argument. So even in the late nineties, reformable borders had a lot of levels of protection. You didn't have to listen to anybody if they're conservative was almost taken for granted, which I deeply ashamed of. Um, you didn't have to, uh, and now if you add to it, you don't have to listen to anybody. If they have privilege. And by the way 100 percent of people actually do, that means you can choose to listen to whomever the hell you want because it's only optional. You have an option to either dismiss marks a as being a white privileged male or you can listen to them. But anytime you run into someone who disagrees with you, you have several sort of tools at your disposal.

Speaker 2:          00:21:01       The was that were white males defending our privileged. Almost nobody engaged with the substance of the argument.

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       Yeah, boiled down to the power claims of competing identity groups. Then there is no such thing as substance and I think that actually fits quite nicely with certain strains of postmodern thinking that have a tendency to deny any knowledge of any real world and to presume that everything is not only interpretation interpretation based on a power claims for competing groups and the intersectionality theory. You know, I just finished writing the preface to that new version of the Fiftieth Anniversary version of the Gulag. Archipelago was quite something and I was trying to synthesize Solzhenitsyn's arguments about why the Russian revolution went so badly south immediately after it began. And it's very interesting to think about it from this intersectionality perspective because as you guys just pointed out, it's not an unreasonable proposition that people have multiple, multiple group identities. Now. Perhaps there's some use in considering that because you can think of the ways that people have different advantages and disadvantages, but one of the real pernicious side effects of that kind of thinking, especially when it's conjoined with a viewpoint that divides the world into victim and victimizer, is that you can take any one person and maybe generate 20 group identities for them and you can find at least one identity along which they're privileged and that means that not only can you ignore them as a consequence of them speaking only on behalf of their power, but you have a valid reason for persecuting them, and that's exactly what happened in the Soviet Union.

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       As long as I could find one dimension along which you were an oppressor, then you were done.

Speaker 2:          00:23:03       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       right. Right. Well, they were the best example of that.

Speaker 2:          00:23:11       Any other countries where search. That's where my family comes from and in any other country, you know, my family's story would have been because we went from being to being lawyers and judges within a single generation. My grandfather was in Kiev, polytechnic studying to be a professor when World War One broke out and of course people like me, success stories and any other country we were shot in the back of the head by the millions.

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       Right, right. Well, and you were actually the working class success stories because when, when was, when was eradicated in, in, in Russia. Right, right. So people

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       were basically slaves up to that point and some people made very rapid, uh, leaps in status within a single generation or two. And those were the Kulaks that were medicated by the, by the Soviets after World War One. Then that, of course, that's what led to the huge starvation and massive starvation of the 19, late 1920 [inaudible] and 1930 [inaudible] and early 19 thirties. So it was a complete catastrophe. So. Alright. So we, you put together a bunch of symptoms, you know, you said well, microaggression theory, I'm no admirer of Daryl is derald wing sue? Yes. I think that, that. I read his book, I thought it was absolutely appalling. And in all in all possible manners. There's the, the kind of oppression theory and intersectionality, the idea that we're in a patriarchal tyranny, and then one of the things that you've pointed out at the beginning of this interview was the unknown effect of social comparison with these new social technologies, social media technologies, right? Because we're really at a really laid vulnerable to these new technologies because we have no idea what the effect they have on adults, let alone young people. And so do you think that is actually making young people feel that the world is a more dangerous place and requiring them to seek protection?

Speaker 3:          00:25:06       Oh yes. We think that's a big part of it. Physical Safety, safe or unsafe for death rates go down so you know Steve Pinker and many others, a chronicle of the decline of violence, but we react to the world not as it is. We react to the world as we perceive it through the filters that were given. And if, if you remember the old movie from the 19 eighties or nineties, it was the bowling for columbine boy, Michael Moore's movie, bowling for Columbine, where he traces out why Americans are so paranoid compared to Canadian, I'd say. And he, he blames it all on cable TV, putting stories of crime in our face. All right? So I think there's a lot of truth to that. Now, imagine social media channeling not just stories of crime, but whichever side you're on politically, you now get filtered through of all of the stupid things that any person says in our country of 330 million people everyday.

Speaker 3:          00:26:05       Someone on the left says something incredibly stupid and offensive. And everyday some of the rights says something you know, and as a video. And so if you're being. So if you're rewarded for forwarding outrage, things that outrage you aside, you're rewarded for forwarding them at home. We're all forwarding it. We're all drowning in outrage stories. And one of the things that that sells or that sells in terms of getting retweets is stories of aggression or violence or racism or whatever it is. People trampling on your side, sacred values. So if you're exposed constantly, the stories of you know, if you're, if you're on the left, you're exposed to stories of right not, not season. You think that half the country is, this is going to have a big effect on your perceptions, even if even if the reality is social progress, even if the reality is increasing safety. So we do think that the reason why it's so many things are going haywire, not just in America but in many countries is the Internet and social media all hitting us. At the same time, globalization is the other factor, a little more distant, but I think their intersection intersecting interacting in all kinds of interesting ways that we don't yet understand.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       We talked about polarization on the right than on the left. And one of the things that struck me and maybe I'm wrong about this, is that I'd be particularly concerned about the rise of the radical left. And that's probably because I've been immersed in the University of you and as you already pointed out, the left is overrepresented at least among the social scientists and the humanities and I suspect as well the administration in the universities and then I see as well people being concerned about the rise of the radical right. But I certainly don't see the radical right as posing a threat in the universities and I can't see what sort of threat the radical right is posing because I can't get numbers. So like when, there are lots of stories about outright types and about neo Nazis and white supremacists, but they seem, I mean there was a white supremacist rally in Washington about a month and a half ago and I think they got 16 people on a bus on the white supremacists side and several thousand counter protesters. And so I'm wondering to what degree the radical right is, uh, like I don't know where they are exactly. So do you have thoughts about that?

Speaker 3:          00:28:25       Yeah, definitely. In my work, I talk about this being the most recent trend and we talk about this in the book and it's not necessarily the radical right, but we've seen some of the talk about it kind of like we have this sort of echo chamber on the universities and there is a sort of an echo chamber on the right as well and those two have been a sort of colliding with each other with each other. So we've definitely seen an uptick in fire of liberal professors getting in trouble for what they say on the Internet, what they say on twitter or facebook or you know, going on Fox News for example. And we talk about a couple of examples of that in the book. Now this is so recent that we're not going to have real data on it, but it definitely is a noticeable change for those of us who work on the front line.

Speaker 3:          00:29:08       So it's important to look at the timing here because we hear this a lot too. And you know, whenever we talk about something, people will find out, well, what about the. All right, and what about the Nazis? Um, and when, when we started this, when Greg first notice what was going on in 2013, 2014 and in our article came out in 2015, the right had nothing to do with it now that nobody had heard of the alt right practically they weren't trolling on campus. So whenever the origins of the problem on campus, it is not a reaction to the right now in 2016, um, the right got a lot more attention and it got much more sophisticated trolling. And uh, as I read a little bit about trolling or the New York Times began to cover it, it became really clear all you need is a few people with a kind of a perverse sense of humor and a few anonymous Internet accounts and they can provoke a gigantic reaction from the group that they want to provoke.

Speaker 3:          00:29:59       And so I think in 2016 we saw the right and into 2017, that's where we start actually seeing the cases of right wing movements to get professors fired there. There's some really nasty stuff coming out of various sites on the right flooding people's inboxes with rape threats. And death threats and racist rants. So there's a lot of nasty stuff coming from the right towards professors in 2017. And since then it wasn't happening as far as, it wasn't anything new, it wasn't really part of the story early on. So we've talked to six. The polarization cycle of the problem we believe is not originally from, from the right, although now they are a part of the polarization cycle

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       right out of the darkness in that manner. I mean, one of the things I've seen on youtube and the other commentary sources that I've be monitoring is a real increase in antisemitic comments and it's hard to tell. Of course, it's hard to quantify that, but your appallingly common, um, on, on youtube and on twitter as well. Um, and some of them are coded, you know, I think it's common place nowadays to put your comment in three brackets which indicates a, an antisemitic origin or emphasis. And so that's very pernicious. But again, we have no idea how many people are actually engaging in this. And it's a very difficult thing to, to come to terms with. Because like when I look at the United States, I think, and more power to you that your political dialogue is actually quite balanced. There's a fair bit of power on the left and there's a fair bit of power on the right. Um, the radical left seems to be overrepresented in universities and that's something that's unique. I can't get a handle on the white supremacists and Nazi types. I mean, I think Nazis are vanishingly rare. I really believe that the white supremacists types as well, but, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not growing. It isn't being cultivated in some sense.

Speaker 3:          00:32:02       Then the question is how much should we react to it? So I'm Jewish. My mother told me when I was growing up that America is the promised land for the Jews. It's not Israel. Israel is the promised land. Um, I was raised to believe that America is the promised land for the Jews. Sure. There was some antisemitism. My parents, we moved to Scarsdale, New York, and they could not join certain country clubs. Big Deal. There were Jewish clubs, there were clubs. That's the way things were. It was, it wasn't perfect, but compared to what? Compared to the rest of the world, God, my grandparents got off the boat in New York and didn't go onto Buenos Aires or any, any place else that was settled originally by the Spanish. Um, so America is not an antisemitic country. Now. What do we make of the fact that now we're seeing all this antisemitic stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:32:50       What I make of it is that there are a few assholes who are organizing and doing this and am I triggered by it because I grew up where occasionally you come across a swastika, like scratched into the bathroom stall. You'd find the f word, you'd find them Saturdays, you'd find a drawing of a penis and you'd see a swastika. And my reaction was, you know, Yuck or bad. And then I would go on with my day. It wasn't a trigger. But if we teach kids now, if you find something on the Internet, been triggered and of course you will always find something on the Internet.

Speaker 2:          00:33:23       I will say though, and this is just anecdotal, but my. I speak a lot of times in California and some of the sort of anti Israel bleeding into antisemitism is something that I've, I've, I've seen really dramatic performance. It's almost as if it's become stylish to be so anti. You're almost antisemitic. At least certain circles. And I spoke at the British Labor Party for example. For example, I spoke at the 50th anniversary of the start of the free speech movement way back in 2014. Uh, I spoke at Berkeley and I'll be damned if my speech was not in a room with a lot of antisemites and there was even a guy who was trying to address this saying like, oh, and people want to call it antisemitic and so wrong, and then you finish that sentence. But it's undeniable that the poison hand of Zionism destroys everything it touches. And I was like, okay, that's, that's A. I think they, I can understand wanting to call you that. So I, I definitely, I don't think it's in people's heads that this is real and I've noticed it most pronounced for some reason in California.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       Okay. So here's the idea of. So no, one of the things that happened in Germany in the 19 twenties was a polarization process, right? I'm obviously much more severe than the one that we're going through, but I wonder if when the political spectrum polarizes that I'm ethnocentrism of a certain sort of rises and drive something like antisemitism. So maybe maybe when the left and the right are relatively close together, people aren't so obsessed with their group identities or the extreme types aren't. But then with the polarization process starts, everybody locks harder into the group identities and then anyone who's. I don't know if it's anyone who's an outsider is viewed with access to sufficient. But see the situation with the Jewish people is complicated too because they're often successful. So I don't know if it's some perverse interaction between ethnocentrism and resentment for the, for the successful, that's. It drives antisemitism during polarization processes. I'm trying to get, get a finger organized, you know, trying to put my finger on it.

Speaker 3:          00:35:33       I think what you're, what you're reaching for it here is this phenomena that you suddenly these bursts of intolerance. What triggers that? And here I turned to Karen Stenner of political scientists, didn't work at Princeton, and now she lives in Australia. She wrote this brilliant book, the authoritarian dynamic published in 2005. And what she says in there is that authoritarianism is not a stable personality trait. It's a dynamic in which some people got 20 or 30 percent of the population, um, when they perceive that society is coming apart. That is, you know, I study morality, we need a sense of shared moral order or at times when we feel that the moral order is secure, violations aren't punished, everything's fine. Um, there are other times when we feel things are coming apart, it's chaos, it's Babel, when that's happening, people who have this predisposition to authoritarianism, it's like there's a button on their head that gets pushed and they then become intolerant against all outsiders.

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       And so she does experiments where she gives a story about, you know, maybe it's Mexican immigration, but it turns that that then makes know if you present it in a threatening way as Donald Trump does, that doesn't just turn people against Mexicans. It turns them against lgbt Americans. So it's a general dynamic of stamp out, descend, stamp out the outsiders, get back to the purity of our group. So when we have times of increasing prosperity, when we have peace, when there's a sense of progress, the pie is growing, there is some sense that we are. We have something in common, then things get much calmer, but a number of events, a financial crisis may have contributed to sense that there is not a growing pie. But I think again, social media has made it so that if you are prone to this and then you sign up to any group that is concerned about immigration or anything else, you will now be so you will, it will be come flooding into you really powerful videos designed to press that button over and over and over again.

Speaker 3:          00:37:34       And before you know it, America goes from having, you know, 50 Nazis to having 500, maybe even 5,000. It's not 5 million. I really don't think there are five know whatever. It's not like two or three percent of the country are Nazis. So we've got to somehow learn to get used to the fact that we've got to somehow get back to judging by sort of the average or the overall rather than the individual extremes because now we will be faced with the individual extremes forever and also while we're recommending books. Amy Chu was political tribes talks a lot about this too and it's really, really an interesting stimulating.

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       Well partly what I've been trying to do in my lectures. So I'm lecturing to people and doing this to some degree on youtube as well as to emphasize the existence of the Coleman Center. For me, that's a return to classic liberal and and to some degree classic conservative values, I mean some intermingling of those. So some emphasis on traditional, well a traditional phenomenon like a, like monogamous marriage, but the

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       idea of the sovereignty of the individual as part of that common landscape that unites us. And that seems to be quite useful. Although I would go ahead,

Speaker 3:          00:38:46       just keep going. I think this is a very important point that if you go down the identitarian path, there is no clear endpoint. Nobody can point to where this will end in a good way. So what's, what's so interesting and here's one of the most encouraging signs is that just in 2018, we are seeing an explosion of books written by people who are not straight white males who are saying identity politics practiced in this way is a dead end. We need to, we need to really emphasize what we have in common. And so I'll just read you. I just started collecting a file, put this online someplace soon. Here are some of the books. Here's something really interesting things coming out. Just recently, Amy Schumer's book political tribes, as Greg mentioned, a Francis Fukuyama has a new book identity. The demand for dignity and the politics of resentment just came out last week.

Speaker 3:          00:39:34       Uh, Anthony Appiah isn't writing brilliantly about identity politics. Uh, Jonathan Rouch, uh, I guess he's conservative, but he's, uh, he's been writing again very, uh, about amy Chu and about other reasons why identity politics is a dead end. John mcwhorter, uh, has been writing brilliantly about how, uh, anti racism has become a religion a how we need to start focusing on, uh, on that. In that way I'm in Britain. There are a number of, of people of Caribbean origin had been writing about this. I just had dinner last week with your shot. Manji has a book coming up. Don't label me. So this is wonderful that we're seeing all of these people just to all of them identify as being on the left. None of them are straight white males and they're all saying we need to rethink this. And so we're, we're thrilled because in our book and chapter three, we distinguished between common humanity, identity politics, which is what Martin Luther King did have any of the civil rights leaders, which yes, you need to demand rights for groups that don't have them, but you do it by appealing to our common humanity versus common enemy identity politics, which is what intersectionality tends to devolve into it.

Speaker 3:          00:40:40       So it doesn't have to be, but it often is bastardized into let's all unite against them. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:40:46       No. In Canada, we've been pursuing a multicultural policy and our prime minister is famous for saying that Canada has no identity, which I think is an absolute catastrophe of an idea. I mean, if you think about the multicultural landscape of the planet, it's certainly produces records along with diversity. So the question is how do you bring people from different communities into a universal community and maintain piece. And it seems to me that you do that essentially by concentrating on the sovereignty of the individual as the fundamental marker for human identity rather than rather than the group. And I was thinking about intersectionality, which I think by the way is a painfully obvious idea. You know, the idea that you could be classified among many group dimensions and, and if their social status consequences to all of those and that they interact. Um, but I think intersectionality is actually the discovery of the fatal flaw of identity politics because if you drag people down, if you allow their group identities to multiply and interact and you get to the point where each individual's unique nexus of group identities. And I actually think that that's what western culture discovered over the last several thousand years, that the logical end point is the individual. And if you take everyone's advantages and disadvantages into account optimally, then what you do is you treat them as individuals like there isn't any one else liked them in some sense, except in terms of their common say divine value or something approximating that.

Speaker 3:          00:42:25       If you followed it to its logical conclusion, then the worst aspects of identity arianism would vanish. Because as you say, everybody ultimately unfortunately of the 20 or 30 dimensions on which one could categorize people. It's really only three to matter. It's straight white males. That's really where it's at.

Speaker 4:          00:42:45       We're digging into, you know, because that that's actually illustrative. I would say to some degree of the actual motivations. There is all these identities and hypothetically there's nothing to distinguish them in terms of primacy, even in terms of their effect, say on socio economic outcome. So then it seems to me to be a victim victimizer narrative that's driving the idea that it's straight white males, that, that in some sense have the, have the phenomenal upper hand, which is another thing I don't really buy. I mean, most of the dangerous jobs are done by men. And so

Speaker 3:          00:43:20       who has power and wealth, you know, straight white man can plead guilty to that, that the world is not perfectly equal across all categories. But I think what we're seeing now in very sharp relief since the Sarah John Controversy in New York Times recently is this red wine. I think it was Wednesday instead of a year or two ago. Um, there, there are some people who see inequality and want to end it. There are other people who see inequality and want to reverse it. At the time I thought, well that's interesting. I wonder if that's true. But I think the Sarah John Controversy where the New York Times hired a young Korean American, a person to join the opposite of the editorial page and it was discovered that she had all these nasty anti white entryway tweets. And the fact that there was a discussion and debate, many people would say, oh, by definition there's no such thing as anti white racism. It's okay to say terrible things about white people. It's okay. Here's the key thing. It's okay to look at someone and based on the way they look, dislike them and treat them badly. And if you think that's okay, then this is the problem. This is common enemy identity politics. I think that's horrible. We shouldn't be judging people based on their race then that's, you're probably supportive comments, humanity, identity politics as well.

Speaker 2:          00:44:36       I actually would like to push back against the idea that it's just straight white men anymore. I felt like I always feel like unfortunately, sort of like the Stanford Palo Alto Slash San Francisco Bay area is unfortunately way ahead on these trends. And I think one of the reasons why you are seeing pushback from minority members. Well it's partially because for a long time, at least among the friends, I don't really believe in this and almost like a religious kind of way. Um, they're, they're, they're extremely guilty about simply being cisgendered as a non transgender that you, you'll, you'll see sort of this call out culture applied to a straight black men for example. So I do think that we, we've been falling deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole where people are realizing, wow, so this is just a permanent situation of guilt and shame about an identity that I have no control over. That can't possibly be right.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       Well, the other thing we can point out too is that even if you do make allowances for the fact that let's say on average straight white men are doing or have done relatively well economically, it's also very much worth pointing out that it's a tiny minority of straight white men who have been doing spectacularly well. You know, so you have a distribution problem within each with each, within each ethnic identity group. And so to say that because on average the socioeconomic status of a given group is higher than the status of another group. All of the people who are members of that group are disproportionately benefiting is actually a rather. I'm in, I would say a rather motivated and resentful analysis because it is always a tiny proportion of people in a group that are doing spectacularly well and then then you have to do something else which is you have to look at that proportion that are doing spectacularly well and you have to decide about how many of them are doing well because they actually deserve it and how many of them are doing well because they're inappropriate rent seekers and I would say because our culture is pretty damn functional and because we do generate a lot of wealth along with the inequality that there's a fair number of people who are doing just proportionately well who are doing that by benefiting everyone else and we're not very careful about making those sorts of distinctions and they're actually crucial.

Speaker 3:          00:46:50       Right? So that's what we did. So in chapter 11 we go into social justice and many people have claimed social justice is a meaningless term, gets thrown around in certain ways. People can't define it. I'm digging into it. We decided that it actually is meaningful, but we have to. We have to break it down into its component parts and so we go into what is the psychology of justice and if you focus on distributive justice, aren't people getting what they deserve based on their inputs? Everybody recognizes when people are being cheated that they're, you know, like in America now, a lot of low wage workers, the companies have found ways to skimp on benefits and pay, so that is a violation of of distributive fairness. People recognize that that is wrong if that is disproportionately affecting one race or if people are being cheated because they are members of any identity group.

Speaker 3:          00:47:40       That is a violation, I would say, of social justice or injustice applied to identity groups that we think is a very important concept. Simply procedural justice. If the criminal justice system ends up for whatever reason, getting better representation to some groups than others or treating people differently at any point, that is a violation of justice, which can possibly quality violation of social justice. What we pushed back against is the shift in recent years to this obsessive emphasis on outcomes. Social justice argument seems to be on campus as you just say, look, men are overrepresented among coders. Well, they're not overrepresented among all other functions at Google and apple. If you look at everyone else in the company, you know it's 50 slash 50. We're very close. It's only in certain job classifications where there's a disparity and so people take that as ipso facto proof of systemic sexism, but we really push back hard on saying that's lazy.

Speaker 3:          00:48:39       That's unfair, that's inaccurate. That's an invitation. Those disparities or an invitation to look closer and if you see that the pipeline is 50 slash 50, but the outcome is, well then you've got a strong case. But if the pipeline from Grad programs and computer science is exactly the same as the representation among coders at Google and apple, well you know, you have to do something to show that people are being treated differently. So we think there's a lot of bad thinking gun in the service of prosecuting one's political agenda within the culture war and that a lot of people don't know how to stand up to it. And one thing that I find interesting but district become a blast from this argument is a personal preference, particularly when people talk about gender. So I mean if you've ever actually read, for example, the speech that got Larry Summers and so much trouble, incredibly conclusion is it's probably mostly that these are not, a lot of these jobs are not our job. So the, a lot of the theoretical physics things, they don't have a lot of appeal to women. He, he basically, he comes down for some reason saying that there might actually be a reason why no veterinary sciences, overwhelmingly women, some of some of these mathematical fields are overwhelming. Mimic, might have something to do with it. Some small differences in what people actually liked doing somehow.

Speaker 1:          00:49:54       So the biggest London Times just did an article this week on two papers that came out, um, was quite an interesting article because one of the papers came out showing once again that the personality differences between men and women are largest in the most egalitarian societies. And they actually get quite large by psychological standards in countries like Holland or the Netherlands. And also in the Scandinavian countries, which are the most egalitarian countries, but the biggest difference between men and women and also one that grows in more egalitarian countries is an interest and that that

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       difference is more than the standard deviation. It's like one and a half standard deviations. And so it's more than enough to account for the disparity between male engineers and our female engineers and male nurses. And the fact that it grows as societies become more egalitarian is actually a death blow to social constructionist theory.

Speaker 3:          00:50:49       That's right. So, so let's go into this because this is a really helpful area where I think we have a good idea what's going on and we can see why it's so hard to find. Find the truth here. Um, so when I taught at Uva, I had a lecture on sex and gender and I went into sex differences and have clear finding for many decades is that if you look at differences in ability between men and women, they're very few and far between. Men are better at spacial rotation. Women on some images are a little bit or at social skills and language. So there are some differences, but they're few and far between. If you look at the differences in what kids like and what they choose to do when there's no adult watching, their huge little boys and girls play radically differently by my wife and I, we, um, we once gave up my triplet nephews and they were four years old, four years old again from a bag of plastic dinosaurs and the two boys grabbed a dinosaur and they start battling the bashing them together and the girl takes two dinosaurs and she says, don't ever leave me money.

Speaker 3:          00:51:48       I won't be so dope. But the point is girls and boys play really differently. And if you, if they're supervised by adults, the differences get smaller was if you let kids play on their own, the differences get bigger. Differences in interest are huge and crucial. Finding. Jordan, I'd like to ask you what, why, why is this? Why do you think this is treated so much? Like heretical. Bless was thought that must be immediately shot down,

Speaker 4:          00:52:13       that you zeroed in on the property issue before. When you talked about the equity Dr. now, one of the things I've been trying to figure out is how we know when the left goes too far. Now we know when the right goes too far, when they start making ethno nationalist claims of superiority. It's something like that and claiming that all the good things should happen to one ethnic or racial group. Okay. Know where you're outside the domain of reasonable political discourse at that point. Now obviously the same thing can happen on the left, but when it happens, it's not so obvious. There's no smoking pistol, but I think emphasis on equity, which is code word for equality of outcome is actually the smoking pistol. If you had to pick one.

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       No. Okay. I would disagree with you on that. That can't be a smoking pistol. Emphasizing equity can't get smoking. Pistol, I think we mean by smoking pistol is when someone makes an argument in good faith trying to understand some phenomenon in the world and they suffer social consequences. That's the smoking pistol.

Speaker 4:          00:53:14       Why we might be talking about two slightly different things. I'm. I'm maybe not. I'm trying to figure out where the. Where the tipping point is on the left that makes things spiral out of control and you guys talked about the equality of outcome doctrine as as the wrong. First of all, it doesn't allow for multivariate analysis. Right? Which is a big problem, so it oversimplifies things radically if there's a difference in outcome than ipso facto. There is a victim, victimizer, a narrative driving it or reality driving it and I think that the, the, the fundamental problem on the radical left is exactly that and that's the reason that they don't like the literature on gender differences because you can point to gender differences in outcome and you can use them as proof for the oppressive nature of society, but if you look into it and you find out that that's actually not proof that some of the differences, even some of the differences in outcome are being driven by things like biological difference in interest than it radically weakens that central axiomatic claim of fundamental oppression. And so that's viewed as an existential threat by people for whom that's the cardinal presupposition is. That's how it looks to me.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       That is correct since since reading the righteous mind, I always like to analyze things in terms of what sacred, organized. They circle around it, that binds them together. There are a lot of things that people hold sacred, you know, on all sides, but I am struck by the fact that in the academy it's not just questioning sacred values of any sort. It's specifically questioning diversity policies. That seems to be the most dangerous thing to do and that does fit with what you said that it's like it's a big project that we're all engaged in and we'll working hard against the enemy and we're fighting the fight and if one of us steps out and said, well actually maybe we'll wrong on this point. Bang, we've got to shoot them. We can't have got to shooter.

Speaker 4:          00:55:16       Yeah. Now that probability would be proportionate to the centrality of the axiom. I think the central axiom here, that's it's causing all the trouble, is the insistence that the best way to insistence's one. Is that the best way to characterize Western society as an oppressive patriarchy?

Speaker 3:          00:55:36       That's right.

Speaker 4:          00:55:36       Yes. And, and the second is that the best way to characterize people is by their group and those two things interact. And so the gender data is particularly a horrifying, I would say to people who hold those axioms because, well, for two reasons, one is because the gender differences actually exist and they do account for differences in outcome, but even worse, and this is a catastrophe, I think for the social constructionist, is that as you put egalitarian social policies into play, that the very differences that you hate get bigger. And that's, and this needs to be said a thousand times because it really is, it's, it's a fatal blow to the social constructionist egalitarianism and even to the concepts they're using. Because one thing we could also ask is like, well, if turns out that men and women are as different in egalitarianism societies as boys and girls are in there, unsupervised play, I think is a reasonable analog, then we're going to have differences in outcome that are going to be magnified by the very policies that the egalitarian or putting in place. And then we also might ask to his inner truly, uh, in this society that we want to set up, maybe wouldn't have wanted to be the case that people's free choice would determine their occupational outcomes and then we have to put up with a certain degree of inequality of outcome and think in a complex way about it.

Speaker 2:          00:57:01       We were talking about about sacredness and one of the stories we talked about in the book, I know you're very well familiar with the Rebecca to bell story paper, an academic paper talking about, well, if we accept transsexuality, what implications does that have for someone like Rachel woke, kind of wants to decide what, what a, what a racist. She claimed that she was black heels, black inside. And um, and, and both John and I are very, we've really tried to sort of be reasonable as possible, aggressively reasonable. Um, but in that, in this one we, uh, we, we liken it to, um, a male Durkheim's definition of witch hunts because it really, unfortunately really set because you not only do you have this kind of like, you know, like normal, interesting intellectual exercise of an academic article and making an interesting point. It, she's treated absolutely like a blast summer and so badly that people are signing letters condemning her while at the same time emailing saying, oh, this is really terrible what happened to you.

Speaker 2:          00:58:03       Um, and it's just absolutely bizarre and scary as the smoking gun proves that there's a problem is when there are social consequences to make good faith are out in the public square. If you're in the comments section on Youtube, of course we're trying to do with universities, is this really unique and important thing which is create an environment in which people are expected to challenge each other. We're not supposed to be there to be agreeable and it all makes sense. It's all okay because it's the surface service of finding truth. And as soon as people who are taking part in that process are shamed, punished, excluded, there calls to expel them or punish them, as soon as that happens, now we have more of a sort of east German mindset where people are not thinking about what's true, they're thinking about, you know, what will, what will avoid getting in trouble, what am I allowed to say by the fact of what will get me incredible praise for being, throwing myself as a true believer.

Speaker 4:          00:59:00       Tremendous amount of authority is motivated by the desire to avoid being shunned and treated as the violator up at taboo because that's exactly what's happening is that there are, there are new taboos. So then part of the question might be to why is there such an insistence that the culture we live in is a patriarchal tyranny, which is also a collapse of complexity, right? I mean, obviously our culture has its flaws. It, it tends towards, um, rigidity and tyranny, like all cultures do. But comparatively speaking, as we've talked about before, by, by world standards today or by world standards, historically, it's a pretty damn free and, and productive culture. But we have this tremendous emphasis on the idea that it's fundamentally a patriarchal tyranny, and that if you a question that then you're treated as a taboo violator. So then the question is, well, what the hell is driving this insistence that it's a patriarchal purity with, with Kate Millett?

Speaker 4:          01:00:06       No, you see who originated, at least in part patriarchy theory. You see that she had a very, she had an alcoholic and abusive father. And so I think that's quite interesting because I think there are psychological dynamics here at work. I, I wonder to what degree the people who are pushing this theory, um, have had very disturbed interpersonal relationships, gender relationships, and that, that's, that's what would you say driving the collapse of their political viewpoint in to a single dimension like a single oversimplified dimension. You see that sort of oversimplified thinking when you look at, at, at, at psychopathological complexes, you know, like with, with, uh, with, with women, with eating disorders in particular, what men too. But that's rarer. Everything collapses to a single, uh, a single dimension of evaluation. Something like thin equals beautiful or thin equals good. And then that drives everything. And so, and then I also think maybe it is this also a challenge too to cultural tradition, an actual intellectual challenge. Say, well we think that your, your, your way of, of, of, of operating within the culture is too, too radical. That we're going to throw everything we can at you and an attempt to make you prove that that's not true. But I, I can't get any farther underneath it. The math.

Speaker 3:          01:01:30       So you're a clinical psychologist. So I think your first impulse is let's look to the person's formative experiences. Why do they think this way? I'm a social psychologist. So I think in terms of if there's some new or some interesting social movement, what are the social forces and pressures on them that led them to think this way? I also read a lot and think a lot about evolution. I like, and this is what first drew me to you. You went through when I met in 1994. We both loved Carl young and I love this idea of archetypes interpreted from an evolutionary point of view as to like, why do we dream about dragons? Why do so many cultures have dragons? Well, actually, you know, our ancestors, you know, 60 million years ago, actually, we're in a world of dinosaurs. That's a pretty cool idea. I don't know if that's right.

Speaker 3:          01:02:11       Anyway, I'm human beings have a tendency to think in a manichaean style. It's effortless. It's default for us to divide the world into good and evil. And that's why the third grade on truth in our book is the untruth of US versus them. Life is a battle between good people and evil people. It's very hard to teach this to people. Um, so, uh, so we think that is innate as a possibility. And then the question is why are some movements now teaching this and why is it making more progress in some areas the university now than it was 10 or 20 years ago? Um, so I think that, to answer your question, if you were engaged in a, in a radical program, radical means you want to tear things down, you want radical change, you need to demonize the country to the structure. You want to tear down, you need to say that America is the worst.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       America is a paragon of racism and sexism. And of course we have our problems. You know, most of us think that things have been getting steadily better since the 19th century. Um, but you're committed to saying that America is the worst. So there was an interesting study published a few months ago, if you've probably heard about this, it rent America as like the, like the twelfth worst country on earth for women. It was behind, you know, Eritrea and Sudan and you know, North Korea know it was the one of the worst places on earth to be a woman. And you know, just on the smell test and really like, um, you know, I don't want to go into why that's so wrong. But at the methodology it was, it was judged by her. I can't remember what it was. But despite, obviously it was in the judgment of like human rights activists or something like that, rights activists are generally many of them, and just American human rights activist. I was something like that. They are not weighing up statistics on how women fare around the world. They're being asked what are the worst countries for women? And if you were engaged in the project of critique in America, you're motivated to say that America is the worst. And that's explained that ranking

Speaker 4:          01:04:08       that justifies your continued activism and if that's what you've staked your career on them, that's also necessary. I also think that's one of the things that's driving all of the things that we're talking about is that we've produced a committed activists class that has been heavily subsidized for 30 years and they are always in need of reasons to justify their continued existence. I mean, as, as we all are, of course, but, but this is a situation where that's become dangerous,

Speaker 3:          01:04:35       committed activists class. Um, I think this is important also to focus on for a moment because in discussions of this, we're all supposed to praise the students political activity. We're all supposed to praise activism, um, and you know, Pepsi tried that disastrous commercial of just like, you know, random beautiful people being activist because if you have a bullhorn, bullhorn, that's political activity goes. So I think there is an idea among young people, and this is I think more true on the left, that to be political is to be protesting. Just telling me like why is it that the right when they're upset about something, they go and they get people to the school board and they changed the rules. Like the right I think is more pragmatic in its politics. The left is more expressive and I think this is a point that Mark Lilla has been made so ultimately ends up backfiring.

Speaker 3:          01:05:25       But I think that the, the, the, the respect that we accord to activism, pure and simple. I think that should be rethought and I might be about to do that. One President of a major university in this, in this region recently said something to the effect that universities are becoming ungovernable now. There's a lot of reasons for that. They face a lot of pressures, but the student activism, the fact that it's, it's. It can be anything. It's not addressed at injustice. It's addressed at something in the dining hall, something that a student, but it's because there are protests about almost anything I think many administrators are realizing what have we done, what kind of Frankenstein monster have we created by incentivizing and praising this kind of of, of, of activism.

Speaker 4:          01:06:15       Our whole being talking to politicians in Canada about the possibility of making a distinction between education and activism and political activism. So you know in Canada if you're a charitable organization, you can't engage in political activism now. It's very difficult to distinguish between what might constitute education and what might constitute activism, but the idea that there's something intrinsically moral and noble about, about, about complaining about the evil people in the world is definitely something you don't want literature. The humanities used to be the antidote to that to some degree because one of the things that characterize is great literature as opposed to secondary literature is that if the literature is great, the battle between good and evil occurs in the hearts of each protagonist, right? It's a psychological issue and not a sociological issue.

Speaker 3:          01:07:11       I'm turning here to our opening quotes. Um, and we already talked about one instance of one of our three opening quotes, the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And that is what we should be teaching students to complexify situation to the extent that we teach them. No, it's simple. If you know the category, you know their moral valence and you know there are bad. And so you've sent that. We are teaching students to think in this way. We are harming them. You're setting them up for failure. We are preparing them for citizenship in a democracy and we are harming the future of our country. And I probably have, I have a

Speaker 2:          01:07:48       little bit of insight, a as a first amendment lawyer, um, as someone who's spent a lot of time defending the rights protestors and I've dealt with very many protestors who were protesting utterly sensible things that I'm like absolutely more power to you. But also I've talked to other people who I felt were tilting at windmills or, or, or, um, one time representative group that was, or Algebra represented group that believed that the US should have no navy I'm talking about. So it's not that you think we should spend less on military, but we should literally have no navy. And that was the argument and I would ask some of my activist friends in San Francisco, some of them were doing, I think particularly with criminal justice and that kind of stuff, but another case. So they'd see sort of activists sort of groups that were, you know, for example, I opposed the second Iraq war.

Speaker 2:          01:08:41       Um, but I had friends who also oppose it would immediately go into a and nine slash 11 was a conspiracy to, to allow for the. I'm like, why are you moving it to that next argument where you're going to lose more people and the perception was that we have to keep the temperature at boiling point, we have to keep it a to 12 or else people will lose interest and I actually to in pinker is actually more correct on this is that we're actually creating virtually through some some of the postmodern is thoughts that we're creating, a situation in which actually progress is more or less hopeless and all you can really do a shout about it, which actually makes people more cynical and does less to achieve your goals. Whereas as pinker likes to point out, if we actually look at, well, what did we do that actually works and try to keep doing that, that's probably a better bet for actual progress knowing.

Speaker 4:          01:09:30       Welcome, perverse thing there too is that I believe this to be true. John, you mentioned that there's been a variety of books coming out. Maybe I could get that list and post them in the description of this youtube video that might be useful, but there's also a whole string of books that's been published lately, including Steven Pinker's book, enlightenment, now showing that the rate of economic progress around the world, especially with regard to lifting the abjectly poor out of poverty is increasing at an unparalleled rate and that might be a secondary benefit to the collapse of communism since 1989. A lot of things are driving it, but certainly some of it is the spread of ideas of individual sovereignty and the use of free market policies by developing countries. Just as we see the, the landscape for poor around the world to be radically improved during this process and the west of criticizing our fundamental principles to the point where we're.

Speaker 4:          01:10:28       We're driving a dangerous level of polarization. And so that's our very perverse and strange situation and difficult to contend with. So. All right, let's, let's switch a bit here. One of left. Okay. So while we see the problem, the problem is that we're still sketching it out and trying to articulate it, but it's something like the rise of a, a victim, victimizer culture that might be driven by young people's increasing sense of vulnerability as a consequence of the unexamined effects of social media, the big polarization driven by tendency for a dying media to come to concentrate on extremism, the domination of the intellectual discourse in the universities by the left and the radical left. All these things are playing together and they're causing a certain amount of trouble, like the rise of this excessive safety culture that has negative psychological consequences. All right, that's all dangerous. What do we do about it, Jonathan? You have the Heterodox Academy. So. So that's, that's, that's something you've put into practice that was designed to increase viewpoint diversity. Do you think that's. What's your sense of that? What's the consequence of that?

Speaker 3:          01:11:45       Yeah, so the problem is, as you said, as we say in the book, there's six different separate contributing factors all coming together. The solution is not easy. Let's break it down into what do we need to do to get our universities functioning better, what do we need to do to raise kids who are more resilient and more able to deal with difference? Let's focus on those two. So let's. So let's start with universities. So, uh, I cofounded Heterodox Academy, if you go to Heterodoxacademy.org with Nick Rosenkranz, last caller and Chris Martin, a Grad student in sociology and then a bunch of other social psychologists, um, because we were concerned that this is just a faculty initiative that discussions among professors of psychology and research and psychology was showing signs that certain hypotheses wouldn't be investigated. Other interpretations were favored. We were seeing signs and almost all of us were on the left or center. There are, there's only two conservative social psychologist that I know of.

Speaker 3:          01:12:46       We were concerned about research quality. That's all it was. And so we ended up putting up this site, went live on or about September 10th, 2015. Totally unrelated to that. Greg and I had been writing the Atlantic article totally separate track and then all hell broke loose at Halloween in 2015 and it became clear this isn't just a faculty issue. The problem on campus is a culture issue in which in which student, this new form of student activism, this new form of student, that belief in fragility is affecting how we do our research, how we educate, so all problems are interrelated a bit to focus on the faculty issue. What we're doing in Heterodox Academy. Provisionally, when I was running it, I thought the issue was, well, we have no political diversity. We need to get more. We need to encourage more conservatives and Libertarians to get phd's and then we need to help them get jobs.

Speaker 3:          01:13:35       That's what I thought originally, but over time the problem has morphed a and it's become clear. We do actually have some diversity in every field. Not everybody is on the left. A lot of people are in the center or libertarian or they say, I can't be putting a box, and what we have to do is encourage those people to feel that they can speak up, they can question dominant ideas, they can be a little subversive. Um, they have to make it so they're not afraid of social consequences for speaking of. So that's the way that I was thinking about it now. Uh, in Janet, last January, I turned over a heterodox academy. I hired an amazing woman, Deborah. She's a professor at Harvey Mudd College. She is leaving that job to run heterodox academy full time deb studies relationships. She's a great teacher. She is moving the organization to focus more on helping, helping campuses recreate that climate that we all know and love.

Speaker 3:          01:14:29       I mean, you know, we, I love being a professor. I love universities. I'm deb is focusing on how do we prepare students. And so we've talked a lot about this in the book. What do you do at orientation? What are the norms you made clear about speech and free speech. Of course we need to do training in diversity and inclusion and sexual violence, all that stuff, but how many schools trained for free speech? Pretty much none of them. Then the fact that we don't mention any of these deep philosophy, major concepts that will be deep philosophical underpinnings of academic freedom, freedom of speech, but there's just so much we can complain about students not knowing them when nobody's actually thought. So

Speaker 4:          01:15:06       it's been really interesting on this lecture tour and find out how receptive people are to exactly that kind of message, you know, and I've been beating the drum, let's say four or more conscious understanding of the relationship between meaning and personal responsibility because one of the things we also teach students is that, um, the proper focus for them is the violation of their intrinsic rights as if the upholding of those rights is going to provide them with a sustaining meaning in life. But I don't believe that that's true. I think that what's, what's more true is that most people find a sustaining meaning by adopting a fairly heavy burden of personal responsibility partly for themselves and partly for their family. And partly for the broader community and that, that that just seems to have dropped out of the public discourse in its entirety and then also what could be taught to incoming students is this clinical doctrine that we've been describing, which is well, how do you make yourself stronger while you expose yourself voluntarily to challenges that are outside of your domain of current competence and that often involves confronting things that not only that you think are frightening, but you might also think are disgusting because that's what happens with obsessive compulsive disorder treatment, you know, and discussed, obviously runs a motivates some of this political polarization.

Speaker 3:          01:16:31       That's right. Somebody alerted me, somebody as civil rights scholar told me about how the marchers in the sixties, how they trained and here they are going in to a staging, protests going in, doing sit ins facing real violence, and some of them were actually killed. The way they prepared for it was others would shout racist slurs at them. They will be prepared for it. They would expose themselves to the worst and then when the worst happens, at least it was less painful than had they not encountered it. So again, over and over again, we see. Are you, is your goal to toughen yourself up? Is your goal to become stronger and more able to deal with the world as it is or is your goal to demand

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       that somebody make the world other than. Yeah, which is the which is the more reliable path to success in life. I'm in both John and I, I'm president of fire and through Heterodox we're both trying to also figure out ways to get to people well before they set foot on a college campus. No, certainly I think it's kind of unforgivable that most universities don't teach about some of these philosophies and concepts in orientation, but you should be learning about some of these ideas when, when you're, when you're in high school. So one thing that John did that I'm totally jealous of is they did a graphic novel version of a part of chapter two of on liberty about freedom of speech as a great way to tell a generation students about. And I also just love on liberty predictably argument, freedom of speech as a lawyer because I'm like this guy because this guy argued being able to defend the decision to defend blasts one meal to go up against blasphemy prohibitions at 18, 59, but then managed to say, and by the way, you know, you know, who suffered under blasphemy laws, Jesus and socrates guess enforced them.

Speaker 2:          01:18:20       Marcus Aurelius also one of your heroes and it's like you just won the case. You're a world class. So let me suggest that viewers go to Amazon and look up all minus one a or go to heterodoxacademy.org/mill. We can get a free version of pdf or you can have a $3 kindle version of it as well as the printed Arco. Great. Put that in the description as well. Great. So yeah, so high school, any high school that wants to teach about free speech and sign this, it's extremely readable by high school students. It's just chapter two, cut by 50 percent. And metaphors are illustrated. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:18:59       Okay. Well, so the free speech issue too. So one of the concepts that I've been wrestling with is we have to produce hierarchies in order to accomplish tasks collectively and we have to accomplish tasks because they're suffering to address real problems to solve. So we're going to produce hierarchies and hopefully the hierarchies are predicated on merit in relationship to the solution of the problem. And so the right winger types are more inclined to support hierarchical structures because of their psychological predisposition and the left wingers are more likely to be concerned about the fact that the hierarchy's inevitably dispossessed because they'll produce on equal distribution of resources. Okay. So then you can imagine that the political landscape is a battleground, are permanent battleground between those who stand for the hierarchies and note that they have their utility but are perhaps blind to their proclivity to become tyrannical. And those who are more sensitive to the claims of the dispossessed and worried about the proclivity of tyranny, of hierarchies to become, um, predicated on nothing but power. At some points the hierarchy is going to be weak and need to be strengthened. And the other points, there has to be more clamor on the side of the dispossessed and the reason you have free speech as far as I'm concerned is because it's the mechanism that keeps those two to opponent process, opponent process processes balanced. And so it's a core, it's the core element of a free society because it's actually the process by which the society maintains and improves itself across time. So it's not just another value among many values

Speaker 2:          01:20:54       is one of the founding fathers were really good evolutionary psychologists. Um, and one thing that I love about working in constitutional law is just how both pessimistic and optimistic it was at the same time were the tensions of Alexander Hamilton and Madison were so concerned about like, how do you, how do you balance out these natural human, it's human nature. Whereas today, you know, we're supposed to claim the reason. There isn't any such thing as human nature on. The other thing is I have a slightly different philosophy on, on freedom of speech. It's actually much simpler than a lot of sort of like the more sort of like platonic, platonic ideal of truth, which is simply that it's always valuable to know what people really think as simple as that sounds. It does mean that when people say, well, you certainly certainly you shouldn't be listening to conspiracy theorists and what they, what they say about stuff. And I'm like, if it's a popular conspiracies, shouldn't you have some clue about what some of the population actually thinks about things? And I think that we, we, uh, that understanding what people you despise actually think and believe is always a value because the project itself is a project of human knowledge. No one human beings as they actually are not as we wish they were.

Speaker 4:          01:22:09       I can use that terminology. It's like if I want to know what you're going to do and I do, especially if I happen to be near you or, or have you or have to interact with you repeatedly. If I know what you think and I can understand how you're going to ask, and if I don't know how you, how you think, partly because you're not allowed to express it, then you're an opaque mystery to me and the probability that we're going to engage in conflict goes up tremendously. So I mean there are multiple reasons for for the, for protecting the sanctity. Let's say a free speech. Now, one of the things that really distresses me about the postmodern slash neo Marxist philosophy is that there isn't any room in that philosophy for the idea of free speech. Know this is something I've come to understand more deeply over the last two years.

Speaker 4:          01:23:02       When you're talking to someone from that theoretical. They can't engage in the discussion about free speech because it doesn't fit into their worldview because all there is. There isn't sovereign individuals engaging in a discussion about the nature of reality. There's avatars of their power group unconsciously making claims on behalf of their privilege and that there's never free speech there because you don't want a free agent. You're not even a real entity as an individual. And, and, and that's a far more pernicious assault on free speech than mere objection to it, as you know, a, a right wing as something that's been hijacked by the right wing to, to validate their power, their particular privilege,

Speaker 2:          01:23:47       because this is one of the main arguments that we get back, is a free speech is just a way for the powerful to retain their power. Greg's cause when the Nazis started having rallies for free speech. So that's really not what you want. What's your response when people say free speech is just to help some powerful. It drives me nuts because it's a fundamental misunderstanding of history and government and political philosophy. And I've, I've had this argument with Stanley fish and it seemed like a total shock to him. I'm sure it'd be thought of it before, but you don't need a special protection of an individual, right? I'm in a democracy. Um, uh, uh, for the majority, you, first of all, rich people and powerful people under any system of government where rich people's under communism, you know, don't do so well. Um, once they take over, but after they take over, you know, like the KGB people get rich and powerful. People are always going to be fine. If you set up a democracy, I'm, the majority is always, if there's a consistent majority, the majority is always going to be fine. You only need a special protection of freedom of speech for minority points of view.

Speaker 4:          01:25:00       No, I know. It's absolutely amazing that that's not.

Speaker 2:          01:25:06       And John Roche and it was really interesting. Refresh has a lot of interesting because he says it's like, listen, if you've reached the point where there's enough, uh, enough people who are worried about your wellbeing, that they're willing to pass a law and a majority country to get you protected. It probably means the real dark days are behind you. Um, and one of the things that we've talked about me and Roche is that if we passed an anti, sort of a hate speech law saying the late 19 sixties, it would have frozen in place kind of attitudes about homosexuality, which he was concerned about. And I think we would have ended up with a law that looked a lot more like what you see in Russia that actually ends up being used against a gay people that then then rather these sort of progressive law that we hope it would be. But time and time again, the idea that you like, by the way I'm going, I keep on trying to put this out to from a very practical way like so you want laws that define that, that allow the government to stop hateful speech and you want trump

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       and some.

Speaker 4:          01:26:06       There's an old military doctrine which is whatever weapon you design your enemies will have in 15 years. And if you start putting restrictions on something like free speech as a, as a benefit to your ideological position and you don't imagine that you might be out maneuvered in their use by your enemies, then you're not sufficiently awake. So when I did a lecture a year and a half ago, which was a left wing case for free speech, and I just thought that was self evident for the reasons that you put forward, which is well the powerful, and you can use leftwing terminology here, the powerful have an a priori monopoly on speech obviously. And so you want to put protections in place so that the dispossessed who you hypothetically champion get a chance to put their viewpoint forward. And it's really, it's quite a mystery that, that that's not merely axiomatically obvious now. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:27:06       Well, you know, it's not Caesar calling for free speech. It's the easy thing to do is say, okay, well then it must be bad.

Speaker 4:          01:27:14       Yeah. Yes. Well, okay. So tell me, let's go back to the book. So how you said earlier when we talked before the interview that it had, you know, in the New York Times bestseller list and it seems to be selling well, what are you hoping, what do you see happening as a consequence of your essay in the Atlantic and, and as a consequence of the book and what you hope will happen, like say over the next year if we're going to be optimistic about where we're headed, what's going to happen?

Speaker 3:          01:27:46       So I felt for the last two years that we're kind of in an emperor's new clothes situation where most people who are paying attention, most people are involved in universities or an education realized that something wrong, but they don't understand what it is and nobody wants to appear insensitive. The people don't want to stand up and critique if it seems that you're pushing back against it, against the historical marginalized groups in particular. So there's been. So university administrators, we spoke to a lot of college presidents. They're overwhelmingly, what I would call it, liberal left, not illiberal. I don't know of any college presidents who are illiberal, but they're often afraid to stand up for what you've observed you to Evergreen State University. So. Yes, that's right. That's right.

Speaker 3:          01:28:28       Yeah, that's right. So there's been a lot of desire to change, a lot of desire to restore some sense of ordering community on campus that we can do our work and our teaching. Um, and, but, but I'm hopeful that our book will do, is give everyone a common set of concepts and, and sort of a look into how this thing plays out if you, if you don't do anything to stop it going down this rabbit hole. Um, my hope for the book is that the parenting stuff is, is new. That is a lot of people have been what's going on on campus, but they don't realize this is now happening in high schools. And so my hope is that every, every school principal from elementary school through high school and every college president will get a copy of the book in the mail or given to them by a donor, Jordan, Jordan's large audience. I hope that you will buy a copy of the book and give it to the principal of your kids' elementary school and certainly

Speaker 4:          01:29:27       maybe we can put that in the description as well.

Speaker 3:          01:29:30       Makes a great gift to the people who are educating your children.

Speaker 4:          01:29:34       Right? I'll, I'll write that down right now.

Speaker 3:          01:29:37       Reaching parents. So that's always the first constituency we talk about because, you know, we hear it from parents over and over again as parents ourselves. There's this kind of like there's a sense that something's really going wrong in k through 12 education. Certainty there's something more going on than just the process of parenting where most people feel kind of. That seems like a lot of parents feel sort of helpless because they don't have that pluralistic ignorance problem. They don't know that everybody else having the same problems and as soon as you actually get the conversation started, if we can get to parents, we, uh, we have a real fighting chance.

Speaker 4:          01:30:13       Okay. Alright. Well, um, what, what do you think? Are you optimistic or pessimistic about where this is going at the moment?

Speaker 3:          01:30:24       No kidding. That's exactly. You hit a little bit of both. I'm very pessimistic about the national situation. I think polarization is going to get worse for awhile while, and so I think we have to think about how do we adapt our institutions to life in an increasingly polarized country. So if know politics is, is dominating everything and it's getting nastier and Nastier, it would be great if when you go into a restaurant, you don't have to think about, is this a Democrat restaurant? When you go into buy a pair of sneakers, you don't have to think about, is this a democratic pair of sneakers, a Republican pair of sneakers? So we maybe go into the rope to everything is polarized, everything's political. That'd be terrible if universities to come to that, if this is a Democrat university or public, that would be terrible. Um, so I think on the national level I'm very pessimistic, but I think that there is enough recognition that we're all exhausted.

Speaker 3:          01:31:16       This is, this is out of control, but I think we will have a, it'll be possible to get a constituency to say our elementary schools or middle schools or high schools. And universities, they have work to do, um, uh, we need to reform what we're doing in ways that are better for the kids. We all love our kids, we all want our kids to be resilient. So I like Greg, I'm very optimistic that, that the trend towards overprotective parenting, which has just been continuing on and on. I'm very optimistic that, that will reverse once people see those graphs once people and you talk to parents of teenagers, even if their kid isn't depressed, seven of their kids' friends, depressed or anxious.

Speaker 4:          01:31:55       Okay. So let me ask you about that a little bit and maybe we'll end with this. Um, I've been trying to figure out why this overprotectiveness epidemic has emerged. And so I took the social, psychological root of analysis instead of the psychological. Because I do know you should look at situational factors before you look at app in personality factors. Let's say generally speaking, well, here's some demographic trends. Um, fewer kids. So maybe parents don't make their kids resilient. Maybe siblings do, you know, because there's a lot of, there's a lot of uh, uh, what would you call status competition between siblings and if you're special or unreasonable, [inaudible] your siblings are going to have a field day with you. And so, you know, maybe we can't raise kids that are resilient unless they have three brothers and sisters or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:32:54       That makes a lot of sense. But my recollection was elicits a cela what was it, the guy who wrote birth order, what was that book? My recollection is that the effects of birth out are actually very small. And so whether you're a first or last, whether you're an only child or not. So research one back very far, those effects are pretty small. So I would not put this big change on the factor of declining families because you don't have siblings rather declining families means there just aren't that many kids in the neighborhood.

Speaker 4:          01:33:24       Yeah. Well that's the other issue. Sure, sure, sure. Because more significant. So then next thing, next thing might be older parents know we don't know how optimally stupid you should be when you're a, when you're a parent, and it might be that you might need to be somewhat narcissistically entranced with your own life to ignore your children enough to allow them to develop independent resilience, you know, and if you're, if now let's say you don't have a child until you're, well let's say 40, you only have one or two, so they're pretty damn precious and you'd been waiting a long time and now you're more conservative because you're older because you will be and you have endless resources to devote to this extraordinarily valuable individual. So, so if it, if it's, if it's the consequence of it switch and demographics and, and, and older parents, then it's going to be a harder thing to rectify as a consequence of transformation of attitude.

Speaker 3:          01:34:30       Nicholas is major, major theory on this stuff. And at the same time, you know, you have to say some things that really have changed. And definitely what first, I'm a first generation American. I'm the, uh, but the idea that there's this sort of like a, of the stratification in the US in terms of income is getting so dramatic and the way you can get to that life raft is getting into a princeton or Stanford

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       or Harvard, um, that, that's not entirely in people's heads, but unfortunately the way we thought that, the best way to do that is to build these sort of rocket ship hyper invested in. We have two kids and you treat them both, like keep seeking missiles and you completely eliminate any autonomy over their lives. They get up at six and they're scheduled until they go to bed. Um, it turns out that this is visibly dysfunctional. At the same time, it's why we interviewed Julie Haines who wrote a book called how to raise an adult about how, you know, freshmen are showing up at Stanford. I'm depressed partially because they have been no sense of locus of control of their life. So I think there is a really stunning success that we found in researching the book. It's no surprise that meant if you compare it, if you go back to the 19 fifties and sixties, look at how men spend their time and today it's no surprise that men are spending more time in childcare and more time with their kids.

Speaker 2:          01:35:54       That's great. We all think that's great. What do you think has happened to women? Women were very rarely working in the fifties and sixties and so look, the number of hours they spent two and childcare involve their children back then getting us going up or down since the fifties or sixties. Now they most women are working. Answer one more time with their kids and there are very few kids now. So you have mom and dad both spending more time with their one or two kids supervising over investing. They're not a lot of kids out in the neighborhood and investing poorly. And that's important is right there. That's right. Because we're investing in a what? A net zero calls. Concerted cultivation. We have the two, the two.

Speaker 4:          01:36:32       Here's another. Here's another conundrum. So one of the things that struck me is that a lot of this gender play that you see gender roleplay that you see in among adolescents now, older adolescents and young adults in university. So the gender bender and gender fluidity a games and I'm calling them games for a reason. They remind me of pretend play within insistence by the player that everyone joins the game. And I've been thinking, well maybe we're seeing a delayed reaction to the eradication of fantasy play in early childhood as a consequence of the introduction of technological devices. Because you know, the developmental psychologists know very well that children have to engage in a lot of fantasy play. And then if you introduce technology that that interferes with that or supersedes if then the fantasy play doesn't do occurred. You're playing with different roles when you're engaged in fantasy play.

Speaker 4:          01:37:31       So I'm also wondering, you know, because I noticed even when I had kids, which is no for a long time ago, often when I took them to the houses of other people with kids, instead of letting the kids go off and caused a bit of trouble and then settle into a spontaneous fantasy play episode, they'd put on a video, but now that's like 20 times is bad because all kids have access to endless electronic devices and we don't know what that's doing to the early childhood play and so well. So anyways, those are some of the sociological forces that I thought might be at work that are driving this hype of protectiveness and if it isn't obvious to see how to reverse them because they're not happening consciously in some sense. Right. It's not like everybody decided that they were going to hyper protect their children.

Speaker 3:          01:38:20       Yeah. But I think social norms are very powerful and if everybody else acts like letting your kid walk a dog is dangerous, you'll be less likely to let your kid walk the dog. It should be possible to reverse that. What we're hoping will emerge from this book and our discussions, the book is the norm that if you're not letting your kid out, you're harming your kid. Almost like a vitamin deficiency. I'd like to know if doctor story, if pediatricians and the pediatricians just put out a big report on the importance of play at kids need a lot more play than they're getting vitamin P and how much vitamin P did your kid get today? And parents and vitamin D is not. It doesn't count if you were there with them. So, um, so if we start, if pediatricians aren't asking them how much vitamin peg kid get less and only tell me about the unsupervised time. So, so we look at the idea because you know, so your point about the shrinking families is, is right and that's irreversible. We're never going to go back to large families. We have to adapt to that. And if you really want your kid to be successful, he'll back off. That's the idea. We have to get across.

Speaker 4:          01:39:30       Look, your kid's going to have to encounter the full tragedy of life as they mature and become adults.

Speaker 3:          01:39:37       You're trying to do what you're trying to do. I mean, there are all sorts of things. So when Nisha said what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, the principle is true, but it's not literally true and the research on adverse childhood experiences and we talk a fair amount about advocating for that, but certainly for goodness sakes, you know, the ability to get in fights with other kids and resolved among themselves. We got rid of that and now we have a generation that's looking upwards.

Speaker 4:          01:40:23       Say whatever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. So he certainly knew that something. Right? So it's a matter of optimal exposure to challenge and it's by challenging your kid's not five, protecting them that you make them resilient and they need to be resilient because life is actually difficult. And so, you know, one of the things that's been gratifying to me too is during my lectures I've been telling people that the idea that they're okay the way they are, especially if young is an appalling idea. What they could be concentrating on is who they could be. One of the really positive elements to the notion of optimal challenges, but it's really, um, it's encouraging for people to know that you're willing to let them take a risk because you have enough faith in their ability to learn and prevailed that, that supersedes the risk.

Speaker 4:          01:41:21       All right. Well thank you guys very much appreciated the discussion. We'll get this up as soon as I get it edited, which shouldn't be too long and if you would be so kind as to send me all the url links you'd like me to post in the description, then I would be more than happy to do that. And good luck with your continued sales of your book and with all your other endeavors as well. And hopefully a good sense will prevail and we can do something to reverse this polarization and to, and also maybe to reduce the safety culture on in the education system. That would really be something. Thank you, Jordan. Jordan. Good to see you both.
