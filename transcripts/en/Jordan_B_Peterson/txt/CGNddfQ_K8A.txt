Speaker 1:          00:01          I'm very pleased to announce the new partnership between Westwood One America's largest audio network and the Jordan B. Peterson podcast with the premier episode release this Sunday, March 24th subsequent podcasts will be released every Sunday featuring lectures about issues of profound psychological and social importance and discussions with leading scientists, philosophers and authors. I'm also very happy that I will be joined in this revised podcast by my daughter, Mikayla Peterson, who will serve as cohost and discuss it. It's a project we have both been excited to develop and they're looking forward to continually improving. We hope that the Westwood one partnership will improve the quality of our production and introduce many new listeners to the podcast.
