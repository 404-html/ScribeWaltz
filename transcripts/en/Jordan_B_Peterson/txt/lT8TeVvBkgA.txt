Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:32          so today I'm going to tell you the best three stories that I know. I think these stories are absolutely phenomenally potent and the reason for that is that I think they illustrate in an extraordinarily powerful way the nature of the processes that lead to the establishment of Western democratic ideals received whose work I rely on substantially substantially to make the following argument has taken Western academic culture to task in a manner that hasn't fully been revealed yet. He said that like all human cultures, the West is parochial and narrow in its viewpoint, and although over the last 300 years, there's been a substantial amount of cross cultural intermingling and a potential broadening of philosophical and religious horizon broadening has not been sufficiently complete.

Speaker 2:          01:39          If we build on the viewpoint that I've been developing with you over the last few courses and make the presupposition that religious modes of thinking are more phenomenological than they are rational, which means that they deal more with what you experience say. Then with the objective world, if we look at archaic religious stories through that Lens, then they can start to open up and so given that I want to open up three religious stories to you today too, in depth and one only in passing because we'll return to it later. I'll start with a Judaeo Christian myth of genesis. When I say myth, I don't mean untruth. I mean a form of knowledge that's narrative instructor and predicated on presumptions that aren't empirical. A myth describes processes of transformation. A myth describes the process whereby elements of experience come into being and transform. The fundamental structural elements of genesis are the word of God and chaos and Hebrew, words for chaos and waste our tail for chaos and Tau who for waste and Tom in particular, Tohu who as well are very interesting words because you can track their derivation historically and sometimes if you can track the derivation of words historically, you can get some sense of the culture mill you out of which the word sprang, and we know what time at means because we have written records of a story that involves a character named ty Matt and time out as a dragon who lives at the bottom of the ocean.

Speaker 2:          03:24          In the oldest creation myth we have, which is the Enuma Elish, the Sumerian creation myth, Sumeria, Babylon acadia rightly regarded as the birthplace of modern western civilization.

Speaker 2:          03:44          In Genesis two, processes unite to produce being the first of those processes are states is chaos represented by tail Marto, who? The second of those processes is logos and logos is another word that has an extraordinarily broad range of meaning. It's generally transcribed in the Christian tradition has the word, and it's identified with Christ, which is a very peculiar identification because it's the word of God that creates order out of chaos, and of course the word of God in Genesis is a phenomena that predates the birth of Christ infinitely from a classical religious perspective, so the fact that the two beings are identified as a great peculiarity and also of great interest, the fundamental story of genesis as something like this and it's perhaps the most brilliant contribution of Judeo Christian thought to world history, it's, it's total impact is virtually incalculable. The idea is this, that chaos can be conceptualized as something that has an essentially feminine aspect as a matrix and a matrix is a structure from which other structures emerge and the story in genesis makes the hypothesis that logos, which is the word of God, a phenomena associated with speech and communication and logic, logos, logic, rationality, courage, exploration, all combined into a single entity or a trait logos.

Speaker 2:          05:27          The combination of logos and chaos is what brings order into being. That's what the story in genesis means. It's not an empirical description of the origin of objects. It's a phenomenological description of the origin of experience, the idea being that without the piercing glance of whatever consciousness is, whatever the background of experience is, the Matrix, chaos cannot be conceptualized as real. It takes the interplay between the feminine principle chaos and the masculine principle logos in order to produce being now that's of substantial importance when you give some consideration to the fact that immediately in genesis, after the establishment of livable order, the data Yahuah identifies as the individual human being with logos right made in God's image. That's the essential characteristic of the human being and what that means is that the logo is that operates in human beings, which is this capacity to make order out of chaos is identical to the principal. That gives rise to the cosmos from a mythological perspective, so it partakes of the daddy in a very direct sense. In so far as being itself is dependent on its operation. Now, it's still possible to claim given that perspective that a story with that sort of structure is superstitious and then it doesn't bear any relationship. To what actually constitutes reality, but you have to understand that that story, old as it is, is predicated on older stories and it's on the ground that those older stories established that our entire concept of natural rights rests. So if you believe that natural rights have an existence that's more than merely arbitrary,

Speaker 2:          07:24          the reason you believe that is because they're predicate, those rights are predicated on the ideas that are expressed in these myths. Okay, so now we're going to go back in time to Sumeria and I'm going to show you how this Sumerian creation myth lays itself out. And not only that, I'm going to describe to you the direct political implications of the enumerated list, the Sumerian creation myth, because the political implications of that myth are well understood because the political structure of Sumeria was directly associated with the structure of the myth because the Sumerian emperor was regarded as the earthly representative of the highest God in the Mesopotamian Pantheon, whose name was Marta. So in so far as you were emperor, the reason that you were emperor, and this is what gave your sovereignty

Speaker 2:          08:17          legitimacy, right? Because sovereignty has to have legitimacy, otherwise there's constant revolutions. What gave sovereignty legitimacy in Mesopotamia was the identification of the emperor with Marta and that has, that has certain implications for the emperor, which we'll discuss in some detail. The story starts like this, you've got this dragon, Talia, Matt, and tie them out is a great primordial beast who lives at the bottom of the ocean and the ocean is water and water is associated with the primal element in archaic thinking, and I you. There's reasons for that already. If you viewed the transformation of deserts as a consequence of rain can understand why water would be considered the element that gives life, right? That the element that that brings life fourth, and we know from an evolutionary perspective that that's accurate and we know that we're 90 percent water and so to consider water.

Speaker 2:          09:13          The primal element is no trivial conclusion. No, no less than presuming that the sun is the ultimate source of life, the ultimate God, because the sun is the ultimate source of life as far as we're concerned on earth, right? Because it's the source of all our energy. These aren't stupid concepts. All right, so timeout is this horrible creature that lurks at the bottom of the primal element right now. She has a husband app suit. Now, the massive Batavia and creation myth doesn't say much about Appsu. We only know that he's the male consort of the dragon of chaos, and we know from reading other sources of mythology that the male consort of the dragon of chaos generally represents either logos or culture. So we're gonna make the presupposition in this particular case that the husband of chaos is order or culture. Okay? And then the Mesopotamians don't say much about that.

Speaker 2:          10:04          That that doesn't. The development of the idea of apps who are order or culture doesn't. It doesn't take new force until the ancient Egyptians. We'll talk about them today too. Okay, so timeout naps who are locked into a kind of sexual embrace according to the Mesopotamian creation, death. And what does that mean? It kind of means two things. It means that they're not really distinguishable because they're locked into this embrace and it also means that they're up to something creative because the act of sexual congress in mythology is most usefully, is most frequently utilized as representation of something creative or as representation of the probability of some new form coming to be right. All right, so cop suit and tie them out are locked into this embrace in a state that other creation myths describe as egg, like the pre cosmo Gonek egg, there are intermingling gives rise to the initial state of being according to the Sumerians and the initial state of being. According to the Sumerians is characterized by the dominion of the elder gods. These gods feeding none to bright make a tremendous amount of racket doing things well. What does that mean exactly?

Speaker 3:          11:27          Well,

Speaker 2:          11:29          it means something like this. They make a lot of racket and they cause a lot of trouble. They make a lot of wind and all of their racket and trouble and wind and activity. Rouses tire. Matt, what does that mean?

Speaker 2:          11:43          Well, it means if you do things, you get in trouble. It means even if you're trying to solve problems, you get into trouble because the solution to a problem, Chin tends to generate a whole bunch of new problems, right? It's like the Hydra, so what it means is that it's more or less fainted that any form of activity whatsoever is likely to produce the threat of catastrophe, and of course we're absolutely keenly aware of that in the modern world because were possessed by this sense that all of our frenetic activity, all of our frenetic motivated activity is producing alterations in the world order such that nature itself is going to be destroyed and eliminate us,

Speaker 2:          12:37          and of course we're absolutely keenly aware of that in the modern world because were possessed by this sense that all of our frenetic activity, all of our frenetic motivated activity is producing alterations in the world order such that nature itself is going to be destroyed and eliminate us. Right? That's classic Sumerian fear and nothing's changed in the last 5,000 years. The Sumerians presumed that once the elder gods were constructed and started moving around on the planet, that their activity, they're mindless activity. Because remember, these aren't well integrated motivational forces. They're more like primordial beasts right there on the integrated activity risks, plunging everything back in chaos. Well Tire Max, the representative of chaos, this generative chaos, but so what? At the Sumerian say, well, the elder gods caused a lot of racket. They move around the planet and they upset time at and she decides that enough is enough and she's going to wipe them out.

Speaker 2:          13:43          So she's sitting at the bottom of the ocean, fuming away as the elder gods go about their business, and then they take one step too many and they kill Appsu. Who's her husband. Now the Sumerian creation myth doesn't say much about this, but we know that aps who is the male consort of chaos, that makes it harder. So what happens is the elder gods destroy order itself. They destroyed culture itself, and as soon as you've destroyed culture, all hell breaks loose. And that's exactly what happens in the Sumerian creation myths. So tye Maddie merges just going to wipe everything out and the world will revert back to its primordial non-existent state. Now the elder gods get wind of this, and of course they're just terrified because they know that this thing that gave rise to them, whatever it is, the matrix of being can easily wipe them out at a moment's notice, and so despite the fact that they're transpersonal and immortal and characterized by a certain amount of power in the face of absolute chaos, they're insufficient.

Speaker 2:          14:45          Now this occurrence is extending over a protracted period of time, and as elder gods are threatened, they're also breeding and mating and producing new forms, and they produce a great, great grand son whose name is Marta. Now, mark has a lot of very interesting attributes. The attributes are described in the Enuma elish in the following manner. So this is what [inaudible] father sees when his wife Damn Kina gives birth to Marduk. So when he who's murdered, his father saw his son, he rejoiced. He beamed. His heart was filled with joy. He distinguished him and conferred upon him double equality with the gods. Okay, so that's the first indication that whatever Martik represents is something that's elevated beyond the normal status of a primordial daddy. So that he was highly exalted and surpassed them in everything artfully arranged beyond comprehension, where his members not fit for human understanding, hard to look upon for where his eyes forward, his ears, when his lips move, fire blazed forth.

Speaker 2:          15:48          Each of his four years grew large and likewise his eyes to see everything he was exalted among God's surpassing was his form. His members were gigantic. He was surpassing in height. Mary Youtube, Mary Youtube, one of his names, son of the son, God the son, God of the Gods. Okay. Complex bit of poetry. It says a bunch of things. It says, well, whatever Martech is is the offspring of the gods. Whatever Marta is, is characterized by high heightened awareness, right? Because he has four years and four eyes and they're large. Whatever Martech is characterized by as the status that surpasses that of his father's. Whatever he's characterized by is associated with the power of speech. Real power, because when he speaks fire spurts. Fourth Marta is also huge, but more importantly, he's associated in this particular poem with a Sun. Why is that? Well, the sun dominates consciousness, right?

Speaker 2:          16:46          Because we're conscious during the day, most of our brain is visual Cortex, so we're visual creatures, so when the sunrises is when the day begins, so Martin is also associated with whatever dandy dominates the day, and that's the daddy of consciousness and there's more to the story of the Sun, right? Because the sun is also something that rises and sets repeatedly, and that means that the dandy that dominates consciousness is characterized by a cyclical nature. That's a son. Myth, sunrises in the morning renewed as a consequence of fighting a terrible battle in the night with the enemies of everything that's associated with consciousness. A Classic Solar Myth,

Speaker 2:          17:30          so absolutely entire Matt give rise to the world of the gods, the activity of the world of Gods reawakens timeout. She decides to destroy everything, but at that moment the gods give birth to mark. Now, that's a typical motif which is that the is born at the time of maximal crisis, and the reason for that is in part it's simple. Look, if your culture is dealing well with the forces of the unknown so that everything is static, static but productive, so the problems themselves don't arise. There's no reason for the hero, right? There's no reason to confront the unknown. It's only when crisis beckons that the birth of the hero is necessary. Marta constitutes the birth of the hero and they say, look, you know, we're in real trouble unless someone goes out there and confronts tire Matt Straight on, she's going to wipe everything out. Um, it's a dangerous and terrifying job, but somebody has to do it. And Mark says, oh, well that's no problem, but I got a few rules here and this is the first rule I'm in charge from here on forward. What does that mean exactly?

Speaker 3:          18:43          Well,

Speaker 2:          18:44          these archaic stories, our policy in our policy mic in Northrup fries terminology, and what that means is that they can be misread validly had multiple levels of analysis simultaneously. And so one thing it means is that if you take the two year old child who's essentially under the dominion of assorted primordial Gods and Goddesses, right? Aggression, fear, panic, and according to Freud, a certain degree of sexual aggression,

Speaker 2:          19:18          the child moves from domination, from motivated state to domination for motivated state, and it isn't until the age of three and four when under the pressure applied by the social world and as a consequence of the maturation of the prefrontal Cortex, which matures throughout childhood and adolescence and doesn't reach its final form until perhaps into the early twenties. All of those fundamental motivational us to start taking on a structured relationship to one another, which is to say that once your, as your personality becomes integrated, a single motive force forward has to bring all of these underlying motivational systems into some sort of harmonious arrangement. Okay, so let's, let's see what the Sumerians are doing here. Okay. First of all, they're, they're doing psychology. They're trying to figure out, given the dominion of the elder gods, the indisputable dominion of the elder gods instincts. Who should rule, right? What should be in charge, how do you construct the hierarchy of values and then more complex. Lee, when you integrate a state, which is what? The mesopotamians dead, right? The first great civilization, what does that mean? The first time hundreds of tribes were hammered into some sort of stable hierarchical order. How do you represent that order?

Speaker 2:          20:44          So Marta gets his act together. The gods all meet in a huge chamber. They elect him king. Then they prepare them for battle. When the gods, the father's beheld the power of his word, they were glad and then homage saying Martin is king. They bestowed upon them a sceptre, a throne, and a royal robe that gave him an irresistible weapons. Fighting the enemy saying Golan cutoff the life of Tire Matt may the winds carry her blood out of the way. Places after the gods, his father's had determined the destiny of Martech. They set them on the road the way to success and attainment.

Speaker 2:          21:21          So then he goes to the heart of darkness, so to speak, and confronts tire. Matt accuses her of treachery and challenges are to battle. When ty Imad heard this, she became like one in a frenzy and lost her reason. She cried out loud and furiously to the very roots or two legs, shook back and forth. She recited an incantation repeatedly casting her spell. As for the gods of battle, they sharpen their weapons, Tiamat and Marduk the wisest of the gods advanced against one another. They pressed onto single combat and approached for battle. Okay, well, things don't go out so well with timeout. From this point forward, the first thing that Martech does, it encapsulate her and then net, and I think that's a really interesting metaphor because that's essentially what human beings do when they encounter the unknown, right? They encapsulated in an explanatory network, so it's a way of binding up the the anomaly or the unknown and giving it a substantive form.

Speaker 2:          22:24          Then he cuts her into pieces and then he makes the world out of her pieces. In fact, one of Martin's names is he who makes ingenious things as a consequence of the combat with tire mapped. Oh, that's very, very interesting because what it means is that the Samaritans are presenting in metaphorical forum. The notion that when the chips are down, the survival of being depends on the capacity of whatever Martech represents the solar God to encounter the Matrix of being, to cut it into pieces and to make the world. If you think about it in those terms, it's a very, very straightforward story, right? It's basically the story of human beings. Fundamentally the story of human beings because we in the words of a famous evolutionary psychologist whose name completely escapes me. We occupied the cognitive niche, right? Our motive being his creativity and the in the face of the unknown and when chaos threatens the established motive being.

Speaker 2:          23:25          It's necessary for us to put our creativity into action and to carve out new territory or territory as a consequence of encounter with the unknown. Why? Well, because we can take the world apart with our hands and put it together in new ways and then we can scold what we've done verbally and we can transmit it to another person and then they can do the same thing and we're all doing this all the time and we're all telling each other how we're doing it. And that's how the embodiment of logos in the human being, which is precisely equivalent to the Sumerian notion of Martech. That's precisely how it is that we're constantly capable of redeeming the world.

Speaker 2:          24:06          And that's why you make resolutions at New Year's because the new you is supposed to be born at the new year. Okay. So what are the Mesopotamians do it the new year, they take their king and they bring them outside the city. Now you have to understand that outside the city is chaos, right? Because these are city states. When you go outside the dominion of the human, you're in chaos. And then the priest makes the Emperor Neil and takes all his marks, have status off him. So He's reduced to his assets, fundamentally bereft of his social persona. And then he slaps him with a glove and humiliates him and the king is reform forest to recount his since right? Everything he did in the last year, that wasn't up to standard so to speak. And you can see how that'd be pretty useful thing to have somebody who's in power do on a regular basis. Right? Because it reminds them that they're in fact subject to a transpersonal structure who's nature isn't precisely evident, but is nonetheless there, which is the case act like Marduk or all hell will break loose and demolish your kingdom, which is, of course it's true now as it was then. So the emperor gets humiliated. He asked to recount his sins, then he's locked up.

Speaker 2:          25:24          Then he reenacts the battle with Tire Matt, and when he emerges victorious, he's locked up with a ritual prostitute, a higher duel, and they mate. Why? Well, the higher duel, the ritual prostitute represents tire Matt. Now, why the hell would that be? Because timeouts a dragon, right? A horrible man eating dragon that lives at the bottom of the ocean, which is to say that in any encounter with the unknown, as difficult, traumatic and violent as that might be, there's also the possibility for something creative to emerge as a consequence, right? Because it's out of the unknown that we mind new information.

Speaker 2:          26:09          So in so far as the Mesopotamian emperor acted out the role of Marta than he was a good emperor. Then he deserved his sovereignty and literally as well as figuratively in so far as he did play that role, then the society was going through remain not only stable, but constantly updated because he's engaged in this constant creative contact with the unknown, aided and abetted by his attempts to remember his own inadequacies and weaknesses and to do something about them. Okay. So that's a pretty interesting story. And it gets even more interesting when you start to understand the Judeo Christian creation myth is assimilated to the Sumerian creation myth by the union of the notions of chaos and tire matt. So the logo's in Judeo Christian thinking, the word of God that produces order out of chaos is also essentially equivalent, at least metaphorically speaking, to whatever Martech represents in the Sumerian creation myth. And we know that our relationship with the Enuma elish is obscured by time, but our relationship with the stories that lay out the fundamental substructure of Western culture is not so ameliorated. Even though we may not believe them explicitly anymore, they still sit at the basis of our society.
