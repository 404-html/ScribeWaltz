Speaker 1:          00:33          I think of all the stories that we've investigated so far, all the fundamental and myths of creation that we've investigated so far. The two that we're going to talk about in detail today are probably the two stories that have had more impact on the course of world history than any other two. I'm going to talk in some detail today about the story of creation laid out in genesis, genesis, and also the story of the Buddha's enlightenment. Both stories are also characterized by a kind of depth that's virtually limitless and I think in some ways that the topics we're going to discuss today are the most enlightening of all the many ideas that we've traveled through so far in this series. So we're going to be concentrating on an analysis of this Schema. Again, the idea of being here, of course, that the world of experience, which is the world that mythology is attempting to describe, has these fundamental constituent elements.

Speaker 1:          01:36          One associated with chaos or nature or the unknown, one associated with culture or the great farther or the predictable and another associated with the architect will son the individual who's the offspring of the interplay of these two fundamental forces. Now given that part of the purpose of this series is to elucidate the causes of war and motivation for war attention paid to the dualistic nature of the individual is of paramount importance. So we could say that just as nature has its terrible side and just this culture has its terrible side, so the individual has his or her terrible side and the depth of that capacity say for atrocity and vengefulness is just as deep as the depth of terror that the unknown itself holds. I think this is so called, uh, uh, difficult fact for normal individuals to grass given that we're highly motivated to view ourselves as if not precisely good, at least as relatively harmless.

Speaker 1:          02:41          But the evidence that as individuals we are relatively harmless, is very, very thin indeed. And I don't think it's possible to understand the depth of motivation for atrocity and social conflict without coming to terms with the capacity for evil. That's characteristic of the individual. Now, both the story in genesis and the story of the Buddha's enlightenment, uh, laid bare in many ways the nature of the structure of individual eval and also not only it's structured, but it's motivation. Why it is that people would turn more or less voluntarily away from the good and embrace what can only be described as its polar opposite. So in addition to making reference to this structural Schema, of course, we're also going to be discussing, it's the typical mode of interaction of these elements of experience. You may note for example, that this diagram with which you're now very familiar, that the notion of order chaos and reestablishment of order also parallels the structure of the story in Genesis, the creation myth where human beings are created first and existed. A paradise will state that that paradise is disrupted. That as the, as a consequence of some, some uh, event, uh, virtually cosmic significance, that as a consequence of that disruption, people are destined to live a profane existence in constant wait for the next state of, of order.

Speaker 1:          04:18          So just as this is a fundamental archetipal structure, so that fundamental architectural structure is, constitutes the, the basic grammar for the story in genesis. Now what we're going to do to begin with is to do describe precisely how this idea of paradise descent and the search for paradise is illustrated symbolically agenesis and exactly what those symbolic representations mean. The idea here being that the reason that the authors of Genesis, the multiple authors of Genesis six extending over thousands and thousands of years chose those symbols is not because they were laboring to be obscure or not because they were establishing a pre empirical representation of reality. I kind of, cause I seem to scientific representation, but because these symbols have an elusive or metaphorical richness than enables a story, although short to be characterized by an almost infinite depth. That's part of the reason. The other part of the reason is that when you say something profound, you say it using the language, the chorus language that you have access to.

Speaker 1:          05:20          And if the story is almost unalterably profound, then the images in which is in shrouded are almost in comprehensively complex. Then it has to be that way. Because if the target of the investigation is reality itself, something so complex that we cannot conceptualize it fully, then the language that we use to represent that reality has to stretch us to the limits of our ability to understand. And it is the case that historian genesis say as much as the story of the Buddha's enlightenment constitutes an artistic endeavor on the part of the human race to portray the nature of human reality and to explain that behavioral and philosophical consequences of that reality, that being a tall order, perhaps we should forgive the multiple authors for only being able to manage it in a way that's essentially images stick and dramatic rather than explicit, logical, philosophical, and fully developed.

Speaker 1:          06:20          So the first thing I'd like to point out to you is to, is a statement made by Garcia Eliod, which I think is one of the most enlightening things I ever read. Now the first thing that Ellia does is describe the universality of flood mythology, but then he puts a twist on it. So the idea behind flooding mythology is something like this. If societies deviate from an emergent, unnecessarily emergent kind of morality, a kind of reality that takes the viewpoint of all the inhabitants of a given society into account. If it's society deviates from that viewpoint sufficiently, it dunes itself to annihilation. That annihilation being represented mythologies mythologically as the flooding of the society by that pre cosmotronic water sleep, the primordial element or chaos. So societies that are tyrannical doing themselves to eradication by chaos, a simple equation but made more complicated by Ellie. He's observation that more than one factor plays a role in the establishment of a tyranny.

Speaker 1:          07:21          On the one hand, there's the straight degeneration of cultural presuppositions in that if you establish a state or a game, which has particular rules because of the environment is constantly transforming itself. The rules by necessity become out of date. So merely as a consequence of the progression of time, the presuppositions on which any state or found them tend to become less and less relevant to the current environment. Okay, so there's this aging and senility merely as a consequence of thermodynamic processes. But then Eliana also points out that there's one additional factor which has to be attributed not to society, but to the individuals that make up that society, which is that the strictures and rules on which society is founded, Ken, be constantly and carefully updated when necessary, if all the individuals that make up dot society are perfectly willing to confront exemplars of emergent chaos in their own lives.

Speaker 1:          08:18          When those exemplars and merge, which is to say that it's perfectly reasonable to be guided in your personality by the structures of your state. But if you face something unknown that those rules cannot handle, it's a moral necessity and obligation on your part to face that emergent anomaly forthrightly to souls, it if you can, and then to communicate the consequences of your solution to the rest of the members of your society. Now with Elliot, it points out is that the individual who, who removes him or herself from the responsibility of confronting their own and normally speeds the process by which the state decays. So the decay of the state and the possibility for the emergence of chaos is an interaction between the tendency of the state to a archaism and senility merely as a consequence of change and the voluntarily, the voluntary unwillingness of the citizens that comprise that state to face the unknown courageously when it confronts them.

Speaker 1:          09:14          So Elliot, it says the Deluge myth is almost university disseminated. It is documented in all the continents, although very rarely in Africa, probably because of the relative shortage of water and on various cultural levels. A certain number of variates seem to be the result of dissemination, first from Mesopotamia and then from India. It is equally possible that one or several dilute catastrophes gave rise to fabulous narratives. But it would be risky to explain. So widespread of myth by phenomena of which no geological traces have been found. The majority of the flood myths seem in some sense to form part of the cosmic rhythm. The old world, people by a fallen humanity is submerged under the water and then sometime later a new world emerges from the aquatic chaos. In a large number of variants, the flood is the result of the sins or ritual faults of human beings.

Speaker 1:          10:04          Sometimes it results simply from the wish of a divine being to put an end to mankind. The chief causes light once therefore in the sins of men and the decrepitude of the world by the mere fact that it exists. That is that it lives in producers. The cosmos gradually deteriorates and ends up falling into decay. This is the reason why it has to be recreated. In other words, the flood realizes on a macrocosmic scale, what is symbolically effected during the New Year Festival, the end of the world, and the end of a sinful humanity in order to make a new creation possible.

Speaker 1:          10:43          So then the question might arise logically enough. What is it that would motivate an individual to work to avoid a normally when it emerges in his or her own life and to risk and eventual flood even more profoundly, what would motivate an individual perhaps to work for the antithesis of order to work, to promote the emergence of chaos? Since we know that people are relatively ambivalent in their moral stance, is it possible that we can create a, a compelling motivational story for the desire of the individual as such, to work against the emergence of the good rather than for it. So let's take a look at what genesis says about the creation of experience. So first of all, remember we're taking a phenomenological stance on this story, which is to say that this story is not an objective retelling of I've materialistic emergence. It's something more specifically dramatic.

Speaker 1:          11:41          It describes the nature of human experience. Okay. The nature of conscious human experience. And in fact the creation story in genesis lays explicit stress on individual consciousness, literally as a precondition for being itself. Which is to say that underlying the story of genesis is the notion that without whatever consciousness is there would be no segregated entities and therefore no being so. This is one manner in which genesis attempts to put human beings at the center of the cosmos, so to speak, which is the idea that the world independently of consciousness, whatever that world is absolutely needs to be reflected by consciousness in order to exist in any sense that existence could reasonably be defined. First chapter in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was on the face of the deep. Now the idea that the earth was without form and void takes us back to the Mesopotamian creation myth and Marduk and tie mat.

Speaker 1:          12:45          Because the word for void, the Hebrew word for void, his tail and Tam is a word derived from ty Matt. And the void, the chaos that constitutes the unformed condition of the cosmos prior to the elaboration of being is assimilated to the same category as tire mat, which is this terrible, unformed and frightening a priori condition that has to be courageously confronted in order to manifest itself as being. And the earth was without form and void and darkness was on the face of the deep. So now you see another, another interplay of opposites here between matter and water, the primordial elements. So first of all, it's heaven and earth and then it's earth and water and, and the height and the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. So another opposite representation between spirit and whatever it is that the pre cosmotronic water or chaos constitutes.

Speaker 1:          13:43          And God said, let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and then a prototypical division between light, which is associated with illumination and enlightenment and consciousness because we're conscious during the day and the sun and life that emerges nested inside this initial opening lines of this sentence, uh, northrop frye notes that there's tremendous emphasis on the notion of s a repetitive cycling of days and nights in the opening sentences of genesis, even though from a formal perspective, this emphasis is paradoxical because the notion of the day merges before the creation of the sun and fry's point is not that this is some careless gesture on the part of the people who authored genesis, but more that it's an attempt to emphasize the idea of a cyclical relationship between consciousness and light and darkness and chaos.

Speaker 1:          14:38          And, and, and to highlight the idea that it's cyclical relationship is somehow absolutely vital to being itself. So genesis one five says, and God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening in the morning where the first day fry's says, the central metaphor underlying beginning is not really birth at all. It has rather the moment of waking from sleep. When one world disappears, a world of virtuality and potential and another comes into actual beating. This is still contained within a cycle. We know that at the end of the day, we shall return to the world of sleep and, and that's a notion that has a metaphorical resonance because there's the sleep that punctuates periods of consciousness, and then there's the great sleep at the end end of life, which is characterized by the complete cessation of consciousness. We knew that at the end of the day we shall return to the world of sleep, but in the meantime there's a sense of self transcendence of a consciousness getting up from an unreal into a real or at least more real world, but a sense of awakening into a greater degree of reality is expressed by hereclitis as a passing from a world where everyone has his own logos into a world where there's a carmen logos.

Speaker 1:          15:49          The experience that we all share. Genesis presents the creation as a sudden coming into being of a world through articulate speech, which is another aspect of logos. Logos incorporates the idea of creative exploration and then the formulation of the consequences of that exploration and verbally communicable categories, right, which give our, give our aspects of our being there defined boundaries and parameters and enable us to establish a shared mode of social being through articulate speech, conscious perception, light and stability. Something like this metaphor of awakening. Maybe the real reason for the emphasis on days and such recurring phrases and the evening in the morning where the first day, even before the day is we know it was established with the creating of the sun.

Speaker 1:          16:41          The most fundamental pair of conflicting and sick likely interacting pairs of opposites that is portrayed in genesis is essentially the, the pairing of chaos versus order. Generative chaos versus generative order and a poem expresses this idea extremely well and very powerfully, so I'm going to read it to sacred night sweeps. Having word she takes the glad the wind some day and folding it rolls up. It's gold carpet that had been spread over an abysmal pit, gone vision like as the external world and man, a homeless orphan has to face an author helplessness naked alone. The blackness of immeasurable space upon himself. He has to lean with mind, abolished, thought and fathered in the dim depths of his soul. He sinks for nothing comes from outside to support or limit him all life and brightness. Semen, ancient dream. While in the substance of the night unraveled alien.

Speaker 1:          17:43          He now perceives a fateful something that is his by right? Absolutely brilliant poetic statement. I think laying out very nicely, very richly that the fundamental nature of the existential paradox that constitutes human life pointing to a very profound sense of futility in theory, but then beyond that to the notion that in the depths of the unknown, in the depths of the darkness and in the depths of all that, that's fundamentally unfakeable, there are still lurks something that can be discovered given sufficient courage, another fundamental division portrayed indirectly in genesis the word versus chaos. So what you have in genesis is an absolutely stellar idea. I think perhaps the most fundamental contribution of archaic Jewish thinking to Western and world civilization, which is that although it is easier in some ways to consider the actual matrix of things, their material substrate as the strata from which they emerge, it is equally reasonable and perhaps more pragmatically useful to know that things only exist because of the interaction between the logos, the word that characterizes consciousness and whatever this matrix is.

Speaker 1:          19:03          So in Jewish thought and then Christian thought and of course in in thoughts of that sort of echoed throughout the world. There's the idea that consciousness associated with the transcendent directly associated with the daddy is actually the thing that in the interaction with this matrix give re gives rise to being genesis plays a stress places stress on this notion of the internal logos, the individual consciousness and to very complex ways. It's first stance that it's the word of God, the logos of God that gives or that gives ordered to chaos and makes being emerged. But then even more particularly it's the, it's the self conscious logos of individual humans, their capacity not just to see the world as an object but also to see themselves as an object that gives the world that particular value slump that it has for us. Which is to say that not only are we in a world where the subject and the object are separated and, and, and therefore experience and suffer the consequences of that separation.

Speaker 1:          20:09          But even more particularly, we are the only creatures who are so conscious that we can observe our self as objects. And the consequence of that is that because we've extended our consciousness to ourself, we're capable of conceptualizing things that other creatures cannot conceptualize, such as the infinite possibility that lays manifested in the unknown, but also the fact that as individuals were subject to our finite limitations, right, that we can become diseased, that we can become mentally ill on that finally will die. And so the idea here is that something like the extension of logos to the object to the subject has made human existence finally problematic. And Genesis refers to this as essentially the heritable sin of Adam because we're aware of our own vulnerability as a genetic consequence merely of being human. There's a transformation in the nature of experience that has essentially cosmic significance.

Speaker 1:          21:16          Lout sue and the Dao de Jing makes a comment on the formless chaos that constitutes the matrix of things, the origin of things in the following manner. He says there was something formless yet to complete that existed before heaven and earth without sound, without substance. This is the void or the chaos dependent on nothing, unchanging, all pervading unfailing. When we think of it as the mother of all things under having the idea here being that whatever experience is in the absence of a delimited human consciousness is something that's outside the boundaries of time. Because time is a temporary is a human attribute and it's outside the boundaries of spatial limitation because only human beings with their delimited and fixed size can attribute spatial aspects to being itself. So whatever it is is that exists without us. It's so comprehensive and so complete and transcends temporal dimensions to such a great degree that it can't be conceptualized as being at all. It's something that transcends being to such a degree that it's not even nameable but still exists as the mother of all things under heaven.

Speaker 1:          22:33          Now, genesis formerly associates the human being with logos. And this is a determinitive move in human history, just as the Mesopotamians first hypothesized that their emperor was equivalent to Marduk the force that confronted timeout and carved her into pieces and made the world. And just as the Egyptians conceptualize their pharaoh as the intermingling between ocirus stability of the state and horace, the exploratory hero, and then disseminated that identity down the aristocratic levels closer and closer to the individual individual. So the ancient Hebrews said, and God said, let us make man in our image after our likeness. Now it could be said that the logical derivation of that statement is that God looks like human beings, or conversely, that God is an old man with a beard, but it means something. I think that's more sophisticated than that, which is that the central aspect that's associated with this transcendent daddy, the logos, which is the thing that gives rise to order as a consequence of his confrontation with chaos, is also the thing that centrally characterizes human consciousness. And so with that, there's this transcendent notion that inside each human being is a spark of genuine divinity, and it's the manifestation of that divinity in human, temporal and spatial parameters that literally keeps the cosmos generating.

Speaker 1:          24:08          So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he, him male and female, created he them and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. Now the fundamentalist Christians read this as an injunction, right? This is what human being should do, dominate all other living things, but it's more like a description, which is that the consequence of the embeddedness of this spark of divinity in the individual is precisely what gave rise to the human ability to dominate the planet. We just an ability that at least at the moment, seems fundamentally unparalleled with no limit in sight. So it's not an injunction so much as a cold hearted description. There's a very profound idea underlying the necessity of the creation of the individual human big.

Speaker 1:          25:01          There's a line of Archaic Jewish speculation that runs something like this. Why is the creation of a limited subject necessary? If God's Omniscience and omnipotent and omnipresent, why would he bother creating anything outside of himself? And the line of speculation runs like this. The one thing that a being that is complete in all regards, even all hypothetical regards, lax by necessity is limitation. And as a consequence of that, anything that's absolute is not complete and can't be complete without limitation. And so there's an emergent idea in genesis and most notions of the emergence of human consciousness that the absolute needs, the reflection point of a delimited being to actually spring into some kind of defined actuality. So that being itself becomes an an an interplay between the necessarily limitations of the finite and the transcendent reality of the absolute. And so being is something that emerges because of the fact as another ancient Jewish tradition has it gone in man or in a sense twins mutually dependent on one another for their defined being from such a perspective being has the same nature as a game.

Speaker 1:          26:22          When you're playing a game, you have to play by rules, which means that there are things that you can do well playing the game with. There are many, many things you can't do, and that the game could not exist without the limitations. Also predicated on the idea that the imposition and Nietzsche and idea that the imposition of limitations on a structure actually gives rise to the possibility diverse new forms, which is also a very sophisticated way of conceptualizing the world. So from the perspective of Genesis, the individual is the low cow of the experiential drama, and the fact that the individual is limited is a necessary precondition for being right.

Speaker 2:          27:59          Okay.
