Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Uncut version, any computer say that takes the people come in and do it on a computer instead of have you read his book?

Speaker 2:          00:00:42       Were there before anything? Was there time outs of feminine figure because she's the wife of absolute, which is also a dragon and it is the case in the ecology that the figure of the terrible mother and mother in general is often contaminated. Figure dragging. I don't exactly know why it is that mythological. I mean, most mythological stories described this creation of the world out of one of two things. It's either the body of a giant or it's the body of a serpent. I don't exactly know why it's the body of the serpent or wall or a giant for that matter. It's difficult to tell. It's in part because the serpent is a serpent that eats its own tail. That's the era. So you've been reading about and it's a symbol of the union of opposites and from the mythological perspective, whatever it was that the universe is made out of. Before it was discriminatory, law objects was everything that's now discriminative, all combined into one thing and the assembles that myth uses to the symbols that myth uses to represent that state, which by definition can't be represented, circulate around attempts to, to represent the union of paradoxical opposites.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       apple fest, for example, the Egyptian serpent, the serpent that eats the sun every night. It's the serpent that Ray, who's the son God kills every morning when he, when he, when he rises again, raised the god of the Egyptian, Pharaoh is assimilated to apple. FIS for the Egyptians was the god that was there at before time began and the same God that will be there after time, not known at the beginning of time or the head of time, but outside of time, entirely something that surrounds time. And that's what these fingers are attempting these fingers here and getting them to represent the same sort of idea. And this is from Ben and in Nigeria, there's a certain design here in the serpents in closing the world on a breast shield. This is a Mexican calendar stolen within encircling serpents, serpents, head up there. That's the world.

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       Again, the world is the reason the serpent is a road a year because the year is also the world mythological language tends to mix things up. Again, it, it's, it's very. It's very frequent for cultures to regard the creation of the new year as equivalent to the creation of the new world. That's why again as in Sumeria, and that's an extraordinarily widespread, a ritual that the day that the dragon is dispatched and her parts pulled apart to make. The world is also New Year's Day and the day that the state is renewed, state is equivalent to the world. From a mythological perspective, the state is where order rules as opposed to chaos. Chaos has two symbols, one being the serpent and the other being the great mother. The serpent is the most primordial form of chaos. It's chaos from which everything else is engendered. So you could say there's two types of chaos.

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       There's chaos that preceded the division of order and disorder, and there's the chaos that stands for disorder as opposed to order in the Samaritan Inn. The earliest Sumerian creation mythology. For example, world parents arise from the body of the serpent worth parents on the sky and the earth. The earth is assimilated to the female. Female stands for chaos, but you have to understand that once you've circumscribed an area, say like a state, the area outside of that state is conceived of as chaotic. It's where anomaly roles. It's where novelty rules was a slightly different form of chaos that the kind of cast that proceeded the establishment of any order whatsoever. You can see that's kind of a subtle distinction and I think that's part of the reason why the figure of the serpent and the figure of the great mother get contaminated so easily is the great mother is novelty from the standpoint of ordered. The serpent is novelty before there was any division between order and chaos. Okay, so see if we can take a look at some representations here.

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       Here's two more. This is from Babylonian. As the ocean ringing world, you can't see much of worlds in the middle. The oceans around the side and there's just. You can just see the edges of the serpent's tail. There is not much left of them, there's not much left of the tablet, and then this is from Italy. In the 17th century is the four corners of the world. The world, by the way, is often, and this is also very difficult to understand, the world of orders generally represented by a symbol that looks like that. That's the world. It's a Mandela. It's a circle, is divided into four parts like paradise. The paradise in Genesys has exactly that structure. There's not phone from which for Rivers Flow, the fountains right in the center where the four rivers divided up into four parts and it's a circle and that's a model for Jerusalem and Jerusalem is the heavenly city, and the heavenly city of Jerusalem is the archetype of log, so to speak, upon which all actual cities are predicated.

Speaker 2:          00:06:13       So they're always built in an attempt to imitate and having a city. And that's common model for, for city construction. Again, it seems to be more or less distributed all around the world. Now, the funny thing is my daughter started drawing the world, hear about it about three weeks ago. And uh, she drew a finger exactly like this. This is the world she draws and divided one line with divided and not. Um, I just wanted to ask them why a representation of a chaos before I was the unknown and the unknown is so important and why there's such drive to since from the time when I'm in representation as possible in the world would already have been divided into the unknown and the unknown.

Speaker 2:          00:07:00       Well, again, I think the reason is, is because the argument that are trying to put forth in the next few chapters in this book is that the thing you need to know, most of all, if you think of a story as a map of meaning, it's a, it's a description of behavioral patterns that are designed to help you make order out of chaos. Okay? In order to generate a story that has generalized validity instead of one that's just relevant for a given occasion, you may know how to do one thing and you can teach someone how to do that thing. But knowing how to do one thing is nowhere near as useful as knowing how to generate patterns of knowing things and I think part of the drive to represent the unknown per se, it's part of the overall attempt to come to a representation of the domain, so to speak, of the always present unknown know your question is why try supposed, why is it necessary to generate an image, say like the serpent rather than an image of the great mother, which is just normally.

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       I don't know exactly the answer to that. I mean I don't even know if all I. all I can say is that as far as I've been able to determine what people have done is attempt to represent the source of things. And I mean we still do that obviously scientifically people are more than willing to speculate about the origin of things previous to the. Even the potential established with a baby or even could have experienced it. And it seems to me, well it seems to be just a side effect or a direct effect of our general curiosity about everything once, once. So could you say that once we've been able to define ourselves in time, we want to have an explanation for all time? I would say when it also maybe like, I don't know about this, this like I find this stuff very compelling. Obviously it seems to me that things aren't necessarily just attempt to describe the unknown there right there.

Speaker 2:          00:09:18       The representations to me seemed to be accurate. I don't know where they came from or how they developed their approximations that have taken place over thousands and thousands of years. I don't exactly know why. As such as represented as a circuit, it has something to do with the conjunction of opposites. A serpent is something that's wind and it's something that's on the ground, so it's a niche. It's an image of the Union of whatever it is that's represented by spirit, which is usually something like consciousness or the domain that consciousness hysterical. That's the masculine will be at least mythologically speaking. The fact that the serpent crawls on the ground gives the feminine aspect because it's tied to matter. It can also shed its skin so it can trips for. So the mythological symbol is trying to say that don known as such with something that combined opposites that are generally viewed as separate bowl and that can transform itself.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       He can't say anything about it like it's, it's, it's a weird category because. Well loud. So you attempted to to describe it in this bowl. Now something formless he had complete that existed before heaven and earth without sound, without substance dependent on nothing, unchanging. What may think of it as the mother of all things under heaven has doubt actually. And it's the, it's the source of everything from the perspective of Chinese mythology and he points out that as soon as you talk about it, you're not talking about. Because as soon as you categorize it, it's not an attempt to be like a purposefully obscure. The point that is being made biopsy for example, is that as soon as you try to talk about something that's uncategorizable, you've already categorized it. You've already got away from it. So we're in a problematic position here because we're trying to come up with a representation of something that existed before any representations were even possible. So all I can tell you about her just to see what the representations are now, I think the purpose of them was because we've been attempting to generate a Meta story as a species, and the story is how to adapt to the fact that the result unknown territory. Remember the dragon has other attributes to. I read a book called Grendel, which was a novel published in the seventies recently that the debt or the dragon in there,

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       there's a mythological character named Grendel who eats people and he's constantly attacking this one king from deal. There's a little Scandinavian and it's written from the perspective of the monster instead of perspective perspective of people. Anyways, Grendel is this monster eats. He keeps attacking this kingdom and eating people and he's completely. The dragon has made him invulnerable. You can't be defeated, but the consequences of his repeated attacks on this kingdom is the kingdom starts to fortify itself very, very heavily because it's always being attacked. It as a consequence of spreads his dominion everywhere. So it's, it's a, it's a morality play. In that sense. It says that one of the functions of constant death, threat of death is to produce a tremendous amount of power in response to it. Anyways, there was one point in the book where grandma goes and talks to the dragon.

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       This dragon can see the beginning and the end of time. He's also involved in vulnerable. He sits on gold. That's another attribute of the dragging say, well, I need classic hero mythology that you hear those optic to go through the dragon, right? As soon as he, soon as he faces the Dragon, he gets the gold that the dragon has drinks back. That's another. That's another indication of the juxtaposition of opposites. The story is basically telling you what the dragon is, something that can devour you, breathes fire. After all, it's a very potent transformative agent. Annotate eternal. If you face it, sits on a treasure, though. It's very dangerous. If you. If you face the dragons voluntarily, that's the story of the myth anyways. If you face the dragon voluntarily, then you can get the treasure. Will you bring the treasure back to the community that it's changed?

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       That's a story mode adaptation. That's why those dragons stories pop up over and over. It's always sitting on Treasury, so it's another. You can see there how that image sort of blends into the image of the great mother and it's positive on one hand, negative on the other. I think it's a story, not a habituation, but exploration generated that application in many taken another very archaic notion and that's the notion of human sacrifice. I think I talked to you a little bit about this before. If you dig down into most cultures, if you get down to a sufficiently archaic layer, you could find a strategy and time during which that culture practice team and sacrifices, that's sufficiently peculiar practice so that Arthur Kessler, when he wrote, he wrote a book called the machine that was quite famous back in the early seventies. He said, the fact that human beings practice sacrifice at virtually all levels of culture, our culture, all cultures so far identified was the indication that there was something really biologically wrong with us.

Speaker 2:          00:14:09       That was such an insane thing to do, but what? What? Those cultures that were practicing ritualistic sacrifice. As far as I can tell, what they were doing was acting out the idea that the thing that was valued most had to be sacrificed to the unknown in order for constant adaptation to continue, so it was either like the sacrificial victim was either you could feel him as a hero because that was often the case, so he was a hero who who would be killed and that his body would be distributed among the crowd and they'd eat it. That's one ritual of it. It's just like the Christian mass by the way, is exactly the same idea and the notion was that to to move towards divinity, it was necessary to incorporate because that's the most concrete way of putting it, incorporate the body or the essence of this thing that's constantly being offered up to the unknown. That was the only way that you could continue insuring that constant adaptation was going to take place. So that's the sacrificial aspect of the hero. And then there's also the sacrificial aspect of the king and those two things get confused as well.

Speaker 2:          00:15:11       The king isn't a hero. The king is the fonder of the hero, or he's the thing that hero generates. You can look at it either way. The king is also something that has to be sacrificed, that Kenya is the embodiment of behavioral patterns that had adaptive significance in the past. Also schemas of representation and they're useful for guiding adaptation, but if the environment shifts suddenly, then they have to be changed and the only way they can be changed as well from the mythological perspective, if their sacrifice, that's what those rituals were trying to act out now as you can check around in the literature to two year old, two year old to satisfy your own curiosity. As far as I can tell, I've never been. I've never found an explanation. If you sacrificial ritual that was fun, prehensile, that didn't make. That doesn't fit along that theoretical line.

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       So if you can, if you could accept the argument that people acted out ideas before they understood that. That's what I was trying to explain it. Part of that neural psychological chapter, say evolutionary pressures, select our behavioral patterns. We don't invent them all. If we experiment a lot, some behavioral patterns last and some don't, so I think we get. We get behavioral patterns that are established as a consequence of evolutionary pressures. They're established long before we can understand, so we get the behavioral pattern down. Then we started watching what we're doing and when we're watching what we're doing, we tell stories and the stories reflect their first order, representations of behavioral patterns that that work so people, people's that survived were able to give up the thing that was most important to them when it was necessary, and over the course of, I would say hundreds of thousands of years, we gathered enough observations about success to draw some general conclusions about what it meant.

Speaker 2:          00:16:57       We know already in this and obtain by the Mesopotamian times, whatever it was that Martech represented was already positive as necessarily occupying the highest position in the in the dominance hierarchy of gods. So that's already established 5,000 years ago. By the time people could write. We knew that story and it's debatable whether or not we knew what it meant, but then you have to ask yourself, when you say that you know what something means, what do you, what do you say in one thing you're saying is like if you know something, you can act it out and the fact that you can act on does not necessarily mean you have an accurate representation of it or that you can say anything about it, words that are or that it was constructed as a consequence of word verbally and thinking that it was rational or any of those things, knowing something is acting it out and that's wasted and it's images of wisdom are collected in mythology.

Speaker 2:          00:17:48       Far as I can tell. Otherwise you have to come up with it. Well, I mean you can try, try, try as you want, come up with an alternate explanation for things that on the face of it seems insane. Sacrificial rituals. You have to realize these things have lasted long time. When I made allusion to the Christian mass, that that's direct light. When you eat the way for that represents Christ. He's the sacrificial victim and the incorporation of that way for it's made out of wheat because wheat is it dying and resurrecting a plant by the way, so there's a lot of vegetation going, symbolism that it is assimilated into that we host. When you meet that notion is that you're supposed to incorporate whatever is at the essence of Christ. People still do that and so it's a. it's a symbolic representation of sacrificial ritual and it's supposed to produce an effect.

Speaker 2:          00:18:44       It's got more and more abstract as you can tell people no actually engage in sacrificial rituals anymore. Although we kind of do that and we still do their new year's. Say you make your resolutions, the notion there is the death of the old self and the birth of the new self and you see they're still symbols that hang around you. The culture from from archaic terms about the New Year to kind of the old year who's hobbling along. He's killed off to make room for the new year and that's when you're supposed to formulate your resolutions because that's a time when you can scrap your pastor Vernon, so to speak, and give rise to a new self. No sorts of those sorts of rituals. Those sorts of ideas are very useful. It's very difficult for people to escape often from the weight of their past. That's sort of their accumulative habits or the way that they construe the world like there's certain utility and now because God you as far as you as you are now, but there's a tremendous amount of weight so I can.

Speaker 2:          00:19:39       I can remember, for example, I'm from a very small town and the thing about being from a small town perhaps it's not so much different. The city is that everyone knows you. When everyone knows you, you're trapped by your social representations, so it's very difficult not to stay who you were because your behavior is always modified by those around you into a shape. They can predict. Even if you want to change, if you leave a place like that. In fact, anytime you leave anywhere that's the changing of your world, you have a chance to, to abandon your old personality, develop a new one. Anyways, let me show you some of these representations. The only way you can get a feel, I think for this sort of thing is fine. What else am I thinking about it? I want to show you that. Well, I'm not sure how new year got so far Easter because Easter shift.

Speaker 2:          00:20:40       Yeah. Yeah. Well Christmas isn't very far with this place from the new year and the thing is is that the son is born on the 21st of December. That's why. That's why Christmas Day is so close to the 21st of December. So because the days start getting longer again. So I guess that's part of the answer is that the Christian ceremony of Christ's birth was assimilated to the rebirth of the sun, so kind of occupied that space in the calendar. That was the. That was the first part. Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know. No, I don't. I don't know the answer to that question. I do know that's why there are rabbits and eggs at Easter. Right, right, right. Okay. Right. I'm not saying that. Why is, why is why is in eastern in December. I'm saying, why isn't the first day of the year?

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       I don't know. I mean, I, I don't know. I knew you could speculate that there's tension between the two dates. Rabbit's hole when Easter. Well, they're symbols of rebirth. Takeaway rabbits are symbols of fertility and ate eggs. Easter bunny. What do you think these things come from somewhere? The vast unknown, like I just told you like five minutes ago, that we do all sorts of things. We don't understand. We act out things we don't understand. So I tell you what, the Easter bunny meetings and everyone laughs because everyone knows about the Easter bunny and no one has a clue what it means. So that's a perfect example of how these sort of archaic ideas can continue to exist. People are absolutely so to speak, unconscious of the meeting, which basically means you act them out, but you don't know what you're doing. So for example, of something that represents rebirth because it's some sort of an archetype or an example of something that represents me because it's been, well, it's a, it's a fertility symbol and it was a pagan.

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       It was a pagan symbol of fertility and as as far as I know, it just got it just got assimilated to the Christian festival of eastern hung long hung around long width and so we speak and the. Are they sort to re re chosen as symbols that chaos that proceeded in division or or or are they ancient temples that have simply been pretty simple that we have today? That's a good question. I'm going to show you a bunch of videos and I don't know the answer to that. I think personally I think that when people start thinking about those sorts of things, those symbols naturally come to mind regardless of whether they're passed down. Although they are also passed now that because I can't understand why they keep popping up everywhere. Otherwise. The other thing is this is an argument that human too. He said, he said, well, symbols won't for a long time to listen.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       Particularly Apropos, no. They happen to match some aid priority concept in psychology, academic psychology. We don't give much credence to the notion of the archetypes of the collective unconscious, for example, that's observed. That's because that is because we are unbelievably ignorant historically in psychology here. I'll give you an example. I was reading with and let the other day, you know, when the Spaniards came to the new world, they were looking for gold for elder out of the city of gold. That's. That's an analog of paradise. They're also looking for the fountain of Youth. Part of the reason that they ended up going up north on their trips was because they met abandoned wandering Indians who were looking for the same thing. The Indians told them a whole set of stories about where this paradise might make and away they went. You. That's pretty peculiar. You know, it's an hour.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       I can give you the reference for that. It's an these book, the sacred and the profane. I mean, it's difficult to account for that. We can't account for it by by a while. You could say both ideas came from a single source, some tens of thousands of years previous it'd be like 17,000 years because I think between 10 and 17,000 years because I think that's when the native Americans crossed the land bridge into North America, but then you have to explain why those ideas hung around for at least 10,000 years. I guess there's a difference between saying that or that that determines the shape of our culture and those ideas. Yeah. Well, I think. I think what happens is that. Well, let's take another take the notion of the snake, for example, like we know that we know that novel phenomena have the capacity to grip your attention so then you could say that any, anything that has the capacity to grip your intention would be a useful symbol for novelty and it's certainly the case that snakes have the capacity to grip your attention.

Speaker 2:          00:25:39       So that might. That might be the process by which the symbol's not only originally generated but renewed when it has to be renewed. I'll show you a picture of Kelly. I put it in the manuscript and anyways, I mean it is the case that innate like the domain of the novel always appears to us as simultaneously threatening and promising with threat having the initial operation, if the phenomena is up sufficiently, have sufficient novelty, and that's in board, right? I mean that's part of the structure of our nervous system, our capacity oriented, unpredictable. Now it's also the case that we seem to be able to generate an effect to things like snakes easier than we can do things like electric outlet, even though the environmental danger of perhaps being reversed, so there's, there's at least a kind of a tendency in our nervous system to acquire fear to spiders and to bare teeth and to snakes and to fire easier than other objects.

Speaker 2:          00:26:42       So perhaps you don't need much of a, an underlying biological knowledge to ensure that a certain class of symbols constantly gets regenerated. So we know the not the novel, the domain of the novel has the same attributes that Rudolf Otto wrote a seminal book in 1946 called the nature of the Holy Spirit. The holy phenomena is newness. That's a word you coined. It has two aspects, a fascinating aspect and the terrifying aspect, and again, I think he's really relating to he's describing the same sort of phenomenon, is that we're innately compelled to Orient and Tan and to consider on inspiring for that matter any sufficiently dramatic manifestation of the novel. It's also the case that it's perfectly reasonable to make the presumption that the world is generated as a consequence of our contact with with anomalous information because it is. That is the place where we generate everything that we take for granted, including ourselves. So it strikes me that this is a relatively mythological perspective, is it seems to me to be a completely coherent viewpoint. Now people say, well, the fact that something's coherent doesn't make its true, make it true, and that's certainly the case because paranoid delusions or coherent, but theoretically they're not true.

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       Then you have to figure out what do you need in addition to coherency? Well, that's a tougher. That's a tougher question. If you act the story out and your emotions are arranged in a manner that you find better subjectively than they were before, would you say that that would be evidence for the efficiency of the story, the efficacy of the story for its truth? Can you just define shoot? Well, I'm just wondering like one of the things I wondered about constantly when I was teaching my personality class for example, is these constant panoply of different personality theories. They're all predicated. They have certain elements in common, one of them being a necessity to face those bits of your experience that you really can't comprehend very well to face novelty. That's something that's really core to them, but they vary a lot and in the clinical literature there's a fair amount of evidence that there isn't much difference between one therapeutic approach and another in terms of their efficiency, they're all pretty good.

Speaker 2:          00:29:10       The only thing that's kind of known for sure is that if you're an eclectic psychotherapist and you sort of pick and choose, you don't do as well as you do if you're committed to one particular law, even though it doesn't matter what the model is. So then it struck me that while perhaps the reason for this is that if you go into therapy and have an incoherent story, which basically means you don't know what direction to go in, your goals aren't set very well. You don't have a good definition of yourself. That means you're emotions are dysregulated. If I give you a story that's coherent, that's an improvement. Just the fact that it's coherent is an improvement over your incoherence story and maybe there's other the other. Then the next thing to do what he does specify what else you need from a story other than coherence.

Speaker 2:          00:29:49       And again, that's what I'm trying to do with this course. So what I'm wondering is like we would say that therapy is effective when the client says I'm better and when the or when the therapist says you're better or when both due or when. Some other people do, but the point is it's still, it's still based on, well, when a client says I'm better, usually what they mean is I'm not going to commit suicide now, so I'm going to have depressed. I'm. I may be somewhat anxious, but I think I can handle it or and I'm nowhere near as anxious as I used to be. So negative emotion has been brought under control. I'm hopeful about the future, you know, and I can see that life might be satisfied. That means their emotions of being regulated and that's what a coherent story does. Since stories are about patterns of action that are adaptive, that make well, that makes a certain amount of sense because when we're acting on the environment, what we're trying to do is to transform it into a place where our emotions are optimally balanced, where we're not subjected to pain or anxiety, where we have hope for the future and with how we view life is satisfied in addition to being coherent.

Speaker 2:          00:30:55       Story should also be relatively stable. Well, it has to have two aspects. It has to be stable, but it also has the. It has to have the capacity to update itself with stability. That's right. That's right. So the best story is a story about how the update stories, when that's necessary, and that's the story that hero and wild anyways, clients would. I know. I wouldn't suggest that. No, I would say actually the to the degree that a therapy is effective, it acts that out because for example, in one of the most effective behavior therapy techniques is exposure, so to speak, and what's what exposure is supposed to do is is producing situation, which is wrong. That isn't what exposure does. If you like. If someone's afraid of getting into an elevator, what you do is teach them behavioral strategies to transform and elevate it into something that's positive.

Speaker 2:          00:31:53       It looks like habituation because because mostly what they do is model you, but that's still what you do it like you don't have to think. You don't even habituate to the unknown. What you do is explore it and classify it. It's just that our experiment procedures have been really poorly constraint. I think. So they're trivial to fight. If you're in the lab and I pay you 100 tones that are the same, and then the nonvolatile, we'll orient to that and if I keep playing it over and over, you're orienting response to go away and then I would say, well, you've habituated, that's not true. What you've done is classify that tone as meaningless through exploration of its properties and you have to be sitting there so your exploration is really constrained. That's still what you're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:32:38       So I would say like an answer to your question is to the degree that a therapeutic doctrine is implicitly or explicitly modeled on this story, it works to the degree that it isn't. It doesn't. We know like what are the major factors in promoting therapeutic improvement is exposure to threatening or an almost information. So Freud thought something terrible has happened to you in the past. That's trauma, right? So that's an event that you can't make sense of for, you know, it's hard to define trauma, but we'll just leave it at that for now. Freud originally thought that all you have to do is bring that traumatic experience up into consciousness. That was catharsis cured, but he knew by the end of his life that that didn't work. Behavior therapists have said, no, no. You have to warn them. You have to adjust someone's actions. So that's the things. If what a therapist, a therapeutic system does is expose you to enormous or threatening information and make you readjust your behavior as a consequence to the degree that you did that, you're cured.

Speaker 2:          00:33:41       If you won't do it here. No, I don't understand how situation isn't what you just described as exploring it and getting used to it. Well, habits. Well habituation usually means something like getting used to, but most of the time when you encountered like you don't just habituate to a normalist or threatening information. If you're getting pounded flat everyday you go to school saying you're a child, you did not habituate to that. The only way that you can get used to it, so to speak is to alter your behaviors or your scheme of representation so that bullying is no longer pounding on you. So that means you might have to. I don't know. What do you have to do? Take karate lessons. Weightlift get a new group of tougher friends, bring a knife to school, something, but until you transformed the source of the threat, then what? You're not going habitually because you don't get used to it. You'd like to turn it into something positive, but certainly turn into something positive. Could you could turn into something neutral. And if you're right, maybe it stays negative. Yeah, neutral is not so bad, but it's not as good as positive. So if you're really successful, it's when, if it's one thing to chase the dragon away, it's another thing to give the gold. If you're really successful, you get the goal of chasing the dragon ways. That's not so bad. That's usually what we do.

Speaker 1:          00:34:57       So patients with dreams where patient therapy, patient dream,

Speaker 2:          00:35:13       right? So that would be the patient that was, that was his interpretation of transference, said because he thought that he thought in fact the therapy was the ritual. And the first, the first, um, he thought that what therapy did was basically initiate a sequence of activities that were biologically predicated and that our capacity to hero worship was one of the things that lead our, an outpatient. So you think you think about this, I mean, you know, the children will, will hear a worship, they'll imitate, imitate their parents, or they'll pick us child who's slightly older and act them out, literally follow them around and duplicate their actions. Say they their capacity for all drives their ability to move behavioral information from one place to another, or you just thought he reactivated that in therapy so that the person would regard the therapist as well. For all intents and purposes, God, that was all right in a sense because it could, it provided some emotional dynamism to keep the therapy going forward in the face of the tremendous amount of threat.

Speaker 2:          00:36:26       Because you need, you need something that you didn't already have to overcome the threats that you couldn't cope with before. And then you would presume that, well, once he died in the dream, that meant that the thing that the therapist thought he was had been [inaudible], so to speak, into the person so the person knew what they had put out there was actually an attribute themselves, but know them personally, but of humanity in general, when he's in front of a therapist, provides a story and the therapist would be story in there for the king and the hearing process would result in the death of the king as being the, the crush story followed by the possibility of taking on the role, the crunch store. You mean to get to get you through the story just provides. Yes. So initially, yes. Yeah, that's right. Well that's so the dreams is a representation story of the consulting firm.

Speaker 2:          00:37:26       Bain, right? Right. Exactly. Speaking of which, I'm going to. I'm going to show you some images. It's better to show this in images. So you guys can read the manuscript and you can add like, I'll answer your questions too. I want to show you this one in particular just so you can keep it in mind. This is an image of the positive feminine, by the way. Green Tara from that. This is what, sorry. That's not very focused. This is a Mandela. You have to take my word for it. Seeing from the side instead of from the top, usually go to Mandela is. It's a square that has a circle inscribed. It's divided into four parts. You see them in wallpaper and on. Unranked isn't all over the place anyways. This is one that if you look from the top, it would be a man. Now you can see the square here, circle there.

Speaker 2:          00:38:07       Anyways, that's Tara. She's a positive image of the feminine. She's in this thing of in here. That's trees. It doesn't matter. I love. The thing that's interesting about that is that there's a whole creation myth and this little in this little lot, this little statue, that's a turtle. The turtle on which there are threats. Out of that comes these two dragons. We should know a little bit about. You should be able to see how that relates to creation mythology, but anyway, she pops out at the end. She's an image of higher consciousness as well. Anyways, the thing or what did he keep in mind is keys to certain to certain, like things that accompany your. I want to show you some Disney animation. Great. Now I'm Mrs Partly Dancer for to address your question in part. I mean you said, you know, did these images pop up or they transmitted? I don't have a clue, but I'll show you some of them. This is a really funny one. This is from the rescuers.

Speaker 2:          00:39:08       This horrible female gets this little girl out of the orphanage and she wants to lower down a well and in the whale there's diamond in a skull which has no chemical image by the way. She lives in a swamp in a row boat. The swamp is. That is a favorite place for creatures of the night in fairy tales and myths and that's because the swamp is a place where death is transformed into life. Straight. Swamp is eerie because things are dying rocking here all the time, but it's also a place where there's a lot of action. So anyways, she's in the swamp. I'm going to show you a very short brief on this. This is more comical than anything else, but

Speaker 3:          00:40:05       okay. All these little avenues. Okay. This is where the horrible. If you would try to give me my KDP or teddy goes with me. Those were her values. Hmm. Just do your whole list on the steering wheel. No hurry. Girls and boys that have a real life character with this creature anyways,

Speaker 2:          00:43:33       and so she plays the role to here, so to speak, which basically means when a human being is in its infancy, he has her, her infancy there, obviously very, very vulnerable to all sorts of external forces. So that's, that's basically all that's making reference to. You see this pop up in all sorts of weird ways. Superman in the car. The comment, by the way, that became very, very popular during the depression and Superman's birth was endangered, right? His planet was going to blow up and uh, he crashed earth and have two sets of parents as well. He has the cans who has normal parents and jewelry. Hell and all. Who are his celestial parents and he's a. well, he's a hero obviously. Andy, what's that? I don't know the story of Orphan Annie very well. She has. She's an from the dingy as daddy warbucks. Oh yes, that's right.

Speaker 2:          00:44:25       That's right. Yeah. That's very typical. That's pretty typical. So that's making reference to the parents by the way, and the divine parents from the mythological perspective, our culture, that's the masculine domain in nature. That's the feminine domain. Or You could say the predictable hip and unknown. Those. Those are the two things that give birth to the hero and the hero is the symbol of wealth is one of the symbols of the individual human being. The fight over the teddy bear seemed like with the diamond inside seemed like the sun bug or a newman talks about in here. Is that. Am I getting too far gone? No, no, no, no. I didn't pay much attention to the jewel. The jewel plays a big role in here because the jewels in the little teddy bear that's hers. And the fight over that. Yeah. Well it's, it's, it's funny because you see the girl winds who.

Speaker 2:          00:45:19       Let me see if I can remember the story properly. Um, like I said, the girl has to go into a dark. Well to get this diamond, it's inside the skull, so she has to recover fears to get it and she's getting it for this horrible woman. Now the woman has the diamond confused with what it represents and that's why she's after that. So this is a parable about materialism by the way, that's when you get the diamond confused with what it represents. The little girl actually wins the diamond, so to speak, because she overcomes the great mother and at the end of the second, of course the story that's happening because she's a hero. She does end up with a family. She's turned into a real person. That's basically, that's basically the moral of the story. So, and on that note, let me show you this one.

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       Okay. This is Pinocchio. And Nokia is a hero myth. I mean it's, it's, it has all the elements of the hero myth. The Nokia was not real at the beginning of the story is made out of what will. Blue fairy comes down and says, if you're good, if you're good, you can become a real, a real boy. And uh, so then he goes on a series of adventures and the adventures culminate in this scene and he, he's accompanied by this cricket given crickets. Who's a, that's his conscience. He plays the same role, you know, this little cartoon face scenes you see where there's an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other. Well, Jimminy cricket is the angelic aspect of conscience and I've always, I don't know, like, I don't know this and this is just something that popped into my, my, uh, my imagination, but his initials are jc and I don't think that's a flute anyways. Okay. So, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       he's fallen in with bad company. Okay. On his adventure. He's out in the world and it's just checking.

Speaker 2:          00:47:16       Okay, well, you get the picture there. That's where he's almost identical story of the horse and the cirrus. And why that's the case. I don't know the history of this particular story. Um, I want to show you just a couple of overheads here. The Fisher King, right?

Speaker 4:          00:47:45       Just one other comment, this is the edited version, the 19 eighties version, and the original Disney version. When they were inside the belly of the beast, they they decided they were going to eat the fish, the little fish, Cleo, to stay alive, and that was edited out. That might have some sacrificial.

Speaker 2:          00:48:04       Well, I don't know. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. That's an interesting image that's relevant in the jaws of hell, so detail, but wouldn't acquire stolen friends anyways, so that's kind of interesting. Relevant image, these images. Sixth Century. That's the cauldron of transformation by the way, that the blue angel therapy and that was a. she's a symbol of the positive aspect of the feminine. No positive aspect of novelty. Basically it was released as a consequence of his voluntary represents the dragon. Remember Marta curves the world of timeout. Timeouts. This dragon that lives at the bottom of the ocean. Same thing happens in the Hebrew Bible to it's varied. It refers to a much more archaic tradition. You have a three makes the world out of it as a consequence of dabbled with the monster that's variously known as ray habit and Leviathan. How if I have the hair of this section is written down, but my computer crashed today and I didn't bring them in so I can get you the references if you want for references and various places in the old testament while there's some mostly in the old testament.

Speaker 2:          00:49:43       Yeah. It's also the case. This is interesting too, is when Jehovah threatens to lay various territories, waste, which he does with certain mode of regularity, he always describes the territory that will remain after everything's devastated as fit habitation for serpents. So again, it starts the story of the reduction of the order flakes. Chaos and chaos is the place that's fit, habitation for surface and anything that lives there is assimilated to a circle. So I'll get you the quotes. I collected them all last two weeks ago. Actually, I have the King James Bible on CD role, which is really useful because you just put in whatever your word is and it gives you every single reference to the whole text, so there's. Well, he collected a whole sequence of references from various cultures that will bring them in and show you, so this is an interest in reverification of the sacrifice ram

Speaker 2:          00:50:52       baptism imagery. That was what Pinocchio, just on your way and the fact that you can say, well back. The baptism rituals we have now, which are pretty trivial Christian ones anyways, a pretty jovial, so in some some sex in the southern us in particular dip people completely into the intuit river, signifying your second birth, generally just sprinkled with water, but what that is is a very. It's a remnant from a ritual that was much harder, much more dramatic that his finger went through in the Disney cartoon by two year old son. Watched that. By the way, he was quite impressed with that. We'll be talking about that for a good long time. He started out about a month and a half ago and he still talks about that. We'll set the bottom of the ocean. It was pretty impressive. So I can remember too from from bio, he chose the image of the inside of the whale.

Speaker 2:          00:51:49       It's almost like a cathedral that stuck with me, if I can remember that when I watched this. So that's the second rebirth. That's voluntary. Hey, that's the reason that Nokia was turning into a boy when you hit, when he was well on his way to becoming a jackass was because he decided voluntarily, first of all, to jump into the ocean and the ocean. That's another symbol of the chaos that sort of precedes creation. He is a great symbol. I mean that is where life came from. After all. Here's one from Peru, dragon fight heroes there. There's the dragons got fish like features here as well. Human Nature.

Speaker 2:          00:52:38       Yeah. The respirators. Why did they, why were, why were there two alligators? And also the, uh, the reference to, to is, is the reference. It's a reference to the world parents set. The serpent separates into two things, order in chaos. I don't exactly. That's about the best I can give to that stuff. The negative mother often appears associated with a serpent time for mass because as I said, as far as I can tell, I've been trying to puzzle this time. It's because the. It's not that easy, easy to distinguish the chaos that existed opposition from order to the chaos that proceeds over the division of order and chaos again, they get mixed together. Okay, cool. Yeah, that's a great. That's a great time. That's a great picture on the night scene journey. So he's assimilated to the sun because it's the son that goes through the night seizure every office.

Speaker 2:          00:53:33       By the way, the myth of system. This is all being assimilated to the sun and you remember that diagram I showed you. Things descending into chaos and then being reborn. Well, that's a solar imagery as well. Anyways, this is a great emergency. Okay, so he's out there in the night in this cauldron. He's wearing the skin of a line or lines of solar beast for all these reasons. It's yellow. It's in Africa called or study. It's sort of upstarting, typical masculine characteristics. Even though it turns out that it's female lines to actually do most of the other thing, in reality, he's carrying a club, right? That's his weapon. His eyes were very wide open. He's conscious, fully coded signals was doing see the club, these things on the club. Those are our eyes. So it's more for symbolism of consciousness. So he's up to defeat the monster that it inhabits. Unexplored territory territory before it's being transformed into the place where real human beings can live. So. Okay, let me show you some others. So we looked at the rescuers, right? Yes. But then he rides from. He was from Australia, you know, it gives kind of scary. So by that time it's more or less inevitable. So yeah, he tries to give it away so it's funny. So I don't know what to make of that. Exactly. Accepted by that time. It's too late to turn back. It's funny too because his conscience is more or less warning them against the Jenny Craig is warning them against doing it, but it also helps them tie the state. It was a real cute touch. So let's see. So we have, well,

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       well maybe we'll do this one. Some of you have seen the sleeping beauty clip. I used it, my personality class, so we'll do the little mermaid instead. So you can see the assimilation of the feminine character. Okay. Now Ariel wants to become a real human being. Same sort of same time. She's also a like to to surface. They're not hurt their personally eels. Look at the structure she goes into. This is very interesting. It's a portal portal. Imagery defines the border between chaos and order. That's another reason why the feminine is often used to symbolize the chaos because the female is the border between the place that creation takes place and the real world. That's the most fundamental reason of heroes. Often climate in the body, the value of the feminine, the Feminine Needs.

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       Okay, so

Speaker 2:          00:56:27       those are soils that the negative mother was gone.

Speaker 1:          00:56:39       I'll just be in social personality disorder.

Speaker 2:          00:56:53       The same thing happen to them as happened to the boys that were turned into donkey says they've made errors. These choices

Speaker 1:          00:57:09       is the fitting room.

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       I'm gonna stop this for a minute. One of our students last year asked me why ask me some questions about these negative feminine new images and why they were often sexual, especially in Disney movies then occurs. They're very concerned with beauty. For example though, she's. She's kind of grotesque, but figure out a snow white's mother, which is sleeping, but they're usually older child the swimming and I read that as a symbol of the sacrifice of the child to the maintenance of youthful. That's what childless, that's what child listens. Representative needs in these stories. So for example, Snow White's mother, very concerned that she's the most beautiful. She's the stepmother. She's never, she's never. She's never had children and the way that myth dot reeves, that basically as far as I can tell us that that's equivalent to the devouring of children who sacrifice of children to. But. And that's what makes these fingers sort of both beautiful and and horrifying at the same time. They're attempting to hold on to a domain that's, I guess not right there. Yeah. She's, she's clearly assimilated to conserve. That becomes even more clear later time. So she's going to, she's offering area of bargains.

Speaker 1:          00:58:44       What I do, unfortunately have no one else did in the past when they called me. Well, nowadays I've mended all my ways. Repentance, which is handy. I always have to say I use it on behalf of the state, wants to get the girl and do so now it's happened once or twice the price and I'm afraid I have to put all the whole life of a human for three days. Three days. You get derailed. He's got to kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss you. You remain human, but it doesn't give you a choice. Oh, we haven't discussed this. This is what I bought from your way is sweet cakes. No more talking, singing voice, and don't get fired for ladies, not to say a word on that. He was withdrawn and she. Oh bosses.

Speaker 2:          01:03:24       She's. The funny thing about this movie is this know she's pretty horrible character, but it is. It is because of her in the middle assists that Ariel does get what she wants. She wants to. She wants to be human. So I mean, what would you. What does that mean? Well, she's, she's not really. She's a subterranean creatures. He doesn't know what the equivalent is for being in the ocean. She's not real, so she's. She wants to be transformed into actuality. I guess just going to know what does it seem like she has to sacrifice something to get what she wants. Well, because you have to sacrifice something to get you. That's. That's the sacrificial motif in part there. I mean, that's the thing she values most, right? Is their voice in this particular. In this particular scene, walking, walking legs, is that each step? Does she get her voice back? Yeah. It's hard for me to tell exactly where to start this because of this machine doesn't have any place. You have

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       to make some pretty serious boats. Married the wrong woman because she has Ariel's voice. Why don't you just watch the sun set? Remember that's her domain, right? Because she's the creature that eats the sun. Some dogs are very precious exchange. Someone lost her. Once again,

Speaker 2:          01:12:11       monster bites the dust. No, the king is released. Again, this is typically goes into the belly of the beast. He freeze. Those people were there and basically what that means is that he's established a new pattern of behavior or an adaptation or a new frame of reference that enabled people will be defeated by the unknown, threatening I know to well to start their life again, because you have to remember that the nature of the unknown, which is to say the nature of your experience is absolutely dependent on how you are. Okay, well, I'll lead to the age of 63, 12, 3:00. Um, I wanted to show you all those things so that when you go through the next couple of chapters, you're sort of building up a storehouse of images too, because the only way you can understand this stuff is to get the images down basically. So you're also reading a great mother right now.

Speaker 2:          01:13:19       See, this is a union vote. Fundamentally, our students both young and none of them believed that the great mother was a representation of the collective unconscious. I think they're wrong in a sense. It's a great mother, is a representation of novelty, is just so happens that the phenomena that young subsumed under the rubric of the collective unconscious are the, you could say, or the first r is the first line of defense that people erect against the unknown, which is basically to say that if something unexpected happens, you start imagining what it might be. So the imagination, what we would normally refer to as the imagination, its constituent elements. That's what you identified as the collective unconscious. So all I'm saying basically is that if something unexpected happened to you, it always occurs into some form of representation. So, and it's that form of representation that you identified as the collective unconscious. So he would say novelty as such, would adopt the aspect of Kelly, for example.

Speaker 2:          01:14:37       Anyways, I think that the book makes more sense. The theory makes more sense in general, if you understand the great mothers, the archetype of novelty, unknown territory behind your sits the dragon. So that's true. Uh, yeah. I just was looking in the book the other the other day and I saw the euro burst. Describe as a representation of consciousness. How do you think that that is? Because the consciousness comes out of the finger that. Well, the thing is the reverse is the source of the subject and it's not. It's not a symbol for consciousness per se. It's a symbol for the origins of consciousness. The place that it comes from, you know, I was just looking through. His book is called the Silverware University, but well people take liberties with the symbols. That's the problem is that they do tend to. They do tend to mail and across categories. It's not because they have fuzzy borders. They do tend to blend into one another. Not knowing anything else about the book. I wouldn't say that the statement that the of burroughs is the symbol for consciousness is wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:15:45       It's so what's the father representing consciousness.

Speaker 2:          01:15:57       Okay. Just for the record, before the represents, there's. There's two domains of masculine symbolism and mythology. Once the hero wins the father, before that gives rise to the hero, which is to say that you're a product of your culture, but the hearing also gives rise to the farther, which is to say that culture is a product of the activity of the individual. So in Pinocchio, I would still say that Japan was assembled, symbolize more what we would consider the domain of the state or culture and Nokia with the forest that revivified

Speaker 1:          01:16:31       yeah, for Jimminy cricket. And so it's kind of like consciousness is referring to save his consciousness and what he's doing. He referred to him as the son in the movie.

Speaker 2:          01:16:55       He's not. No. Oh, I see. No, he's not saving his consciousness to see Japan and notion tells him to save themselves. So like Pinocchio takes the more difficult route, which is the simultaneous, I would say from a mythological perspective, the simultaneous regeneration of culture. So what are the things that you all pointed out? Was there any personal problem that's taken far enough in terms of cultural problem and if you do a thorough job of solving your personal problem because many people share that problem with you. I mean it's very rare that you'll have a broad mix you so unique to you that doesn't also affect that whole a whole sequence of people who live at the same time as you do. If you really solved that problem symbol, fantasy or update your culture and that's what that was. That's what that story was referring to.

Speaker 2:          01:17:42       That's why. See, that was a sufficiently heroic endeavor. So the Pinocchio got awarded by becoming real. He didn't just do the thing that was best for himself in the narrow sense. He also did the thing that revivified his father. The thing that made him like literally an obedient because he was made out of wood better was a master craftsman. So Japan, Oh, stands for accumulated wisdom basically that, that, that can become stultified but is nonetheless necessary to sort of drag along, so to speak. So it depended on the positive aspect of the known. Yeah. And the in that particular. That's right. He's the guy who forgot, I can't remember his name, but the one who ran the pleasure alum or the boys that the negative aspects. That's right. That's right. See a name that the boys who misbehave, who didn't follow, the coaches who were abandoned by their conscious never no longer spoke to them.

Speaker 2:          01:18:37       They were transformative to jackasses and became slaves. That's right. He was the negative aspect of culture. So the euro is transformed by flooding. I mean they're both transformed, right? While to hear. Exactly. It's a process of mutual transformation. You see in the Cirrus Horace Smith, which is the myth that IED, the Egyptian Pharaoh for Onyx stape was predicated on is the pharaoh is both Osiris and horus simultaneously, and that's because the pharaoh, if like the Dan Pharaoh, the pharaoh just died instantly assimilated to ocirus, but the live feral, that's horace. He's both though horace and ocirus. Simultaneously I take, well, that's confusing. Is the dead pharaohs ocirus. How can the live feral deal?
