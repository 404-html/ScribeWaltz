Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I thought I'd do something different today, so I haven't given this talk before. I'm going to tackle the issue of free speech. From a left wing perspective, it's actually dead simple to provide a left wing rationale for free speech. It should be self evident to people who are pursuing social justice, that the most potent weapon in their artillery is the ability to communicate. What do people who lack power have other than their ability to speak on their own behalf and isn't it on their behalf? That the right to speak must be most jealously guarded. Anyway, I thought I would begin with a crucial observation. There's a fundamental structural reason why our political system has developed both a left and a right wing, and that's the tendency for scarce resources to become unequally distributed. So let's discuss that. In my clinical practice. I once had a client, an older guy in his eighties he'd come to me after his wife had died because he was lonesome, but also because he was obsessed mostly with mathematical ideas.

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       Sasha [inaudible], he and I showed it to a woman in our department who was also very [inaudible] start by the moment you saw it didn't pretty have the same effect on me because I'm not someone who sees, I'm not mathematically gifted enough to seek beauty in symbol that represents that sort of thing. Anyways, I got to know him pretty well and was actually in some sense he was paying me to uh, you just kind of a car to me because I certainly heard it as much or more from him. And he did for me is Greece. And I also help him like, hey, come to terms with this mathematical obsession. He put the stop thinking about mathematical issues, but that was more or less just the way he was. I mean, he was wired that way. Um, and you know, we felt bad about the substance, but if you're an obsessive genius, that's just life.

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       You know, there are people like that and they're not that common and it's a good bit. There are some of them and he was one of them. He had been a psychology. Stupid is you are. Then he switched into economics and tried to learn how big his fortune, but she had been quite successful up and he introduced me to some concepts that I have encountered which shocked me. It shocked me because the concepts to be introduced me to [inaudible] fundamental, a fundamental importance and I couldn't believe that I had gone through so much education and so much further education and research and develop a certain expertise in statistics. Although I know statistical expert without encountering cause. This said ideas and he introduced me to web hasn't been come to be known as, oh it's the work of bill friend. They'll fred old pareto who was an Italian economist and also the work of Derek, the solo price.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       Who is someone who is studying scientific productivity? That's the 1960s he wrote a book called big signs, little science. I tried to get a copy of it, go on Amazon, try addition again. I believe the first edition fled to the south of France. They never were selling for about 630 bucks, which is quite staggering. And it shows you how interested people are and after to get a piece of work. And so I'll tell you about just all price first and then I'll tell you about [inaudible] and the three of distribution. So just old price was interested in scientific productivity and basically index scientific product candidate by looking at how many sites and get papers to him. Scientists publish it and side of the, Sir I'll set up with precise, but there they're also obsessed with their seismic publication record because well, they, they liked status just like the next person.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       And a status has to be measured and, and uh, and track and communicated partly because, well, you have to promote people and you have to assess them and you have to hire them. So you'd have to rank order them. And so if you all keep track of people's accomplishments that you do that for under stupidly, and then you don't hire or promote or replace the proper people. So the scientific community has organized itself very well and keeps very tight to trap. I'll different metrics of research post let's say. And so one of the most would be number of papers published peer reviewed journals and that's a pretty good one. As it turns out, pure nominator is actually as it turns out, a very excellent index of scientific quality. Um, partly because generally speaking, quality and quantity in a productive field are quite tightly correlated and reasonably how it is.

Speaker 2:          00:04:46       Well, it's kind of obvious the more you practice at something, the better the tenant to get out. So quantity quality tends to be typing into interlake, but there are other indexes like the quality of the journal that you publish in and that's indexed by the average number of citations that give, given the paper might get. And Psyche, she copies an indication of impact, right? If no one was sites your word, like 80% of published humanities papers at zero citations, a polling people writing those papers, there's published in journals, a is buying them zero people read them, scan, cat scan. He said it's a financial scampi does for a very, very expensive and that was just published them because they're expensive and libraries and path to buy divided. And so the library is by them, even though they wouldn't release, doesn't know insights that they staff the is the feminine, they increase the ratio of noise to signal and we subsidize that. It's no longer to television. It's one of the reasons because the bees are dying, probably not fast enough.

Speaker 3:          00:05:56       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:06:04       free to fire up, let's say more classical approach, the heart of the university and they no mistake about if you get universities, you've got the tech stuff and somebody could stuff that can be parceled out either other agencies and existence to take care of that humanity humanities at the heart of the university we lose the university university and now it's a terrible thing, but it's not as terrible as having them continue on the path that they're authorized down language back to productivity. So this Sol price was curious about who is productive and what the differences in productivity were. And he had he, he hoped data being average number of publications that a phd student had. And this was in the early sixties upon graduation, how the rates have gone up since then, but I've already graduation, we're pretty sure that the, you mentioned some tape to say in terms of what we're discussing, grace of God so that the median number of publications, which is the typical number don't be hours number, right?

Speaker 2:          00:07:07       The typical number that people would produce was one, one publication and then you might say, well okay fine, the medium person published one, how many people publish to and hash it out was half as many as publish one. And then the other question was, well how many people publish straight? He has those houses. Then he has published two and four was half as many as three. Five is half as many as four. And so what you see isn't it scattered the rapid drop off of productivity, but as you, as you move upward in number of publications and there's a, there's a side effect to that. So, so imagine breath. What happens is if you're, if you're graphing come rip people out of a particular number of publications, you have the vast majority of people that have one pop as many to half as many of these that as three, four, five and then you'd get out of, so here in the how, maybe like 10 or maybe 20 and those people are, well, they're super geniuses in her field right there. They're unbelievably smart girl, unbelievably fast. There are unbelievably productive and it was hard to them. And so price being an observation about the scientific productivity and it's a terrible, terrible observation. It's a hate fact.

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       He observed that if you took a domain of scientific productivity and you were trying to figure out who did it for doctor work, he answered grossed out. It was the square root of the number of disparities, the number of people who are operating in that particular specialization produced half of the publications. Now it's worthwhile thinking this through. So let's say you're a candidate, people in a particular, this also employs applies to the employee productivity. Incorporations pilate saying general rehearsal. So if you got 10 employees, three of them do have to work. Well that's not surprising. You have people who don't do any anymore. You have some people who don't solve in the work that they actually cost you money. It's that, that's the estimate. There's four, if I remember correctly, 65% of managers at that negative mentality you to become, well, it's hard growing company, it's easy to save one and they, and they fail all the time. Okay, so you have 10 free. You have to work on that because it seems so bad. Well, if you have 25 five you have to work. That's getting rough. Do you have a hundred is 10 if you have a thousand

Speaker 4:          00:09:40       well it's hard to any, it's third. So what does that mean? It means that

Speaker 2:          00:09:51       productivity is distributed in a manner that was described by bill, frito retail. And that's the free or distribution. And when you looked at the distribution of income and the distribution of wealth, it's prudent Mr View, which means that almost everyone has not and a few people have a little bit and then even fewer people have a little bit more than that. And there's some people, they'll ace for example, Carlos Slim, um, Jeff Bezos who have more money than God anyway, say, well that's a consequence of improper social structure. And the right response to that is no, it's not. It's actually something more akin to international law. It governs the same distribution, garners the size of cities. That's an interest to take. It also governs decisive planetary bodies. That's harder to blame on the patriarchy. But he also seems to govern the distribution, every single thing that you would be produced creatively.

Speaker 2:          00:11:01       So for example, and I mean everything, it's really quite staggering. So if, if it applies to a number of hockey goals score for example, um, set, set something like Wayne Gretzky, I read if you took away all his is actually gold, you'd still have more points than any occupated never late and so ill and get a shot. That's really interesting it because they didn't tell us 1%. No, it's spot. It's like one 10th of one 10th of 1% of all the people who play hockey get into the NHL like no one. Right. Give it up. It's not, it does happened. And you're like the allergenic Gel guy. Like you're a superstar and then there's some son of a bitch like the redskins.

Speaker 2:          00:11:44       We'll just stay home piece in all of these, in all of these, still making some pre production. I can tell you people were kind of brands like either it old fashion. So you can talk about Pablo Castle. He's an interesting character. Yeah, they're long productive lives. Right. Hit it. If I remember correctly, it's nineties. Why may I know how many, how many more hard macassar produced and you know, you might get, these are just sketches that he was like just thrown off, but don't make that go onto the online, the castle archive. We're 50,000 of them have to be documented and I can give you the way, my punchline. But so, so, so I thought about it and then I did some research to find out how many artworks, this crazy character, but bruce, and the answer was 65,003 day, every single day for 65 years. So I try to do right.

Speaker 2:          00:12:48       I mean he wasn't just obsessively producing artworks, although he was there like a huge proportion of those things were masterpieces, right? So this was no pike of this guy. He was, he was something else. And then Bach is a good example. Care as far as, well, um, he wrote so much music then it wouldn't take a capias 45 years of eight hour days just to copy what he had to propose. So these people are, they're off the scale with regards to do what they do. You know, when you see the same thing, if you're looking at pat with numbers and that sort of thing and so, so depressed. She is, this is, this is a really interesting all of that. The question is two questions. Why in the world is the world set up like that? That's the first question. And the second question is what would make, since it makes everything radically unfair in a sense, at least with regards to distribution, maybe, maybe it's, it's good because those people are producing things like that and the rest of us, at least in principle get oily.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       But nonetheless, there was a big problem with in terms of inequality, of, of distribution ability and all of these things. Why, why is that the case? Well, here's one reason. So in this is something I've worked on, at least in part with my, with my client. Um, who else would have a theory on societal revolutions, which I think was pregnant, intelligent theory. Um, he introduced me to a, a field of inquiry that I had never heard about. People were holding, he caught on physics and I didn't know there were quantum physicists, but there are, and sometimes they're very productive and the other ones are the economy businesses figured out that you could model the distribution of money in a population, usually the same equations that you could log in with the distribution of a gas into a vacuum. So, so there's a deep interpret like phenomena driving the distribution of money.

Speaker 2:          00:14:55       And so, and here's how it works while you guys are hopefully to the mall, right? And so, but often just basically a random walk. I mean, you know how to play it off when you buy it an you can as fast as you can. And the first it was the luckiest, the way it is. That's basically the health and all the work. You know, there's a lot of company, are you going to say a skill? There's sort of a modicum of stupidity, stupid play you lose. But barring that, it's random walk and you know that, cause we played 10 monopoly games, it's very unlikely that you're going to win more than your random sharer. So let's think about what happens in an office. The first thing that happens is you start from a position of equity. Everybody has exactly the same amount of money and then you engage in brandon training, essentially chicken, the guys, right?

Speaker 2:          00:15:46       And so what happens? Well, what happens is, so here's the graph. One Bar, here's number of people, or people are playing, they all have exactly the same amount of money, think it's like $2,000 to begin with or something like that. Then you started shaking your ducks and then go starts to happen is a few people start to granted it more and a few people start to lose a bit more. And what happens to the waiters is that they become more resilient, right? They can take more losses than the people who are starting to lose. And so what happens is the distribution flattens out. Couple of people get more of the word money. One person pulls up if the lead, some people get less money and the loser starts to develop and you keep shaking the dice as soon. What happens is they hang, someone gives zero.

Speaker 2:          00:16:35       Now zero is a terrible number and you can see this in all sorts of ways. For example, if you're trying to start a business, zero customers is really the wrong number of customers who have as way harder to get your first customer, but to eat your second year customer, you know it's way easier to get your hundred and second customer, then your third customer, massive easier part of the guys. Who the hell wants to buy something from you if you haven't sold something to someone else. You know people use social proof and you aren't saying, well I'm new and revolutionary and they, well that's all well and good for you, but just so damn wait, I'm going to take the risk of being wrong vibe and the product. If I'd rather people buy it, then I can say, well these other hundred people bought it.

Speaker 2:          00:17:15       So I thought it was okay, which is a reasonable justification. But otherwise they have to say, well, you know, I wouldn't have gotten the lamp and just a few exciting. It's like, yeah, you're fire. So, so carbon is very, very difficult to get away from zero now and normally it's impossible because as soon as you hit zero and we run into a problem that you don't have when you even have a $20 and the problem is you cannot invest zero to making more money. You're done. You Stack up at zero, you're done. And so zeros were off number while we keep playing, someone walks away with all the money. Yeah, you've been complaining about the rules of the game, but you know the funny thing is people will play even if they know they know what the outcome's going to be. One plutocrat walk away.

Speaker 2:          00:18:03       We called houses, parks here and we'll track, but then we were watching all this is to recast the game and play once more. The tables will often turn that my client's hypothesis, which I thought was very good one. What's that? That's what happens in society because that's why they moved towards repletion. That's kind of our society in some sense, which is that you play on the hate logging off. You could assume these are random and trading game. It's not exactly around the trading game, but you, you've been Martin on quite nicely at around three day. What happens is eventually, you know, some people have oic everything and almost every one stacks up and zero. And the problem with zero is that you've got nothing to lose if I don't flip the damn board over and start a new game. And that's especially true if your male as their evening.

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       It's true if your males, because may all need status and the reason they need status is because females don't like men with no status. So that's a fundamental rule. So the correlation between male socioeconomic status and access to me or is this roughly about 26 which is a standard guy, the high correlation for the social sciences, massive correlation. You hardly see the only correlation I've ever seen higher than that as the relationship between inequality and male on male homicide, which is about 0.8 which is, it comes from all of them. So as any quality cram side, men start to kill each other and they're young men and the Carolina men and they do it status disputes. And then you have within race and it's, it's, it's you say read to me, I see something, bring it back. We're trying to save face for, tried to print up a, the status soon if we're not careful because we're impulsive because our future is that right?

Speaker 2:          00:19:53       We have a short time horizon all we'd gone to certain reputation. It's like it's your big buddy and so you ended up dead or maybe I ended up da, it's a toss up. And so what happens? You get sharp for second degree murder. There's not enough prosecutors to go after you. So company argued down to mass slaughter. You can argue self defense. You're pointing to prison for three years. He served 18 months and when you come out, no blood in one messes with you. Right? Right. That's a harsh economics. The calculation. I, it's an effective one. And so, but one of the consequences of quality.

Speaker 2:          00:20:30       So we did research using this, this, this recalled the creative achievement questionnaire. And I developed with a student that by name Shelly Carson, when our is teaching in Boston and he should be done point of popular nature. Um, when you're thinking about creativity, there's two ways to think about it. You can think about creativity as a process. You don't have to be how creatively can you pay and that would be associated to some degree with your Inq, especially if their verbal Iq and also with this trade is big five personality traits don't as openness, which is a fundamental, fundamental, deep, vital, ultimately recruited personnel on the tree. And basically people who are creative are good at generating exemplars. Either other category or between Catholics in can you can, I can test your creativity right back. It's, it's actually quite straight forward. So for example, if I go out to you guys to pull out a piece of paper and write down his name, where it says you could have that began with the letter s in three minutes, does the number of words you generated would be correlated with your creative capacity in about 23.4 and you think, well that's not very high, but actually that's higher than is generated in both the 95% social science studies.

Speaker 2:          00:21:44       So it's flaky. Well, small effects are just help a lot more effective than you think for a variety of reasons. Partly because of the extreme is now. Um, and I can do a bandage off if I sat down, write down as many uses as you can for a brick three minutes. And then I sorted globally in terms of how many uses you came up with, but how comparatively rare you're useless work compared to the rest of the population that was being scored. Now, you know, it would have to be sensible to happen yet plausible use for a brick rarity and fluency seem to make a lot of what constitutes degree pivoted. So that be measured for you? Well but and that's kind of normally distributed like, like intelligence. We are interested in some something else you've got straight ticket can be defined in different ways.

Speaker 2:          00:22:35       So we are interested in creative achievement accomplishment, right? So not only could you think creatively, but you've actually produced something in the world as a consequence. And you can debate about which is the better definition of creativity. It doesn't matter. You can have both definitions and they're useful for different purposes and we chose the greater achievement definition because that was good. We're curious about, and so what we did was we thought we thought as many dimensions as we thought were reasonable in creative and so that was like dance music, theater inventions, cooking, you know, no architectural innovation, um, fiction writing, nonfiction writing, I don't remember all 13 but you get a picture and then we had, we, we develop an eight point scale of levels of achievement and we have them generally by experts and then we rank order them in terms of their being probability.

Speaker 2:          00:23:37       So category zero bus, I have don't training or talent in this area. And kind of [inaudible] was like, well I have an reputation and so and so did we have people fill out the Erin and we go down to the distribution and what we bought was pre don't yesterday you should have, that was before I do a premium. Distributions were, but he must've followed out and making the scale in some stance because everyone who's a social scientist basically everything is normally distributed. It's just wrong. Many things. Our peritoneal distributed as a bring out everything when people produce creatively is distributed. And that gets really, really, really, really important because you see, one of the things that shows you is that whatever's going on in the income distribution doesn't just characterize income distribution. So you can't just blame it stupidly on unfair social circumstance. It's also the case that every society, every study I was studying has a peritoneal distribution of income.

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       Now how steep it is. Dot varies to some degree. As a consequence of things like social policy, that's very, very difficult to get away from the [inaudible] distribution. With that, we don't know how to get away from it. That's, that's the real truth about you don't know how to get away from it anyways, but that creative gene press here, what we found was that I think it was 60% of people had a score of zero zero. If they haven't done anything creative in any of the 13 dimension, look, it's not that surprised that. How many of you have written the book? Well not. And if you have written that, you certainly hit publish it. And if you didn't publish it and no boss, no one really wants, it's pretty hard. And then you write the minutes and rejection ready first tried to get publications like 99% I mean there's like a million folks accomplished a year as I think, I can't remember. It's like 2,500 the 10,000 copies or something horrible like that, you know it. Steve became, gets all the money and this brings us to the reasons for such thing. So I have a friend who's his office and he's, he's not seeing his pain, but he does three, well, he's written his the gear for Oh 20 years. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:25:53       has done a business, but he's Brendan the edge of the radical distribution. He hasn't really hit the big time year, but he's pushing most level is just there. They just start. They just started like artists to start. So we talked about this. It's like we'll work it out. What's going on here? Why does all the money flow to like five people? And he said, well think about this. Think about geographically, although in a strange manner, think about real estate territory in relationship to books. And then think about going from the airport and then think about going to the airport bookstore and then think about the best seller stand. One, two, three, four, five, down to 50, the top five. Everyone bought us them. And then think, well, there isn't just one of those towns and that's like 70% of the selling real estate and territory. And it's overwhelming dominated by person up in the left hand corner. Is it very often, Steven King, whose name everyone knows who's worth everyone can predict, makes the choice easy. You know, you're preoccupied, man, you're on a flight somewhere. You don't want to say 10 minutes figuring out what you're going to read it like the plague basis, tens of billions of doors. And that's how it goes for everything. So here's another example. So click about composers. Um, it turns out though

Speaker 2:          00:27:29       five composers, Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, and Haydn proposed the worst and they talked with 95% of the perform classical repertoire composers DMP, right? And it's hard to composers [inaudible] if you don't have to worry about classical music you've been listening to and any look at those, those people's useful conversations. And what'd you find out is that 5% of what they propose, it's 95% of the playtime. So it's like hardly any composers at all composed all the music that everyone listens to and God was hardly any of the music that they can post. And that's, that's why. And so when the economists, this sort of thing called the matthew principle, which is an interesting nomenclature, it's from US stealing by Christ in the New Testament. Don't think he has many economically one of them. It's a vicious, vicious said, some very vicious things in the New Testament, you know, which is one of the things that need to lend some credence in my estimation is did you pick this? Those things, would it be to those who have everything more will be given from almost nothing. Everything will be taken away. It's like that's the matching principle. That's the freedom principle. Success breeds success and that's how the world works. What's the problem with that?

Speaker 2:          00:29:17       Zero you don't want to tell you too much of a problem because it isn't like actually zero but it's close to zero. You know there was an article and yet some report or just started to go and he didn't do it. It's overwhelming. It's called like survey. But you surveyed a bunch of people to see what proportion of people could come up with $500 in an emergency. And the answer was in shockingly low number of people or overextended and you don't have any excess bunny at CAC. So I'm going to leave when people who were, they weren't as zero, which is a very rough place to be law. You don't want people to stack up at zero because what happens is that I, one of the things that happens is that the male violence, let us start to call it. So you think young man and he status that they also need opportunity.

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       They also need something to aim for it, right? They need all of that. And if they're in a place where the inequality, whenever any three steam, it gets hard for them to move out of the zero position. And the district to do it. Something to do it by any needs whatsoever. And so what seems to happen is that as society becomes more and more on equal, the pressure on young women and girls and you can pageant well what sort of young men and becomes viable the first, and this is where you can have it up in the other, what would you call them? Variables that predict violence. Maybe impulsive guy, maybe the guy who drinks too much, take it. The guy who was fond of swarm him against the wall three or four times when he was drunk when he was three and damaged his brain.

Speaker 2:          00:30:53       You know, anybody who's impulsive and liable to his self, the future, it's hard to be even more hyper motivated by in hopes of violence. As adults, we can call the client and they are applying here and I'll be speaking out. We've got, like if you go back 80 95 you know, in age 95 the average person in the western world lived on $1 a day and you want to take while the calder fucking warrant more back then it's like, no, no, no, today's dollars. But back then everyone had nothing thing and have a few people have some, I mean you can arrange that then didn't live like any of you live now you've got running water. If you've got central eating, you've got rely on shelter, you've got an infinite amount of information at your fingertips had every moment it's like you're filthy rich, you are filthy rich.

Speaker 2:          00:31:45       Money has bought everything that you can have except sas because that's comparitor. So, but the good thing to know because otherwise he might think of yourself as poor and if you're not, you might be relatively core but usually means you have to wait three years to get the thing that the rich guys have now. But it's just not that big of a catastrophe. So anyways. Okay. So you is followed with societies with regards to creative products tend to tilt so that people stack up at the low end. And if you people start up idea and then things start to be stabilized, that's the big problem. So like I tried this, I bought this, this was swell. Societies run out there haven't been trading game until it, most people have zero and a few people have everything. And then the revolution comes in. The board selected.

Speaker 2:          00:32:38       Everybody wants to start it. Yeah. So I'm assuming that if there's anything left in the wrong, right. And so there's a Marxist flavor to that. And of course mark's pointed out that capital candidate to accumulate, enhance with fewer and fewer people. The thing he got wrong, and this is an important thing to understand, is that although there is the 1% and even born, it was the one 10th of 1% who have almost all the resources that the 1% have, right? They that exists, that it's always there, but it's not the same people. That's, that's one of the things mark's got seriously draw. It's not the same people. Most family fortunes only not for three generations. Right? Because I don't know, you guys should have money sometimes. Did you keep it?

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       No problem. And I the other people is it? Yes. [inaudible] all the way. We're willing to Dole it out with just that quickly because you have a lot of money. You just spent large homes, money equally stupidly. And let's for somebody who really knows how to deal with money, those people are really quite rare and so family fortunes dispersed and very rapidly and the typical fortune 500 company, you only got us about 30 years. So although the distribution is the way that I describe it, the constituent elements of the distribution turnover quite rapidly. So I think if you're, what is it? I think you'll have a 10% chance of always that healthy stuff. I think you have a 10% chance of being top 1% for a piece, one year of your life on average and a 40% chance of being in a top 10% for at least one year on average.

Speaker 2:          00:34:17       So we know when people move up and down throughout the life of, another thing to keep in mind, which is very important and no one ever talks about this, is that most of the reason that people have money and said they're all right because young people don't have any money, but they're young or old people and we're waiting on in particular cause all the alternate don't have over and have most of the money right now because the old man dies conveniently. And now you know the problem that people, all my that role. And so just the typical overs as me to take credit me on the court and he got to be, well, yes you could think about that yourself. If you're young, it's like, okay, you're now $20 million from afternoon 85 it's like, what are you gonna take? So, you know, to some degree it depends on how you calculate. Well, right. So, okay, so what's the point of all of that?

Speaker 2:          00:35:11       It all keeps us and it's actually a fundamental problem. And even if you're a conservative person, you might say, well, it's a fundamental problem because at the inequality gets out of Canada to Valerie and society starts cause you stabilize. And you know, the one that conservatives, Republicans say they're a cop on crime. Progressive Conservatives for that matter, how dry. It's like, well what drives the risk by your crime? They all are final homocide. Let's say we know what it is. It's inequality. The correlation is, like I said before, gate, it's all of it. It's all of it. That's what drives the status competition. And just interviewed Dr. Martin Daly who's, uh, who's evolutionary psychologist, staff mcmaster that being from this place and he, you know, he didn't know the Brown works with this sort of research. So I've been re released that in one week and he wrote a book recently called the killing to competition is very high school.

Speaker 2:          00:36:07       He talks about being on the 11th it says, a rational strategy for uncertain environment where there's a lot of chaos and a lot of equality. It's worth reading. You know, he's very strongly biological, biologically oriented, the evolutionary psychologists, very, very highly. Incredibly. My estimation, but last two chapters deal with social contributors to inequality and I don't think that that is separately. They're very powerful part of this book because I don't think it deals with the fundamental issue. I'm trying to tell him, cause I'm the medical issue. If there's something going on here, it's like a natural law. There's producers, there's wide disparity, has an outcome.

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       Now the question is, well, what should we do about it and answer, isn't it nothing? Because if you let her drive him to his conclusion, then all hell breaks loose and yeah, even if you're rich, you think, okay, you're and you're down in Central America, even in Columbia. Do you want to be rich in Columbia? Well Great. You have to. You don't get to go outside instead of inside the confines of your compound. You're in a Ga. Nice. You know you're going to people in their computers for family, but fundamentally this jail, he's got a huge house. Hooray. More clean as far as like a fence around the barb wire. You've got guards everywhere and can help your kids having to go out. They get kidnapped. She was like, are you rich? Well, I don't think so. I haven't been Montreal. I was poor. You're speaking.

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       I just have a students, you know, students up a site map and I didn't spend much time in my heart because I wasn't looking place. But Montreal, peaceful, right? Great infrastructure, great streets, life. You're safe. There were three in the morning, you can go anywhere in the city. There's always something going on. Often experiental cost public essentially like in many European cities. Hell, you're rich. Well, part of the reason you're reaching under circumstances like that is because the inequality hasn't gotten out of control. And so you know, we need to figure out how to define wealth too, because wealth is not just what you happen to possess.

Speaker 2:          00:38:10       That might be sas and status is useful, but status and wealth, they're not the same thing. Okay, so now the issue is, well, there's a problem. The problem is in quality goods are unequally distributed and that's not fair. You know those additional problems that go along with that. Because one problem is is that if you happen to be in the top 1%, it's easy. Your check is your from your children's who also quite off the socioeconomic live. Now it's not as easy as people think and there's a reasonable probability that you'll fall and some of it is actually due to intelligence because it turns out that on average intelligence people have more money than unintelligent people, which hard becomes a surprise and conscientious people have more money than I'm conscientious people, which also hardly comes as a surprise. And if you haven't become as your parents and you're more likely, if you can tell yourself not as intelligent as them, cause you addressed to the me, even even the unequal distribution of intelligence sorts itself out across time.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       But you show up there, you still have what you might describe as a technically unfair advantage. Okay, so you've got a distribution problem, you got to technically unfair opportunity problem and it's reasonable to point those up and that's what the left does, right? That's what the leftover food, it's functioning properly. It says, look, we've got to keep the day, I mean, quality the Gini Coefficient, let's say you're got to give you the call. He flattened out because we won't have a civil society without it. And we'll meet people at the blog who could be productive and useful and we will get an opportunity and then we will get to enjoy all the cool things they might have made were invented. And that's, that's why I'm, that's a good point. And you know, when people say, yeah, but if you flatten out the damn distribution too much, then you remove people's incentives and you don't want to do that too much.

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       And it's like, yeah, that's right. True. So you've got truth, a truth be and o questionnaire as well, which true ratings. Right? Well that brings us to the next one. So I'm going to talk to some things about right, but here's what I'm going to tell you some things about last week. So the first thing I'm going to do is to tell you about why people are like that. And we've even, and other labs [inaudible] labs first. In fact, um, have you investigated the relationship between the fundamental biological tempered, what's included intelligence and political? That's called a viewpoint. It's better to get an opinion or attitude, the idea of a viewpoint. It gives you, see, when you guys look at the world, you don't see the world and just see that tiny little fragment of the world that you find valuable, right? If a rose to complicate it, and I can know how many of you have seen the famous invisible gorilla video, but you know, there's a bunch of people playing basketball team 0.3 of them wanting and what I craved them, it has the bouncing balls back and forth between them.

Speaker 2:          00:41:08       You're supposed to count the number of times the way t passes basketball. They feel a visual screen. These, these six people, they're dense around this. The best of all, you're counting, you're thinking, you're pretty damn smart. It just, and you can count stands the screen and beats his chest for like 15 seconds and says songs off. And then the experimenter baskets, you did you notice anything strange and was saying no. And he says, well, how many passes did you say? 16 and you think, ah, and then he says, did you see the gorilla? And he'd say, what are luck? Or talk to them. You say what her role. And so then you rerun the tape and sure enough quick power palatable ran hundreds girl right in the of the screen you are just not very bright. Three blind. We are so large and the points were so mine.

Speaker 2:          00:41:58       It's so focused in know we're kind of like a panel on a piece of paper. You know human consciousness is likable. The ball point portal that Canon, it's writing but it's just barely making contact. Yeah. What's enough to write and move on, which is not trivial but that's how focused we are and we're focused on the things that we find before. But then question, yes, why don't we find the things we find the portal and pardon and ask her. That means at least in part Kimber kimber filters for you. So for example, an example, if you're high in openness, you're going to be attracted to duty. You'd be attracted. Hispanics. Could he trapped with ideas? If you're an extrovert and it's like the whole world is a part of it and you're the entertainment if you're, their audit is like key things that are game away from him cause you're agreeable.

Speaker 2:          00:42:45       It's relationships. You want to take care of things, you want a formal relationships. If you're conscientious, it's like an eagle lake view, a heat away due to the relative industries orderly. And then not only did they, does that cover your attitudes, but it also filters things for you. So you see the world through your temperament. You can filter news through your temperament, right? And so well part of that is because there's different niches in the world. It's like, you know, maybe you're an entertainer is when people like to fight, you're part of the city you can be relied on. So when people ask you to help them move, which is the going from, you know, maybe you were agreeable. So you know, if someone needs to have a talk about something that's bothering them, that you're there, maybe you're disagreeable or there's someone wants to blunt truth, then you'll come and talk to you.

Speaker 2:          00:43:32       And so these are all places that you can fit in the social structure and in the world. So that's where I lose that 30 again, you know, more power to it. It's great people come equipped in the world with different tools and the tools allow them to do different things. And that's what diversity is. It's real diversity, not that idiot diversity that was showing us right in place of real diversity. All right, so are your, the way you are now, you know Tara is high character, you know it can be both. So for example, if you have a child who's high in neuroticism, let's say, and you can tell if you have a child left out because there more fussy, it's hard to calm them down. They started or easily to a noise. They're more, you know, in more cautious of strangers. If something new, the famous study by drove the get use robots to test kids.

Speaker 2:          00:44:27       See how they describe it that way. Precisely. He wrote all of a sudden Ronnie in his room with these reflect to your rules, maybe wave line slash sheet and somebody can use the extra virgin. Not at all my courses and just, you know, interact with the devil and the more timid ones with hard to be heard. Your parents, mothers, no man. And that was adamant as early a six months. Now what Kagan found was that if the people who have what he called inhibited children were diligent in encouraging them to get out and explore the world, that their level of negative emotion could move towards normalization over a number of years. But they never became truly fearless people. You know, you could modify. And of course if you have a kid like that and you miss, treat them and make the regarding to very uncertain and you take away all the security from them, then you can turn them into a complete neurotic wreck and they'll never recover.

Speaker 2:          00:45:30       And so, and so, you know, the same applies for extroversion and at the same applies for conscientiousness and agreeableness. These things are deeply, deeply rooted in people. Now you can move them around to some degree, but first of all, why would you, except maybe it's nice to have a kid feeling more emotionally stable. Um, it's okay if that diversity exists and it's useful to know that it can be easily automated. That's part of you. The reason that's useful to know if, because one of the things that you want to know, if you want to be successful, find a damn job that suits your cameraman because it's easier than changing their temperament to suit the job. So if you're is meredith and I had made the commotion, I would say say owes no problem. And if you're like our radical extroverts, like computer programming, probably not.

Speaker 2:          00:46:21       You're going to be the guy who's wandering around chatting to all the other programmers and annoying the hell out of them. The, they're introverted and they can be conscientious as well. They want to do is be alone in the border until go away like joe you. So, okay, so back to holy text. Well, it turns out that temperament predicts political belief very nicely. Now at the level of only predicting, say party affiliation or voting behavior, you can give up 10% of the various political weight, which doesn't sound like much, but just lansing to throw the election, right? Because you know the hinge on time, 90 markets the best presses up the u s but if you do a detailed analysis of people's political beliefs, so you differentiate how much farther than you you're voting behavior, you can get like 30% of the variance. It starts to get to viciously powerful, powerful enough to make the assumption that the primary determinant of political belief is temporal and the primary each other, the cameraman is biology and so you're biologically pre disposed to be whatever card you are.

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       Now you might say, well, what about the well known where young people tend to be more liberal, less bleeding in young people or do people tend to be in a more conservative? Part of the reason for that is if people get more conscientious as they age and so that it doesn't destroy it up. I bought the system at all. Now the reason that's useful to know, he said, you know, if you're aware laughy and you're talking to someone who's right way, you're not just talking to some blind 88 you to see the obvious truth. You're talking to someone who's different than you and there's reasons that they're given. It happens at different niche and occupy a different edge. And that's a real niche. It's real. So here's an example. Are you trying to predict entrepreneurial behavior for a long time learned to do it or it's successful and he's nor obvious who entrepreneurs are?

Speaker 2:          00:48:18       You know, are they the same as executives? They say there's managers. So they have to say is an industry, is it the same as your first two professors are artists? None of that. It's all true though. They're the same as ours. So why don't you drivers are creative people. They're high in openness. Now what that means is they're pretty damn good at coming up with eye gaze and moving sideways and reading inside. Cause if they have to, but they generally aren't very good at all. Everyone companies, what do you want to run? The company is someone who's conscientious and conscientious people. They'll do what they're supposed to do. If they know what it is, they're not jumping all over the place. They want to track to walk out. Right? So if you have someone installing gas pipes where there's not supposed to be any leaks cause otherwise they explode.

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       You want some obsessive conscientious got who wants to get with exactly right. You don't want some Korean guy who wants to make like a coach consultant. Entrepreneurs are afraid of him. They're liberals and the managers and administrators on the conservative yet. And so you need liberal place to start companies to be creative and you need conservative types to run. And so that's kind kinda nice. You know, how many creative types need compared to how big managerial types has the same problem as how many fingers do you need in the political sphere versus how many conservatives and actually conveys it depends on circumstances. Okay, so now we'll go into more deeply. So heres the predictors, the fundamental predictors of political belief up. Just a little conservative for now. I say that just left and right. I'll tell you about the flooding from prep types of, but we'll just say the conventional left to right distribution, the right waivers are low in openness. That's the creativity dimension, right? They can't think of very many uses for a break. If you ask them, he use this, well you can't do [inaudible] [inaudible] I can change anything.

Speaker 2:          00:50:19       Creative guy, he's going to get all sorts of like it's a hack, you know, and so on. And so conservatives are low in openness and high in conscientiousness, conscientiousness fractionated into industriousness in order, but he does and they're particularly high in orderliness. So that's the conservative, not a very creative or and you know, confection. Here's some other things. Let's say I'm ordering traditional hierarchical kid dutiful hi candidate here, tactical, conventional, narrow, predictable. Now some of those things, especially if you're labeled, you say none of that for us. Traditional hierarchical, Jill doing it full or orderly. It's like, well do you want things in order or not? You know what, the traffic lights working one of the, his throw one time so to speak. You are with things to do what they're supposed to do. So like while that the ordinary people out or do you want to go do something exciting to get the hell away from them?

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       They have to have point now you could get to order and that's for sure and you can get to anything. That's the thing is that there's kickass cookies at the end of the temperamental distributions to neurotic dog. Good. Too conscientious. You give a no on the obsessive side. Maybe develop an eating disorder, too agreeable everyone. I'm sacrificing myself for everybody. It's like team, you're resentful and bitter because it can't stand up for yourself to friend prison incarceration. It's like William Straight. If you're bad, you go off the rails because people make loud. We want to be happy. He's like, well, how many do you want to be impulsive and there's no trace of it. Someone who's an addict is they only money? Why? Because the world is such a wonderful place. You find. I just find that happy people are impulsive as a year. Notice if you're one of those people who like to drink because it energizes you and you know who's probably 10% of the people in your life that it's like a dream to be energized because most of you just to relax, but some of you get energized.

Speaker 2:          00:52:31       It's like to make good decisions when you're in that habit is no, happiness means rapport. You can grab Napkins, you content. Sometimes that's what good idea, but sometimes it's read it knowledge. So don't be thinking then you know you can't get to happen. It's like he'd get ready to be to happen. So you know they're, they assess it. Any virtue that becomes a virus and that's where I began with the lows and the damn conservatives have to talk. Right? Okay. So if you think you got a company, you want to figure out how many advantages versus how many entrepreneurs who need and that's what that is. And some circumstances there isn't a balance. You can't say, well you need like 40% free people and 60% conscientious me. And the reason you can't say that it's because the environment is a giant snake and it continues.

Speaker 2:          00:53:20       It's giant eternal surfer and you're on it's back and you don't know which way it's going to move. If you fall off and fall off the left side of you die off right side, you die and still run. You want to do is stay approximately in the middle. And so when you need is one side pulling, pulling, pulling. And what you hope is that by holding each other, you say in the name of the damn snake and then you think about how can you decide a pole and the answer is low, but then maybe you killed the other person or they kill you and they need them. As it turns out, or maybe your dad, that doesn't seem like a very good solution again, that that's actually the frog you're trying to solve. And so you can, you can, you can become slaves to the other side. You can impress the other side. You can find with the other side or, or you can talk,

Speaker 3:          00:54:17       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:54:17       that's the alternative. You can talk and you're going to talk to those annoying people who aren't white kidney. And one of the advantages to those who, even people who aren't like, you know, pleadings, you don't know

Speaker 2:          00:54:32       all those people. You get along so well, you're already like with you, you can't remember anything from them. They just know what the same thing as you know. No, that's fine. Do you know everything you need to know? So how do you know? Where do you want? Give me whether or not you know everything you need to know who suffer. So what you're suffering and you are. Then I would suggest you probably have something to learn because maybe if you learned that you wouldn't have to do that. Why? But they're not going to say, well, since you were a new mobile soccer so much, you should talk to someone who knows the things you don't because then we'll try some things you don't know and then you won't suffer so much. And an ask the purpose of free speech. Okay, so let's retracted with it now.

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       You wouldn't use her problems. Well obviously. Why don't you just tragic and shorter. We have a problem. Poor people have problems. Rich people have problems. What are the things? It's actually quite sad about socialists and perhaps about catalyst as well. And both Roddick can overestimate the degree to which money can solve fundamental existential crawls. It actually can't own install. This is quite clear on that too. Why don't you make enough money so you're not suffering from absolute [inaudible], which means that bill collectors chasing you around the get your life miserable. Then additional button on we call it. And so when you get that baby at anybody out to work in class, they go higher than that. Yeah. We might still be resentful because there are legal or Richard and you. But did you get more money? Doesn't help. Why? Well why would you still die? Maybe you ain't no longer. Maybe they can help you in catch later for an extra year.

Speaker 2:          00:56:27       Divorce. Well it doesn't help me get along with your wife. It doesn't help you necessarily get along with your kids. No, it doesn't prevent him from dying or the of various diseases doesn't make it my similar while sometimes lots of times it doesn't. Once you solve your basic economic problems cause she do, just to repeat, what does he have running water, shelter and access to the information you're up. Stitches you can be to except to the comparitor your basic problems. Our soul. Again, the 90th percentile and maybe you want to hit the nine ninth to like one or two of you, but most of the problems I used to be saul.

Speaker 3:          00:57:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       Anyways, people find problematic, right? Life is suffering. That's a fundamental rule. The rule is exactly her job. She transcendence, which is a very straight, very surreal to say, why do you think here's how animals, here's the equipment, you're not stupid hunting as unbelievably intelligent. It's not the same kind of intelligence that we have. So the mosquitoes I'm riding the giant circuit to, it's flipping everything. Some of the ceos are talking about the dog and so how do we manage that? Well there, I mean is made and cruise a whole slew of mosquitoes. No patch if it was feels or at all died except for one I didn't know [inaudible] you just keep going and so many, many mosquito eggs, art of mosquitoes way of thinking, right? Because what the mosquito was doing is producing small parents. I was south, which of those are going to survive? They're slightly different. And then you know, her wonderfulness white, he said, why don't scale. And you go back and tell you why we need the deep and I need a yard. So mosquitoes produce as much as areas of themselves and they're, most of them died. And then one mosquito lives. That's how they propagate themselves through time. So

Speaker 2:          00:58:57       human beings the opposite thing. [inaudible] very deep, very number limit wrap up his or our salt water into educated. And we do that because our children are capable of producing, bearing sometimes sat in front of me. So you know, you play, did you get [inaudible] happen? The Bar, you can send me out to her off that. And in part because you know, give him a paid promotion but you're not there. So that's what an idea is. An idea is I'm avatar you and moral and even think about this from an evolutionary perspective because the prefrontal Cortex, which is the whole of your capacity to think abstractly, grows the lower court. Yes. An order for Texas to thinking that enables you to voluntarily [inaudible] world. And so what you do when you fake is generate, I'm strapped versions of yourself, test them in a fictional environment, figure out which ones are stupid and likely to die and then don't act those out then at that than others.

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       But nonetheless, the technical person doesn't act out their stupidest ideas. And so we internalize the Darwinian process. We think we pretty spare minutes of ourselves. We killed them all for ourselves. And then when you're coming out, the ones that you take your most likely to survive pretty damn smart. So yeah, chaos. But he has limitations. Limitations. Well, we talked about one camera. You know, if you're a local person, phoned openness. This is one of the things that drives me crazy about conservatives. So concerns are blind to bub. They're so fun. Like I remember Harper, this is going to be one of the dumbest things he said. He was talking about harvest.

Speaker 2:          01:00:55       He makes sense each hold like limousine artists that were what? Sponging off the public purse. You know these French artists, it's like there's like three rich artists to Canada, right? The probability that you're going to get Richard as an artist is so low that I didn't know. You're like, you're like, I'm you. You're like you. You're like an accident. If you're, if you're an artist and he would make enough money to survive, it's impossible. There's no rich artists. So, but the conservatives, they don't think, they don't see that because they don't see the contribution that artists make. You're blind to it. And so I can give you exactly what, how open people work and how they contribute to the public good. If he had a large city like Wilson, you, you don't look at these trashy areas that are kind of cool and the old people go there and the reason they go there is because that's the frontier.

Speaker 2:          01:01:50       And that's what, when people go to the frontier, the Korean type status, their niche is the frontier. There's for all tiers everywhere. There's four in science. Does Frontier [inaudible] frontier as literature. There's frontiers in cities and the frontier in the cities where there's other Lemar chaos then order. But there's potential artistic type. Sniff that out. And I as part of, if they can only afford rent there, don't just go hang out with your neighbor. They go, hey hon and rough name because they think, hey this, they can sniff out galleries and maybe we start to go to coffee shops and then they start to do cool things and it starts to get cold. And then the legs helping people who are still kind of open go here and hay out. They think that's cool. And then the entrepreneurial capital was tied to start to notice and they start the road safe and they have a place judge requires the artistic chased, the Reiki.

Speaker 2:          01:02:42       They don't have anybody cause they know how to improve some of the carbon for the city. And so that's what creative people do. Beauty has an incredible, incredible value. Think about Europe. You came, it's a blend. Two as a people or cities, there's the garden, they're European cities. Men, like were you saying about the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars that those dams, European step in Fargo cities, you think about the return on investment that they gathered, you know, I mean places like France and Spain have more tourists then people all the time because people are going there from all over the world, bathing beauty. Also, it's useful to talk to them open types and do appreciate what they have Prof. So anyways, you're blinded by your camper conservatives camps and beauty, uh, liberal types, especially if they're low in order to get us, they can't see the value of diligence or duty.

Speaker 2:          01:03:41       So I ran it the right fingers, traditional, hierarchical, the other gym, beautiful, orderly, hygienic, puritanical, conventional, narrow and predictable. The hygienic and puritanical thing that you could get up and down that's associated with disgust, sensitivity. There aren't really, people are very sensitive to the US and part of the reason that the hyper conservative types are exclusionary is because they build walls around themselves to prevent contamination. And we'll get back to that. And there's reasons for that. It's not arbitrary prejudice all the way. It can be arbitrary prejudice. Unfortunately it's more complicated that left fingers radical fluid, mercurial, Carolyn's chaotic, unsanitary and promiscuous, 12th of and he's doing it depends on your perspective. It's a little harder on the old sexually transmitted disease. You know how many people did age killed? About 400 million. I think that's a fairly high increase in pain, I would say so it's not like there's nothing serious at the bottom of these various is there's something damn serious at the bottom of them and there's real room for flora of have informed opinions. All right, so you got the conservative tax low in openness, high in conscientiousness. You want something done to their people to do it. They're liable. They're traditional or hierarchical. You have Velma structures, their guilt, native soldiers. It's very brilliant, corrupt military accomplishment. Conscientiousness is a good grip crew of race. It's a good predictor of manager of the bakery.

Speaker 2:          01:05:20       The next test doesn't predict creative production, openness. Openness is actually slightly need. If he call me and we started ticketing product, did it as far as we can tell because sorry, support, mostly diligent rather than their artistic the sciences and dealt with through the process. You know, it's, it's a fact that you can grind it out, which just part of why it's so damn powerful. So they're gonna say, well why, why would openness and conscientiousness go together? You political belief because they're not coordinating those, there's traits. It doesn't seem to be any real reason why they should clump together to determine the clinical to be turn in political opinion viewpoint. I was thinking about this a lot and I thought, well, you know, the older people they like, they like the Jack in the box, jump out the blocks and if they don't want the box to stay closed, they want all the possibility and the box does spring out.

Speaker 2:          01:06:15       And so they can do cool things with it. And if you're go to conscientiousness, they're going disgust, sensitivity. So we are a character of borders between things. So on the one hand, they're not afraid of the absence of borders. And I'm have to be like the exciting things that happens to the barbers are transgressed against and I were thinking, well, that pump conservative types, they're high in conscientiousness. It's like they like orders that's ordered. They like to be protected from contamination and the overall in this, so they don't get any thrown with the Jack in the box, jumps up the box. They just think that they should stay in the box for long it long. And then I thought, well that's interesting. You know I mentioned that works every single level of analysis. It's like the conservative types, like the border around concepts, three main title identities, sexual identity, it's holes, private property towels, provinces, states.

Speaker 2:          01:07:04       I thought, well that's what happened in the last election. That's what happened. The trial because what did he say? Let's feel the wall. It's about the borders. Well that's what's happening to Europe to it's the borders. Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right. That's what politics is about. It's about borders between things. And if the fundamental argument is, well, she's worse. She opened her clothes. And the answer that is, it depends on the circumstances because we're driving and johnny sermon, Kevin Number, which weeks where you turn. And sometimes here's what happens. If you open the borders, grace, let's say you woke up from accidentally. So this is what happened to the native Americans. They are warriors, let's say, and his family. And she'll go, well, you know the Spaniards and showed out for off on. We have the social side, particularly rough time for the native Americans. And you know, we conquered the entire territory.

Speaker 2:          01:07:58       But no man, they had horses and armor and the need for having a crisis at the time. And so, you know, that was bad luck, but that wasn't the real problem. The real problem is that the Spanish were filled with the absolutely filthy, like all the European city dwellers of the time packed. And can you, he's living with animals, Roy. The disease developed immunity to diseases. So yeah, when we got small parts, but to die, they book very horrible for chicken pox and we lived through the, and you can make her mom's like healthy. You were, but you were well armed against pathogens. Well, not the North Americans, not the Americans. Not at all. There's hardly any disease here. So the Spanish showed up, not even 5% of the native American style. Right. Think about that. So many of them died and the puritans showed up, which was a long time out with Hispanic, showed up.

Speaker 2:          01:08:56       The native Americans were happy to see them to the Internet, going to be able to take off their crops, guessing like the third of European sky. Yeah. I thought it was a border issue to break because the racks came in off the shifts and it sailed somewhere else. 30% of the European startups, black player. Well, that's not good compared to 95% all in the borders to see what the hell happens. It's dangerous. You know, liberal types. No, no, not all. Wonderful. Now the liberals will say, well, I'll just hold on a minute. It's like, yeah, yeah, there's some danger in close quarter in open borders, but they won't say that because they can't see that. But if they were sensitive and we'd say, yeah, we buy the argument that there's danger in open borders. I think of all the drivers just soak the borders between everyday was like, yeah, fluency and thought.

Speaker 2:          01:09:49       You here to talk about the relationship with the fluency in thought and the ability to think divergently and creativity. It's like, Whoa, become old and borders between things, between concepts, between people, between towns. We're not going to have any new ideas, but I'm going to get anything new happening. We're hungry to go find a stranger from another culture and welcome them in and find out what they held her up to a train and come and get all the cool stuff. That's a problem. If we caused the borders to type it, then what's going to happen is we're going to stay that safety regarding to stand to say, Bro, look the same. We talk the same and then the damn snake is going to move and every single one of us is going to fall off. It's like, yeah, well sort of service and gavel open the borders staff and the liberals say closed borders debt and the right, both of them are right.

Speaker 2:          01:10:42       That's the thing. They're both right and that's why we need to talk to each other. You see, because we can't out. So figure out how to stay on the secretary of the snake without talking to them. Now you've got your biases, your cognitive biases that are built into you, and so you're blind to all solve the world and so you're going to sit down and fit. If you're thinking you actually break yourself into avatars, cards, and you give all those appetizers, the voice, and then you let them how she knows and the woman, where did she go? So even when you were thinking you're basically engaged in dialogue, it's just what you're doing it internally. But you have limits on that because unless you're very good at figuring that, you probably don't want it because people aren't going to do the thinking there. They're really good at jumping into predetermined to conclusions and very bad thing because it's hard to think it's annoying.

Speaker 2:          01:11:34       It's just stressful that it's technically difficult. It requires training. You have to be able to write, you have to be able to think clearly. I feel to formulate an argument you have to read. It's like it's really hard to think and sold as much as could just fly over your built a priori temperamental soldiers, which is what people do to to a great degree. But when I say you can figure to some degree, well good. So that means there's forms of death and misery then you can avoid with some degree of, of you tell them, but you're full of biases. You're going to miss this. This is part of why married people live longer and you never narrative someone. They're annoying. You could think differently than you, but that's so helpful if you listen to them because they can have two brains. Two brains actually get you through the royal families of one grade if the brains are communicating and if they have some differences, right, because then you're not just producing the same.

Speaker 2:          01:12:23       So if I open myself up to someone else and talk to them it in dialogue, then be correct. The errors in my thinking and then perhaps less less chance of suffering and dying and so the reason that you have to engage your Donald Donald's because that lifts you out of your a parochial view and helps you clarify the world and clarify how to act in the world with all these different people that you have to get along with. That's part of it, but also to survive just in the world and make a little sidebar. Here is something that we can talk about more in future. I have been thinking about those damn postmodernists pernicious, horrible idea is true that any text has an infinite number of potential interpretations and then therefore there's no way of determining which interpretation is correct. Now the problem with that interpretation because it in some perverse sense is true because there are so many phenomenon the delay themselves before you even the world that you can construe it involved in different ways, but here's for the wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:13:43       They say you can interpret it that same way. Therefore you're traveling the world in a way because the world is like a text. If it has multiple potential donation, but looking for some of those interpretations will kill you. Someone goes into her, patients will make you suffer. Some of those are patients will make people around you suffer. Some of those interpretations will make people hate you. Some of those interpretations will make people refuse to cooperate with you. So you say, well there's this multiplicity of interpretations, but it's constrained by the necessity of preserving yourself. Preservative, dyadic relationships, preservative, progams, social, social contexts. So happy in a manner. So pursuing your own selfish interests definitely stabilized old damn game. And also when you act in the actual world, it doesn't slap you so hard across the face that you perish. And so yes, there are home with the DMP certifications, but there is a very tiny fraction of them that actually have any functional utility. So I'm the runs completely be the nihilistic argument related to multiplicity. That's at the basis of postmodernist. They know what's at the basis of postmodernism cause that's why they turned the Marxism Dornier themselves. Because you can't do anything if you're a postmodernist because there's no proper solution. So anyways, back to free speech.

Speaker 2:          01:15:13       You have to think because if you don't think you die but you're too stupid to pick rod, you are, you have to talk to other people because they tell me why you're stupid. And then if you listen, you're not quite so stupid. Now you go and die for often. So that's the bottom line. And they might say, well who should I talk to them and answered as well. If you talk to people that you agree with, you don't burn anything cause they are to think the same way you do. And unless you're 100% correct and I will be very, very hesitant about including that. If you're still suffering and I her 100% correct, then you've got to go find out an entity. Have you talked to, because maybe they'll point something out to you that you seriously, seriously, seriously needs to know. And so you know, our culture of Western civilization, let's say roughly speaking, it's a good culture.

Speaker 2:          01:15:56       You know, like I'm the utopian, it's got its problems. If you compare it to a hypothetical utopia is hell on earth except we're not. Hypothetical. Utopia actually tries to manifest itself because Ben didn't find out what really is. But that is how you compare a society. What you do is you take a society and say, well how are we good compared to like other societies and actress? Well, you won't be hampered skill you guys like that. They could go wherever they want and so when they go, well they go to that tiny handful of countries that has the lacy that's tightly associated with free speech. Why? Because basically we can solve our problems that we have. We don't have any, we got a loss, but we can solve a why cause we figured something out. We figured out that there's nothing more important than free speech because that's what thinking is.

Speaker 2:          01:16:54       That's the logos that sits at the bottom of our culture, right? The divine word that transforms chaos into order continually and you are taking half, not individually precisely. Although you do as an can, participate in conversation, communication with other soul and also sad you straight. If you're not afraid, then you suffer and die and so when people around, because lots of people laying that down. But if you're nodding at that end, if you're ready to get it done, you should really be hearing is it the task stuffy and where the work to bring it to a hall, making her song case for that. I think it's a terrible case. I think it's a profoundly flawed chase because it's predicated on the idea that you've already done everything you could to improve phase. So I would say well before you transform yourself into the ultimate judge of being, you should try to get your act together to some degree and see if you can draw things around. You can render your final judgment and how you do that. Well, what does that mean?

Speaker 2:          01:18:15       What do you no, no, no. That's where things aren't right that sex, the other and go on as well for you and I'm going to work for your family. It could be, or your community or your country or the world you can be trying to solve. Then he asked us a couple, are you touring assault? That's not the right person, right? First two years are trying to solve them with all your heart and mind and soul. And that is no, I spent six hours a day wasting time, which is pretty much standard. And you got no right to say anything at all except started getting bacteria. And so it's time for everyone, right? That's the right response is that orients you property towards Ba and then being humble, knowing that you don't have your act together. Then maybe you open your eyes when you say todd, just more things. I don't know what. I'm stupid. And there's some people who are different from me. Maybe if I talk to them, listen to mostly cause you wouldn't believe when people will bloody will tell you if you listen to them. It's just absolutely unbelievable experience listening to people. Cause I'm a clinical psychologist cause it's like there's a dos nfc. No.

Speaker 2:          01:19:32       Once you get the problem, 88 theological presuppositions and they start talking about the reality that they're actually in contact with. They're endlessly revealing and remark and you learn. And you mentioned listening to what a good deal that is because you're not very smart and he was suffering. And so you know, if you could learn something from someone, especially someone different than you, it's like wow, it's a good day math in sixth grade. Okay. So, okay, so

Speaker 2:          01:20:03       back to the left lane. Well, right. What do you are, you know, disintegrated or I don't pick up after themselves because sometimes we need that. And then so there were no, just a sec conservatives. Well, I know they've got the blinders on, man. They're just not that exciting this page and make it a little discriminatory. They like things to stay where they are, so they're not that much fun to party with. You want something done? Well, they're equal and you know, they're hauling the people that you want to be false sterilized, hypodermic needles, for example.

Speaker 2:          01:21:03       So let's appreciate political distribution and let's understand that. You need to say on the dark in there. I'm snake. Okay, so I'll close with a little more elaboration on the left. The main rationale for free speech, that was something like free speech is being used by fascists or as far as politically correct. Radical left is conservative. Everything because he used to impress the oppressed. They got a one size fits all solution. It's corporate intellectually and it's pathological world and that's part of, it's just too easy. I the side of the oppressed that needs to be a good person. It's like, you know, first of all, what makes you think you're on the side of your pressed? Really, you really dare to claim it's not so easy to be on the side of the deal press. It takes a hell of a lot of work to be on the side of the oppressed and you can do sergeants in the face of people that you think you, hey, that's not on the side. You'll laugh. That's no matter to say, why am against poverty?

Speaker 3:          01:22:22       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       oh, [inaudible] you a word. If there was some controversy company come to visit, there's a little article in the newspaper. Somebody who was your professor said was reprehensible. I was making the space on safe, but you can tell presuppositions and get down to the, and so I tweeted out with top off the linfield college to violate some safe space. It's a satirical show. They got wind of it. That's a pretty vicious tweet. Doesn't matter the venue, I mean serious of all the people who should be in favor of free speech, it shouldn't be the people who are hypothetically on the side of the people press. Why the radical left precept position is everything's a hyper dominant patriarchy and the people at the park, all the power. Okay, well then the people at the top, whenever they want, they own the newspapers, they own TV stations. They only advertisements. They only corporations. They can say wherever they want, whenever they don't need to be protected. Obviously they have a little, and I'm speaking from a logical framework, right? Well who needs for connection if they want to speak for obviously the people who are up the water. Okay, so let's review the evidence.

Speaker 2:          01:24:40       Social movements of the 20th century. What's the way mantra, speak truth to power? That means you've got, you have to be able to speak to speak out and hypothetically not going to be in power. Things like, hey, that's a lot of what you've got on half my core aid, but why people are you kidding? He's got a lot of courage. That guy and he's conquered. Know he's, he's a show both. He started my butt. That's version of vital comedians, like definitely got Walter play because they're good at, they're good at social critics. You know, so far you got to speak truth to power. Well then you better be able to speed that. That's the fundamental issue. So, okay, so you're left your, you want to slap it on the inequality, the Rhogam and you think, well Geez, I'm going to be able to talk about this at least.

Speaker 2:          01:25:37       And then you think, well let's, let's restrict free speech and many things. Here's a, here's a lesson from the military. If you make a weapon here, meb, how's it been 15 years? So you know, the logical conclusion to that is something like kind of be slightly carry both which weapons you made it and so what's the lesson for their free speech? Trump haters. It's like you guys are the ones who think that everyone else has to power. You start restricting free speech, which you're doing what you're doing it radically, continually, no stall. It's like you think for a moment. If those people who have the power and the, let's say the crooked people who have the power, just to clarify it, you just take that, they're not going to get a lot better at that than me real quick here. So glad they're naive and it's doing even funny.

Speaker 2:          01:26:30       They're going to be those. Every single one he used to oppress free speech is going to be a bat. You would force it. You can imagine. And so then you wonder, well, people that are pushing us west whatsapp with are naive. Is that whole? Are they going to eat or are they willfully blind or are they actually malevolent, but they actually aiming at, now I'll go with naive because that's the simplest explanation, but I wouldn't rule out the other ones. All right, so let's look at the 20th century suffered. Yes, women's rights. How did that come about? Freedom of speech, labor unions, the powerful did not want the labor unions to organize. How did that come upon? Freedom of speech, all of civil rights for black people and Mexicans, but Mexicans, civil rights movement isn't as well know. How'd that come about? How about constitutional protection for free of fees? What are the students who it started in that absolute grassy s virtually

Speaker 3:          01:27:37       [inaudible]. The free

Speaker 2:          01:27:45       speech movement started in 1964 [inaudible] 65 after. Why? Well, there was a ban on normal standard campus political activities and so the students fought for the right to free speech and academic freedom and the one, well, they weren't since they're on the left, those people, right, they were already ally. If it's a civil rights movement, they became the leaders of the students move with him as he had them anti war movement to other movements which depending on free speech. What about the environmental movement or the lgbt movement with all, it's not dependent on free speech for obviously these were can you support rex marginalized people? All they had was their capacity to formulate an argument to make a sad sacks if they didn't have the power. Right? Right. Lackeys they didn't have the power. That's the honey claim, so we're powered and they have, they have the power to speak German.

Speaker 2:          01:28:43       That's actually power. Its real power and so if you're normally side, if you will crest like you claim, then you should be standing up as diligently as you possibly can for free speech because it's the most powerful weapon you have to write the societal that you're hypothetically and perhaps realistically concerned about. We have to discuss inequality for example. You have to discuss it long enough until we figure out how saw everything from stacking up at one end of the distribution and then everyone else hitting zero, and this is going to be a big problem. So example,

Speaker 3:          01:29:25       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:29:27       the Tesla guys, they're building on top of the sarcoma, but they're not stupid. You know, you ain't going to stop there. We're building a condoms. He goes, they're building robots and robots. Autonomous Robots are first going to take the shape of a car. An autonomous car is no more a car. Then the car was a horse drawn carriage. They're not the same thing. They're not even close to the same thing. And they're going to produce societal transformations that are so radical lifter unmanageable. But I can tell you one of the transformations that going to occur, what's the most common source of employment for Man in North America? Driver, right? And so for instance, the autonomous robots show up, which isn't going to be very long then why all those people going to do, and the answer is they're going to stack up at zero. And that's what's already happened in the United States. In particular in the rust belts. I mean, that's why trump got elected, right? Because the Damn Democrats here, absolute stupidity abandoned the working class who make important to represent well, it's not good. They're going to be dispossessed people. It's going to be a big problem and we need to figure out how to solve it. And so we need an active laugh. We need the left. It actually stands for not postmodernism and not daredevil, murderous, reprehensible. Marxism like that has to go

Speaker 3:          01:30:56       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:31:06       Rodney Times attracting Nazis. It doesn't seem to be terrific, but in any case, that's an accusation, that's b level. But here's something strange at mcmaster. You know, there's that big demonstration against me and uh, there's of students there, maybe they were students, they were professional protest, your gripes. And if they were students, they haven't been educated by the professors doctor into what's essentially a call. And they showed up with a big banner. It had a hammer and sickle on. It's like, what the hell? No, I'm serious. Like this is not funny. It's not funny. The circle was mostly used to cut off people's heads. What are in the 20th century was no cocktail and chill. Yeah. You still got North Korea to deal with. Oh, that wasn't real communism. Oh, your city is, well, you see plenty of examples of real communism, so I would say you'd have to tell them university circumstance, I'll problem because people will know more dare to go and do a protest without blood hammer and sickle, the name of the gear to go in a Nazi uniform. What do you mean by social scientists in universities identified themselves as Marxists. It's like, why the hell is that acceptable? What does it take for us to learn? Or obviously a couple of you, your desk and the Cold War, nuclear thermal, nuclear annihilation, while one is

Speaker 2:          01:32:55       anyways,

Speaker 2:          01:33:00       oh, mnemonics calling investigations that I've done trying to get to the bottom have indicated to me that there's something to the notion of being eternal human soul. Now you'd called a metaphor if you want. That's fine. Matt, for us, turn out to be extraordinarily powerful days. How is this sold? Conceptualized? Conceptualized is either prophetic voice, so [inaudible] Jewish conceptualization or as the logos and what is that? Well, it's the voice that restructures in equitable social societies. That's the prophetic voice that makes the horse, that transforms the chaos of potential, which is everywhere around us, into Howard Bloom order in which that soul manifests itself. So the society, we can be guided by it. This term, all through communication, term free speech limitation on that is to put a limitation, I would say on the Holy Spirit itself and not the sin that cannot be forgiven.

Speaker 3:          01:34:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:34:15       And so why would say wait, stop allowing people to do this. Then you don't remember. No one's brandon left, right? Whatever you can possibly do is dependent on your ability to communicate what you believe as clearly as possible. It's your holy duty to do that. And anyone who interferes with that interferes with the proper on the phone. We going to be, it's up and it's a catastrophe. Have

Speaker 4:          01:34:59       universities in shed and the humanities specifically are the worst offenders. Thank [inaudible] uh, I don't actually have a question. I was just wondering if you could comment on kind of the before and after of your life from the point where video games, political correctness, you just want to tell a little anecdote, a little story about the vortex. You got sucked into the first part. Mostly it's surreal. It was surreal. Oh, first of all, these videos as upset, I need to design apps to church people, the Apple Watch things at the same time I started to toy with youtube because I have a little bit of exposure on public health issue for Ontario and they get a from the course. Um, and so I put those on youtube and you know, people watch them a little bit. And then I started from my lectures on the two of them.

Speaker 4:          01:37:27       I thought that was cool school, crappy videos and that sort of thing through, which was, you know, it's a Frankenstein Monster, like [inaudible] [inaudible] set up my patriarch accounting because I was curious about how cruel people can monetize their products. And Patriarchal seems like the electricity thing. So I thought I'd explore it. Best thing to do with that is to get involved in all views over three years. And I had about 10,000 subscribers. We were talking, you know us a lot. That's a long view with a man. If I sold, we sold a million copies and B, you know, I can do touchdown dances in that. You would catch that with dances, ecstasy. You never see.

Speaker 4:          01:38:20       And so in September, October I be picking on political correctness for quite a while back, I was writing a book which is going to be published in February. It's called 12 the 12 things everyone don't hope for life. An antidote to chaos. Okay. Coming down from the facility, one of those jobs it's called chapters in that book is called [inaudible]. The children that they're skateboarding and it's all political correctness and it's always obsessing me. Cause if you know, since you get into that, it's just takes over your life. And uh, I got news, how would this bill see? 16 then I investigated it. I also had a couple of clinical clients would be drinking beyond your limit of tolerance by politically correct people in your workplace. Who are really harassing the hell out of the name of sensible people. And so all of that working together when I thought I was not sleeping one night and I can either write it or I could get video, how to make video and see if like my cell phone, it goes to this political practice, your university and also just what's going to make it mandatory for their human resources.

Speaker 4:          01:39:29       People to either go auntie unconscious bias training, which I think is reprehensible. And so I've made one video tell me about why I thought bill CC scheme is dangerous and that we maybe have one vote antivirus trig and unconscious bias and uh, you know, then I was a little clearer and I thinking and I thought that was that. Well, you know, listen to people who watched it. That's your job to feature.

Speaker 4:          01:40:01       And then it's been a tornado since then and some of it's great. Like this is great. Some of it's not so great, you know, it was very worrisome or being for about two months. Mostly I would say on behalf of my family because my job was in Germany, right? Severes here I got my two warning letters from the university which were full of lies. Most of the admissions, admissions with truth and I know how companies, corporations and she's fired people. They send three letters of warning and then if they take action, that's what they were doing going down the hr tactic and then which they were continually going down except that I know about the support and so what happened to begin with was the journalists, they didn't and a good guy, but some of them actually read the material while I was waiting on my baby and thought, oh, he's actually just telling people what's actually in the legislation and they were journalists who handed it to be more conservative about free speech. Then rose and so going to watch the journey was started after you my favorite and then the social justice warriors play their role because they came up with a free speech rally and again, a variety of cinematically describing that's not strategically viable phase.

Speaker 4:          01:41:40       This is quite educated. I wouldn't say cynical and dark heart rate every time that as social justice warriors you cannot me, all I have to do is stand back [inaudible] himself. I was somewhat confusing, although expressing no get faster tobacco. There's a good example of that. Like I could just sit back and let the performance of her because I knew that a very large number of people that watch it and it was a very large number of people did it. And so like great. I most of the rest of it is just surreal. I know I do words. Um, I don't really have any idea what's happening.

Speaker 4:          01:42:38       It's very difficult for me to pick the proper level of analysis. I do real deep at the fundamental level of analysis. There's the social movements at the deepest levels feel about, but I still talking about what's happening in Alaska somewhere between philosophical and theological. Um, we're in a moment of crisis. The things can go either way and I'm hoping that they go through traffic and I'm hoping that what I'm doing is facilitating that turned to be very careful with what I say. And, and then the close is the, I decided a long time ago that there, I learned a long time ago that there are two ways of forgiving yourself through like why you, you decide that you want use your layers to get it. That's a lot better than not doing anything. This is the critical year into like, except that's not going to use your language to get what you want.

Speaker 4:          01:43:45       Okay, here's another, you'd use your language to state what you observe and decentralized as clearly as you possibly can and let whatever is going to have. So that's what I tried to. So this is all what's happened and fundamentally it's okay with me because already decided that whatever the outcome was of doing that was going to be okay. It's an act of faith. It's Dick after faith action because you've decided that the world run better on truth or false. If you're going to stand on truth, that's a decision that you speak the truth and you let the cards fall where they fall. And so I was watching where they fall and I'm trying to stay intact and so far it's working. So thank God Eric. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:44:56       yeah, maybe we could go, let's, let's make it a little bit though because people want to know what the hell's going on. So how about 20 hours but time is it, it's almost like, okay, how about 20 after is that I'm doing okay cause I won't be intelligible after with open dialogue between the only thing that helps keep communication between could do to get a few clients. How do you connect the people who are cleaning certain ways to find, okay, well first of all I wouldn't say that necessarily come down, right? So there's an analogous problem in clinical psychology, which is how, what do you do to help someone who doesn't want to be helpful and answer? It's, I could use a new guest of quote against that. It's another harsh one. Don't cast pearls before swine. I took me a long time just going to escape.

Speaker 4:          01:45:57       And what it means is that you deem valuable. What's valuable by offering it to people who will not appreciate. If you can engage to Donald's a summer and go find someone that you can engage with and maybe, and you might say, well what about those people? And I would say, what the best thing to do with them, the first day of the series you live in again and burry the desk. And the second answer is the only way that you get a person a self if I can help is by example. So you'll walk away from people you cannot communicate with, you, communicate with people who you can communicate with and you try to put your life in the water and then, and then you hope that some of the wake up and some of the well,

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       so. Yep.

Speaker 3:          01:46:54       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:47:00       thank you very much for your speech tonight is fantastic. Um, my question was dre simple. Um, it has to do with your crowd funding academic research, which we recently did on Coco for earlier, I believe it said, and you raised more than doubles so far. Your original goal is now $162,000, which is amazing. Um, and I hope the organizers of this event, we'll post the links, we can get more money. But if your question is, this is the first time I've ever seen a university research funded by the public at large as opposed to through one of the Canadian research councils, which usually are, there's a community and there's a different process. To me it seems like it's precedent setting is not willing. Right. How would you think this will change the pattern, uh, research funding in Canada? Well, that's a good question. I mean, one of the things I haven't talked about, first of all, if that's how I'm my campaign, right? It's the real community is now they asked me if they could run it and I said yes, but I, I don't believe I would've done it on my own because it seemed like,

Speaker 2:          01:48:15       what did it seem like? It seems in some sense by capitalizing on misfortune know and so, so anyway, so they did it. I'm happy about that. But when they decided to do it, I talked to a number of people that I know about what this could conceivably me. And one of the things that we thought about was setting up a system whereby other professors could do the same thing. I've been researchers, no doors, some sites like set up, I think there's one called the spear mint.com I passed right by the way, but it does fine with these sorts of things. Um, it might be worth investigating whether this is say a reasonable and Broccoli precedent, but it isn't obvious to me that I have the time to investigate that old enough to figure out how to do it. And that's part of what I'm trying to figure out right now.

Speaker 2:          01:49:03       So I'm going to be talking to people over the next couple of months in all likelihood. I have some, some supporters who are reasonably well capitalized and they are interested in working to allow that sort of thing to happen. But it's very complicated. I am, I'm already walking by and so I know the answer is I don't know what sort of precedent and step. I do know that it's going to keep, my graduate students were waiting for the next three years. So with any luck I'll apply for another grant this fall and yet, and then I'll have more money than I would that would be funding. So I hope that,

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       uh, I'd like to thank you for posting your videos. The lectures on the young and archetypes president of the lion king is worthwhile if anyone's interested. My question though is about the limits and restrictions on free speech. So honestly we're opposed to anyone who wants to restrict free speech. However, how do we deal with issues like death threats or dishonest or pernicious to advertise? Yeah. Well are you saying we've already dealt with that pretty nicely. Like there are, there are limits to coerce a speech to the be, I think he was home law actually has dealt with that very, we see I'm a great admirer of English common law, English common wise and the whole legal system. Right. So just so you know, cause you should've jumped because our legal system is to come follow it up by me. What would you call it? Intro mission of French civil law precepts into the English common law system, which is catastrophe in my estimation.

Speaker 2:          01:50:40       Under English common law, you have all the rights there are and are granted to you by the government you have. And then what's happening in English on laws when you have some rights and rights, common had scrapped because you know, you don't know where one right ends the other who begins. And so then we gave each other the court and then the court decides roughly speaking where the line should be drawn and then the law of builds organically across content. And how do we, now that it's come up with all sorts of, we could call the limitations on, I wouldn't say free speech precisely because I don't really believe that that's what they are, but I'm like, you can't outrun death threats. So, and I guess it's partly the paradoxical situation where sometimes what you're doing with your free speech is interfering with the continuation of free speech, in which case you should be saw.

Speaker 2:          01:51:30       It's something like that. And so, you know, there should be limits on seditious speech of some sort because that's treasonable speech. You know? And I guess if what you're doing is oriented towards demolishing the structure upon which your own freedom depends, then something has to be there has to be eliminated. Now where did evidence should be? Well that's a tough one but that's, but a lot of that card would be seven. You know, there's lots of things you can't ever get France you can incite to criminal activity, right? And you can't blatantly lie if you are a commercial vendor, in fact been tobacco for example. And it has to be certain in the Supreme Court and your ass, you have to put warnings on your tobacco product that's compelled speech, which was what I was objecting to. It feel see 16 but outside of the commercial domain there hasn't been any attempt to compel speech. And that's how it should. So I think those things have to agree to be dealt with on a case by case basis because the devil's in the details. And that's also why English common law, such a staggeringly brilliant contribution to world culture. And you know, if you want to think, well, is there any of your collectors for that? It's like, yeah. Most countries that we're founded on English

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       common law are rich in the Americas. Founded my friends core funded by Portugal ports, founded by Por [inaudible] rich. So any sligo structure now that's my home was a great book, Huh? What was it called? The wealth and poverty of nations. It was written by a Harvard professor who analyzed, he was very generous about why some countries in the Americas we were pouring, some are rich because they all have natural resources, what's going on. And so, and then other countries like Japan, you know, we need the resources and the rich are functioning. Legal System said is the ultimate attachment resources. So it was becoming an yep.

Speaker 3:          01:53:36       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:53:40       this relates to Sam Harris has been set. We will like it, but I'm just gonna go with it if you don't mind. Uh, so why can't be subjective? I, you know, luther and still fit into your methodological perspective. Well see the thing about a question like that, this is the truth. This is the truth about any question like that. When you say is a equivalent to be,

Speaker 4:          01:54:09       the answer is it depends on how you define it in your hands. Now you'd find you'd be like, it's a weasel answer in some sense, but it's actually the correct answer because I can't answer that question without knowing what you specifically mean by illusion and specifically meaning about the subject. Now and I would also say the question is not that I didn't call because they are referring to is not homogenous. It's heterogeneous of eyes, you know, radiation, something like harvey was something like a unity after call and some of that of yours in some sense a losery. Did he get in the same way that the desktop on your computer isn't an illusion. The representation of the actual computational processes, it's more illusory. It its function. If you're thinking about illusion as some, you see you have to define the physical arena in which you were formulating the concepts before.

Speaker 4:          01:55:12       We could have a proper discussion of that. Now that I would say the simple truth that Ari and here too is that civilizations that act as if human beings have freewill seem to work. Now that's a pragmatic didn't habits, right? Sounds scientific, but I'm a pragmatist so that is pretty far from me. And so from a shorthand perspective, I would say if something is functional and it's based on the particular first principle, the first principle is true enough and that's where I think about free will and not sort of thing about the idea of the soul. Now I'm not saying that constitutes that exhaustive analysis of freewill core of the soul. It is, but it's a good first pass approximation. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:56:14       um, I saw him on your q and a's. I hope this isn't too unrelated but it's probably what we keep it lighter. Um, you said that you're a big fan of a guilty pleasure for trailer park boys, a brief sort of article, well your hair characters and maybe the tie back to free speech. How a show that is so crude and offensive managers to be making the most positive

Speaker 4:          01:56:51       here. Um, well I'm from northern Alberta. I don't know if you know the movie. Um, rhubarb. I went foobar it's actually about the people that I grew up with. Pete to some degree having us watch for the border probably eight years ago because they have one of my old friends and we were scared of swatches. You know, I, there's something about, I went to the class guys, I think they're fighting, they have great senses of humor and something, I read this, one of the ways the working class guys compete is through observing for restaurants. I heard lots of rough places, rail crews and that sort of thing. And what keeps guys alive in situations like that? Is there a certain sense of humor and the training of our employees is a great example that I think it's hilarious that the Canadian government funds it.

Speaker 4:          01:58:08       Yeah. And this is also the simpsons. It's absolutely reprehensible in all of its details except for its container, the simpsons. The family is central to this instance, right? Well to say about homeowners, like loves his family, who, anything for his family and fundamentally they're oriented towards each other. And so it's always a calming because there anyhow. And so that's what gives best what makes the simpsons just mean spirited. It's not mean spirited. It's great. Saqqara everyone's, he held the Joe and the characters are, are essentially moral and it's the same, somewhat lesser degree. It's like, because the stories when it's working, the story is, well two things. It's about impulsive, male stupidity, also friendship. And it really is about friendship. Even the enemies are friends. And so the creative subject have done this remarkable job of walking the line between satirical, like English to meet needs. It's great car, but they have, they have their characters, the characters completely reprehensible. Right? So that's part of why I left the street, goes to Vegas. I think unbelievably funny because you watch it then have this documentary like aspect is easy, but these are real people. Conky episode down.

Speaker 4:          02:00:06       I have a bucket list to be invited on the trailer park.

Speaker 3:          02:00:19       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:00:21       Um, I just have a question about, uh, your plane's on political belief and direct correlation to big five personality. Um, I, you mentioned that there's truth ain't truth be fighting it out in this between the right and the left. Um, what do you mean pass the treaty? Which is what I see is emerging is the libertarian movement, which isn't really in either category. The first answer is I don't know enough about libertarians to say because we haven't been able to sample it off the boat. You get a sense now I shouldn't say that the 23 correct types are not causing, just so everyone knows the biggest English or for the politically correct heights is that they're very high in agreeableness. Anyone say, well, I don't see very real. People are only agreeable to say like, so if you're in their desk, then you're gay. But if you're outside the nest or a snake and so they're very agreeable behaves, but they're not very agreeable to snakes. And most people are snakes. So, so, but the is my suspicion is that there are high in openness and high in conscientiousness. I don't know. I really don't know. They may also not be very agreeable because they're kind of like, leave me the hell times,

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       which kind of goes with the sort of people that I, I'm agreeable, I'm quite agreeable with the guests. I find it really hard, disagreeable types, basically telling him to screw off and that can be really useful because that is what you should do. I suspect that the Libertarians are more disagreement. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:02:04       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:02:09       ah, so you expressed some concern about losing your job at University of Toronto and I was just wondering, given that you're picture on income, excuse my own salary, is there a threshold at which you would consider resigning and pursuing a youtube just being oppression of youtube as your primary? Well, you know, I thought about that, but as I said earlier, I like to do both things at the same time and right now there's no reason to do that. I have this great professor and I should also say on behalf of when students like, look, I went back to teach in January and I was not in very good shape. I have real health crisis in December, which I think was unrelated to this. We're not, but I was reading on in good shape and I, I had been, it had been recommended to me by my chair.

Speaker 2:          02:02:57       I'm not returned to teaching independently of what was going on at the university. There's no damn way. I just like, no, I wasn't, but I wasn't clear to me how much additional stress, I'm just going to kill the target. Or the students were extraordinarily well and he knows the students at the university trav and most students, most of them are kids, are first generation immigrants, right? It's like they're on a bloody political bandwagons frame from their economic future there post powered by the dreams and desires of their parents, and I'm working in south down to the tailbone. I'm trying to get her degree in new up here. It'd be functioning. And so I liked the undergraduates. It a small percentage of it. Is Paris laws the same? Damn, no.

Speaker 2:          02:03:52       I don't even know how many of them are students for now. And then there's the administrative person, a fair number of the sites who are politically correct, but the university itself is actually quite conservative in the small sisense. Now that's annoying sometimes because I'm right radical from a creative perspective. And so I find we have some constraints, whatever. I got nothing to complain about this with the rest of, it's a highly, highly privileged job and thrilled to have. I'm lucky to have it fortunate. I like teaching young people. It's a great privilege to do it. And so I don't see any reason to stop and I think there can be both. And so far that's working. So as long as the loan, which is my libertarian aside, as

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       long as I left alone by the university and my gender, yeah. Then I can have my cake and eat it too. And so that's a good deal. Um, so earlier in your speech and you mentioned how the length generally kind of come to the aid of who they perceive at as oppressed. Right. Uh, so I kind of view, uh, the rights as being sort of a price on the left to myself. Uh, do you think my perception is correct and if so, why do you think that the social justice type don't also see it like I did? Yeah. Well, you know, we're in a time of cat, right? Isn't that [inaudible] times things reverse in twists and, and we're in many and I believe that where I do believe that that's [inaudible] main process has emerged is the left or pressing the right, I think it's more like the left has gained the routing color as being incremental control over many institutions as a consequence of inappropriate public subsidy. So there not that many of them.

Speaker 4:          02:06:19       There are whole disciplines that are pathologically etiological possess, which like the ethnic studies waiting studies types where the studies in particular it's complaining of hospital and increasingly the humanities are being pulled into that vortex that have postmodernism two thirds of the way down to Marxism. Underneath that, the problem is, is that set up a system where people are, that orientation can draw a stable cell for decades. There's thousands of them, hundreds of thousands perhaps and do nots. But we're on what they say demo on which is the underlining of the patriarchy, which is a reprehensible term. By the way. It's a wrongful oversimplification of the estate and it's also profoundly the ungrateful because although the Patriarchy is an oppressive structure obviously because any social community requires conformity or it's not a social community, it's also staggered in a productive and for example provides them with a degree of safety and security. This unthinkable. Well they pursued their fifth call agenda. We've got to stop. It's not acceptable and the way we started in parties, Harrods, don't let your children take you. Never of course

Speaker 5:          02:07:55       [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          02:08:03       One of the things that I've been thinking about doing this, and this would be a great crowd source project. I would like to make up a technical, if I can do a technical analysis of postmodern slash Marxist slash social justice terminology, you'd be working on that already. And then great course descriptions, how of course descriptions raging fires and publish them. And so then with brain corridor, universities and colleges by social justice infiltration and to do this and that and produce a manual for parents and high school students that would say who not to take courses in which horses and you avoid because I think that starving them out is the right approach and it's going to be difficult because they'll take your, and I've been an admirer of 10 but the system's gone sideways, that there was a way of exploiting it and, and, and it's being exploited.

Speaker 4:          02:09:04       I mean the, I don't know how many of you guys fall real peer review cat. I would recommend that one player that you want to see what the pathological humor, these spoilers are up to you as soon as described the real peer review and it's like you, it's, it's far more observant than to on so, so I don't remember what your question basically is the oppressor to right. Uh, and then like recognize some, well the left, he has a little pressing the universities and the universities are oppressing the culture now with that and that translates to some degree into what you're disruptive. So thank you.

Speaker 5:          02:09:56       [inaudible] on behalf of the UBC Bruce Beach Club, we just wanted the thing, everyone that are coming out and we want to think Dr. Peters in determining as well are those that we will be seeing some of you tomorrow where we will be doing the devouring mother event will be a joint conversation between Dr. Peters and Hen Third Myers right there and uh, that will be live streamed as well along this way. And that's going to be on a and media for now. And I know that you want a copy of that. So that's going to be on your channel. And listen to me eventually. And, uh, what those were. Those were those. Yeah. And that's, and for those of you who have a VIP tickets, you get a phone call as well. So yeah, thank for coming out.
