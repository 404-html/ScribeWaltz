Speaker 1:          00:00:02       I become aware of over the last five years or so that there's a significant overlap between the concepts that I'm telling you about and Heidi groups work. I didn't know that, you know, ideas come from lots of different places. It's hard to track them down, but when heidegger was trying to what what heidegger's philosophical program essentially consisted of was the rediscovery of being now he believed that prior to the ancient Greeks for quite rational and modern in their approach to the world that people lived in a relationship with being that was much less mediated by interpretive structures I suppose is one way of thinking about it and he thought of being as something that was in framed and the framing, which is also a term that I use. The framing restricts the manner in which being is able to manifest itself. So it's like a reduction of being something specific.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       Now it's pretty obvious and Heidi girl obviously knew this, that in order to interact with something you have to simultaneously not interact with everything. So you have to reduce the phenomenon to pinpoint before you can. You can actually interact with it in any immediately useful manner, but when I'm hiding her points was that that also restricts our ability to be in direct contact with speeding and he thought of that as like the ground of meaning. Now I think there's different sorts of meeting and perhaps if you're getting to is the meaning of the thing that reveals itself to you. And so that would be the meaning of an anomaly in some sense. And then there's the meaning of the framework that you used to interpret the situation. And then there's the meaning that you experienced when you transform the framework that you use to look at things.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       So those are all forms of meeting and they're all interrelated. But, um, it has striking to me, Heidi, that Heidegger, heidegger hiding Heideggerian approach to this because in some sense he was also reacted to niches, ideas about the debt gone. So it was an attempt to help people reorient themselves in the world in, in the novel historical situation where we had to become. You cashed in some ways from our traditional religious beliefs, which were in some sense a form of framing. You know, one of the things young said about religions, he said the purpose of her religion was to stop you from having religious experiences. It's quite an interesting way of thinking about it because what was claiming was that the purpose of a religious system wants to filter the overwhelming power of being down to a point where you could tolerate conceptualizing it, but you know the price you paid for. That was a certain kind of arbitrary limitation clause. You're always paying the price for arbitrators invitation, but it would be nice if you could also transcended that from time to time and realize that there's meaning outside of the frameworks that you

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       generally in habit and that you can narrow those frameworks so much that you don't get any of the vivifying form of meaning.

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       You would think of that when he was thinking about it symbolically. You would think about that as the absence of the water of life sounds, which is a very. It's a very calm with multisig fairytales. You know the king is old and desperate guy and the only thing that'll save the water of life is great. Him, his brother fairy tale just call the water of life. It has exactly the perfect ms dot structure. Now I think I showed you guys this last time. Is that correct? Is the director, is that okay? So that kind of summed up our discussion about the dragon of chaos. What I was trying to trying to communicate, which I think is a very, very difficult thing is that there are many different ways of conceptualizing the ground of being and you can do it from an objective perspective but. And that's a very useful tool, but I think that is a form of framing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       It's not so much a description of the nature of being per se and the being that we were speaking of. I think his property conceptualized at least at least for some purposes in relationship to this diagram which says, well, being as a field of information from which you derive the common objects and entities that you interact with, but also from which you derive your own structure, your own experience and your own mechanisms of framing and so you can think of reality as that which allows for the derivation of those two things and I also made the case to you that I think you could make a strong case that that's actually how your brain works. Your brain acts like that's the way the world is, and then a secondary case that if that's how your brain acts and your regard waiting, then you're faced with a problem.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       If you are attempting to make the claim that the objective world is the ultimate reality because that isn't how your brain is set up. At least in principle, it evolved so that you wouldn't die because of your foolish ideas, embodied or otherwise. Anyways, you can wrestle through that and your own lines. It's very difficult thing to conceptualize. Now, one of the things that's characteristic of this particular diaper, I missed that. You've seen this in the book. This is a bit of an elaboration of the idea of what happens to you when you encounter a. normally what happens is fundamentally that your body prepares to do all manners of things. Some of those are negative, right? Their experience as negative emotion is they're fundamentally intensive protection and protect them so they can evolve. They can involve pain and frustration and disappointment and shame and guilt and all of those sorts of things as well as fear.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       But then the other side of that as well, you know there's there's riches to be had when you encounter something novel and so the parts of your mind that are associated with creative exploration and the reconfiguring of ideas should also be put on alert and that is what seems to happen. So basically your response to a novel, these to compare to do everything and that's. That can be very exciting. It can be extremely compelling. So one of the things that I think is really worth thinking about, and this is something we'll cover a lot of the class comes to a halt because this is one of the only optimistic ideas I've never been able to derive from psychology that I actually think might be true. And it's a really optimistic idea. Like if you accept the idea that it's reasonable to construe the ground of reality in this manner.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       And then you take seriously the two things, the fact of your motivational. You're embodied motivational and emotional response as one thing and then the fact of the hierarchy of the normally so that some things are anomalous, you know, and it kind of trivial manner. And then some things are a novelist and an absolutely terrifying manner. But so if you accept that you can draw further inference, which is the well maybe sometimes things are anomalous in an optimal manner now. And then I would say, well, what we're defined that optimality. Well let's assume that there is a meaningful ground of reality. And then let's assume that there's a framing system that you have to use to deal with that. And that's partly biological, but it's also partly a consequence of inculturation, and then let's assume that that framing system can get outdated, so that's all associated with the stories that we've been talking about so far.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       So then let's assume that the fact that it can be outdated is also an exit existential problems, so it's a constant problem so that not only do you need to have a framing system, but you need to have a mechanism that you could engage in to update the framing system optimally and then we can take that one step further and say, that's built right into you. It's part of your nature is part of your biology, is part of the structure of your consciousness. And then we could say, well, here's the hypothesis. What if that's what's happening? When you get engaged with something, so imagine what your brain is trying to do. Roughly speaking, is to situate you in relationship to being so that you can both tolerate it. For you can. You can tolerate it, appreciate it, frame it and stay on profit and that your mind has to be able to signal to you when you're doing that, and I think that's what happens when you're captured by something and you get engagement.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       It is what's happening is your mind is telling you, your experiences telling you you're exactly situated in the right place. You're stable enough so you're not going to fall apart, but you're fluid enough so that you're not going to fall prey to excess stability and then the experience of that as a spirit and experience of engaged meaning, but there are phenomena that are associated with that too. Like it's easy to pay attention. It's just straightforward. It's easy to pay attention to things that you're engaged by and I think that that's because your your mind roughly speaking, your brain knows that, that that information flow is maximized there so you're not going to be terrified and you're not going to be bored. You're gonna be engaged. You don't fall apart and you stay updated, and so the way you experienced that is that the meeting is optimized under those conditions.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       You're, you're, you're, you're deep into the material, so to speak, and it's meaningful. It's directly meaningful. Yes. So will this be a framework to explain why say novel music or stories or like an grossing video game even would induce that? Sure. No one's another world, so you're safe, but also it's like an unfolding experience with both of those at the same time because it's, you don't want to play a video game where there are no rules and you don't want to play a video game where the rules transformed so rapidly and radically that there's no can model. You want to play a video game where you can suspend disbelief. You know, there's some play with the axiom, so maybe there's some things about the model of reality that aren't exactly like real reality, but once that framework is established, once the rule governed framework is established, there's play inside of it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       And that's very embarrassing. And I think part of the reason it's engrossing is one, you actually learn things from playing games because in some sense you're always playing a game, right? Because you're always inside a reality that's bounded by a certain set of assumptions and it's not the total reality. It's like a game like representation of the total reality and you know, hopefully it's a good enough gain. Light Representation. You know, one of the things I was thinking about in relationship to video games was no, I've read critiques of Video Games where people complain about young people generally being engaged in video games to the expense, having a real life. And then I was making, I don't know if you know about Edward, I think his name is Ed Edward Castronova now he's an economist who studied video games and he did this quite awhile ago. I think it's gotta be more than 10 years ago now, but he made the claim at that point that one of the big massive online player games, I think it was world of warcraft, but that might be wrong, was like the 20th largest economy in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       Really. Not In any fate way, partly because you could sell artifacts that you were producing on Ebay, for example, but also partly because people traded within it and like there was no reason to assume that the additional level of abstraction that that video game represented was necessarily any more abstract than what we were already doing and economies. So then you could ask yourself, for example, think about this. Is it more real to lead a band of adventurers through a complex mythological reality in an online game or to work at Mcdonald's? Now you'd say, well, what board Mcdonald's? Because that's real, but let's, let's think about that for a minute. So exactly why is it real mean, first of all, but is good and exist unless it was nested in a whole bunch of other things. Right? So it has to be nested in a functional capitalist economy and that has to be nested inside a functional political system. And then there's all sorts of other preconditions in terms of material supply and so forth that have to be in place before you, before you're able to work there and receive tokens for your labor.

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       Okay, so

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       the same thing applies to the video games and you might say, well how do you determine which of those is real? And I would say, well maybe one of the ways of determining whether a game is real is to what degree do you practice a wide range of the sub sets of skills that would be transferable to other beings while you're playing that game. And I think you could make a case that if you're playing a very complex video game that the activities that you're engaging in which involve leadership and cooperation and communication and problem solving are actually a more comprehensive subset of the skills that you would have to develop to work in the world as a complex place. Then what you would pick up at Mcdonald's. Now you know, obviously you can argue that, but it's not self evident.

Speaker 2:          00:14:32       So,

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       so back to framing. Well you know, one of the things, the video game, one of the, one of the types of meeting, one of the things that the video game designers really trying to do is put you in the zone of proximal. Now that's a term from the Godspeed who was a Russian development psychologist who was probably the most influential developmental psychologist apart from Psj. Now what the Gonski noticed was that when parents talk to their children, they talk to them constantly at a level that slightly exceeded what brand and you think that's so cool because on one hand they're communicating with their children because the children can understand what they're saying, but on the other hand there are teaching them to communicate, to understand more things at the same time. They're doing that in exactly the same time and he thought about is the zone of proximal development because it was sort of dragging the kids pass their current state of of comprehension and understanding it and framing into the next set.

Speaker 1:          00:15:39       And it's sort of analogous to the principle that I mentioned to you earlier about playing a game in a manner that not only helps you win that game but helps you when all the other games that you're going to play after you played that game. And that's playing the game at the zone of proximal development. Because it involves generalization and I would say that, you know, one of the real debates in psychology, and it's an appalling debate as far as I'm concerned, is what's, what is it that you can buck used to buttress yourself against the undeniable catastrophes of existence, you know, because it's obvious to everyone that existence is tragic and it's fundamental essence, right? Because people are limited and fraud and mortal. It's like that's a big problem. Now, hypothetically, that was addressed quite well by traditional religious structures, but then our ability to assume that they were reasonable ways of framing existence has been badly damaged or called into question by the rise of scientific and materialistic and object to thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       So the psychological, like the, the, the academic psychological response to that has been in many ways that, well, you're in framing only shields yourself shields you from the tragedy of being. And that's what it is. It's a defense mechanism and that's the terror management guys. It's right. Fundamentally, your basic problem is that you're terrified of dying. There's no other bloody thing that can be done about that. So you have to, you know, put up shields of various sorts so that you're not constantly assaulted by that problem as you go through your life. And it's a variant of Freudian theory. So that's one theory. And then there's a very, a theory which is positive illusions, you know, which is the idea that it's closely related is that you can just delude yourself in an optimal way above the structure of being so that you can pretend that things are going to work out better for you than they probably are.

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       And then you don't have to be worried about the fact that it's tragic because you just concentrate on your simplistical optimistic, you know, illusions. It's like no dozer am guessable theories because they basically say that if you wait, woke up and opened your eyes, what you see would be so terrible that you would die, you know, or that you would want to die, that it would drive you to suicide. You know, that's a, you gotta be careful before you tell people that that sort of thing is true because you're undermining their capacity to live a genuine existence. And you're also saying, well, you can't live a genuine existed because the weight of it would be so heavy that it would. It would destroy you, or it will drive you into a position where you want it to be destroyed. It's like, well, before we get so damn pessimistic about it, we might start thinking about whether there are other phenomena that aren't illusory or delusional or defense mechanisms that actually are characterized by meaning.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       And so one of the things I suggested to you at the beginning of class this class was that you watched what you said to find out if what you said was making you stronger or weaker and that you can actually feel that. That's kind of a Rogerian idea because rogers would say that if what you're saying wasn't insane with your body being roughly speaking is Rogers was really gonna body theorists. That you would feel that as a kind of discordance and then that weaken you. And so it's a much. It's a much older and deeper idea than that, but Roger's articulated very well. Well, there's another. There's another experiment that you can run that's also very much worth attending do, which is watch and see what's meaningful. Don't think about it. Just notice, notice when you're engaged in something enough so that the fact of you doing it is sufficient for the tax, you know, because you could say so thankful they come club this way.

Speaker 1:          00:19:41       Okay, well you're a bounded creature and so you're. You're beset on all sides by tragedy and limitation. You know now that might be necessary there. There may be a reason why that's the case, but we won't bother with that at the moment. We'll talk about that later. The question then is, are there conditions under which you would regard that as acceptable and answer isn't what people think about. That's the wrong answer. The right answer is all. Pay attention and notice if there are times like that, and I think that's the. That's horace, that noticing, that's the eye. It's not thinking because it's not the framing process. It's something outside of that. It's something that's watching and I think if you notice, you'll see if you go through your week, you'll notice if you have to sort of stand outside yourself and think, ha, I was really into that.

Speaker 1:          00:20:35       I was pulled right inside it and then you see phenomenon that occur along with that which chip and the hiatus detailed reasonably in his, in his work on flow. You don't notice the passing of. You're not self conscious and the activity is sustaining. You experienced it as sustain even though it might be difficult, you know, so it's not a matter of just take easy way out doing something fun. It's not that at all. It can be that it's often you feel that way when you're doing something that's exceptionally challenging and difficult and usually I think it's those things that are they're real in relationship to your goal hierarchy, you know, so they're, they're moving you forward in the way that you've determined that moving forward is appropriate in so far as you've sorted that out. So you know a implies B and B in place.

Speaker 1:          00:21:25       See it, see implies d and so forth and you've sorted that all out, you know, so maybe you're working on an essay in the class that you find meaningful because you want to derive something useful from your education so that you're a good citizen so that you can live a proper life, you know, and so the chaining of all those things makes the local activity quite richly meaningful because it's properly contextualized. But then there's the other element which is when you're pushing yourself beyond that, not only do you experience the meaning of what you're doing in relationship to your goal hierarchy, you also transcend the goal hierarchy at the same time so that while you're working towards realizing it, you're also working towards transforming it and improving it all at the same time. And I think that you're set up to experience that as as the highest form of being.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       And then there's a corollary to that, which is maybe if you spent the bulk of your time doing that, you know, so you've got practice data to you were doing it. Maybe you're doing, I don't know, you could figure it out for yourself, but my suspicions are that for many of you, that's probably five percent of your weekly life. Maybe I'm wrong about that because it's been a long time since I was your age. I can't remember what it was like reading, you know, but I do know when I survey undergraduates and I asked them how much time they waste, you know, they're telling me generally speaking, it's four to six hours a day and I actually think it's probably more than that. And so that's time not spent in this particular state of mind and it's wasted time while you even recognize it as wasted time because when someone asks you if it's wasted time, you say yes and it's like, well wasted.

Speaker 1:          00:23:08       It's wasted and you know it. You're obviously comparing that to some other sort of time that isn't wasted. Right? That you regard as valuable and meaningful and worth engaging and even though it might be difficult and require discipline and all those sorts of things. So you might ask yourself, you know, if you have times during the week where you were engaged in often what you're doing so that you find that intrinsically meaningful and it removes the burden of tragedy, and I don't mean because you're preoccupied, I mean because you're experiencing what you're doing as intrinsically worth the price. That's a different thing. You might think, okay, well what if you were in that of mind 80 percent, 85 percent of the time or 90 percent of the time, you know, and that requires a tremendous amount of discipline and organization and clarity of purpose and it also requires a tremendous amount with the truth because the enemy of setting yourself up so that you can do that is untruth. Because what happens is to the degree that you engage in on the truth, you, you contaminate your frames fundamentally and then you're in real trouble because you won't be oriented properly if you're afraid to contaminated. They're contaminated to the degree that you build them out of nonsense in and delusion. So yes,

Speaker 3:          00:24:38       absolutely agree with that. And probably a natural state, natural approaches. The reciprocal.

Speaker 1:          00:24:47       No, I think it's natural to be a chimpanzee is sitting in the jungle spending eight hours a day eating leaves because you know, you're not smart enough to do any better than that, you know, you know what I mean? So, so naturals. The tough, a tough conception.

Speaker 3:          00:25:03       Like I said, I like restaurant. I mean you could argue that,

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       oh absolutely. You know, sometimes you have fall asleep and sometimes the right thing to do is to have leisure time. But I can tell you, you know, I know this from my own experience that an hour of actual leisure time beats a month of undeserved holiday. And so I would say, well, what constitutes, you know, actual leisure time. It's like you don't have anything that you shouldn't be doing at that moment. That's more important than having a break. And if there's nothing about that, that self deceptive, you know, like you're on trying to escape from your responsibilities by watching a youtube video about joggers falling on the ice or something like that, which apparently is quite a popular one at the moment. So you know when you know perfectly well that when you spend time like that, especially if you're avoiding doing something that you've known that you should be doing using your own standards of judgment, that all it does is make you sick.

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       You know, like there's a, there's a physical revulsion that goes along with that. And I think what, what that is, is your body telling you that you're contaminating your being by engaging in such low quality activity, especially when there's something else that you know you should be doing. And that's not restful. I think that's extremely stressful because what happens is you basically tear yourself in to and why does it tyrant say you're useless? And the other is like a critical notes off. Say I can't help it, you know, when it's a terrible state of being to be in because you're a slave at the same time and it's very, very stressful. It's not restful. So you're talking to you. It's like you're describing students how to take a break and watch the show for the whole time. Like going, Gosh, as you're constantly like, you know, and I think it takes real practice over years, you know, in part of what you'll be reading about in the book is the necessity of adopting an apprenticeship, you know, because you have to focus yourself in on something and really you have to focus in heart and you have to do it for quite a long time before you have or yourself into a good enough shape so that you can even start telling the difference between reasonable use of leisure time and pathological time wasting, which are by no means the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       And it's hard to get it right. It's very hard to get it right. I think you have to attend a lot internal cubes, you know, so if you're sitting in front of the screen and you're feeling somewhat uneasy, if disgusted by yourself, then you have to think, okay, just exactly what's going on here. Am I being too hard on myself? I actually need a break and I won't allow that because I'm a tyrant and so I'm sneaking one even though I'm tired and should ever break. That's hard to get because then that would be an attitude issue, right? Are you have you conceptualize the necessity for leisure property and then the other possibility is while you're just being useless and you know it, you know, and, and, and then that shouldn't be happening. Something else should be happy, but it's by no means a straight forward thing to get those things right.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       It's hard. Now I have a hint about that, you know, because I've worked with lots of people who they're not wasting time, like they're not wasting five minutes and sometimes because of the demand, like usually because the demands on them, they put themselves in a position where the demands on them are so high that if they waste anytime they will fail. And so a typical person like that, a lot of you are going to end up in those situations if you're lucky. You know? So a technical person like that as a challenging job. So it's a complex job. They have to manipulate a lot of variables constantly. They have to be attentive and alert, focused and conscientious. And they have to do that for long periods of time, like well up, depends on the level of attainment you're after, but if you want to attain at the peak of your chosen discipline, it's 60 to 80 hours a week and it's, those are concentrated, useful hours.

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       Now some are more useful than others because you're going to get tired, but that's what you're aiming at. And then you know, well, do you want to have kids? That's a big issue too. And if you want to do both of those, it's like you don't get, you don't have kind of wakes, you don't have any time to waste, you know? And so then you have to get hyper efficient and then you have to ask yourself, yeah, but how much work should I do know what's the limit should like, you know, where is the right limit? Well the answer to that is quite straightforward.

Speaker 1:          00:29:57       You can't work any harder than you can sustain across weeks, months and years. You know. So some of the people that I've counseled who are hyper efficient, one of the holes like fall into is they worked so hard. They start getting inefficient and part of that is they're not paying attention to their family to guilty about their children. Maybe their relationship is becoming unstable and that's going to cost them time. Then like once you're married, if you let that go and you get into a divorce battle and it's a custody battle, you are screwed. So like you have to really watch that and make sure it doesn't happen because it's like a major illness to have that happen. It's not good and you know, you never really recovered from it in some sense because you end up with a fractured, you know, you're close, intimate relationships are fractured and very difficult thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:30:51       So up you're much more likely to get divorced in your second marriage than you were in your first. So it would be like you could hop out of one into a solution, you know, and then also people tired themselves out, you know, so often with the more hyper efficient people and often a lot of these people were women and I think the reason for that is, you know, once they have kids in particular, they're really torn between two sets of fundamental obligations, especially for the first three years of the kid's life, you know. And so it's really hard for them to get the balance rate at to figure out what that balance is. But one rule is you got to treat yourself well enough so you can iterate your activities. If you can be playing a degenerating game and it's a variant of the pig and the idea of the calibrating state, right?

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       And it could have a great state will maintain itself and that can be within you or can be within a group of people or it can be either in you or within a group of people across a long span of time. And that's really well equilibrate. So a lot of the people that I dealt with who were working themselves too hard, we figured out ways they can take vacations. They couldn't usually decreased the number of hours per week or per week wasn't possible. Just the demands of the job, like in the law firm or something like that. You know, you might think what Cathy, just lighten up. The answer to that is you don't get paid $750 an hour for lightening up. It's like you're on call right now whenever your client wants you and the answer isn't, well, you know, I need to take a break.

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       Like then. Then you don't get the pay because that's what they're paying is for. But one of the things I noticed quite quickly was the people scheduled their time so they took more vacations. The number of hours they can work productively actually went up, not down. So you can get the balance right, but it's not. It's not a simple thing to do, but so isn't that. You're only going to find engagement in sheer physical productive activity. There's lots of places where you can be engaged, you can be engaged in art, you can be engaged in literature, you've been engaged in relationships. You can be engaged in your children like there's no shortage of places of meaning, but you have to interact with those places of meeting property and you have to organize the multiple places where you derive meaning in a manner that's sustaining to all of them and that's what you've got your grain right, but getting your frame rate isn't enough because you have to get your frame right in a way that allows you to update your frame as you continue moving forward with it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       And I do believe because I do believe that the world that were adapted to as biological organisms is the world where reality is information. I believe that when when your nervous system signals to you that all is well, all is well. It's true. You're in the right place at the right time. You're bearing exactly the right amount of load and the right amount of load is enough to keep you talked and ready and improve, and when you slip into that slot, I think all of the existential problems that that, that, that arise to push people towards nihilism and hopelessness or or sometimes towards totalitarianism, totalitarianism, that rigidity, that problem just goes away and it's because you solve it. It's not because it's not a problem, it's a bloody problem, but that doesn't mean that you know, because one of the things that monitor people do is they conceptualize themselves as the defeated aim priority. You know that the fact that life is tragic and that you're not all you could be in, that everything will come to an end means that you're not. By definition, you're not up to the task. It's like that's by no means obvious man. People are tough, like they're so tough. It's unbelievable. Why don't you know you see that on Youtube with you? Because I don't want to look at Youtube now. Now you can feel terrible above it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       One of the things I do like looking at it or the extreme sports that people engage in, you know, and I mean people can do unbelievable things. They're completely, they're completely off their rocker, know they can do things with their bodies that you just can't possibly imagine. I was looking for example at there was a video that went around the wild ago about it was a video tape of the woman who won the 1956 I'm hurdling know we bounce off of one of those horses for gymnastics and so she did. Her routine was videotaped and then the next video tape was over. The person who won the gold in the Olympics at the last Olympics and it was like the first woman did this really cool role, often fall off the horse. It was quite spectacular. It's like the second one was like 20 feet in the air with for flipped end over end, you know, vertically. If they wasn't my favorite night and they weren't even the same creatures, why don't look like some kind of kind of like android kangaroo and the other book, like a pretty competent gym teacher.

Speaker 1:          00:36:04       So you know, I mean God only knows what the limits of human ability are, but we certainly haven't touched them. And you guys, most of you have no idea what you're capable of if you like, if you really got your acts together when you were a force, because another thing you might think about is maybe the existential misery that you experienced in your life is directly proportional to the amount of time you waste. Because if, if the dragon gardens a treasure, you know, and your job is to get the damn treasure and you need it, you need it. It's not, it's not optional without the treasury. You don't have the riches necessary to live all the time. You're wasting his time that you're not spent in the treasure room fundamentally. And so, you know, if you're not spending all your time in the treasurer room, you can't complain about being poor.

Speaker 1:          00:36:53       So it's a good thing to think about, you know, because it's, and this is what makes it optimistic. It's possible that if you utilize what was in front of you, and so that will be the ground of being. Let's say if you utilize that, that would be enough, or maybe you could get even really lucky and if you utilize it properly, it wouldn't just be enough. That would be more than enough, you know, so you could go from say, well, it's okay to be a limited and mortal being too saying, hey, this is a pretty damn good deal and if I could, I'd sign on for it again. That was actually niches, idea of the eternal return, you know, so when he was trying to figure out what people should do as a consequence of the collapse of the ethical system, it constituted classical religious belief.

Speaker 1:          00:37:38       He conjured up the idea of eternal return. It was roughly this, you should live in such a way so that if you had to repeat what you were doing forever into infinity, you would say yes to that. And that's an, that's an idea like the state, except obviously it's stretched into huge expanses of time. You know, that's a high level thing to a map. But you know, so here's, here's another example. Like I've seen people who, who get stuck in, in very bureaucratic organizations, you know, and they just get bloody well tortured by death because it's mindless tyranny, stupid rules and and on arbitrary decisions and counterproductive management advice and jealousy and punishment for doing well and you know, everything you can do to possibly set up a situation where the person who's got the jaw is just crushed by it, that people won't say anything.

Speaker 1:          00:38:34       It's, well, what would happen if you said something like, why do you want me to do this? It looks stupid. And they might be thinking, Oh God, I couldn't have thought it was stupid to, you know, but someone else told me to do it. Highly probable that they would be thinking that. It's like, what happens if you just refused to do stupid, useless meetings, meaningless things. It's like, that's a rule. I don't feel stupid. Useless for me. You know, one of the things that happens in corporations, and I've seen this happen many times, is that the corporation gets. It's like, it's like an elephant that gets loaded with intestinal parasites. And, and I mean that. I mean that as a biological analogy, I really do, because a corporation is a body in some sense. It has a tremendous amount of building value and what can happen as the corporation develops as it gets full of people who just pull up the value, they don't actually do anything.

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       They raped the brand is what they do because the brand has value. You know, like the Disney brand has value because it's associated with quality, you know, and if you want it to destroy that, you take over the company and you've put out snow white too and snow white three, it's like five and snow white 12 until and everybody would buy it until like snow white 20 when they would trust you anymore. And then you've sucked all the value out of the company and its death, you know, or you get people who come into the corporation and all they want to do is maneuver up to the talk. They don't give a damn about what the thing is supposed to be producing or about how they're structuring their relationships with other people or about anything that has to do with the truth. They use language instrumental to reach their goals and you get people like that, your company and it's like it's dead.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       It's gone. And that happens to companies all the time because they don't last. Right? This is why Marx was wrong. You know, he said power and money accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer people. What he didn't say is it's always different. People, you know, it's like there's a one percent, but it's not the same people. You know, most family fortunes don't last three generations and neither do most large companies. So there's a lot of dynamic turnover, but you know, you guys are going to be working in companies. The Lord have you at at least at some point it pretty damn significant levels and even at an entry level, you have more power than you think. You know, it is not necessary to do things you know are stupid and meaningless. And if you're, if, if, if the situation that you're in is demanding that, then you might ask yourself, hmm, maybe I should be somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          00:41:09       And then you might say, well, I can't be. What I would say to that is prepared to yourself to be like, if you're going to go into a company and you want to live ethically, you need an escape strategy and you need to have that along with you all the time, so you need an updated resume and it need to be keeping your damn on, on the job market so that you can see where the other opportunities along live for you and so you're not afraid to pursue them. You know, so you got to hold your interview skills. You've got to keep your damn resume on a shot. You've got to make sure you have a broad social network and you have to do it consciously. And so even if some Dane back tells you to do stump to something counterproductive, meaningless, and we'll push it one step farther than clearly unethical, you can say no and you can meet it because no means I'm not doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       And if you push me, we'll either have a war or I'll go somewhere else. It's like, that's what no means. That that's what it means. It means I'm not doing this and you can't say no till you haven't an alternative, right? You have to set yourself up so that no doesn't kill you because obviously then you won't say it needed. These are important things to consider because the actions that you take up, the level of your individual career are going to have far more impact on the ethics and the productivity of the place that you worked and then you can imagine especially if you're someone who's straight and sees what's right in front of their face because those are the people that keep the data companies running and there's not necessarily that many of them know the prices. Law Rule is that square root of the number of people who are doing your job do half the work.

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       So you could say that in a company of a thousand people, 30 people are doing half the work. You know when you could be one of them and then if you are one, except you can bloody well say no because they actually need you and so your last would be can be a catastrophe and that's what you want to aim for. It's like you want to be the person who's lost would be a catastrophe because then you've got some power and then you can bargain and then you don't have to do a stupid, useless crooked things and you'll have a much better life if you don't have to do those things. So very, very practical advice.

Speaker 3:          00:43:25       So when you were talking about how like divorce and like if you have a family and you have like a divorced people sometimes never thought into that and I remember you saying that it is locked before too. So what do you think about that? It's so horrible and what am I people to come?

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       Okay, well let's think about this for a minute then what? We'll go back to the symbolic stuff. How many chances do you think you'll have in your life for it? For like a serious high quality intimate relationship? What do you guys think? How many chances are you going to have for that? Okay, that's good. That's good. I would say probably top out in a boat. Okay, so that's not that many chances. You get old quick. You know by the time you're 45 you're not going to have a family and the well you can do that sometimes if you're male or female maybe, but it gets pretty rough and you're looking probably at that point you had a fair bit of in vitro and that sort of interactions top. It's hard on people so you know, not only you not have that many chances, you don't have that much time, so you're going to get it right. So if you get it wrong and costs you like maybe it'll cost you five years, five years is a long time, so and three, five year cost, you lost things there that you can't replace. Okay. So that's one part of it is you don't have that many chances and it's costly to to burn up the time. Okay. The second thing is,

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       divorce is very complicated, like it's not so bad if you get divorced to someone who's reasonable, but often the reason that you're getting divorced is that one or the other or both of you aren't that reasonable and what that might mean. You might be negotiating with someone whose basic goal is to make sure that you don't have another day of success in the next 20 years and if that's their goal, they will attain it. So, and there's lots of ways people do that and they usually do it by owning the children hostage. People will definitely do that. They do it all the time, you know, so you want to avoid that and then you know, then of course it's hard on the relationship you have with your children and like that's. Those are probably the most important relationships you have in your life. You know, it's like might be parents, might be siblings, might be your partner, might be your kids. But I think when it comes right down to it, your parents are old and so were you. When your kids aren't and they're just as close. Plus they need you and so will you start twisting and messing. Not About, boy, it's hard on your psyche. It's hard on the kids too, so you know.

Speaker 3:          00:46:35       So then I'm just thinking about that and how that's a cost. If you, if you mess it up like a five year cost, they cost you, right?

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       Oh, and it might be a 15 year cost if you were in a custody battle and cost you a quarter of a million dollars,

Speaker 3:          00:46:48       right? Yeah. But like is it then would you say like being a psychologist, that it's better for people to like pursue a relationship that's not good enough to continue to do that and possibly incur further costs than it is to just cut it off because it would divorce.

Speaker 1:          00:47:06       Okay. It's a complicated question. What I would say is don't make the kind of mistakes that get you into such a stupid relationship to begin with. Okay. Because that's the answer to that question. And the way you do that is by trying not to delude yourself any more than is absolutely necessary. And that means when you're in the damn relationship, tell the person the truth and trying to figure out what the truth for you and don't put up with any nonsense and stand up for yourself and also aimed towards the good, you know, if you do all those things, then your relationship is probably going to work if you're trying to do all those things really, and you have a partner that will not do that, then leave.

Speaker 2:          00:47:48       But

Speaker 1:          00:47:51       it's a rare person who will do that if they're stepped along the way property and they learn how to do it. Now, not everyone's like that because you do run into some people who are basically devoted towards mayhem and trouble, you know. But usually you know, a person is a balance of striving for the good and you know, messing about in the health. And you know, you're both like that. When you start a relationship and you try to tilt it towards the good and then you will run into that problem. So. But you have to do that right from the beginning of the relationship. You know, it doesn't take that much to corrupt a relationship so that it's not really salvageable. It the mistakes. Three or four acts of infidelity, your doctor, you don't get to come back from that because the fundamental element of trust is being removed and then you can communicate with the person because you don't know if they're telling you the truth and then you don't know if you're dealing with reality and if you're not dealing with reality with your partner, it's like good luck fixing that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:47       It's like you're working on a ghost car. Well the real one is sitting in the shop with the motor on it. You know it's not going to get you anywhere. So a lot of the issue is don't get into trouble to begin with. If you are in the trouble, well then you try to straighten yourself out and see if you can fix it. Well, if you can't, your options aren't great and it depends on the particularities of the situation. Not Know I have people that I counseled. It's like leave that person and the role is they're lying to you. They aren't aiming up and you won't be able to tolerate being with them for 10 years without becoming resentful, alcoholic and homicide, so that's a bad outcome. There's nothing you can do to avoid it, so you might as well leave and. But you know, you'd have to have. That sort of note has to be the truth because it's no fun. It's no good to leave someone who's struggling in an alert. You know, when you think, well, I'm with this person. They're not going anywhere. You know, maybe they have an alcohol problem and they're resentful. It's like, but I'm all they've got,

Speaker 2:          00:49:53       well,

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       they bloody well better want to have to fix that because you're not going to deal with fixed. All that'll happen is you'll end up in the same place. Now if they really want to fix more than anything and they're willing to tell the truth about it and willing to interact with you, then there's a ghost of a chance. You might pull through it,

Speaker 2:          00:50:15       but

Speaker 1:          00:50:17       it's very hard to fix someone and it's really hard to fix someone who does not want to be fixed and there's lots of people like that. So my

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       parents divorced, so, um, I know that a lot of failing, you're marketing the kid if you. And I've had to deal with a lot of the tension, which is like choosing your parents. But um, when everyone asks like, do you like something? Lawyers? I'm like, I, I see how much they fight now. And I can't imagine having that happen like school,

Speaker 1:          00:50:56       an answer to the question. It depends on the particular situation. And so a lot, there's lots of situations where a general answer doesn't suffice, but I would say it is. This is a tough one. I can tell you what's happened since the divorce law. Scott are liberalized. The first thing that happens is that all of you are going to be divorced and about the same rate as people would have been two years ago because rich people still get married and they generally don't get divorced. Poor people do not get married and that's like 60 percent of the population and it's ramping up quick and there's no evidence whatsoever that that's anything but catastrophic. So kids who are raised by single parents do not do as well. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't some single parents who are doing a stellar job, obviously neurons and there's some married parents to do a terrible job.

Speaker 1:          00:51:52       That's not the issue. The issue is the bulk of the evidence and the bulk of the evidence strongly suggests that children who are raised with two parents do better. Well, why? Well, why? It's impossible to raise children. Jesus, they're expensive, they're troubleshooting, they're smart, and they're useless. You know, so, and you've got them for 20 years. It's like you're going to do that by yourself. Sure. You are near to be working at a horrible job. Forty hours a week or more like a retail job for example, where they just treat you like a slave and then you're going to go home to your miserable kids because I lost it. It's like, that's not fun and you know, it's increasingly the norm for huge chunks of our population, like elitist liberal types, like all of you, for example, don't pay much attention to what happens to people who were actually core, but as far as I can tell, it's been a bloody catastrophe for them.

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       You know, there's an old saying when the upper class gets a cold, the lower class gets pneumonia and you know, the thing about that same. It's true. It's like, it's not a metaphor. It's literally the case. If an epidemic sweeps through a Barbie relation, the population dies from the poor people. Awkward because they're so damn stress. So, you know, I would say with regards to marriage and I'd been married long time sister both 26 years now and I've noticed a bunch of things about marriage. One is two brains are better than one. So if you communicate with your partner because they're not like you, it's like you have a corpus callosum between you, you know, and they'll tell you things you don't understand. You know, like when you're being stupid, you know, in a typically feminine way. Sarah typically masculine way or whatever, stupid way you managed to be stupid to you and that can be really helpful even though it's extremely annoying, you know, and they can help you make decisions and they're a good place to.

Speaker 1:          00:53:52       They're good place to confess to, you know, and it's really helpful when you're trying to figure out how to discipline children so that you're not a pathetic milk saw who lets them run all over you or some tire or who you know, likes to beat them with a stick when they sneeze, you know, hopefully you kind of find some pleasant middle ground in there and it's a lot easier to do that with two people in with one and then they can spell you off when you're exhausted. Particularly useful if you have small children because you will be exhausted when you have small children, you know, plus the narrative of your life as continuity. And that's nice. You know, and if your home is set up properly, it's actually a pleasure to go to it. You know, it is that it is a buttress against the chaotic and uncaring external world because the external world in many ways, it doesn't give a damn both you, you know, so if you go home and it's set up reasonably well, it's like, Hey, you've got somewhere to belong. That's not so bad.

Speaker 4:          00:54:50       Just uh, another, um, related situation that as growth, personal relevance for other people to do that, um, in, in many situations like when something bad happens, you know, okay, yeah, I've got to do some kind of imperative thing. Right. And uh, so say it's like a health scare and go, can I go work on my diet? And then it's a divorce. It's like, all right, we want to go and work through why I didn't think I was headed for divorce for the last 20 years, but now it just happened. And, but, but in some situations people building out repair but they don't want to get them to actually be repairing. So they go to people who are specialists in other areas of, of life, personal, psychological dealers and stuff like that. Anything but divorce, like attention deficit work on your scopes or like work on these, uh, or like assertiveness training or something like that. But like they're, they're like, they're diligently avoiding the heart of the methods.

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       And what was your major

Speaker 4:          00:55:45       and if you were in a family with somebody like that, is there something like that?

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       Well, you know, some situations are like Humpty dumpty, right? There's no putting it back together now. But again, in terms of avoidance of those situations, like you think about that hierarchy. Yeah. Well divorce is a low resolution, high impact solution because it just tears a chunk of that hierarchy out, throws in the way that's a lot and it's cost, it's going to hurt you. Okay. So then you think, well, what, what might you do instead of that? The real answer is solve the damn problems as they arise. You know? And that's hard and it requires drilling down. It really requires drilling down. So one of the things I want to build, for example, which I haven't yet, it's Kinda like going to be like this future authoring thing that you guys do. I want to build a problem solving matrix for, for compost because like, because at the end, here's how not to get divorced from your wife, figure out how to set the table properly.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       Now what does that mean? It's really, really complicated and it's like, who's going to cook? When are they going to cook? Why are they cooking? How should you respond to it? Who buys groceries? What are the groceries going to be? Who's going to put them away? How do you say thanks when someone does something for you in the domestic environment and what's happened, and this is part of the depth of God, roughly speaking, is that the roles are gone. Okay? And what that means is you better be awake because it turns out that running a kitchen in a house is unbelievably complicated and difficult, and so you have to negotiate how to do it and you're a terrible negotiator. You don't know how to decompose the damn problem to the point where you could solve it. You won't admit what you want. You won't admit what your life, you won't pay any attention to what actually irritates you.

Speaker 1:          00:57:39       You know, so you'd like to think that you're nice and easy to get along with, but you're not, you're basically Hitler, you know, and so until you realize that you can't even tell your partner what you want. And so this is where philosophy hits the road or hits the ground, you know, it's like trying to negotiate, you know, to stable solution to how you're going to run the kitchen because that's where the battle between the sexist, by the way, there's two places where it really hits one who's going to take care of the little kids to, to who is going to work in the kitchen and under what circumstances. It's like you figure those things out. You can consider yourself a philosopher, a very difficult. And the cost for not doing it is low quality food in a hostile environment, bratty children that you hate, resentment, hostility, the accumulation of insults at assaults and either a divorce or really unhappy marriage. So,

Speaker 4:          00:58:46       but what did. But just to take it back, what do you do when somebody has a, like to use a metaphor like has it helped care? And then there was like say the cancer and then instead of quitting smoking, they just started taking a multivitamin in the morning. It's like, what do you do if you're watching somebody treat their smoking with an antibiotic was a multivitamin rather than

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       then you go to war three. I'm not kidding you tighten them into doing what you have. But a war isn't just like you fly into a rage and you know, throw dishes, explaining, that's not helpful. No worries. Okay, you are not going to smoke anymore. And so then you think, okay, well what do you have to do to do that? So maybe it's your father, um, I'm going to call you everyday and harass you. And if that doesn't work then I'm going to come over and harassed and I'm going to burn up all your cigarettes. And then I'm going to get your friends to come over and tell you that you're a bloody idiot and I'm going to put pressure on you. And your mom's going to help too. And if you don't quit smoking, she's going to leave. It's like it's life or death.

Speaker 1:          00:59:51       What's it going to be? Now, you know, you may say you don't want to go to war, you might also say that it's not even your right to go to war, but if you're faced with a situation where it's someone you love is engaging in a behavior that seriously counterproductive, it's like your ratchet up the pressure until they stop or you can't stand it anymore and if you can't stand it anymore, you lose, you know, lots of things are a war and so you and you have to be prepared for a book like, because that's also a very, to begin with to say no, you know, videos got offended in a way to take it back to you. You're getting is that like you got to find it in a way that you can continue to have these battles so that it doesn't just become a failed enterprise and the first conversation, right. If you can blow apart the whole relationship, you know, and the personal do that to you too. They'll, they'll often say, well, you can quit, but if you don't start biting me, I'm never going to talk to you again. I'm like, you can't be afraid of that sort of thing. It's like if you can also tell them the difficult, that's an inappropriate move.

Speaker 1:          01:00:53       It's a nuclear bomb. It's like, don't bring up the nuclear bombs yet. Johnson and the will say, look, I don't need to get health tips from you. I'm the parent. I'm telling you what's healthy to eat or whatever. You shouldn't be able to respond to that. That's just a. that's just an entry level volume that you're the parents. Oh, well, hey, that's a brilliant observation. Would say, well, these things, issues or whatever, sending my personal romantic sexual life that like, I'm not comfortable sharing things with you, so yeah. Well you can tell them that you're not comfortable living with the consequences of their stupid decisions and you're stuck with it too because you know the personal say, well, this is me. Well, yeah, right, except you're connected to. He's connected to your mother, let's say, and they're both connected to you and they're all connected to their friends.

Speaker 1:          01:01:42       It's like, sorry, this isn't just about you. You know, if you're on an island, while even then it wouldn't just be about you, but it would be more of a use. So that's just weak argumentation and what people will do when you're having a war with them is they'll have like 10 or 11 prepared responses. They're always cliches, you know, and so you just back that way, they're just cliche. It's like, okay, well first of all we're going to get through the cliches, but then what happens? Then they get math and then they'll stomp away. Then they'll cry. It's like if you can get through all that, well then maybe you can have a discussion, you know, and then. But you got to think it through. You actually care if you're parked, if you're a person is smoking themselves today. Of course I love it.

Speaker 1:          01:02:26       It's like, yeah, sure you make. It's like, why is it important to you? Why does it work? Why does it matter? Why is it worth going to war about it? And you need to know that you need to know it and you have to be able to tell. But first, you know, and if you could tell them that if you could really figure it out and you can really tell them that there's, sometimes they'll listen because they don't, they don't want to know that they're tearing you apart, you know, and they're going to do everything not to see that it's my problem. Yeah, well I wish it wasn't a problem because then I wouldn't have to worry about it, but unfortunately, you know, or fortunately we're tied together at the bottom of the barrel so you know, we better figure out how to deal with this.

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       So it's very hard thing to do and it's way better to address those things before they become catastrophic because by the time they've gotten to the point where it's a 15 year problems, it's like Jesus, you're dealing with a very large tire. Matt, at that point, you know. So one of the things I really liked about the Mesopotamian creation myth is that it tells you what happens if you muck around, you know, it says, because remember that Mesopotamian gods, they kill app suit, right? That's the structure they all rest on. So it's just this sort of a hollow steel shell now and the end now things alive and being fixed. No one's paying attention. What comes, what happens on the longer that goes on, the bigger the monster that makes its appearance, you know, and you could easily be in a situation where the boxster that people are hiding from his.

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       So Cam being you may not have the skills to kill it. So, you know, even remember horace, when he goes off that off after I'm sad, he loses an eye. It's like it's no joke, you know, and he's a god and he wins and he still loses. Not So, you know, with someone who's smoking, you know, one of the things you may have to confront is their absolute cynicism about life. Seriously thought through. And there's plenty of reasons to be cynical about life and resentful and full of hate and all of those things. You know, so, so you, the bigger the war that clear the head, you know, because you're going to hit, you're going to find the monsters underneath the problem. And they're usually archetypal. You know, I've been in lots of situations with my clients where the only language that could be used to describe what was going on was religious because the problems were so deep, like there's so good against evil that there isn't any other language that's even close to powerful enough, and that's usually what happens in households where there's a truly homicidal battle going on. Like a deep full problem for example. And if were you in my personality class, you watch crumb.

Speaker 1:          01:05:13       Oh yeah, that's intense. If you want to see psychological about the kind you wouldn't see normally unless you were a clinician and like a clinician who was really into the situation crumbled Kelly. It's available online. You probably have to rent, but it's the pathology and that families are critical and it's rough. Oh yeah. Brilliant documentary. The guy that made the documentary to the family. Yes. Beforehand. So they laid a band, you know, and they were also nurse assistance. Yeah. That's kind of like what a monstrous animal looks like right away. Like that. He had like this, he had this very large, like clean mother. I don't know, it's was quite the creature. She was sort of like this monstrous creature and so all of his restaurants, we sort of like it and so all of his drawings were like if these monstrous like monster swimming with him as a parasitical appendage.

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       Right. That's the Freudian storyboard. If you don't think that's real, you haven't looked at any pathological families because it's re. Freud's claim was. That's the first battle that people fighting. If you lose, there's a think about it. Here's some battles you got to get away from your mother to get to kindergarten. Great. That's about it. Number one, and then you've got to make friends that's bad enough to and then you've got to get away from your family. It's like in the eatable situation, you don't win the first battle, your screw and it's worse even because the reason you don't is because there's something about one or both parents that is bloody well doing everything it possibly can to make sure that you don't and you think, well, that's pretty dark. Who would ever believe that? But it's like you failed in your life in a serious way. You know, and you're resentful and irritable, miserable about it. What makes you think you're going to facilitate your child's success? What makes you think you're going to be able to stand to see someone thrive where you failed? It's like, yeah, right. If you were that kind of safe, you wouldn't have failed to begin with no one in that particular away. So you know, families can be just.

Speaker 1:          01:07:44       Freud was a smart man and you know, if you watched chrome, you can see exactly what he was talking about. Some very, very difficult to get access to that kind of experience. Unless you happen to be in that situation or you know, you're helping someone cope with it and you're really tied in. So. And that's a perfect segue to the great mother. Now. So the hypothesis here is that, that, you know, what's complex hypothesis, but the hypothesis fundamentally is that your basic ways that you break down being as such, which I would say is, is, is represented symbolically by these ceramic tile forums that have the capacity to be spiritual or to be, to reveal the treasure because you're a social primate and you sort of a nuclear family, social, primate, your primary cognitive categories are male, female, I think it's male, female, and child, and the child tends to take on the aspect of the sun like the male child for reasons that we'll go into.

Speaker 1:          01:08:45       But, um, and I think it's, I think it's because of the overwhelming reality of the feminine throughout history has been the feminine in relationship to procreation is the defining characteristic of the feminine. And so you can define the feminine with femininity, but if you're going to define the child whose relationship isn't primarily appropriative known as a child, you don't use feminine symbolism to do that. So it makes it complicated. It doesn't map. So here's an example of that. So there's a um, you see that sound a herb roast chicken. This is interesting. I have one of these up in my office. Wouldn't any of you guys come up and see what I found? One in Mexico or actually someone found it and I bought it from them. Maybe not next to, but whatever. It's exactly one of these things. It's so cool, except it's got legs at the bottom and it stands out.

Speaker 1:          01:09:37       It's this, except it's chicken with a snake wrapped around its neck. You know, Scott, please wait. He's off to the side and on each wing is a spider web, which I really love. It's absolutely perfect. And so it's an archetypal image in the image of something like you see in the US too with the snake that the US often used for. The Americans often use that flag. It's like an eagle with a snake and it's talents. That's another variant of the same sort of assembled and it's, it's this combination of matter and spirit, burden, burden, reptile, and it does represent the ground of being all things considered. And then out of that springs, these primary phenomenon, that's father, mother child, roughly speaking, and those correspond to nature, roughly speaking, culture, roughly speaking, and the thing that mediates between the two of them. And that's the hero.

Speaker 1:          01:10:29       Now it's not just the hero because it's also the adversary, because the adversary is the thing that refuses to mediate between those two. And that's just as much part of the individual as the part that will do it. Those are logged in internal combat, so to speak now. But that's the first differentiation. And I think the reason for that is that that is how we differentiate the world as we sprayed into consciousness and existence. It's like, first of all, it's a cake. It's chaos. It's like formless Keto Os. That's where you've come from, whatever that means. And then post you've got a mother, that's for sure. That's a primary reality. And you have a father and you know, even if you don't have a father there because you're a human being, you have a father because the father is the patriarchal structure or the framing. You know, it's the, it's the inculturation.

Speaker 1:          01:11:18       It's the embodiment of enculturation and that's going to be in you as you get inculturated, but it's distributed everywhere in every one. Those are the rules by which people live. Not even just the rules, click the behavioral rituals, but govern our interactions and if you don't incorporate, if you don't become enculturated by the time you, for your you're, you're either new astrophe or you're antisocial and criminal. That's the basic rule. And we know the literature on anti social behavior. It's like basically what happens is there's about 10 percent, five to 10 percent of boys who are very aggressive and assertive and selfish, roughly speaking, self oriented when they're two and you can find them, you just put them together with other two year olds and there's this subset of them. They're almost always boys, but not always who bite, kick, kick, hit and steel. And they just do that.

Speaker 1:          01:12:10       And the reason is they're like top little monsters and you know, they're out there asserting themselves. It's just the tail end of a continuum and it's mostly agreeableness. They're disagreeable kids, their toughest boots, you know, and they'll basically stand up to you and they're not that easy to scare, especially if they're low in neuroticism. And so with them it's like, why the hell should I listen to you? And my son was like that and he was like that when he was nine months old, I, he'd stare me down like so impressive. It's really soft and it's like what makes it so, so, so, so anyways, it's either with the, with the kids that are like that. If you don't socialize them by the time, therefore they, they then they can't make friends because they don't know how to play and share and all those things.

Speaker 1:          01:12:56       And then they ended up outcasts and you know, puberty hits, the testosterone rises and Poof, they're in jail, you know, and whatever you go on to be inculturated. And that's the incorporation of great father and some of that's, that's the Super Ego from the audience perspective to some of that is positive because you bloody well better know how to share play games. And some of it's negative because one of the things that's so weird about having little kids is that you know, what you give them hell mostly for is having fun. It's horrible, you know, because you think you're always punishing kids if we do for breaking rules. And so on snow, that's what you do. It's like they're running around screaming at the top with their guns. They're completely having a blast, you know, and they're destroying the house in the process, but they're really having fun and you know, you're, you guys settled out right now.

Speaker 1:          01:13:47       It's like you're doing that all the time. So not only do you bring the negative emotion, you know, the tiers and the pavement, the frustration and the anger and the hostility under control. So they stopped having temper tantrums and they don't hit you when they're mad or themselves. But get that all under control. Jesus regulate the positive promotion. It just dampened it right down until they can go sit with their 80 year old grandmother quietly, you know. So it's a real restricting process. And that's why half of the Greek father is a tyrant. There's no way out of that, you know, like you hope that the whole damn thing isn't a tyrant because obviously by socializing your children, you're doing them a great favor right here. First of all, they learned how to talk. That's very useful. They learn how to read, they learn how to play with other kids, so at the same time that you're constraining the hallow them and making them less than they were in some ways, you're also opening up vistas to them that they would otherwise not have access to.

Speaker 1:          01:14:44       You know, in one of the things that's very bunch we're thinking about is that you basically die into your personality. You know, so what happens? It's a Darwinian issue. Fundamentally. What are your first board of your neurons? Have more connections than you can shake a stick at like more than you'll ever have in your entire life. And then all the ones you don't use dye and so what that is, it's a collapse of potential into actuality. But let's make no mistake about it. It's costly because you become what you are instead of all the things that you could have been and people experienced that as a cost. That's the story of Peter Pan. I don't want to grow up because I don't want to become one thing instead of the many things I could be. Now, the problem with that theory is you get a whole right, so you don't sustain your potential without.

Speaker 1:          01:15:35       Even if you don't develop it, it doesn't just sit around and go stale. Curdles get salary, so it's not an. It's not an acceptable choice that people make that choice all the time, especially if they take the great father isn't anything but captain right? A terrible heidrick tyrant who's terrified of death crocodile with the clock in its stomach. It's already got a piece of him and that's the great. That's the dragon of chaos. He's being chased by the dragon of chaos. Like if you were terrified of the dragon of chaos and you're in the patriarchal role and there'd be a tyrant and then why the hell would anyone grow up to be want to be like you? One of the things I see in my clients very, very often, and this is more characteristic of the males and the females, is that many of them will not allow the cells to experience anger or aggression or to express it because they have tyrannical fathers, you know, and so one of the things they decided when they were like four was, I've never going to be like that.

Speaker 1:          01:16:38       It's like, well, that doesn't work out because you know you need the capacity for anger and hostility and aggression and all that. You have to have that at hand and you don't fix it. By refusing to manifest. All that does is cripple you because you're missing half of your emotional dynamism and a whole chunk of your power. Know we don't have that many sources of power. You've got enthusiasm. The answer, good one, curiosity, interest, appreciation for beauty. You know, anger is unbelievably useful, tremendous reservoir of power. You know, and you don't want to suppress that. You want to harness it so it's at hand so that people don't mess with you because they will. People will push, especially pushing people and if you can, well if you can't push back, you're going to walk all over you. They won't even notice, you know, because you'll just move and they'll, they won't even notice that they pushed you over so when you will go home, you'll be all resentful and irritated who brewed on it for a month and it's like they didn't even have to say anything at so.

Speaker 1:          01:17:41       And you know, so the man I've seen often will refuse themselves access to, to anger in particular. And then with women it's often the case that they have a harder time getting access to it because women are more agreeable than men. So it's harder for women to be, you know, it's hard for a woman even if she's pretty damn tough to really contend with the guidance. Really difficult as guys who were really disagreeable, especially if they're physically intimidating and super smart and those people are very, very difficult to deal with it, you know, because the cut you into pieces verbally and they won't budge. And so you have to really ratchet up your preparation before you can withstand that. And you know, a lot of women here who are going to be dealing with in corporate environments and dealing with people who are tough to go in and get prepared for that.

Speaker 1:          01:18:31       And it's no joke. There's some very, very, very broad card people up there. And that's a good thing. There's nothing would happen without, you know, there are forced to contend with. So anyways, the dragon of chaos, roughly speaking, differentiates itself. And did these fundamental, you could say personified elegance, but for Sondra fight is the wrong idea because you know, usually when you think of something as being personified, do you think of it as being something and then you act as if it's taken on persona. Find Quality, you know, so it's like a projection now. I don't think that's how it works. I think that we naturally experience the world in the persona fight categories and then we have to take them apart to get the world, you know, look again at that differentiated world out them. So for example, when you're a baby, roughly speaking the world is your mother, and then as you differentiate the world, it starts to turn into things that aren't your mother, but it isn't like you confuse the world with your mother to begin with.

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       It's modern world to begin with. And it's a perfectly reasonable way of thinking about it. I mean, you're only this faith. Your mother's really big and she's taken 3 billion years to build. So you know, that's a force of nature to contend with. And by thinking, by conceptualizing that entity as the world, you've done a pretty good job of initial modeling because think about this. You're actually a reflection of the world, right? You really are, because you were shaped by the world in your evolutionary development. It's like, here's the world hears you. You're like, you're a little reflection of the world because the world has made you. And so you embody it. The world is the sort of place where something like you can adjust to it. That means you're a lot like the world. And so if you start out with the assumption that the world is a lot like your mother is actually a pretty good assumption, it is pretty much like your mother and she is a force of nature and so it's not personification is first pass, understand, and then you know, the father comes into it in one form or another, you know, in a fractured for perhaps or a complete form, you know, with the hope that you have a parent.

Speaker 1:          01:20:44       Do you have, you hope you have an architectural parents, some sense who embodies that entire dynamic range of what it means to have that gender because then they're a really good representative of the world. Also, most of the world that you're going to interact with isn't stuff. It's people. So in so far as your mother and your father or the world, that's a really good model because everyone you meet is going to be your mother or your father roughly speaking. So you know, if they're very dynamic people and they embodied the full range of human possibility, you know, in so far as one person can do that, then they're excellent models. For what you're going to be interacting with for the rest of your life and that is what they should be, right? Because on average what you should do for your children is be as much like the world is you can be because that would prepare them for the work so you shouldn't be too nice because the world isn't too nice and you shouldn't be too harsh because then you'll just crush them, but you shouldn't be like making things easy for them.

Speaker 1:          01:21:48       You know, when you should be making things. It's difficult for them as they can possibly manage and it takes a real. You really have to have a relationship with a child will be able to do that because you got to keep them in the zone of proximal development and that to do that you have to know what their life, you know, and so if they can carry five following Monday, he put another ounce on Tuesday and you know, that way they, you, you a lot. It's the anti eatable approach. You, you encourage them to become strong and independent. Very hard on parents to do that. Especially if they define their lives by their children because they will want the child to leave. That's not a good thing because you don't end up with the child. You ended up with a crippled monster and you know, in the closet, you know, not good.

Speaker 1:          01:22:36       So. Okay. So anyways, you know, and the child obviously is there too. There's the mother of the father and the child whole situation, that's the world. And so that's what things break into the first and I think our social cognitive primate brain operates that way and then if it operates that way and there seems to be plenty of evidence that it does. And then the next thing you might think as well, maybe that is the right thing. So since our brain evolved and mirrors reality, that's perfectly reasonable way of thinking about reality from Egypt on great. And from China on the left, that's actually on the left. That's actually Osiris and isis, if I remember correct. So that's so cool. You know, they emerge from the primordial serpent out of chaos. The predatory, dangerous and promising chaos emerges. The primary archetypal things. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:23:37       No I don't. And I can't give you much more information about that, although because a couple of students sent it to me over different spans of time. So. But I don't have the story at hand, unfortunately. I love this. Okay. It's now we're going to concentrate on the fifth on the archetypes of the feminine. So this is femininity, right? This isn't a female a woman. It's a class, it's a category. It's an architectural category. So we're investigating the nature of the feminine and the use of the feminine as a mode of representing things. Okay. So this is a nice cap. It's like done by know drug addled hippies in the 19 sixties. I think they lived in San Francisco. Actually think they knew Robert crumb because he was a. He was an underground cartoonist and fact I think crumb probably established a little organization that gave this guy who's named Ms Dot Gilbert Shelton.

Speaker 1:          01:24:37       His start in his career. So he has these characters that are three hippies and they're always experimenting with drugs in one form or another. And they have this cat, it's fat freddy's Cap. And they kind of liked the cat and the cap has its own adventures and this is one of them. So the hippies had just sold a bunch of cocaine and they bought this little estate in the country and so they're bringing their cattle there and it's never been in the country. And it's pretty interesting. I think it's a funny cartoon because I've had cats and they hate it when you move places, you know, because they're all comfortable where they were. And then you move to captain the new place and it's like, it's like the little rap that you just put in the new cage, that cat is not happy. Maybe it will just sit there and cry because they will do that, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:25:15       But then they sort of loosen up and eventually they sort of master the new territory and it's very stressful for a cap. So dogs are much better at doing that from, for whatever reason. Maybe it's because they're pack animals. Okay. Anyways, the hippie takes the cat out, shows them the country. It'd be the cat's not that happy about that. So it goes into this crouch which animals actually do when they explored new territory. So if you put a rat in a cage and it starts to move around it hunches down, you know, sort of slinking through the undergrowth basically so that nothing can see it. So that's what cap will do. And then the cat sniffs away, which is what a capital do because they're mostly old factory, like most animals. And then poof it encounters an anomaly and that's already on edge. So like an explorer exploring cat like this would have, it's for half popped up already because it's funny.

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       It's preparing for what's lurking out there in the unknown. And then if anything just triggers it over the edge. You've seen this, if you've ever gone behind the cap, like wit to it, if it's, especially if it's someone startled thing will just explode into for the jump four feet in the air and then it's very amusing, you know, so a little better off than the other direction. Take revenge on later. So anyway, is the cat encountered something that doesn't understand and then runs up to the adults. And so the MP say the cap disappeared to now and he says under the house and the cat says Ukiah too, if you'd smell what I did and then it shows what it smells and it's a great thing and it's like it's got duck feet and it's got a like deer antlers and it's got a whole face and it's got a skunk tail and it's like you might say, well that thing doesn't exist, but then you might say, wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          01:26:59       If you're going to derive a first pass approximation of what the what's lurking out there in the forest, that's not a bad representation. It's like it's alive. It's got the properties of the skunk going to and a wolf and all these things in Melbourne made it into one thing. Now it actually is what's waiting out there in the bush. Now as you exploring, you're going to differentiate that into sub categories, but you don't. You can't start your knowledge at a high level of resolution. You're going to start at a low level of resolution. You've got to come up with a low level resolution model that's accurate but not detailed. And the reason you have to do that is because you bloody well better do it fast because if you don't, you're going to be sitting around and thinking, well, are you a deer, a wolf or a Fox?

Speaker 1:          01:27:44       And the next answer to that is, I'm the thing that eight, you know, so it's not a good, it's not a good approach. You want to get quick and dirty. And that's why kids, I think that's why kids imagine monsters all the time in the dark. It's like there aren't monsters, well not in that particular gardens, but the kid is not that stupid. It's wired up, knows what's out there in the dark and it's not good. And so it takes a lot of calming to make a chart, especially because we have kids sleep in your own bedroom. Like that's not natural for kids. I know what I'm saying. That is what should happen. But as an evolutionary know, I think it does encourage you to dependents and all that. He at the cost of some trauma. But you know, you can perfectly well imagine that collective humans, 150,000 years ago stayed in a pretty type heat when they were sleeping because that's a lot safer, especially if they're, if you're little and delicious and edible.

Speaker 1:          01:28:42       So. So I love the cartoon because it's also a really useful illustration about how fantasy, you know, how a fantasy operates automatically and regenerate these generic low resolution categories. All right, so now here is, this is Kelly. She's a Hindu goddess. And so you might say, well, did people invent gods? I think that's a very weird question because the answer is yes. And NASA results will know because you could also just as easily say that God's people. It depends on how you look at anyways, you know, if you think about it from a Marxist perspective or Friday and perspective or from a scientific perspective and those perspective that tend to be very destructive to religious thinking. You're basically, you've got to think, okay, well the image is there to, to protect you against death, anxiety or, and that it's a substitute father. That's the Freud defined again, basically, or that their religion was constructed to aid in abet.

Speaker 1:          01:29:44       Those are in those who are empowered to keep all the peasants and the Lo life's under control by, you know, like promising them happy ever after if they behave or that it's just a primitive scientific theory that should be superseded now that we have more knowledge. Those are the alternative hypotheses. Okay, well let's look at this image. So this is Kelly and she's a destroyer. Devour that doesn't mean she's bad by the way. It means something to contend with. She's like the tmf. So I couldn't take her apart so that you can see her because you can't, unless you happen to know what this means because of your culture and even then you might not be able to see it. So let's figure it out. Now she has eight ladies. Why? What has eight legs expire? How do you all feel about spiders? Right? And the reason you feel like that is because you have these little spider detectors on your skin.

Speaker 1:          01:30:38       Those are basically cares. And when the spider crawls along in the spider detectors, you get this creepy feeling and that's you basically shaking your skin to get rid of the damn spider course. You can't do that anymore because you're not a horse, you know, so you just kind of have this digital feeling like that. And spider can give you a good chomping, you know? And so sometimes that's actually poisonous and that's not so good. But also a spiker is an interesting thing from a conceptual perspective because it spins a web and the web catches things that aren't paying attention. And then the thing that isn't paying attention gets wrapped up in this spider's Web and then it gets sucked dry. So that's a spider. Okay. So she's a spider now. Spiders are pretty cool too because they can spin webs, you know. And that's the web of faith by the way.

Speaker 1:          01:31:24       That's the way with faith. Um, so that's one thing. She's a, she's a spider and then, well she's in this web, but the web has made other fire that's fire. And then inside the fire, those are skulls. So she's a spider that sits in a web of fire and skulls, so believe me, if you saw a spider like that, you'd be looking at it. You might screen first and maybe he would run away, but then you'd come back and look at it. It's like, oh look, I found a spider, a web of fire itself. I'm happy, very attractive to you. You probably wouldn't be able to forget about it. And you know, that's one thing about Kelly. She's the bunch of things that you bloody well cannot forget about. And so you could actually even say she's a model of all those things that you can forget about.

Speaker 1:          01:32:08       And then you could say, well, she's an attempt tomorrow. All those things you can't forget about. And you might say, well why would you want to model those things? Well it's because you bloody well better remember those things or you're not going to stay alive. And then you might ask, what should you be dealing with? The things that you shouldn't forget about one by one fires say or, or, or skeletons. Should you be dealing with that one on one or spiders or snakes or should you be dealing with that as a category? Right? That's the thing about human beings is we like to deal with things as categories because that way you could solve a whole bunch of problems at the same time. You know, so you might say you do this all the time. You don't. If you go on log on online and you look at people who are having one advice about relationships, they want advice about relationships and you think, well really what they want is to figure out how to deal with this female or this mail, but they don't ask that question.

Speaker 1:          01:33:12       They ask, how can I improve my relationships? Which is that they're trying to solve the problem of how to relate to all the set of all potential relationships right now because maybe that's better information than exactly what to do about this particular male or female at this particular point in time. Now, often it isn't, but you can understand why people push for that. It's like, why not get the general answer? If you can, then you solve the whole class of problems. Okay, so what's the class of problems here? The class of problems here is the class of problems. It's how do you conceptualize the class of problems? It's a brilliant. That's such a brilliant question. You know, for, for. I mean maybe you can't. Maybe there's no commonality between all of those things that constitute a problem, but by the same token, maybe there is.

Speaker 1:          01:34:02       Well this is an attempt to do that. Okay. So what else about the Kelly? She's got a sword for hair's on fire. She also has a headband of skulls now people don't like smells very much, you know, they creep us out and there's good reason for that because all things considered, you should probably avoid places where there are a lot of sculpture because it's easy to infer from that that a lot of people like you died there and that might be because there's something around that it's going to kill you just like it killed all those other things or there's some illness or whatever. It's like get the hell out of there. So even chimps don't like chip hands and they don't like it. Mobile chip bodies. So you know, a scuffle for us it's like well you can see it's death itself, you know, and it is that, but it's an architect will assemble and you don't get accustomed to skull very, very hard.

Speaker 1:          01:34:52       So just got skulls everywhere. Well sometimes she has tons of a tire but she doesn't think this particular representation. But sometimes she does. And that's the predatory element. And the tiger, that's a pretty fascinating thing, right? Because it's like 12 feet long, five feet high and you know, it's a major piece of engineering back and probably it will eat you. So to put the timer is counting on. County also indicates that she's representative of those terrible awe, inspiring predatory things that lurk in the forest. Of course this is an Indian representation. She often has this snake around her waist and usually it's a Cobra Cobra. Is there another thing that people find absolutely fascinating like fire and then. But not in this situation, what she has wrapped around her instead of her intestines. And you see how our bellies hall, she just gave birth to that unfortunate character that she happened to be standing on and his intestines that she's eating right now.

Speaker 1:          01:35:54       I fail to see how this symbol can protect you from death anxiety, you know, quite the contrary. It seems to me to be something that would seriously evoke it, you know, and there's no patriarchal protection here and I can't see how anybody could use this to oppress the peasants. You know, maybe they could scare them with it, but that isn't actually how Kelly is used. So I don't think that that's a useful way of thinking about it at all. Now, interestingly enough, Kelly is something you made sacrifices to now that's cool. And because it's weird, people have had a hard time to figure it out. The whole idea of sacrifice. So there was this guy who was a journalist in the 19 sixties and he wrote a book, his name was Arthur Kessler. He wrote a book called the ghost in the machine, which is a book of consciousness.

Speaker 1:          01:36:39       And one of the things he pointed out was that the Motif of sacrifice seemed to be architectural, it was universal, it was happening everywhere. And one of the side effects of that was human sacrifice. Go onto row, upset you can sacrifice a couple of slaves or captures or children because the Carthaginians used to do that all the time, their own children. And they have them smile before they killed them. So it was brutal room. But the Carthaginians they would commit suicide at the drop of a hat because their basic idea was if you screwed up while you're wrong, time to kill yourself, there's no hope for you. So it's very common idea. And the Japanese still practiced that before World War Two as well. It's like, so. So anyways, so the whole idea of sacrifice pretty damn dark, you know, and, and Kessler regarded it as evidence that the human race was basically insane, like fundamental, biological manner that was not fixable.

Speaker 1:          01:37:37       So it was like the ultimate in original sin and the theorizing, you know, when that was written, when everybody was all shorted out about the fact that we are going to blow ourselves up with nuclear weapons. And so the idea that humans were basically insane, which is not a bad theory, you know, you could even say we're, we've been driven insane by the nature of being anyways. You make sacrifices to kill it. They're often blood sacrifices. Now that's kind of interesting because one of the things that you might notice about what Kelly represent, which you might say is the predatory, like almost diabolical site of nature. You know, the part of nature that's really working hard at doing un is that it does seem to thrive on blood. And so there's an idea here which is if you give the damn thing what it wants, maybe it will leave you alone.

Speaker 1:          01:38:26       But there's more sophisticated idea right beneath that. Because what happens if you sacrifice to Kelly because she turns into her office and her opposite is, well, it's the opposite of this. It's benevolent nature. It's the kind of nature that that environmentalists believe it, you know, it's like nature as French impressionists landscape. It's not mosquito mosquitoes and Guinea worms and cancer and crocodiles and gangrene. It's, you know, it's, it's a sunny day in that old growth forest where you know, Disney dear, constantly around smiling at you. You know, and that's nature too because nature is what gibbs and if you use the feminine, the feminine symbolism, I mean your mother is certainly someone who can be an absolutely horrific forest and that often happens to infants, but by the same token, chief, the bearer of everything that pulls you into life, you know, and her, her contact with you or her physical contact or ability to play with you.

Speaker 1:          01:39:23       The fact that she looks at you, the fact that she feeds you directly from her body. It's like that's the whole opposite of Kali, the destroyer, and they're both elements of the feminine. And part of the reason I think that it's the feminine per se that came to represent the destructive element of nature as well as the positive element is that men experience women in many ways. As the disruptive element of the feminine, because men are always been rejected by women and women are nature because nature is what selects you to reproduce, and so the answer for most women to most men is you're a nice enough guy, but there's no way your genes should propagate themselves into the future, you know, and that's as harsh a judgment as could possibly be rendered. If you watch chrome, for example, which I recommend it because it's full of great mother's symbolism is he's being described himself as someone who is so much of a loser.

Speaker 1:          01:40:16       He's not even in the dominance hierarchy, you know, he's not at the bottom, he's outside, you know, so he described himself as someone for it was, especially him and his older brother, it was virtually impossible for there to even conceive of the idea that they might ask a girl in high school. It wasn't that they would get refused. It was that it was inconceivable that they could even do it. That's where they were in the dominance arc. So of course from and who has a mother to go with it, you know, all his females are like these extremely physically powerful bird headed goddesses, more or less, and he construed themselves with this little word thing that's sort of cowering at their feet and it's deeply embedded and to wonder, given his circumstances, it's no wonder he actually did a remarkable job of, of developing himself in a, in a, in a productive manner, I think given what he had to go against.

Speaker 1:          01:41:14       But anyways, yeah, he is. You sacrificed to Kelby and you bring forth its opposite. Now it's like I was once I thought, I thought I understood, I thought that I had come to understand the idea of sacrifice. I think I figured this out about 15 years ago and it just blew up. Blew me over when I figured it out because it had always been viewed either as kind of an empath phenomenon or something that's pathological, but it's not. It's the most remarkable. It's one of the most remarkable conceptual discoveries that human race has ever made because what it meant was we started to figure out that if you gave something, what it wanted, if you gave something something of value, then you can turn it into something that might be beneficial to you. So it's the, it's, it's the common towns of delayed gratification. Delayed gratification is a sacrifice.

Speaker 1:          01:42:09       So you know the, the, the marshmallow experiment, right? Okay. So you get these little kids, you're tortured, you say, hey, hey, you like marshmallows. It's like, yeah, I know you. Okay? So here's the advice of the. Now if you don't eat those marshmallows, you get to have more marshmallows. And so then you leave. And some of the kids eat parched, Alex, right? And you got to admit those kids. There's something about them to get the damn marshmallows, you know? So if there was an earthquake, right, then those kids would have one. Okay? So that's something to think about because delayed gratification is not always the right answer. The environment has to be stable enough so that the probability that you will get what you've delayed for is high, and so if you're living in sheer chaos, you're a fool to delay gratification. It's like eat the damn marshmallow now so, so it's not like delayed gratification is the solution for everything.

Speaker 1:          01:43:02       It's not. Sometimes it's the solution. So what do you do? You make the sacrifice now and the idea is it will pay off in the future so that you think about that in architectural forms. That means that you forego something of value. Now it's a sacrifice you let go of it and the deal is if you let go of it, better things will happen to you in the future and you know, no other animal has figured that out. Well, squirrels maybe because they store knocks, but I don't really believe that they. I think it's fundamentally an instinct. You know what I mean? I don't think they generalize from that idea. They do act it out, but I don't think they generalize from it. They haven't turned it into a concept. And so the concept here is the world is constituted such that it hasn't tremendously destructive element, but if you can barter with that properly, then you can flip it over into part of it.

Speaker 1:          01:44:01       That's positive group will reveal itself. That's bloody brilliant. It's unbelievably brilliant. And there's even another element to it because let's say that all your, all you been getting from reality for awhile is Kelly. It's all spiders and snakes and fires and skull. You know what's and and things that want to eat you. You might think why. One answer is, well, that's just what it's like, but then that's a problem because that's not just what it's like. You know that the opposite is there. And you might say, well where, where the hell is that? Like why is it hard to get space for me? And one answer is I reality is cannot be contentedly that's one ass. But that's like you're depressed and hopeless like you're done. Here's another answer. You might be doing something wrong and then you might think, well what would it mean to be doing something wrong? And then we might say, maybe you're hanging onto something you value a little too tightly, maybe one of your axiomatic presuppositions, like the thing that's at the top of your damn value structure is actually sufficiently outdated or pathological such that if you hold onto it all, you're going to get his rounds and misery.

Speaker 1:          01:45:27       So maybe you have to let it go. That's a sacrifice. And so maybe that's why the rule is when you're making sacrifices to Kelly, you don't sacrifice the low quality junk. You sacrifice the stuff that you were attached to you because if things aren't going right, it could be that it's because you're attached to the wrong things. Now that's interesting. That's starting to get very interesting because that means that people are starting to think maybe my attitude has something to do, something I can change. Like maybe it's not just the factual nature of the external world. It's something I can contend with and dance with. And maybe if I readjusted my moral Schema, the profitability is kind of low that Kelly will be there all the time and it'll be pretty high that her positive counterparts shows up. So then the question might be how do we set, make the sacrifices that are necessary to organize our schema of interpretation in behavior such that when we implemented in the world, reality shines since positive face on us in order it's negative face. And like that's incredibly complicated problems, right? I mean that's, that's problem. Human beings being trying to figure out at animals for that kind of forever, you know, it wasn't until they were human beings that you started to get some conceptual representation. But then the other thing too is you guys are all doing that. You haven't been back going with nature and the fattiest

Speaker 1:          01:46:55       made some sacrifices right now. Or maybe your parents are making sacrifices on your behalf and what's the bed? The bed is. It will be worth it. But what does that mean? It means that if you make the proper sacrifices, you discipline yourself. You don't, you're not to dilute with your resources. You pay attention and you wait. Your life will be better. That's pretty cool because it might be true and if it's true, then none of this is illusion or delusion. It's just low resolution.

Speaker 1:          01:47:33       First pass representation that smart and so you know from a Piagetian perspective, well, what do you do before you understand something, act it out. And so the people that were making sacrifices, they're acting out this idea. Do they know the idea is what you mean by? No, no, you're acting it out. They're dramatically representing you. Is that knowledge or it's a form of knowledge? Is it the kind of abstract knowledge that we're talking about right now? No, but it's the immediate precursor to that you don't get from the phenomena to the articulation without running it through some bodily representations and some drama and this is so damn complicated that, you know, you probably couldn't get to it until you had civilizations that were pretty damn good. And lots of people thinking about this all the time, you know, so the person who came up with this, they would have experienced it as religious revelation.

Speaker 1:          01:48:30       It's like what's the nature of reality? You get this image, you know, some of this multi armed goddess and it's inflamed. It's in a way up and it's like terrifying. It's terrifying you. You're gripped by it and you make a representation and part of the reason you worship it is because the bloody thing is, is you when its grip and no wonder because there's an idea behind that is so powerful that you shouldn't be gripped by it. You should be unable to forget it because it's, it's an absolute, it's a stellar stroke of genius. It's a real revelation and it sets the whole human race on the path to making the proper sacrifices so that the fire and the bugs and the insects and the snakes and the Tigers stay the hell away and a good thing. It's a good thing. And then maybe now and then you know, the world's can so that it's beneficial to us. I'm not sure if this would be greatest moment, but um, I asked a question before my shirt. You got to it last. Did you can just directly stating when you think of as an architect when you used the word

Speaker 1:          01:49:46       well that's

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       good. That's a good question. This is an archetype, but your behavioral reactions to that could also the architect. So I would say it's the expression of something that's at the foundation of knowledge, so it's like an innate axiom of representation and behave and it's archetypes that make us human rather than lines or ants. We have human architects and those are the things that we can dispense. They're built into us like, well, jealousy would be an architect for example. It's an archetypal pattern, hunger, thirst, all of these things that are common to everyone, but there are more. They're more conceptual archives to, to like, like things, you know, it's a, it's a fuzzy word, but it, it, it has to do with the element of idiation and action that are not merely culturally constructed. Let's say. Is it something like I'm in jeans, something like there has to be a sub straight, but then it also has triggered or activated by something or is it just kind of all over again?

Speaker 1:          01:51:01       Well, that's a good question. That's a good question. Um, I, I don't, I think the, I think I can answer that in some sense by analogy. John would not be able to learn language unless they had the archetype of language at hand, right? Does it have to be triggered?

Speaker 1:          01:51:23       Twins sometimes come up with their own language, identical twins, so they'll just create a life, you know, and so there's a pretty powerful language creating capacity, but generally speaking, yes, it's triggered because you're thrown into an environment where, which is the norm, but you can throw a chip in there and that's not going to work. Now what it is that makes people, they are able to generate languages that's complicated because partly it's, you have the right mouth, you have the right timing, you have the right throat, you know, and then you have the right brain, whatever the hell that means. And we don't, we don't exactly know what any of those things mean. So we use the word archetype to kind of cover rate in roots in some sense.

Speaker 4:          01:52:08       Does the human psychological element of archetypes in your views change? Um, change qualitatively when human beings are having widespread access to board presentations?

Speaker 1:          01:52:23       Hopefully. Because otherwise it wouldn't be any. There wouldn't be any utility in developing your representations. Mean I, so I think the question you're asking in some senses is representation useful and the answer is so far so good, you know, useful, but just that, like the thing itself, once represented, does that representation and now filter back in and then change this thing that started out. So I would say it doesn't happen all sorts of ways. So for example, in some ways the dominance hierarchy is a way that animals organize themselves in an environment, but if they do that long enough it becomes the environment, right? Because once it's, once the adaptation is being there for 100 million years, it's no longer an outpatient. It's part of the environment. So there's loops, causal loops happening everywhere. So yeah, the representation changes the archetype. God only knows how. And over what period of time.

Speaker 1:          01:53:20       Yes, yes, there is a relationship, but I don't know enough about Hinduism to tell you what it is. So you know, I'm not, I'm not an expert on Hinduism, that's for sure. It's very complicated religious system, you know, but you know, I do know that these sub dailies, so to speak, are manifestations of the ultimate reality when there's many, there's some utility in that because it's, it's monotheistic at one level of analysis and polytheistic and another, it makes it easier, you know, you could think about these as bridges between the human and the absolute divine, the absolute divine so damn abstract and distant that it's hard to have any relationship with it. You need intermediary structures and the saints are like that. Catholicism, you know, because they're sort of God's roughly speaking, but they're sort of human. So when you could kind of understand them and their fractionated out and so the only representative of the day, you know, so they're not the whole thing all at once, which is a bit much to contend with.

Speaker 1:          01:54:22       So, so you think having diverse vocabulary of health people, I don't know if it helps it. Say that again. Um, it helps them differentiated now. Okay. And articulate. So now we want to think about what that means. Okay. So I think I've told you before, I've seen children that haven't been played up with enough, so maybe they're five or six and they're kind of, they're like little Frankenstein, you know, you're kind of uninformed and kind of cloudy and clueless and they bump into things like other kids, you know, and so they're, they're not articulated well. And so the other kids usually won't play with them because they're sort of that a three year old level of development when they should be at a six year old devil of development. Just puts the other kids off, you know, they find it creepy and there's reasons for that that I won't go into.

Speaker 1:          01:55:23       But those kids aren't differentiated, you know, they haven't got the extremely high level movements down. And so as you articulate an archetype and it diversifies, you become more adapted to multiple places. So that's what you want to do. You want to take the damn archetype and differentiated like mad because for example, when you're looking at a woman, you don't want to see only the archetype. First of all, you'd be on your knees if that happened. Believe me, there's lots of men like that. They're really are. It's animal possession. It's way more common than you think. I see this with male clients all the time. If they're attracted to a woman, her mere presence is so god damn overwhelming that it just ties. They're talking about the naughts and what's happening is they're not seeing the individual. You're seeing the archetype and archetype is life is just too much.

Speaker 1:          01:56:15       Now, what's interesting is the archetype does shine through the woman. It's real, but the individual part is real too. Unless the guy is capable of differentiating the archetype into that actual woman to woman won't have anything to do with him or maybe she'll play with them like a spider plays with the fly and it serves them right too. But, but so you have to have both, you know? And so that's partly why. Remember Sleeping Beauty, the Disney movie, you know how the, the hero is put into a castle by the evil queen, right? And then sleeping beauty is sleeping. And so then he has to fight his way through this architectural representation, which actually transforms itself into the dragon of chaos. He has to fight his way all through all of that before it can actually get to the real woman. And that's exactly what happens with men as they develop poor, failed to develop is the first thing to the degree that they're immature.

Speaker 1:          01:57:12       All they see is the archetype, and they're very inferior in relationship to the archetype because unless they were Christ, so to speak, you know they're going to be at. You're going to be on their needs. And so to contend with, the archetype means first of all, to elevate the mail because as he contends with it, he develops, right? But at it also means to, to to place the two equality. And then the archetype turns into the individual woman. Now that's a big sacrifice because you know, hypothetically, you rather have sleeping beauty that pretend princess in some actual woman with all her trouble. But the problem is there isn't sleeping beauty that pretending princess. There's just the real woman. And you see that with Peter Pan to the story. Because he's got tinker bell, that's fine, except for Tinkerbell to ferry and they don't exist, so he could have wendy if he would grow up, but he doesn't want to grow up, so he's not going to get Wendy's just been in state king of the bloody lost boys and that will be the end of that.

Speaker 1:          01:58:11       So, so it's differentiation of architects and that's what you're doing as you develop across time. Now there's a book called the origins and history of consciousness, which was written by a guy named Eric normand and it's a book that's very much like maps are being because I believe that NASA meeting has been written four times. Um, it's symbols of transformation and growth that it's origins and history of consciousness. Eric Norman, who was a student of young, wrote that and it's also Becker's denial of death and it's because you know, when there's elements and heidegger are very similar because all that's all working on the same problem. But one of the things that's lovely about knowing that he's very smart about this, he describes the acquisition of knowledge as the differentiation of the archetypes. And that's brilliant. It's right, it's like the thing itself is a unified whole that sort of the divine ground of reality.

Speaker 1:          01:59:06       Then it fragments into the first three layers, masculine, feminine and Chai, and then that fragments and hopefully what it does is fragments right down to the level of individuals so that when you're interacting with someone, you're interacting to their with their individual expression of the archetypal reality because then you're actually interacting with the person and that'll get you a lot farther in any kind of relationship than being blown over by the architect project or would it be. I don't think you project them. It's not like you have a choice. It's. That's how you see the world. It's the default because it projection implies that you could be doing something else. It's like everything you see is an archetype. Although some of them are differentiated and they can become extremely differentiated in so far as you know, come to know a person, you know, if you're reading I to get differentiate the damn thing down to the level of individual recognition and you're so skilled at that, but the archetypal reality reestablishes itself and then you get to have your cake and eat it too.

Speaker 1:          02:00:13       Okay. So one of the things that you can conceptualize marriage, because marriage is a human universal vitally something to think about. You know, so it looks like it's built into us pretty hard at a biological level. So there's variations obviously and there's the, there are certain attractions and believe me, especially for men, but all things considered, no matter where you looked in the world, there's generally an attempt by the culture to st a man that woman pair now young was trying to figure out why the hell that would be it. I mean there's the biological necessity. Obviously you've gotten raised kids somehow and there shouldn't just be one of you, but you don't want to just reduce everything down to the, you know, to the level of two rats living together, even though that's an important level and know. He said that one of the things that's really useful about evolve is that you can't run away from the damn thing if it's an actual viable.

Speaker 1:          02:01:06       So what you're supposed to do when you marry someone is you say, look, I'm stuck with you and we're going to bet on this because we only get five shots at it anyways, and you know, you're the least awful person I've come across and so let's tie ourselves together so we cannot escape and see what happens. And so then you think if you take that seriously, you think, oh my God, I'm stuck with this damn person for the rest of my life. Also. Then when, if you really can't escape, you think, well, keep better, build something out of this because we're stuck in it. And so you don't conceptualize the marriage as an all chemical containers, and he derived this from the studies on alchemy where two opposite substances were placed together in a container they could not escape from and then exposed to heat and the heat, the relationship obviously, and all the emotions, but the relationship generates, they're exposed to heat and they can't get out of the damn container.

Speaker 1:          02:02:04       What happens? Well, there's a transmutation. Transmutation is a consequence of the exchange of information. So, and we know this works at a biological level, right? So part of the reason that there is sex is because if we split your DNA down the middle and that it's something that's exactly to say wherever there is a weakness, the two weaknesses are going to combine and you're going to end up with offspring. They're all mocked up. Now that's basically a consequence of inbreeding. So what you want to do is you want to take your applaud genetic substance, which is, you know, 99 point nine percent good. And someone else's blog, genetic substances snap them together and hope like hell that the errors don't match up. And they probably won't. And so that's what you're doing in a relationship. It's like, you know, you're screwing somebody, you cap ex and so is the other person.

Speaker 1:          02:02:53       Then. So when you slap those two things together and you hope that I'll of that you build in totality. Okay? And that starts the information flow moving. So then the question is what would you do if the information flow was a curator? What, what happened to you? So let's say you're 20 percent work, which, which is taste pretty good and your partner's 20 percent more to, but our, luckily you're warps. Don't match up what that means. If you listen to each other over a long enough period of time, if you really communicated, then you wouldn't be warped anymore and neither would the other person. And then you'd have the archetypal situation as well as the individual situation. Right? You see what I mean? Because you both have been elevated up to the point where you're not full of holes anymore. And you think, well that's part of the purpose in so far as there's this psychological and spiritual function of marriage.

Speaker 1:          02:03:46       That's it. And so you can, you can have freedom. You could say, well this is a, not that we can untie, but the problem with that is you don't have to contend with the person then. No, you don't get. You don't have to take it seriously. You don't have to take it as if it's life and death. But the problem is it is, it is life and death. It is. Maybe you can have another shot at it. I don't see why you think you'll do better the second time because all the evidence suggests that you won't. The divorce rate higher for second marriages. So like you know, the thing about being tied to someone who isn't you is that they're not. You have something to tell you if you listen. And so then you start with the flawed individual and if you're paying yourself against each other enough, what you hope is that you both develop and you shared your excess baggage along the way. And that can happen. You know, it's a good thing if it happens. You live longer, you have a better life, the situation for your children. It's like everybody wins in that situation. Okay, let's. You're all getting restless, so let's stop and come back and come back in 10 minutes.
