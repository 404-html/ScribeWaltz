Speaker 1:          00:00:08       We're going to review a proposition now. If I ever tell you something in enough detail that you've already heard that you're like, you've heard it enough, please tell me because I can't. I can't precisely remember what I told you. I know the line of the narrative throughout the entire course and we will return to some things fairly frequently, but I don't want to tell you the same story three times. You know, unless you're, you know, particularly compelled by that story, so let me know. I'm going to start with the proposition and the proposition is that in order to orient yourself properly in life, there's two classes of information that you have to have access to and one class of information is information about the nature of the object of world and the object of world is described in a manner or the world when it's treated objectively.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       Is it described in a manner that strips all the subjectivity from it? Right? That's the technology that the philosophical technology that's behind the scientific revolution involve stripping the subjectivity from, from the sense mediated consequences of certain kinds of actions. Right? Because when you lay on an experiment, you're not just talking about what happened, you're talking about what you did and then what happened, and you're supposed to be able to do it in a way that ensures that if someone else followed exactly the same procedure, they would obviously observe the same consequences and in some sense we're trying to establish a realm of knowledge that is universally applicable to people despite their individual differences. That's one way of thinking about it and obviously that works. Now, whether or not it works in a Darwinian sense, we still have to determine because it could easily be that our development of the scientific method is what will make us go extinct and which and under which circumstances you might consider it to have been an error, but it doesn't really matter at the moment because so far so good. Roughly speaking. So now you know, people think that the world is an objective place because we can describe it objectively and not so much more

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       debatable presupposition. It's partly debatable because it's actually based on a decision in some sense rather than evidence. Partly because your knowledge is finite in every direction in some sense. So what that means in a way is that no matter what you know about anything, you don't know everything about that thing. And so you kind of ground out in ignorance at some point. So what that means is that you have to buttress your thinking with a set of assumptions that you don't question or you just ended up in an infinite regress. And one of those sets of assumptions is usually reality sets of assumptions or truth definitions, sets of assumptions. But the thing is generally, no matter what your theory of reality is or what your theory of truth is, there are alternative theories of reality and alternative theories of truth that are equally rigorous and that have different domains of application. And it's a very tricky business. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       so for example, if you're a reductionist, materialist, you're going to make the presupposition that a brain physiology is more real than emotional experience. And I suppose that's in some sense because you can't get access to anyone else's emotional experience, at least not directly. Whereas you can get universal access to the fundamental details of someone's brain physiology. It's something like that anyways. Now that still an arbitrary assumption because obviously the person and you as well are going to be acting all the time as if your emotions and your motivation, motivational states are real and so then you run into a problem and the problem is, well, how do you know what someone actually believes? Do you listen to what they say or or do you take into account their explicit and well articulated theories or do you watch how they act? And the answer to that is

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       you take your, you make your choice, and generally there are reasons for that. Now, one of the, one of the conceptual tools that I have found helpful in my attempts to avoid confusion when dealing with the fact that there are very many ways of looking at the world is to start thinking about theories of reality as tools rather than as descriptions. And I find that extraordinarily useful as a metaphor because you know you can. If you have a toolbox full of tools, you don't necessarily try to reduce the utility of one tool to another and you don't actually complain because all the tools aren't the same. You know, a ranch isn't a very good hammer, but that doesn't mean you can criticize it on that grounds. It's, you might not want to use it as a hammer, although you could I suppose, but it's not justifiable criticism and it looks to me, and this is something a psychologist named George Kelly pointed out as well, although I think it's also an element of pragmatic philosophy, is that I'm

Speaker 1:          00:05:23       one set of tools for one thing and another set of tools for another thing and that's helpful. That's helpful. And so, and then you know, you are also thinking about the sorts of problems that you like solve with different forms of tools and one problem is what are things made of in an objective sense, let's say. And then another problem might be, well what is the landscape of experience? And that's more of a phenomenological problem. That's the problem the phenomenologists set out. And then the other problem might be how do you and should you conduct yourself, and it could easily be that you can't use the same tool to solve all those problems. And I would say that's particularly true technically when you're dealing with science because science by its very nature, refuses to answer questions about what it is that you should do apart from some implicit assumption that you should do science, which is actually not, well, that's actually not a scientific assumption by the way, because it's a moral assumption.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       And the moral assumption is that if you conduct yourself in a scientific manner, things would be better, right? Because why would you run around doing science to make things worse? Although you absolutely you can, you absolutely can. And, and we perhaps we are, you know, and, and, and even if we aren't, we still might. So, so what's one of the things that I find quite interesting about the scientific endeavor, and this is something you observed, was that it has to be nested in something outside of itself to give it its motive force. It has to be nested in a system of moral assumptions and the fundamental moral assumption is the world will be a better place if we conduct ourselves along scientific lines because otherwise why do it? And that's a statement that cannot be analyzed from within the confines of the scientific worldview because it doesn't analyze those sorts of questions.

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       Now you could say they're not real, but that's a stupid answer because I think it's, it's a, it's a cop out. Maybe it's not a stupid answer, probably yes, but at least it's a cop out because you, if you don't take that question seriously, you can't really justify engaging in the activity and so you can refuse to answer it, but you're basically answering it by engaging in the activity anyway. So even if you're not saying it, you're still justifying it. Alright. So you know, so I'm assuming that you can draw conclusions from people's actions like you can from their statements and it's hard really to dispute that. I would say if you're wise. In fact, I think you derive conclusions from their actions then from their statements. So. Okay, so that's, that's the under belly of the first proposition and the first, the development of that is something like the means by which information is transmitted that is relevant to the domain of behavior is not the same means by which it's transmitted by which scientific information is transmitted and we kind of know that too, you know, without any real debate I believe because how old do you think science is as a technical endeavor?

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       What would you estimate?

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       Hundreds of years, maybe thousands of years if you're willing to give it the Greeks some credit, but really probably not. Probably hundreds because I ever stopped. Aristotle wasn't a scientist, like he wasn't a bad observer, but he certainly wasn't empirical observer and no one got science straightened out. Dylan's probably what Newton Descartes Bacon and you know, there's a handful of other characters who were, who were thinking around those that period of time and they sort of, you know, establish the proper methods really. And also the philosophy that underlies not very old, 600 years, you know, 500 years, man, that's really nothing. It's the blink of an eye.

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       It's yesterday. If that, it might even be like an hour ago, it's, it's nothing, but obviously people were transmitting information about how to act to each other for untold millennia before that and it's probably more like, it depends on what you're willing to consider transmission of information, but even Octopi can imitate, you know, and so they're the smartest invertebrates. They're quite bright. Those things, they're not exactly sure how smart. They only live a couple of years so they can't really get things going, you know, but they can problem solve. They can pull carts out of bottles to get like a crab in a bottle. And then if they watch an octopus, an octopus watches another octopus, pull the cork out of a bottle to get a tasty crab, then that octopus now knows how to do it. So which is pretty impressive. And you can kind of see why occupied might be able to do that because not only do they have a brain, but they have little technically appendages which allow them to manipulate things.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       Right. And so one of the pre cursors to being able to be intelligent in any active way is that you have to have tentatively appendages so that you can manipulate the world, right? And at least for it to be anything resembling what we would consider intelligence. And that's part of the reason that dolphins really art as intelligent as people like to think because what are they going to do? You can't build cities with their flippers, you know, they are kind of trapped in their test, two bodies and the same thing applies to whale. So obviously they have very large brains and they're very social and they can learn and, but whatever their intelligence is, it's not like our intelligence because we run around tearing things apart and putting them back together. We've got the body for that. So. Alright. So anyways, long before we were practicing science, we were doing perfectly well in a sense without any real knowledge of the objective world at all, or at least not in scientific knowledge of the objective world. And so another thing that you might observe about that is that you can survive perfectly well without knowing any science at all or in an articulated and developed manner. Of course animals are in that category. So that also I think in some sense undermines the claim of science to anything approaching a universal truth because obviously life can get along perfectly well without it now. It depends to some degree on whether you're a Darwinian or a Newtonian

Speaker 3:          00:11:31       comments on what people should do. This more feature of modern science than it is a science in general because I'm thinking like someone like, I don't know if he knows, I don't know. Okay, well if it's his maxim, is that basically it's wrong always for anyone everywhere to believe anything on his evidence. And he sort of says that he's a mathematician who tries to prove it on a, on a moral basis. Of course it's still not scientific because that kind of claim can't really be signed.

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       Yeah. Well, I mean obviously the people who began the scientific revolution thought of it as part of a moral movement, right? I mean, it was part of the enlightenment that was part of bringing clarity to our conceptualizations of the world and that was supposed to be a positive thing, but you know, the only, the only issue is, is that claim seems to be outside of the claim of science in some sense. So anyways, you get the picture with regards to the argument. Okay, so now the next step might be, well, if you need or can utilize or there exists information that is not strictly scientific, one might be, well where did that information come from? That that's a good one. How is it transmitted? That's another one and the worst of it is of course is how might it be verified, you know, because one of the issues, one of the things that scientists have really got down and it's a major deal, is that they can lay forth at theory of truth and then they can operate within that theory of truth and pretty much everybody can agree on what it is now.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       And the more well established the science, the more that's the case. So like people don't really doubt Einstein's. People already don't doubt quantum theory anymore and you guys don't doubt it because there you are using your computers and you wouldn't be able to use your computers if quantum theory wasn't right, so you know it's right. Certainly right enough, but even more impressively than not, what? Whenever someone has tried to prove it wrong in any possible way, even if it's more most bizarre predictions over the last hundred and some years, it's passed every test with flying colors. So you know you can make pretty damn solid truth claims from within the scientific perspective. Now the problem is it's a lot harder to do that from within a moral perspective and there's all sorts of reasons for that. And one reason might be that there is a certain amount of situational complexity related to every moral question that you can't reduce.

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       So for example, imagine that you're a clinical psychologist and you're listening. I've been in this situation and you're listening to two people who know each other very well. Maybe a husband and wife, um, discuss their last argument. And you might say, well, you might think, well let's get to the bottom of this. Let's find out what this argument is about. And you might think if you were scientifically inclined that it is in fact about something, which means that if you investigated long enough you can actually figure out what the facts are. But I actually don't believe that's true. And the reason I don't believe it's true is this. So imagine, imagine you have. There's this old joke about these two friends, like they're, they're like 85 years old and they're sitting on a park bench feeding the pigeons and one friend says to the other 64 and the other guy cracks up and laughs like mad about that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:01       And then the other guy says 83 and the other guy cracks up and laughed like mad about that. And somebody watching them and wondering what in the world is going on? And so the person comes over and says to these old guys, well, what's the scope here? You, all you're doing there is sitting there saying memories to each other. And then you're laughing uproariously. I mean, I, I just don't get it. And they say, well, we've known each other for so long that we've heard each other's jokes at least 100 times and so we have them completely memorized. So a couple of years ago we decided we just numbered the damn things and it would take a lot less time to tell them and you know, we, we could laugh more of that. And so, okay. So, so it's an interesting little joke, you know, because it shed some light on the nature of deep relationships and if you have a deep relationship with them, with someone while here's how you can think about it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       Imagine you're trying to analyze an essay. Now I've actually built an essay writing module which is on my site to 30 website. It's, I don't remember which template it is, but I'll tell you in a while, it's based on this theory of meaning, roughly speaking, and you should use it to write your essay because if you do, it'll be a way better essay. So here's the, here's the issue, when you're reading an essay, where is the meaning? Well that's a hard one because first of all it might be in many places. That's. So the question might be badly formulated in some sense because it might be at many places. So let, let's, let's, let's think it through logically. Well you need the letters if it's an alphabetic, if it's written in alphabetic script and so obviously some of the meeting is in the letters and then the letters are combined in certain particular ways and that gives you some words and then the words are combined in some particular ways and that gives you phrases and the phrases are joined together in sentences and then the sentences are strung together in some reasonably coherent manner.

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       So they kind of go from start to end in a paragraph and then the paragraphs are strung together in a coherent manner to make up the totality of the essay. And then one of the things I've noticed when I've been trying to figure out how to grade essays and how to assess them is that you can do a good or a bad job at any one of those levels. So like a really bad essay. It's full of spelling mistakes, right? The words are inappropriate because the person doesn't actually understand them, so they're awkwardly used. The phrases are put together in a cliched manner. The sentence structure isn't good. The sentences aren't even in the write paragraphs, much less organized properly. The paragraphs don't flow from one to another in what might be called the. That's kind of where the skeleton of the story is. It's sort of the most important level in some sense.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       And then even if that wasn't all wrong, there's actually no idea there anyways. And then you can also read essays that have one or more of those flaws or or you know, some combination of all of them. So very frequently I read a student's essay and this often happens with smart creative students who are very badly educated and that would be probably 50 percent of the people in this class. I would bet, and I say that for genuine reasons because I run a fourth year seminar where I have people write extensively and so what they do is they write a four page essay and then I complained about it and and all those levels of analysis and then they write the same, see again in six pages and then I do the same thing and then they write the same essay and eight pages and the first half of the first essays are terrible and you know that's partly because students do you try out as triaged, right?

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       They think, well, do I really have to work in this course? I'll work a bit and see what happens and if I get slapped and I'll work a little harder and if I don't then I can devote my time to other courses. Which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. But some of it's just pure inability. But what's really fascinating is that by the end of the course, all of the students are writing well and it's pathetic as far as I'm concerned because it meant that everybody could have been taught to write 10 years ago, but they just weren't. So anyways, if you look at this template that I laid out, then it will help you with this because it walks you through the process of writing property and that's an extraordinarily useful thing to be able to do. So anyways, so, so now and then I'll read an essay and everything is wrong about it, but there's a really smart idea in it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       And then knowing this multilevel idea with regards to meaning, I could say, look, you know, you're smarter than you can, right? And so there's really something here, but you know, here's all the things that are wrong with it. But, and then you get a worse situation in some sense where everything about the essay is good, but the idea isn't. And so the words are good and the phrases to sentences are right that it goes together, but it adds up to nothing. And those are tough to grade because you give them a c maybe or b, because I probably give them a b and the person comes up and says, where did I make a mistake? It's like, well, you didn't really make a mistake, you just didn't do anything. Right. You know? And, and that's, that's a whole different problem anyways. Okay. So you think that's pretty complex with regards to an essay?

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       Where's the meaning? But that isn't where the meaning is. So here, let me, let me give you an example. I was thinking about this the other day. So the ethnicity and the cultural backgrounds of my students have changed quite radically over the years. Right. And so when I started teaching this course, for example, and my personality course as well, which would have been 30 years ago, I can take it for granted that everybody in the room with no the basic biblical stories and they would know the Judeo Christian version of the. Not say the Islam version of them. Well that's gone. And so that's really, that's really made it difficult for me in some ways because there's a bunch of things. There's a bunch of collective knowledge that might constitute a shared set of cultural assumptions that I can no longer presume and it means there's all sorts of things that I either can't talk about or if I'm going to talk about I have to step way back and start from start from first principles let's say, and so that's also made me think so because if I.

Speaker 1:          00:20:53       let's say you write me an essay and let's say it's a psychology essay, okay, now you're going to presume that there's a whole bunch of things I know about psychology that you also know and the reason you're going to presume that is because we're. We come from, we're for the purpose of this conversation. We're going to come from the same cultural background and what that means is we, we share a set of assumptions and we don't have to say what those assumptions are. We can assume them and then we can talk about the things that we disagree about. And of course that's what you're doing when you're writing an essay. We're having a conversation right here. You're saying, well obviously you and have to talk about what we know because we already know it. We want to push that a little bit so we start to talk a little bit about the things that we don't know, but no more so than we both understand.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       So then you think, well damn it, the meaning of the essay isn't in the essay at all. It's in the interaction between the shared cultural assumptions of the writer and the reader and the asset. Well, and then you think, well, it's worse than that even because the shared cultural assumptions are into their own sort of network and then that's nested inside of it. Very broad historical network and then that's nested inside an extraordinarily broad biological network and it's like actually you can continue expanding the outer reaches of the essay without limit and so part of that means it's actually impossible to specify the meaning of the essay. It's something that you both work at in combination as writer and as a reader, but it's very fluid and flexible and that's that problem is actually partly why the postmodernist Scott going because they sort of noticed this, I mean corrupt as they are.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       They did notice at one point that it was very, very difficult to say what any given phrase paragraph or even essay meant because it wasn't in that it wasn't there. Like it's not in the book. It's sort of in the book. But you know this too. If you listen, you know, you listen to a piece of music, you know. So let's say you had a favorite song when you were 14, you know, and when you first heard that, so I'm maybe you didn't like it that much, but then you heard it four times and you think, man, that's one excellent song. And then at some point you've heard it so many times if you never want to hear it again. And it's. And that's interesting too because it means the song has transformed in relationship to your historical, in interactions with it. You might say, well no, the song is the same.

Speaker 1:          00:23:18       It's like, well, it depends on what you mean by the song, the notes or the same experiences. Certainly transport. So. Okay, so anyways, back to the couple that are sitting there talking. They're having this argument, they're trying to sort out what this is about and the problem is, well, it's about everything that the argument is about plus everything that's ever happened to them in their relationship because you know, if someone has told you the same thing 50 times, it is not the same thing as the thing they told you the first time, right? God only knows how many transformations it's gone through as it's been continually repeated and how many different arguments it's been embedded in and and how many things you have to know to understand the shades of intonation and all of that, but basically each other instead a couple of producers is, is it's meaning as determined by the entire history of interactions that those two people have had and so how do you, how are you going to specify that?

Speaker 1:          00:24:17       It's very, very difficult to specify it. Now you really can, and it's also difficult to know when you've specified it enough, you know, so one of the things that's interesting about training as a psychoanalyst is that it's it. It starts to become an absolutely mind boggling how much archeology you can do, you can undertake underneath a single statement, especially if it's delivered with a bit of an edge and some contempt. It's like there are just levels and levels and levels and levels and levels of meaning underneath that. And you can tell that when you're engaged in an argument like that because someone will trigger you, let's say for lack of a better word and you know, they'll have broken a rule that you've established with them and you're both in a pit and you know, the fight is about that path. Even though maybe it's about some surface thing and you're just running around.

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       They're like racks that are lit on fire and there's nothing you can do about it. You know, and it's, it's, it's a consequence of all the issues that are lurking beneath the surface of that speech act. That seemed to be something you can capture it on video. You'd say, well, here's what you said, there's a video tape recording them. It's like, no, that's not what you said, because the videotape does not capture the context and it can't, so you can't even get an objective record of the meaning of a conversation because the meaning isn't right in the conversation. So okay, so that's one of the problems. One of the problems with trying to validate moral claims is that you've got this insane contextual complexity that's almost impossible to dispose up and so you could say, you could even say that if person a did action a in situation a, that would be right and a person beaded action a and situation a that would be wrong and it depends on the person and so it's very easy to slip from that into a kind of moral relativism because how in the world do you deal with the complexity and how do you make a truth claim?

Speaker 1:          00:26:13       And so I would really say in some sense that's this intellectual situation in modern universities. Now, the other thing that's kind of interesting is this was actually discovered in a number of different fields simultaneously, so just as the literary theorists started to discover, say, after World War II that it was really, it wasn't enough to say that a book has meaning in it, that there's something wrong with that and that there isn't a single meeting. There's a multiplicity of meanings and it's not even a stable multiplicity of meanings. People were finding that out in in other domains as well. For example, in artificial intelligence where it became very, very obvious very rapidly that perceiving a simple object was not simple because objects aren't sample and the border between one object and another is in some sense arbitrary, right? I mean, when I look at each of you, I sort of see you as entities, right? But that's because I see you at this level of resolution. You know, your cellular masses at a different level of resolution, your molecular composites at a different level of resolution. There are 10 times you're made up of 10 times as many bacteria as cells at another level of resolution. So really you're more like an ocean, then you are like an entity and then well is it you or your family, that's the real or is it you, your family and your culture? What about your species or you know, or are you a mammal? It's like

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       all of those things and all of those things and any of those things at the same time. And so when I look at you, what am I supposed to see? You know, do I see individual with name or do I see ethnicity or dyc? Well, you get the picture. So object perception turns out to be extraordinarily difficult because things aren't just simple objects, even if they're relatively simple.

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       Alright? So

Speaker 1:          00:28:10       you throw up your hands, you think, well, how can there ever be any harmony? How can you draw any sense out of that? Okay, so that's the argument against drawing any sense out of it. But then let's, let's try the other tack. Let's see if we can make a case for there being some sense to the claims of, of that, that moral claims can be validated. Okay? So here's a question for you. If you took a bunch of chimpanzees that didn't know each other and you threw them in this classroom, what you would have is a war right now, you're roughly in that situation. Not exactly because, hey, you're not chimpanzees, but you know, your genetic material is quite reasonably related. Um, I mean, you only split off your common ancestor 7 million years ago and that seems like a long time in a day, but it's not 300 million years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       You know, it's still relatively recently from the evolutionary perspective here. You all are. You don't really know each other. You obviously share important elements of identity. So you're all students, but you can come in here and all of a sudden you all know what to do and no one, no one fights or if they do fight, it's, there are very constrained rules around the fighting and everyone accepts them. And it seems hard to say that that's not better than the alternative. So you know, unless you want to come in here and have an APP still chaotic

Speaker 2:          00:29:31       war.

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       So somehow we've managed to figure out how we can at least brings relative strangers together in a relatively high pressure situation because we were learning about complicated and challenging things and everybody gets along and everybody's kind of happy about that. So it looks like we can figure out patterns of behavior that. Well then the question is, are they correct, are they morally correct or they write or do they work? And then you might also ask yourself, well, what's the difference between all of those claims? Is there a similarity or difference between those claims? So, and then you might ask yourself, okay, so here, here's something else you might think about. So

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       let's say you're playing monopoly. How many of you have played monopoly in your life? Okay, is there anyone here who hasn't played monopoly? Excellent. A cultural universal. So I'm obviously in some ways it doesn't matter if you get all those little hotels right? Okay. But on the other hand, if you act like it doesn't matter while you're playing monopoly, then people hit you with things and they should. Because part of the rule is you're gonna act like this matters because if you don't, then it's not any fun. So you have to act like in Madison. Then it turns out that when you start playing it backs right, and people will actually, they'll get angry, especially if you achieved, you know, but people will play monopoly so they'll act as if the end point matters. And you might say, well, what is the end point? And one answer is to get all the hotels and all the money, so to enter the one percent, so you have all the wealth and no one has any and you win and you feel happy about that even if you're a radical left winger.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       So that's kind of interesting. And so, and uh, and then you say, well, that's not really the point. The point is to enjoy the game and you think, yeah, okay. That's probably the point too. Um, and then you might say, well that's not really the point either. It's like you want to, you want to know holding your negotiating skills. Do you want to spend some time with your friends? Like there's lots of things going on at once and so, but it doesn't really matter because monopoly is a game that you'll play. Okay? Now imagine instead that monopoly. Here's the new rule for monopoly.

Speaker 1:          00:31:52       All the people you're playing with can randomly steal your hotels and houses and your money whenever they want and you can steal it back. Okay, so then you think, well no one's gonna play that game, and then you think, well why not? Well, the first surface answers, that's a stupid game. Okay, but and you know that somehow you think that's a stupid game, but then you starting to think about, well why is that a stupid game? Or you might say it's not unplayable gate, which would be a little bit more sophisticated. It's like why? Why would that not work? And you might say, well what's the point in getting the hotels if someone can just take them, but you might say what's the point? And getting the whole deal is anyway. It's like, who cares about the damn hotel? It's, it's a bit tricky. There's something about the randomness of the, of what's now allowed and the unpredictability of it and the arbitrary nature of it and its lack of a relationship with your own actions that takes all the motivational impotence out of the gate.

Speaker 1:          00:32:53       So one thing we might think about to begin with is there's a difference between a good game and a bad game and there's also a difference between a game and no gate and we don't know what the difference is exactly, but there is a difference and then we might even say, well, not only are there good games and bad games, but some good games are better than other games. How many of you have played settlers of Catan? Okay. Is that better than monopoly or worse? It's better. It's anybody think it's not better? Okay. Why is it better?

Speaker 3:          00:33:31       What's better about it? It's more complex and heard what you said. We're not necessarily stealing, but there's a piece of the gay whether it was or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:33:44       Yeah, there's a robber.

Speaker 3:          00:33:46       Place him on one of the titles.

Speaker 1:          00:33:49       Again, you can mess with people essentially. So that's fun. It is just like, I'm going to get you with this, Robert. It's more akin to like real life, I think. Like in monopoly. No, that's reasonable. That's reasonable. That's reasonable. It's also got a strategic element. How many of you played risk? Okay. Settlers of a Katana risk settlers. Who says risk to risk to risk diehards. What about the rest of you? How many for risk? How many first? Settlers of Catan. Okay. Okay. So well, settlers of Katana is quite a bit like risk because it has a strategic element. Right? And there's a territorial expansion that goes along with it and there's also trading, which is one of the things that's nice about monopoly and about risk. Okay. But so you can see that you have intuitions about what constitutes a better game and part of the way that you develop those intuitions is not exactly philosophically because I doubt if you really thought through white settlers of Cape Town is a better game say than risk or monopoly.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       For those of you that think it is, but you aren't your own reaction and your own reaction is something like, well, I'd rather play settlers of kc tap and you might ask yourself why, but you don't have to. You can just rather play it and then so what? And then you think, well, what does it mean that you'd rather play it and you'd say, wow, it's more fun. It's more enjoyable if asked voluntarily, that's the one I would pick, but you don't really know why apart from those reasons, but obviously those are complex. That's a complex social engagement. Those games that are complex and and in fact they're so complex that you can have preferences and not even know why. Now that's interesting and I think the idea that there are games, good games and bad games and games, a non games is a nice way of starting to conceptualize what the difference might be doing between moral systems because the game is actually a moral system, right?

Speaker 1:          00:35:49       It, it, it has a point. It has an end. You have to cooperate and compete to, to run through the gate. So awhile back, a psychologist actually started this and and, and it's reprehensible, but psychologists have done lots of reprehensible things and this is one of them, he this psychologist whose name I don't remember that moment was reviewing the literature on the difference in aggression between boys and girls and men and women and boys and men are much more aggressive depending on how you define aggressive than girls and women. Now that tends to be mostly true with physical aggression. So you might say kicking, hitting, biting, punching, stealing, two year old boys for example, the ones who do two year olds, the ones who do most of that, or boys now, the two year old girls are a kind of each other up behind their backs, but no one measures that. Right? And so you find, for example, with female aggression, it tends to be relationship savaging and you see that on the, in the playground, you see it in junior high, you see it in high school and you see it on the net. It's always the same thing. So whether men are more aggressive than women is, depends on how you define aggression. But men are more physically aggressive anyways. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       a while back there was this idea that maybe we could dampen down to male aggression by socializing little boys, more like little girls. So, and, and one of the offshoots of that was the idea that we should only allow children to play cooperative games. Now, the first thing you might notice is that anything you've ever done that was a game was not cooperative, right? Like it's not a game if it's just cooperative. But then the other thing you might notice is that the distinction between a cooperative in a competitive game is far more sophisticated than people who come up with those dimwitted theories about how to improve the world, whatever. Appreciate. So here's an example.

Speaker 1:          00:37:47       Hockey game. Yes. Is it an aggressive gate? Is it a competitive game? Is it a cooperative game? Ha. Why? Why is it a cooperative game together? Right? So there's the team, right? So you're obviously cooperating with your team members, but you're also maybe trying to be the best player, but you're also trying to be the best player in a way that doesn't irritate the hell out of your team players. Right? Because that's actually, there's something about that that's counterproductive. Like even if you're a good player, if you're a prima donna and you hug the park, say, and you know, you know, maybe you're not interested in the development of your other team members. Like you're not a good player even if you're the most talented. So there's definitely a cooperative element. Is there a cooperative element beyond that? Well, yeah, you have to all agree to sort of cooperating in so much as um, you know, agreeing to the rules of the game and playing with it.

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       You don't bring a chess board or basketball right now, no matter if you're on different teams, right? Because you're all there to play hockey. So just to play hockey as a cooperative endeavor, because think of all the other things you could be doing instead of playing hockey at that time, you could be doing an infinite number of other things. So really if you look at the relationship between cooperation and competition in any collaborative human affair, things are usually competitive at one level, cooperative and another competitive at another. Like there's this continual interplay between competition and cooperation and you can't disentangle them. Now, one of the things that Piaget said, which Piaget's is, for those of you who don't own you probably all do now, is perhaps the foremost developmental psychologist of the 20th century, even though he didn't think he was a psychologist, um, piaget actually made the claim the radical claim that two year olds for example, and this isn't Psj is clean, but if it's associated, if you put groups of people together and their age matched.

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       So you got a group of nine months olds, say one year olds, two year olds, three year olds, four year olds, all the way up to 18, and you just throw them in a room maybe with some things for them to do, and then you count the number of violent acts which is kicking, hitting, biting or stealing. Okay. Two year olds, they're the most violent human beings and most of them are actually aren't violent. There's a subset of them that are violence, about five to 10 percent of them. Now almost all of those are boys. And then if you track those boys across time, over the next two years, most of them become civilized and the ones that don't never become civilized. And then so they're kind of antisocial throughout their childhood. And then when testosterone kicks in at about 14 and all the boys get antisocial again, they catch up to the always antisocial boys. And then the normal boys taper off quite dramatically at around 19 and flattened right out by about 27. But the antisocial boys, they just keep being antisocial. So now piaget noted that there was a dramatic transformation in,

Speaker 1:          00:40:48       in, in, in behavior or individual behavior in relationship to the social world between the ages of two and four. And if you watch two year olds play together, he said that what they did fundamentally it was like a parallel play. So maybe there's one, two year old there and another two year old there and that two year old is playing truck and this two year old is playing ambulance or something or maybe playing doll and they're sitting with each other and maybe they interact a little bit, but they're not playing the same game. Okay. So, so what they're doing in some senses, they're engaged in a goal directed activity. It and it has a point and they're trying. They're sort of integrating all their interior subpersonalities in sense in a way that allows them to play a single game with themselves. You know? And that's pretty complex from a cognitive perspective, right?

Speaker 1:          00:41:40       Because it means there's not, they're not fractionated and they're not being pulled out by hunger or anger or sadness or fear or any of those things. And they're doing something that's highly complex cognitively and they can make an organized themselves well enough to do it for a substantial period of time. So it's like it's a major developmental advance, but they can't do it with another person. Now, one of Piaget's hypotheses was that they couldn't do it do. They couldn't play the same game with another person without actually setting up a competitive structure so that actually compete. Competition was a prerequisite to cooperation. And so the idea was, okay, so if you watch how kids do this, you can get a sense of it. I mean on the one hand, maybe they, they all get together and they decided to play tag. Okay? And everyone knows the rules for tag and you can win at 10, but without the point, the point in some senses, the construction of a dominance hierarchy of competence, right?

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       Someone wins. And then there's the people who are sort of second best and third best and everybody's really into doing that. You all have to get together. If your kids and you say, well what should we do? And then he decided we're going to play tag. And then you set up the rules because there's infinite variations of tag and then everyone goes off in place and so it's a competitive game because only one person can win or maybe one at a time can win. But once you've all agreed on that, well then you're cooperating. So, so that's quite interesting in Psj regarded that as necessary stage in the development of the ability to act like a social creature. And then. And so here's, here's something that happens if you're not a very popular kid. So let's say for kids that are playing jacks good enough, I don't think kids play jacks anymore, but whatever, if they were playing jocks, they're are sitting there playing jacks and when you play jokes, you bounce a ball and you pick up a jock and manage that and the ball because you manage that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:32       Then you drop the ball and you pick up to Jackson, you grew up the ball and you keep going up to like eight jacks or whatever. So now another kid wants to play Jacks and we'll say this is a relatively popular kid. And so the kids sidles up to the group that's playing and sits down because they're all sitting down and then watches and then maybe starts making jack playing motions are a couple of comments about how the Jac game is going and then maybe the other kids don't have to disrupt what they're doing very much and they can kind of open the circle and let that kid scoot in and then he gets to her, she gets to play Jacks to whereas a kid that doesn't. And that often doesn't happen. Even if it's a popular kid, sometimes the little group that's already formed won't open.

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       And let the man you've been at cocktail parties. It's exactly the same thing, right? It's exactly the same thing. She was supposed to hang around the edge of the conversation and maybe if you've got something that isn't too stupid to say you can offer it, then maybe they'd let you in. Right? So, okay, so now if you're not very social, what you do is you stand out there and you don't notice what the hell's going on and you don't start to match your body to what's happening. And maybe you say, I know want to play Jacks, that's a stupid game. Let's go do something else. In which case the kids are not happy with you and your unpopular and that's that you're stuck with it. Because if you got that by the time of year for about the other kids are going to leave you so far in the dust, you're never going to catch up.

Speaker 1:          00:44:53       Okay? So, so what have, what have we concluded from that? We might conclude that people play games. There's lots of different games. Um, there's lots of different playable games. There might even be an infinite number of playable games. There's a lot of non playable games. Those are the ones that aren't any fun. And there's a lot of interactions that aren't games. Okay? So we can all accept that. And then we've added to that the observation or the presupposition that the ability to play games is a prerequisite for being socialized. So being able to operate together with people and that that operation has elements of competition and elements of cooperation reasonable. And then you might say, well, everything people do communally has a game like aspect, and you might say, well that's actually why kids like to play games because kids play games because games are a simplified analog of life.

Speaker 1:          00:45:47       And if you get good at playing games, well what happens is the games you play become increasingly complex and more and more real world, like until they're actually indistinguishable from acting in the world, but they're even then they're still games in a sense because they could. The rules could be different. But then what? The rules could be different. But then you might think, well, are there things that couldn't be different? And yeah, there are some things. It's going to be cooperative, it's going to be competitive, there's going to be ruled. Everybody needs to agree on the rules. People have to want to play. This is something else piaget observed. It's bloody brilliant. He thought, well, how could you decide if one game is better than another? And that's a moral, let's say that it's a moral claim in a sense. Okay. But he wanted to narrow it down so that it was possible that it could be answered, and what he said was, okay, well imagine you have group a that are attempting to attain a goal and Group B that are attempting to attain a goal.

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       Both groups have agreed that attaining the goal is valuable. We don't have to argue about the value of the goal. We've settled that, okay, now we're going to make a further assumption, which is all things considered getting towards the goal with less effort, more enjoyment, and less trouble would be better. Okay. You have to take that as a given because it might not be. Sometimes something difficult is better, but well then you might say, okay, would people working voluntarily or involuntarily be more likely to reach that goal with less misery faster and more effectively? And Piaget's answer was, if you can get people to play the game voluntarily, you don't have to waste any effort on enforcement. No one kicks back. So the system is to be more efficient across time. Now that's, that's smart because he's gone, he's gone on way of conceptualizing what might constitute a better system.

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       Now it's grounded in subjective experience to some degree, less misery, more enjoyment. Um, but there's also a way of measuring it, which is also more efficient, you know, or it does what it's supposed to do with less noise and grief, less costs, let's say. Something like that. So that's, that's pretty smart. Okay. So then let's, let's make another. Well, hmm. How old do you think kids games are like, and I don't know what's happened to kids in recent years because their, their culture in some ways has been seriously disrupted by television and computers, but you guys are a lot younger than me. Did you play hide and go seek? Okay. Do you know ring around the Rosie? You know that? Do you know what that is? You don't know when you're on the road. So how many people don't know that that ring around the rosy pocket full of posies hotshot?

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       How shall we all fall down? Okay. How many know that? Okay, it's an English nursery rhyme. It's about the play. It's about the black plate by the way, and so that piece of dog role, that piece of Ryan has been around transmitted by the oral cultural children since the time of the black plague. And so a lot of co children's tradition is an oral tradition and a lot of the games that children play are passed along. My children, you know, adults might also teach them, but kids learn how to play hide and go seek. And how many of you played tag? Right? Ever. Anyone never played tag, right? So everyone plays tag. What, how would you conceptualize tag if you were a biologist? What do you think children are doing?

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       They're hunting, right? They're chasing things down. Obviously they're chasing things down now. Hide and go seek. Well that's a tougher one, but it certainly exploration. They're exploring the landscape, right? And they're matching wits against one another, but then they're also trying to see if, you know, do people like you enough to actually find you, which is a helpful thing to know if you're four years old. So anyways, children past these games down across, let's say across the centuries, and maybe tag is one of those games that you wouldn't even have to pass down. Children might just invented spontaneously with every generation like because you can more or less play tag with a dog, you know, I mean the dog doesn't quite get it but, but, but it's close. Okay. So. So there are some games that are, that are enjoyable and now so that they're, they're either transmitted and everyone learns some very rapidly or they're, they're so close to our nature that we can reinvent them.

Speaker 1:          00:50:10       And Tag I think is the classic example of that. So. So that's interesting too because what it means is that there are certain types of competitive and cooperative behavior. Those are elementary moral systems that are. They look like they're integral to our nature. Now. You could even say they're built right or you could say there are so close to built in that it doesn't take much of a introduction to the rules of the game before. Everybody's pretty happy with it. And you know, you see this with a lot of things. You play peekaboo with a baby. Okay? So what are the rules? What are the rules of peekaboo?

Speaker 2:          00:50:47       What's that?

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       You Go, you cover your eyes. He. Okay, so that's right. So you go like this. Okay. Then what's the next rule? That's right. You reveal your eyes. You don't just sit there like this. Now you know you can play a trick on her baby if you want. And babies will laugh about this sort of thing, which is really, I think really quite amazing. The baby's laugh is something remarkable to me. So you can go like this and then like this and then like this and then like this. And then you can do this new baby will laugh because that's, that's a little variation. A or you can go like this,

Speaker 1:          00:51:25       right? And then the baby, while even that'll even make you guys can see how deeply rooted this is. So you know, but eventually one of the baby do it. They'll grab your hands, right? Pull them down because you're breaking the dam rules. Maybe knows the rules. Even though you've never established any rules and you can get the rules going with about five reps, right? You say, okay, this maybe no one's ever play peekaboo with the baby and the baby figures it out right away, this, this, and then you're very that. Maybe do that. That baby thinks that's a hell of a good joke instead of down. And so it's variations within this rule bound theme. It's kind of like musical in the sense, right? It's variations within the theme. Now what you don't do is go because the baby, that was your shortage right now, so you don't do that unless you're, you know, last year haven't evil streak.

Speaker 1:          00:52:20       So there's certainly ways of violating the baby's expectations and what the baby will do. If you do that as startle and they started with their whole bodies and then look at you and then probably they'll burst into tears, but some babies will just laugh, like mad if something like that happens. And you can find those babies all over youtube. You get the baby, the mother's sneezes and the baby has a fit laughing for like 10 minutes, you know? So it's quite interesting, like one of the things about babies I've never been able to understand is the staggering sophistication of their senses of humor, like and it's like it's deeper because even a nine month old baby can play tricks on you. So you know, their baby tricks but still their tricks and they laugh and you know, they're quite comical and they liked variation. So anyways, the point is point.

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       One of the points of all this is these, these, this understanding of game like structures is really, really, really, really, really, really deep inside of us. And it's way before articulation. You know, Arctic, it's way before we can say the rules. Babies can pick up the damn rules right away and it's kind of a dance. Some sense. And the dance is also a rule bound structure. Like if you're dancing with someone, well there's rules like don't step on their feet, but you also set up a set of expectations in the dance and then you violate them in tandem. And if you can do it gracefully then it's fun. You know, and, and maybe the person you're dancing with, configuring out if you were an absolute Klutz and you know, civil autistic that you can't even get outside of yourself and might make a half reasonable partner or if it's just hopeless so, but the dance is the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       It's not negotiated verbally. It's negotiated bodily and unless we were able to imitate and imitate insanely well because human beings can imitate like mad, we wouldn't be able to do that. And so babies are the same way. You basically start, you don't actually. Peekaboo doesn't have rules because a rule is a stated description of a set of expectations. What, what peekaboo has his expectations and repetition and you can violate the expectations, but that doesn't mean you're breaking the rule because the expectation is not a rule. It's not a rule until you observe the expectation. You describe what it is and maybe you even write it down and you can play games long before, long before you can follow rules. And one of the things piaget observed is if you take kids, if you watch a bunch of kids playing a complicated game like marbles in, they're like six and you take them out of the game and you ask them what the rules are, they can't tell you or they may be get some of them right in a bunch of them wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       Maybe if you interviewed every child that was playing and you looked at the commonality of description, you could extract out the underlying rule structure of the game. But the kids don't know the rules, what they know is how to play with other kids when they're playing marbles. And a lot of that's, you know, nonverbal Hanson eyebrow raises and no, you can't do that and so forth. And it isn't till much later that they can tell you the rules if ever. So like, you know, you guys can't tell me the rules for dancing successful with someone. You can tell me some stupid things you shouldn't do, but you imagine how complex it is. It's very, very difficult to articulate the whole structure. But you can sure tell when it's happening. And you can sure tell when you're not doing it or maybe your partner isn't. So partly what that also means is you know how to do things that you don't know how you know how to do and you know how to do all sorts of things that you don't know how, you know how to do in fact most of what you notice like that.

Speaker 1:          00:55:48       And so that also means that we can be playing games that are extraordinarily sophisticated and that maybe are rooted way back in history that we don't understand. But that doesn't mean that we can't describe. At least we don't have an articulated knowledge of the structure, but we could still play them. Now, I don't know if you know this or not, but you might know it a while back 20 years ago about that, those massive online multiplayer games started to become popular. And uh, you know, some of them I think although I don't know this for sure, some of them lasted a long time and maybe some of them are still being played like the early ones, you know. So they developed entire worlds in there. And you know, um, there was an economist who became quite famous because of those games. Castro Neva, I think his name was Edward Castronova, I think that's right.

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       But it's close. Anyways, he tried, he thought, hey look man, those are games, those are countries. And so one of the things he tried to do was to calculate their gross national product and you know, you can trade items in those little worlds, right. And you could, you could sell them on Ebay for example. And for awhile in this one game and maybe there's still happens, there were young people in the Philippines who are working inside these games, making artifacts that they were selling on Ebay to other game players because they could make more money doing that than they could actually working in the actual world. Well, so Castronova I think what's his name said? Well you don't get it. That is the real world. Like that's not a game or if it's a game, it's so much like the world that it's part of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:57:29       And so he calculated the gross national product of some of these massive games and they were like, the 30th richest country in the world was insane, you know, and so that's interesting because that also shows you that the line between a game and reality is not clear. So here's another example of that. It's something we're thinking about. Um, some of you have no doubt played very complex multiplayer online games and I suppose those more often those are adventure games or quest games and you have to communicate with other people and you have to solve problems and you have to, you know, maybe you have to defend yourselves. It's like you're an exploratory party in a new world, something like that. And so it's pretty sophisticated now. Okay. And some of you have worked at Mcdonald's or another fast food restaurant. How many of you have worked at a restaurant?

Speaker 1:          00:58:18       Okay. How many at a fast food restaurant? Okay. Would you say that an online game is more like the world or less like the world then your job at a fast food restaurant or more? It's more. Can anybody disagree? Okay. Why is it more like the real world complex stuff, but what are you doing? You're exploring, you're thinking, you're getting out of situations. You always, every new situations coming up and you're dealing with them and you're learning a fast food, right? You're a real car. Get fast food and the sheet, right? Yeah, but it's in the real world. Is it a gate and more like a machine. Right, right, right, right. So, so does that mean that McDonald's is less real than a multiplayer online game?

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       Well, it's a tough one a because when you're trying to think about what real means is, you might think maybe I phrased that wrongly, I maybe I could say, is Mcdonald's a worst model of the real world than a multiplayer online game? And it's too hard because it's hard to say that dogs is part of the real world. So like a priority to claim is kind of absurd. It's like, well, you're in a building. People actually come there, they give you money, it's real. But then when all you think about these complex games and you think, well, you're practicing and extraordinarily sophisticated forms of social and intellectual behavior and we actually don't know what that does to people. Maybe it makes them extraordinarily sophisticated than social. I do think that it helps with introverts quite a lot, you know, cause the introverts, it's harder for introverts to become extremely socially fluid because people were the mount.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       But a lot of introverts do a lot of heavy duty socializing on the net. And my experience has been that it's, you know, all things considered, it's probably a plus rather than a minus. Um, with regards to your, your use of computational devices because you grew up, grew up with them. One of the things I used to see my kids doing is they would sit together in the group, they were teenagers and there'd be a bunch of their friends that were there and while they were interacting with all their friends who were there, they are also interacting with all their friends who weren't there. Is that a common thing for teenagers to do? Tech state. You're texting your friends that aren't there and so forth. Is that reasonably standard behavior? How many of you have done that? Okay. How many? How many have you done that regularity? Okay. How many of you haven't done that? Okay. Okay. So most people have done it, but no one. Everyone. For those of you who have done it, is that more advanced or less advanced social behavior. Okay. You think more? Why?

Speaker 3:          01:00:58       Because I'm like you're keeping your friends while they're not there. Okay. Have a conceptual idea of like what you're doing and like understand where the dynamics are moving without them actually having to be there.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       Okay. Do you think that you paid a price for it in the decrease of the intensity of the social interactions you were having with the people who were actually there? You don't think so. You think, okay, how many people think they do pay a price for it? Okay. How many people think they didn't? Okay. Okay. So. Okay, so, well let's start with you guys then because you're in a minority. So why, why do you think you didn't pay a price for it?

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       Oh, okay. Well, I think that can pay a price, but if you're doing it correctly then you're monitoring the conversation that you're currently taking part of, you know, when it would be appropriate to your phone and text someone else, which actually meaningful probably paying more attention to the people you're talking about because you know, you're also having to monitor.

Speaker 1:          01:02:11       Okay. So that's your kind of taken a multitasking rationale for it. Some sense. Although assuming also that you have to your attention to manage that is there as people who, who didn't think that it was, that you did pay a price for who? Who thought that? Okay. What sort of price?

Speaker 3:          01:02:27       I think that especially with text gets lost, convey your feelings. Like there's so much more to.

Speaker 1:          01:02:38       Okay. So they certainly lose something. What about you while you're interacting with like your, your, your actual president, France.

Speaker 3:          01:02:45       I would say you have to commit to some certain amount of effort to, you know, writing the textbook, ignore like aspects of. So for example, if they're talking about something and then you texted them when you come back and miss like some.

Speaker 1:          01:03:00       Yeah. So, so it stopped. Started stopped, started. I don't think you can commit yourself. One of the things you've suggested was that some of that can be mitigated by doing it properly, which which implies that there's an emergent norm norm for doing this sort of thing and that if you're good at complying with the norm, then you're not going to be irritating people and maybe you can handle things at once. Something like that

Speaker 3:          01:03:26       to the people that are in there that's waiting for you to answer.

Speaker 1:          01:03:31       Well, I guess one answer to that would be that's up to them to determine like if they don't want a big part of it, then they could go do something else and the reason I'm saying that specifically is because you can imagine that that's how the norm develops. It's like obviously if a successful norm is going to develop that allows for text conversation and real world conversation, do current the same time everybody has to want it to happen and so that means that you can't do it in the manner that everyone wants. It's going to die out. Now, see, that's another example of, of the sea. That's another example of how you can start thinking about how moral structures might I think evolve is the right way of thinking about them because I think moral structure has evolved and I think they're just as real as anything else that evolves.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       Now evolved things can be staggeringly complex, right? I mean just think about how many life forms there are and how many different niches there are for those life forms and so you have in some sense an infinite variety, but it's not infinite and it follows patterns. Not just any old thing can be alive and not just any old thing can be social. So here's an example. I found this out a while back. I did a lot of neuro biological research. Some of it hands on, lot of conceptual, especially in the early days of my graduate work and I got really interested in the function of Serotonin and you know, you all know undoubtedly that one of the things that antidepressants do is decrease the rate at which Serotonin is pulled back up into the neurons that deliver it. And that seems to help stabilize people's negative emotion.

Speaker 1:          01:05:10       Makes them less full of tile, less anxious, less likely to withdraw, and so, or you could say it makes them more confident. Now we also know that if you look, say at a chimp hierarchy, um, if you take bottom chimp and you give him antidepressants, then he starts acting more like talk chimp. So because the bottom champ, the bottom chimps world is a very dangerous place. It's very uncertain. He doesn't have a very good place to sleep. He doesn't have high quality mates, he doesn't have good things to eat. He stressed man, it's bad down there. And so maybe that's part of the reason his nervous system is tuned so that he's more anxious and upset by everything because everything actually is more dangerous. Part of that's modulated by Serotonin. Okay? So here's a rough rule. If there's a hierarchy in an animal kingdom at, as you move up the hierarchy, your serotonin levels increase and as you move down the hierarchy or serotonin levels decrease and that's somewhat independent of your absolute wealth.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       So here's the famous experiments called the Whitehall experiment, and it was done on English bureaucrats. And the thing that's so cool about the white doll experiments as they were done 50 years apart, and so what they showed basically was so imagine you take a English bureaucracy and you stratify it by position, you know Englishman or hierarchical and so you stratified by position, you have the top people in the bottom people, and then you look at the death rates and what you find is the bottom people die faster and more often now you might say, well that's partly because if you're not that healthy, you end up at the bottom fair enough. But there seems to be an effect over and above the effect of just general health. It's worse to be at the bottom that at the top. Okay. That was true 70 years ago and then the study was done again 50 years after that.

Speaker 1:          01:06:55       Now the thing that's so cool, it's been by that time, from a material perspective, the people who are at the bottom of the modern hierarchy, we're at least as wealthy roughly speaking as the people who are like two thirds of the way up 50 years before. Right? Because you know everybody had running water. That's a good thing. Everyone, everyone, everyone had enough heat for the winter, you know, everyone had shelter and so on, so you know when you figure with regards to, well, once you've got running water, reliable shelter, heat and maybe air conditioning. If you live in the desert and you're not hungry, it's like you've got 90 percent of what wealth can deliver. Oh really? All things considered. The rest of it is status and luxury items, but this, the relationship between positional status and death rates remain constant, so that's. That's very interesting and we know that that's true from a lot of other studies as well.

Speaker 1:          01:07:55       It's like control for absolute wealth. There's still a problem with hierarchy and that seems mediated, at least in part by Serotonin and serotonin regulates negative emotion and the more negative emotion that you experienced, the more cortisol you produce. Cortisol and high levels is toxic and it suppresses your immune system so your brain gets damaged and you. You gain weight and you get diabetes and maybe develop Alzheimer's disease and you're more prone to cancer and heart disease. And all of those things, and so that's just not so good now that that serotonergic mechanism is really old and so you can give Serotonin, new Jack injections to unhappy lobsters and cheers them right up at least behaviorally speaking. If they're defeated in a fight and you give them a serotonin dejection, they'll stand up tall, confident, and they'll fight again. Now the reason I'm telling you that for a very specific reason, because one of the things we've been asking about as well, how might you conceptualize moral systems and then how might you conceptualize their evolution. And one of the propositions was there are playable games and non playable gates. Well, here's a playable game dominance hierarchy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:07       We've been playing it for $400, million years. It's stable now. It's, it's, it's so unstable that even lobsters have them, but even worse, it's so stable that the biochemical systems that the lobsters used to act within the dominance hierarchy and react to. It's the same as it is in us. And so not only is that stable, it's, it's, well, it's ridiculously stable. So one of the things we could say is, well, one of the games that seems emergent and real is a dominance heart. Well then we might ask, well what exactly constitutes a dominance hierarchy? And then we might also ask, well, what constitutes a highly functional dominance hierarchy versus a dysfunctional dominance hierarchy and even what does highly functional versus dysfunctional meet while we have to define all those terms, but we will as we move forward. But you see the point I'm making is that there, and this is a bit of a contradiction with the initial statement, I need that there is a tight distinction between the scientific world in the objective world because I'm also talking about the evolution of games and you know, evolution, the study of evolution is obviously a scientific study and the dominance hierarchies a biological phenomena, but in some sense it's also a game and it's also a moral structure.

Speaker 1:          01:10:30       So there are levels of analysis where these things start to get tangled together and that's partly what we're going to try to sort out. So, um, we'll do that in the future because it's very, very complicated.

Speaker 2:          01:10:44       Alright,

Speaker 1:          01:10:47       now we're going to step back a little bit. Fact, we're going to take a break.
