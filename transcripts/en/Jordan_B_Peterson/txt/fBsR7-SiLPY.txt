Speaker 1:          00:00:00       These are stopping Jordan Peterson.

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       Thank. Are there differences between men and women? Yes. Perfect.

Speaker 1:          00:00:27       So the first thing I've noticed, and I actually mentioned this at the University of Toronto, the baby with someone who was thinking about this for quite a while and there was an overwhelming majority of men in the room at the University of Toronto and if you look around you'll see that it's probably running, I wouldn't say about 1910 and that's remarkable because there are more women than men in universities now and so it's been quite interesting to me to see the public parks. The vast majority of people are also the people that are watching on youtube. It's about 90 10 as well. I'm not exactly sure why that is. Although I think maybe that nobody is actually speaking to, you know, maybe I'm doing a bit of that and I will say that's probably also really good for women because men aren't doing very well. You can be sure that women aren't going to do very well because as it turns out, you actually meet each other.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       So anyways, I don't need to start again. I guess talking about bills, she's 16 and I know I made some videos back at the end of September. I suppose most people you know that one of them, unless I'm expressing my concern about a piece of legislation at the federal level called Bill Sixteen and it was boring to do, was to add gender expression and gender identity to the list of protected groups, predictability to the relevant human rights legislation and also making it harassment and discrimination, something intentionally addressable under the hate crimes, permission of the criminal code on a surface of it very skirt, shorter bill wasn't turns out on the surface it looks, although it's very bad with formula, the first major errors of course the gender expression, which is fundamentally fashion choices defined onto her human rights conditions, websites. It's how you present yourself, how you present yourself in terms of your clothing and your fashion and your hair and makeup and that sort of thing in day to day activity.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       It's shouldn't be too unreasonable walked out with it. That does not constitute a group and I'm actually a bit of a stickler when it comes to language. I think especially when we're making legislation that we should be laws that say exactly what they should say and nothing else, and since gender expression is not approved, it strikes me as very difficult to determine exactly how it's going to be added as a group to the protected groups under the relevant to human rights. But more than that, um, it's, it's quite self. It's quite almost, and I've talked to a number of people about this, so I know it's not just my imagination then bill [inaudible] and legislation like it are going to be interpreted in light of the policies that the Ontario Human Rights Commission has developed a, the urine absolutely incoherent set of palsy, never seen one. And that's why the, the first video, the second video I made because University of Toronto and its wisdom, the HR and equity people decided that it was okay to force their employees to undergo mandatory anti unconscious bias training.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       Which is something I have a big problem with given that you can't diagnose someone's unconscious bias first of all. And even if you couldn't, there's no evidence whatsoever that unconscious bias retreading will help. And find them, there's no reason whatsoever by your employer, no matter who they are, should be messing about with the fundamental perceptual structures of your, of your psyche, especially when they're looking at things that aren't even volunteered. So it's appalling on multiple dimensions. And one of the things I would seriously recommend to all of you is that if anybody starts to suggest that you need to undergo mandatory retraining through your unconscious racial biases, that if you go along with that, you're immediately admitting that you're the sort of biggest who needs to be retrained. And I would think very carefully about admitting them because first of all, it's possible that it's not true.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       You know, I mean, people carry with them. Every carries with them, certainly in the, in group preference. That's quite common. What exactly that means in terms of their overt behavior. Uh, proclivities is completely undetermined by the relevant science. And there's absolutely no excuse for social psychologists to be putting forward tests like the implicit association task which purport to measure unconscious bias as a diagnosed against them because they don't have the validity and reliability that we put forward as such. In fact, if you are a clinical psychologist and you were using tests that sort of to diagnose individuals, you'd be in violation of the statutes that are governing private practice. So I have my reasons for objecting to these studies. Now. What I really don't like about bill see 16 and its surrounding policies is that it's. It's putting into our law a sequence of presuppositions that actually happened to be false and it was me and pointing out that they were false.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       That's got me in whatever trouble I've been in and generate the accusations of such things as Trans Phobia and racism, which are. I don't know how racism got into the picture at all because. Because I complained about the insane individuals who are running black lives matter Toronto. Then I have, since I'm not a racist, I don't care if you're black or breathing if you're crazy. I've never made the point that you're crazy to people who run the black lives matter are really reprehensible individuals and so I was objective to that. I don't see how that makes racist with regards to being a transport. First of all, I object to the terminology because phobia has specific terminology, which is partly why also object to the word luck, Islamophobia, because phobia is a medical term and you don't just get to pull in medical terms, uh, away from their proper context and apply them to those people whose political opinions you don't happen to agree with misuse of language.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       It's misuse of medical terminology. And I would also like to tell all of them, just so you know, that there are a number of. First of all, there aren't that many transsexual people in the world. There aren't that many in Canada. So whenever you hear from any of them, it's actually a reasonably substantial portion of the overall population. There are a lot of videos on youtube put up like transsexual people, including the person I talked to you in Vancouver. His name is Tara Meyer who, who stayed quite vociferous with that. They don't agree with any of the, uh, of the activist. The trend is that the so called Trans activist political agenda that's being put forward as hypothetically representative of their approval. First of all, they're not a group. The fact that you happened to have a, what would you say, gender dysphoria or, or an indeterminate gender identity does not make people a margin to screw.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       It certainly doesn't. It doesn't situate you such that some member of your group or some so called ally, let's say, can stand out and stand purport to speak for you on mass as if you were a, a modular scrutiny as completely nonsensical. I mean, you can talk to a man and assuming that he speaks for all man, man, you can't tell. Talk to a black woman and have her say that she speaks for all black women and inserting the can stand up and say that because you're a transsexual, you speak for all transexuals department. Why? We have the idea of legitimate representation for people to legitimately represented a group. They have to have some legitimacy. Perhaps they have to be elected. At least they have to pull the people that are purporting to represent because he can just come up and say it. It's inappropriate on after receiving 30 letters from transsexual people and then 29 and the more positive and I can tell you why with regards to what I've been doing, I can tell you why the first is they're not very happy with, uh, the idea that they're being represented by these noisy activists groups because they don't regain at each individual because these are all individuals who wrote me saying that they're not happy about being represented.

Speaker 1:          00:08:22       They're not having because that isn't how their political view of the world actually helps to lay itself out. In fact, most people were turning sexual, are perfectly happened, for example, with the pronouns he and she, they just want to be called the other one. And so the people who are, who want the gender neutral pronouns, pronouns say, I don't know, a very small minority of a very small minority. It's hard to say how many of them are, but the idea that they're somehow valid representatives of the whole group is observing. They're also not very happy because they believe that, that that because this has become such an issue, there are actually likely to face more prejudice rather than less prejudice, you know, because generally what people want, regardless of whatever kind of visible minority status they might have, what most people want is to live relatively peacefully and invisibly among other people.

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       And so then whenever a political movement comes out to exaggerate or or, or otherwise draw attention to the reporting differences, there's real danger in that. So I'd like to put to rest the idea that somehow the transactive as to who are accusing me of all the things that are accusing me of are somehow more legitimate representatives of transsexual identity and, and that say well being than I am. I don't believe that for a second. I've dealt with all sorts of people in my life more than more than most people. That you'll need that for sure. Big Span, different sort of person. You can imagine that I worked hard to make all of their lives better regardless of their, of their particulars, of their identity. And so to cast me as an enemy of, of, of, of an identifiable group, I believe is completely observed them. I think I can be confident in stating that too because I have the good fortune of having about 500 hours of my public statements to university students online.

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       I tape everything now. Everything that will say to students, pretty much, you know, at least in the classroom if there is anything even remotely reprehensible in any of that content and can be sure that someone would have called it out and put it on youtube with big exclamation points that are going to be called property to task for it. And none of that has happened at all. And the reason for that is that there isn't any of that. None of that exists. So I'm not saying that I'm completely without bias. You have to be a fool to say that, you know, everyone is biased in their perceptions to some degree. But that's, that's not the point. That doesn't mean you're racially biased or that you're racist. It means that you have your own particular viewpoint. And then that comes with with idiosyncratic St, St Lucy's and peculiarities of your character and your ethnic heritage and your race and your culture and all of that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       So I'm not going to say for a moment that I don't have my own viewpoint because I do, but I'm a certain things that, that their comments directed at me that you're trying to target with some, some of these half winded epithets that are continuing to direct it after you're completely without any standing whatsoever. So. All right, so let's go into the background that Bill [inaudible] and why I objected to it. So I looked at quite deeply into the legislation as it was originally formulated in Ontario. And that was the legislation that was designed to provide protection for people who, whose gender identities, let's say nonstandard. And the original legislation wasn't too bad, you know, it. It basically attempted to do perhaps what it should have if it was going to be reasonable and merely add, let's say the people who have a nonstandard gender identities to the list of protected groups.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       And they actually defined the known standard gender identity fairly carefully, but they shot the legislation out to activists groups and what happened was that by the time everybody and their dog, so to speak and have their shot at modifying the original terminology was absolute mess and it's an absolute mess now and I'm going to tell him why and also why it's dangerous. There first thing in the policies that surround those [inaudible]. There's a claim that's been instantiated law in Ontario and will soon be instantiated into law in Canada. Anatomy is and it's a technical and you need to pay attention to it because of the technicalities matter. So the claim is the biological sex, gender identity, gender expression and sexual proclivity very independently and that was a false claim. Now, that's actually what I said in the original video and that's why people originally and instill accused me of denying the existence of transsexual people.

Speaker 1:          00:12:56       There's no point in doing that because obviously transsexual people exist and they've existed for a very long period of time, but that has very little to do with whether or not biological sex, gender, identity, gender expression and sexual proclivity are independent and they are certainly not independent. They're not even close to a dependent. There are so highly correlated that the correlation is almost perfect. And, and these things matter when you put them into, into, into a legal framework. And so what's really happened is because the social constructionist types of lost the intellectual battle as the biological evidence for the grounding of identity has become stronger and stronger over the last 50 years because they've lost the scientific argument. They've taken the back door and they're trying to instantiate legally it's not gonna work because you can make false facts law. I mean you can hurt people by doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:46       You can cause all sorts of trouble, but it isn't going to work for any length of time. So let's take apart the client. First of all, the first thing is that biological sex and gender identity are actually different and you know you can make a case for that in a weak way because because there is quite a range of personality expression, let's say, and interests among people who have the same biological sex, so there are masculine limit, let's say, and there are feminine now and there's quite an overlap, although you can distinguish the janitors quite, quite accurately using nothing but personality information and interest so you can separate them even at the level where there is some similarity, but so you can make a weakened case for that, but it's difficult to make a strong case and the reason for that is that virtually every person who was biological sex is male, expresses themselves in mail or has an identity that's now.

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       It's only about one in 300 people for whom that I get the difference. Now you can say, well that's because the, the, the, the degree gender, what would you say? Amorphousness has been suppressed by sociological phenomenon. I suppose that's true to some degree, but it doesn't matter. It's still going to being a very tiny minority and he's narrowed to exceed more than one percent. I don't think so. What that means is that 99 percent of people at the same gender identity as biological sex, so how has that independent? It's the very opposite of independent, so it's wrong. It's a simple as that and then now that doesn't mean there aren't people who don't wear. Those two identities don't match and those are the transsexual people obviously, but two, to extract from that, the statement that those very independently is a intellectual sleight of hand and it's really been pushed forward by people who are radical social constructionists who believe that every single aspect of human identity is determined by culture and that was patently false and not only that, it's dangerous politically because one of the ideas that characterized the most reprehensible movements of the 20th century was the human beings can be molded in any manner possible by the state that we didn't have any intrinsic identity, that any sort and that were only creatures of coalition.

Speaker 1:          00:15:58       And that's not the case. There's a very distinct human identity, and I'll talk a little bit more about that as this progresses. Okay, so gender identity and biological sex do not very independent. That's the first thing that clamp as well, that's moved to gender expression. Well, you can address in any manner in what you can express yourself in a feminine manner, culturally speaking, if you're a male or you can express yourself in the mascot. Now culturally speaking, if you're female, but the truth of the matter is that the vast majority of people whose biological sex is male and whose gender identity is male, presented themselves in their fashion choices as male and the same can be said about females. So the notion that there's independence there is also interact. They can vary, but they don't vary independently. And finally, with regards to sexual proclivity, the vast majority of people who are male who a, who identify as a male who presented themselves as male, are also heterosexual.

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       And that doesn't mean that there are new people who are homosexual. The percentage varies, but it looks like it's somewhere between two and five percent or maybe between one and five percent depending on the statistics, but that means that at least 95 percent of people who are male who identify as male and present and present themselves as male are also heterosexual, so those four levels of analysis do not very independently and that's that. So the law is incorrect, it's badly formulated and it's poorly put forward and that's what I was objecting to. Now is worse than that as far as I can tell, because it's social construction is dale and the social infrastructure element is the insistence that all those things are culturally are culturally constructed and they're not. So let's do that. Let's review that a little bit. It's like elementary biology I suppose.

Speaker 1:          00:17:44       What's different between men and women? All right, well there's a variety of things. You know the classic human embryo logical for is female xx or x, y, and the males are a masculinized in Utero by testosterone. So that's the first difference. And testosterone exposure in Utero has quite profound effects on later on all sorts of phenomena. Psychological and physical, so for example, one of the things that higher levels of testosterone in Utero seem to predict is less interest in people that more interest in face and so, and that's been well documented research teams in the UK in particular, but, but in any case, so this Feminine Female Morpho the Standard Morphology is female, but it's translated into male, a male morphology by testosterone. And so then what do you get for standard morphological transformations while there's the evident genetic ones speaking technically a, obviously male and female genitalia differ substantially as you all know there are, there are, there is some variation in that, although it's very rare.

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       Um, and then there are also other differences that kick forward, especially when puberty hits and some of those are physiological and some of them are resectable. So one of the things that you see have you for example, is that there aren't very many, there aren't very large personality differences between boys and girls before purely doing with regards to negative emotion. So that's trading neuroticism for those of you who are interested in big five trait terminology. And so people who were high on neuroticism are more sensitive to anxiety and emotional pain and women are more sensitive than men to anxiety and emotional pain on average and the effect is massive. It's about a third to half a standard deviation, but it's massive enough so that if you look at the end of the distributions were the extreme and people are almost all the people who have extreme problems with anxiety and emotional pain.

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       Our window, it's running about four to one in terms of depression and anxiety disorder diagnosis worldwide and there's no evidence that that's cultural. Now on the other end of the spectrum, so to speak, there are male pathologies as well, so males are much more likely to manifest every social personality disordered. They're much more likely to be characterized by alcoholism and they're also more much more likely to manifest and attention deficit disorder and various learning disabilities. And so that also seems to be biologic dedicated to a large degree. So and interestingly enough, those differences, the personality differences between men and women with regards to trade negative emotion emerge up puberty while, while. Well, let's think about it for a minute. Now, these are speculations, but you can, you can think about that until you tell me what you think. I mean, they're reasonably grounded speculations, but um, I'm not certainly going to state them as fact, although I would say that the, the idea that these differences in personality between men and women exist, that's fast.

Speaker 1:          00:20:41       How powerful those different those differences are and precisely what they consist of is still subject to some investigation, but it's extraordinarily well documented. So what happens to men and men at puberty, while the men get bigger, they get stronger, especially in their upper bodies and human beings are quite impressive. Were prey animals as well as we're predators, as well as what are the, what are the ways that we defend ourselves aggressively is using the upper body strength. So we punch like Kangaroos. There's other evidence to do that. So, and we punched. And so what that means is that men are quite a bit more dangerous than women in say hand to hand combat. And that's an American actual actually a real problem. You see one of those, you see that manifest itself in part in a strange statistic because it will come as news to most of you, but why is it their husbands more often than husband see if their wives quite quite a lot actually, but it's.

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       It's a misleading statistic to some degree because women lack upper body strength. They can hit their husbands and they're not really going to hurt them that much. I mean there are men who are abused and neglected that, but one of the problems with having much harder at upper body strength is that if you hit some your life Bible to hurt them, and so a male aggression in the context of a dyadic relationship, physical aggression as much more likely to be dangerous or lethal than the female version of the same sort as part of the reason. I think that women are more likely to hit their husbands or wives more likely to interest us that the reverse is because both have wives and the husbands know perfectly well that the wife is going to hurt as much. So there isn't as much inhibition against the aggression.

Speaker 1:          00:22:16       Okay, so now what is it? What is it mean for women that men are stronger than them? Starting at puberty means that women are at a disadvantage in physical combat and that's part of the reason I think that their nervous systems make them more nervous or anxious and more susceptible to emotional pain is because the world is actually more dangerous for them. Now the world is also more dangerous for women's sexually. Now that self evident, I really think I have to explain that. I hope no one is foolish enough to try to disagree with that. Definitely the reason that sex is more dangerous for women than for men obviously because women can get pregnant and that changes. That changes their life completely. I mean, they may choose to have an abortion, but that in itself is no trivial matter and as soon as you have a child and that child is dependent on you, then your whole life is changed and in in more traditional societies, if you had a sexual adventure outside of the standard traditional structures and you ended up pregnant, now you are in serious trouble and so for women to be more anxious and more susceptible to the emotional pain because of their increased sexual vulnerability is perfectly reasonable.

Speaker 1:          00:23:23       Then the final reason I think that that women are more susceptible to anxiety and emotional pain than men is because.

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       Let me see now. I lost my train of thought for that. I'll have to come back to that for a moment. Oh yes. That's it. No, it's not obvious to me that women's nervous systems are actually actually serve to function in the best interest of women. I think that they actually serve to function in the best interests of women and infants because you think, do you think about our evolutionary past and for that matter are present? No, you're quite a different creature when you're single person, male or female, then you are when you're a female as an incident, especially the intent that's under the bolt hole on soul because human entrance are unbelievable. Know they're born in some sense of way before they shouldn't be in that. That's part of an evolutionary problem too because our hands are so fake that babies are. Babies have to be born very young compared to other mammals that are our size.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       Roughly speaking. The gestation period shouldn't be longer for human being. So because our heads are so big, the babies have to come under early and that makes them route relatively underdeveloped. Um, and so they need a tremendous amount of care. They're very fragile. And so it seems to be quite likely that women's nervous systems are optimized so that they're more threat sensitive and more sensitive to emotional pain because they have to be more responsive to infants and they have to take care of, especially in your most fragile state and happen to be in the first nine months. And I think that tilts women's nervous systems hard in the direction of what men might regard as excessive negative emotionality, but you have to be sensitive to threat and danger if you're going to have an infant because they're very, very fragile. So I think those are the reasons, and there's lots of other personality differences between men and women.

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       You know, I can give you a list of them and these are well documented it, so you might as well know about them. Um, there's not a lot of difference in men and women in terms of extroversion. Extroversion as a whole. Extroversion is roughly the dimension that bring in the dimension of personality that's associated with positive emotion. And extroverted people are gregarious and enthusiastic and assertive. They like to party. They like to have a good time. The social environment is their environment and extroversion breaks down into enthusiasm and assertiveness and women are more enthusiasm, which means that not only do they have more negative emotion than men, they also have more positive emotions. And so, um, so that's the positive emotion dimension. The negative emotion dimension is neuroticism, as I said, somewhat pleasantly named, I guess, but it basically index is anxiety and emotional pain, frustration, disappointment, grief, that sort of thing. All logo, the same dimension that breaks into volatility and volatility, volatility. People are rather irritable and and withdrawal and withdrawal are less likely to do things that are threatened and women are higher by about a third of the standard deviation in both agreeable. This is the dimension that men and women differ on the most and agreeable people and this is I think, the most fundamental dimension of matching it at that characterizes human being so agreeable. People are compassionate and polite and warm and kind and giving, but they're easy to. It's easy to take of

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       standing up for themselves and actually if you look at one of the things that predicts wage differential across time, male or female, there's more agreeable. People get paid less and the reason for that is that often salary negotiation negotiations, that zero sum and if and if you're not aggressive, you don't get paid because people aren't just going to give you money because they're going to be nice to you. That is not how it works. You generally have to fight for status and position and movement forward careers and in order to that, you'd have to take a relatively, I would say self centered attitude because they all sent in some sense the opposite. The opposite of being agreeable is to be self centered and I'm also not saying that in a particularly negative way. There's advantages to being self centered and to fight for your own territory and so and men are more likely to do that and you might say, well, what's your evidence that those differences in personality aren't culturally constructed and the evidence for that?

Speaker 3:          00:27:36       It's quite clear. You can go online, you look up the Scandinavian studies. Let's go online and look up gender differences in personality cross-culturally. You'll find the relevant studies. They've been done with tens of thousands of people and what they showed quite clearly is that in those societies where the most is being done to move, move to social world, into a position of radically quality, and so that would roughly be the Scandinavian countries because they've done more than that more than any other country. The personality differences between men and women maximize, they don't minimize, they maximize. And I'll say that again at in the countries where the most has been done to equalize the playing field between men and women. Men and women get more different rather than more of the same. So for all your social constructionists out there in the audience, and there's probably not that many of you because you wouldn't come in here and be talked to or social constructionist. You're actually wrong. Yeah. Well, and the thing is,

Speaker 2:          00:28:35       thank you. Don't

Speaker 3:          00:28:45       be. So. One of the things you might be interested in is that it's all the same to me in some sense, like when I was looking into this to begin with in this group started probably 25 years ago, looking at differences in personality between men and women, you know, it doesn't go at all whether they were fundamentally biological, biological are fundamentally associate, large boiler or mixed produced the differences, you know, no one knew and the most logical hypothesis really the ipod was that as unique as this society that men and women would become more of the same, but that is not what happened, and so we've actually looked the social constructionist hypothesis with regards to gender differences in insects and personality. We'll put that to the test and you're very intense way and the social constructionist viewpoint fail. So it's very strange because no one really believed that, right?

Speaker 3:          00:29:34       If you make this make society one of the same in men and women get more different. Sorry, what's up with that? Well, the answer seems to is that there's fundamentally two sources of variability in personality, right? There's perhaps more, but you can categorize them as roughly genetic and roughly sociological. Well, if you take out all the sociological differences between the landscape in which men, women are raped and all you have left are the biological and genetic differences so they maximize or that's exactly what happened. This actually matters. It really matters. And this is why the demands for equity or so. Well, there's 15 reasons why demands for equity. This is between men and women should not be overlooked. Partly because it's wrong to overlook the junior with differences between men and women. It's not good for the man. It's not good for the women. So one of the things you see in Scandinavia, for example, is there's an overwhelming preponderance of female nurses and there's an overwhelming preponderance of male engineers and actually the data on, on personality differences.

Speaker 3:          00:30:36       Um, there's, there's, there's the standard traits which I'll continue to go through. Um, I can do that quite quickly. There's no much difference in trait conscientiousness between men and women. If you break it down into the aspects, women are a bit more orderly than men, but there's no difference in industriousness. And then with regards to openness, which is the intellect, intellect, creativity, dimension overall, there's no difference between men and women, but if you break it up into the aspects, then the differences are actually quite pronounced. So what you have is the openness to experience is the technical trade and it roughly breaks down into something that's sort of like create creativity and aesthetic interests versus the interest in ideas. And what you see is that women are a third of the standard deviation higher than men in terms of, of creativity and aesthetic aesthetic proclivity, let's say, and men or month or the standard deviation higher than women in terms of interest in ideas.

Speaker 3:          00:31:31       And it's not a trivial difference and it makes a difference. So, but the biggest difference between men and women as it turns out, and this is almost one standard deviation, which is a walloping difference. You never see that in social sciences. And massive difference is um, difference between difference in interest and the masculine interests. Roughly speaking is in things. And then female interest, roughly speaking is in people. And that's what underlies the differences. Say in, in career choice preference between things like nursing and psychology and social work and that sort of thing and engineering and uh, because engineering is perhaps the most male oriented about the disciplines and the evidence that that's a sociological history period. Now I should also point out, because this is important, people have wondered for a long time if they, if the differences between men and women say with regards to the sciences and the engineering had anything to do with intelligence and the former prison department.

Speaker 3:          00:32:29       There is, summer's gone in terrible trouble at one point. In fact, I think he had to resign because he made a very technical claim and he said that if you look at the distributions of intelligence for men and women, imagine you have a normal distribution. Right? So almost everybody's at the average. There's some extremely, extremely intelligent people, but not very many. And there are some people who are very intellectually imperative. Not very many. If you map the distributions of many women onto one another, there's two hypothesis. One hypothesis, roughly speaking, is that they're the se and the evidence for that as is reasonable. I would say the other, the other theory is that the means are the same, the meaning is the same. So both men and women have an average Iq of 100, but the standard deviation is different. So it's larger amendment. It is in women.

Speaker 3:          00:33:14       And what that means is that if you're way the hell out into the hyper genius rates, they're almost all men. But also if you go away, they log into the range where people are incredibly intellectually impaired. They're also all men. And that's the increase male variability hypothesis. And you see increased male variability in and a number of different species, partly because men are more expendable than limit. And the reason for that, biologically speaking, the reason for that is that, well, you don't need that many men to impregnate a lot of women, but women need women. Women are a bottleneck with regards to reproduction. So every woman task, although not every man's house and, and that's true many, many species. And so you see more variability and male behavior because of that across species frequently. And um, that comes often added costs with increased male illness.

Speaker 3:          00:34:02       And you know, look at it guys, you're going to die. It's been eight years sooner than the typical woman and that's partly the price you paid for, for, for, for running, parking on testosterone because it's quite toxic over the long run. So men are men in do page for their, for their, whatever advantages they might have and they paid for that with the lifespan that's decreased by about 10 percent. It's a nontrivial disadvantage. But anyways, what Larry Summers said was, well, if the ICU distribution is flattering for men than for women, maybe one of the reason that almost all the outstanding men in science, technology, engineering and mathematics or mail is because it takes a genius level of Nike level of say 150 or a hundred and 60. And when you go way out on the distributions, when the distribution is different like that, then there's massive differences at bms.

Speaker 3:          00:34:48       Now he didn't say that was by the way he said that that was one possibility. And by the way, it is one possibility because nature doesn't arrange itself so that everything in presents to us is in keeping with what we would like to be true political, in fact, quite the contrary. Now I'm kind of agnostic with regards to that because I've looked at the data on both sides and I can. I don't think that we can make a determined them statement about the differences in science, technology, engineering, mathematics over representation of men on the basis of variability and intelligence. But I do think we can make the case in terms of interest because it is the case that the biggest differences between men and women are differences in interest. And the question is, well, do we have a problem with that? Because that really a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:35:34       Now you know, you couldn't. You could up your culture to eradicate those differences. You know, because you could make cultures very coercive. And so if you punched boys from the time they were born for being interested in things and insisted that they become more interested in people, then perhaps you could do that. It would, it would come at some cost. And you could do the same thing for girls, you could make them less interested in, people are more interested in things, but you know, to the degree that those differences are real and to the degree that they're actually bombed or grounded in biology, you're going to have to turn your society into something pretty damn too radical to produce those differences. So when you to do that, that makes you do, what do you want to do it? Is it not the big problem that men and women actually have different interests and this is read that biggest surprise.

Speaker 3:          00:36:21       Is that something that you want to eradicate? All right. So I also felt back to bill's scene. 16, okay. The policies surrounding it are incorrect and they're dangerous and they're dangerous partly because they are predicated on the insistence that all of these, these levels of analysis with regards to human identity associated with culturally constructed and they're not. And there's implications for that too because one of the things that this is happening, particularly with regards to the equity movements. So I'll define equity for you used to be quality and more opportunity, but it shifted to equity and in many universities now, like human resources department is human resources in their equity. They should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for that is. It is. It is absolutely appalling. It's reprehensible. I actually thinking, well, I want to say it. There's almost no political stance. It's more reprehensible than the stamps that demands equity. It's very informed and it's being tried very many times in very many places and the net result of pushing the equity from a political perspective was not good. And if people have any stats of 20th century history at all, the first thing they realized is that political systems based on the notion of equity become murderous very, very rapidly. And so

Speaker 2:          00:37:40       thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:37:49       So here's how you diagnose in an organization as racist and pathological. So the first thing you do is pick your key dimensions of identity and whatever they happen to be in the common ones are gender, race, ethnicity, sexual proclivity, fine, but there are enumerable, right? That's one of the problems is that you can continually in some of our people into groups and the groups are relevant and also, for example, if you were concerned with the representation, let's say of Hispanic women, are you going to be equally concerned about the representation of Hispanic women from economically deprived backgrounds and for rich backgrounds for privileged about reasonably going to Hispanic women into those who came through privileged and those who came from privileged backgrounds and further stuff divide them by. Well, how about attractiveness? How about that? How about wait, how about that? How about Iq? How about disability?

Speaker 3:          00:38:48       No, you can fractionating populations endlessly with regards to their group identity in it so that, that's one of the fundamental problems with the notion of equity just because you can never attain it because you can keep fractionating the groups and so you're not going to attain equity. But apart from that, let's say that you just start with the major categories, you know, um, gender, ethnicity, race and sexual proclivity, that's fine. So here's how you diagnose an organization to find out if the people who run it are unconscionably biased and prejudice. You look at the strategy of the organization, right? The power structure. Then you take each strata and you map it onto the demographics of the general population according to your particular way of breaking down that population. You have to keep in mind and if there's any lack of concordance between the general population and representation at each of those levels of the hierarchy, then you described the whole hierarchy as unconscionably a biased and racist.

Speaker 3:          00:39:45       It's like, well that's convenient except that it's wrong. And I mean, well, the thing is, you know, most organizations do have their share bikes for historical reasons and for and for reasons that are perhaps a lot more unseemly that historical reasons, but the idea that you can categorically state that every single difference at every single level of the hierarchy as a consequence of the racial bias and announcing the thoughts of everyone in the organization is absolutely appalling thing to think, you know, it's a multifaceted problem, right? Why are people represented differently in different organizations? While there's probably 20 reasons not what you can't just say, well, it's racism or it's prejudice. It's like, yeah, yeah, sure, yes. It's probably racism and it's probably prejudice, but that isn't the only reasons. There's lots of reasons and you have to do a differentiated analysis first of all, to understand understanding and then you have to be very careful not to mock about stupidly with the organization to make it worse than it already is, and so the idea, and let me go up the University of Toronto, her department is teaching.

Speaker 3:          00:40:48       It's just this straight out that's adequately. If they. If the organization doesn't produce a population equivalent outcome, then it's racist or sexist or whatever you want it to be. There's something wrong with it and then where's the that? Everybody in the organization needs to be reeducated. It's like, come on, that's just nuts. It's not sensible and well, no, these are not sensible. It's. It's downright dangerous. And so that was the other reason that I made the videos to begin with is because I don't believe that that's the least bit appropriate and I think it takes our society. Does your path, so all right, so let's. What else do I talk to you both? Oh yeah, so, so this was the last thing I was asked to about. So we're in a rather chaotic political period right now and as you may have noticed, that certainly manifested itself in the American election, which is still causing all sorts of preservations, but you can see the same thing happening in let's say in Europe for the time being, right?

Speaker 3:          00:41:49       What do you see happening? Roughly speaking is that the divide between the left wing and the right wing is growing and extremism on both ends is also growing. And really that's not a good thing because we've had extremist right wing movements in the last 50 years. We've had extremely left wing movement centered. They weren't pretty and maybe we don't want to bring them back and so we have a serious problem. All right, so let's take a look at that for a minute and look at it seriously. So let's look at the left. And so I'm going to tell you some things about the left. The first thing is that people vote their temperament and you need to understand this because when you're talking to people who are across the political divide from you, and I'm assuming they're relatively reasonable people, we're not going to talk about the extremist for a moment.

Speaker 3:          00:42:36       If you're talking to people who are liberal, left leaning, then you're talking to people who are high in trait, openness and low in conscientiousness. Okay, and so that makes them roughly speaking, interested in ideas and creative but not very good at implementing things. And then people who are on the right or the opposite, they're lower loneliness and they're high in conscientiousness, conscientiousness, and that makes them not very good at thinking up new things, but pretty damn good at implementing things that already exist and so and so. The thing about that is that both of those ways of interacting with the world are necessary under different conditions. You know, sometimes you have a good idea and you're running on it, and what we need are people to implement the idea just as Indian as efficiently and effectively and in an orderly map. And away you go, but sometimes you're efficient in order to restructure is not working anymore because the environment has changed dramatically around it and you need troublemakers with new ideas to come in and break things up so that you start moving in a different direction and new I'd for yourself or when is the time for the chaos of the left and when is the time for the order of the right and the answer to that because we don't know and that's why we have to talk because the like the environment moves around on us, right?

Speaker 3:          00:43:54       It's constantly shifting underneath our feet and sometimes it's shifts so that we have to shift to the left to stay in the middle and sometimes it's shifts so that we have to shift to the right to stay in the middle. And the only way we can figure that out is by having political dialogue. And that's part of the reason why I'm strong free speech advocate isn't test if I shouldn't have to defend myself for such a foolish steak. No,

Speaker 2:          00:44:16       please. Thanks. What

Speaker 3:          00:44:27       freedom of speech, first of all, freedom of speech isn't a cornerstone of our is I don't think it's reasonable. You can have a debate about that and I think the reason for that is that free speech is how people fake. Now you might think you finished, but generally you don't want to do is rehash temperamental prejudice is over and over again in your mind and you actually know that much until you write for other people or to the tarp that people could. They make you think because your assumption is just going to be that you're correct gen unless you've been really think and Hartland. Many people can think because it really. It's hard. In order to think, you have to fragment yourself up into multiple personalities, each of which hold about opposing perspective and then you have to let those opposing perspectives have a battle in the theater of your imagination.

Speaker 3:          00:45:15       That's a very difficult thing to do and so don't confuse having your idiosyncratic prejudices with thinking. You have to be technically trained in order to think and it's very uncomfortable and painful and so people don't like it at all. So generally what you do though the speed is that you put forth your view of the world, perhaps invest in internet you can, but also loaded with your own prejudices and biases because how in your ignorance as well, because you have to speak from your restricted perspective, knowing as little as you do know and with your personality, you know first and foremost in your utterances and then other people correct you and hopefully you as you enter into a real dialogue whereby you can transcend the your own bias limitations and expand the toolbox with which you use to work in the world and everyone benefits from that and then you modify your viewpoints so that they actually work better in the future because that's kind of what it means.

Speaker 3:          00:46:11       What it means to have a a useful and correct viewpoint is do you have a toolbox that is going to enable you to work effectively in the world? And if you're too biased and too narrow, too ignorant, what that means is that your toolbox is only going to work and very narrow environment. If you go out into public and you hammer yourself up against other people, especially those who don't agree with you, you could formulate the problems more clearly. You can discuss the possibility for consensus and then you can negotiate an implementation strategy and the alternative to that is that you're silent. You're a slave or your retirement. That's it. We devolve into conflict and fighting and that's not a good idea and we don't have to do it because we do actually know how to talk to each other and although perhaps we forget very frequently why we should have to know.

Speaker 3:          00:47:02       The other thing to think about is you know you don't exist just for who you are. Now. You also exist for who you're going to be next week, next month, next year, five years down the road and so on, and so you're actually a collection of people that extends out into the future. And so what that means is that you not only have to get along with yourself, you have to get along with all the people that you're going to be, and one of the ways to determine who those people that you're going to be is to talk to other people around you because you're actually a collective that extends across time and in so far as you're only speaking for yourself right now. You're not speaking for yourself as are distributed across time, but if you talked to a bunch of other people, then what you're doing is approximating yourself distributed across time. So it's actually even in your selfish best interest to talk to a bunch of other people because they did help you represent yourself better than you were going to do it by yourself. And then you know why we also say it

Speaker 3:          00:48:01       well, there's other reasons that you want to be. Want to talk to other people to get your toolbox in order, because we might want to say to him, well, what do you. What should you be aiming for in your life? I can. I can tell you that roughly speaking, if you're looking for something that will give your life, meaning, that's, that's, that's actually quite straightforward as far as I'm beginning to town. This is where the Ios App, it's so wrong that it's almost unbelievable and as far as I'm concerned, fundamentally they're just escaping from responsibility anyways, even though they are perfectly rational arguments for their nihilism. It's like everything's meaningless. It's like, no. First of all, no pain is not meaningless. You're never going to meet anyone who will tell you that their own pain is meaningless, so we can just forego the whole meeting was argument right off the bat.

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       It's like there may be no positive meeting advice. We can have a discussion about that, but south after the negative meaning exists and everyone knows it, and even someone who's in Archicad, nihilistic to the core drug, a spike through their hand, they're going to get like that has meaning and since I've been an existential and look at how people are instead of what they say, and they'll act out the idea that that has meaning very, very rapid, so we'll just go with that. Now you might say, well, there's all sorts of now, but that's not the kind of meaning that I believe doesn't exist. I believe that only positive meaning doesn't exist, which is, you know, a little on the negative side. I would say the beginning, but I can understand that people have. People can have a pretty directional lights, you know, and you can easily get yourself in a situation where it seems like there's nothing at all to your life except suffering and that's what happens to people who become suicidal, for example, and it's no joke and they have the reasons. Now you know, sometimes those people have been hurt in ways that are absolutely unimaginable and so when they see a horizon that's full of nothing but suffering, you can't just wave that away. But I would say

Speaker 3:          00:49:54       the first thing we might hypothesize is that sending paid is an alternative fact of meeting and certainly seems to be negative, but one of the things you might want to try to orient yourself in relationship to is the reduction of human suffering. Now, because I think that's the goal. You know the answer to what do you do about a child who stopped wearing in a concentration camp? Is it who the hell is going to care in a million years? Right? That's not the right answer, and if it's not the right answer in that situation, then perhaps it's not the right answer at all. And the right answer to who the hell's gonna care anyways in a million years is why in the world when you frame the mistake that idiotically mean anybody, anybody. This is kind of a trick of the imagination in some sense. Anybody who's quick witted can come up with a frame of reference that makes anything that makes almost anything lack meaning within that frame of reference.

Speaker 3:          00:50:49       Well, all that means to me is that you picked a stupid frame of reference, right? Why should you? Why should you accept without doubt the consequences of your stupid algorithm? Who's going to care in a million years gone? Really? You got to be able to do better than that. If that's what you're going to wipe out, meaning. Well, so what do you want from me? Alright? Reduced software, that'd be a good one. You could devote your life to that and I would say start locally and I think this is the alternative to right wing nationalism, which is too much order and chaos, which is too much chaos. We don't want to go down that rabbit hole again, either of it. So what's the alternative? I thought about this for a very long time. It took me decades to come to this conclusion. The conclusion is just that you straightened yourself out and you do that humbling.

Speaker 3:          00:51:37       There's this idea that the new testament, which I get quite a kick out of, that you're not supposed to pray in public. It's a little more complicated than that. Actually, you know what? I'm supposed to pray until you like sorted out the dispute that you have with your brother. For example. I really like that idea because what it means is that you shouldn't make a public display of your virtue until you straighten up your damn life, and this is one of the things I really don't like about protests and I really don't like the fact that university students are tired. They're halfway and professors that the way that you changed your world.

Speaker 2:          00:52:11       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:52:19       You don't change the world by going and waving signs of that you've defined as more evil than first of all, the probability that they're more useful than you is actually quite low because they may be you're in the same damn boat and if you divided the world up convenience so that you can identify the innocent and the and the dam or the oppressor and oppressed and you think you're in the positive category, then the probability that you're a part of the solution and not part of the problem was zero. So it's just not that easy. You know, in the most profound people that I've ever read, he said the same thing over and over. It's like the line between good and evil runs down the middle of every human heart and the first thing that you're supposed to do is with that bag on your own territory.

Speaker 3:          00:53:03       And that's bloody Joel. That's a difficult thing to do because it means that you have to recognize that. Recognize yourself as a perpetrator of gravy and that is what you are and that's a terrible thing for me to learn. You know when you look at the 20th century and you think, well, who brought on the horrors of the communist systems and the horrors of the Nazi system is the answer is people just like you. That's the answer, but if you don't understand that and you think that answer is wrong, then you're not very biased and it's not surprising because the price that you paid for wisdom, this is radically dissimilar. Disillusionment and the confrontation with evil and no one wants that. Really. It's a terrible thing to confront and that's because human beings are terrible or preachers. Now, I think we're also absolutely remarkable creatures and wonderful creatures, but we have an unlimited capacity for brutality and evil and every one of us carries it, and so what you do is you try to sort that out in your own life and you start.

Speaker 3:          00:54:02       I haven't talked to me just a while back about about his life. Haven't been going very well. He decided to put himself together and he started doing this little ritual thing, which I thought was quite cool. He was in this kind of an isolated guy, very overweight guy. When I talk to him, he lost about 130 comments, which was quite impressive for this part of him putting himself together, but he started doing it by bill. He had a bunch of labels leftover from his childhood and the first thing he did, because he was feeling very nihilistic and hopeless, he, he found that he got a little bit of satisfaction out of building little things on the blade bills, you know, and I thought, well that was pretty interesting. And so he built a bunch of these things and then he said, well, I got a bunch of these things built.

Speaker 3:          00:54:40       Then I had to figure out how to organize them in the room. They were. I thought that's cool because he started higher resolution at the level of detail. You know, what he was building something that was trivial. He knew that he was just playing a game, but then as soon as he had a collection of those, then you have to sort out the space that he was going to organize them in many figured out, well, yeah, just sort of the room that they were going to be in, so we started organizing and beautifying the room and at the same time he modified his diet and he was putting himself together and that's the right thing to do. That's the right thing to do is that there is. There are responsibilities that are awaiting you, right, that are in your own grass and you know what they are.

Speaker 3:          00:55:17       This is also something that no one can preach to you about. It's something you have to decide for yourself and you can do it quite straightforwardly and it's something that I do on a regular basis. You sit down in the or in the morning and ask yourself like you're asking someone that you want the answer from, like genuinely needed, want to have the entrepreneur telling yourself none of that. You're asking yourself, right? There's a bunch of things about my life that aren't in order that aren't together and I know it and they're making me suffer and they're making me less than I am, and there's some of those things that are staring me right at the face and I know what they are and there's some of those that I can put in order today with a little bit of work so that when I wake up tomorrow, the domain of my experience, which is basically being itself, that the main point experience will be more pristine and better put together than it is today, and you asked yourself that you'll find right away.

Speaker 3:          00:56:11       You know what they are, five things that come up, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, and they'll all be things that aren't very heroic. They're kind of trivial and that you've been avoiding. You've been avoiding. Those are little dragons of chaos though. And you know, they're just little. That's good because you're not much of a hero warrior and so maybe a little tiny dragons are all the ones that you've been put up. You know, do search those things out and it'll. First of all, they will order your order, the being around you in a more pristine and productive way and they can just a little bit more focused in together and what that would mean is that the next thing you can do is ask yourself the same question in the end of the problems that will emerge will be slightly larger and more complex, and then you can try to put those in order and that will make everything around you more pristine and benefit together and it'll make you a little bit stronger and more clear habit.

Speaker 3:          00:57:01       And then another set of problems will emerge that's a little bit larger. If you continue to do that, you know you're asserting yourself. I'll clean up your room and you put your house in order and then you could start to work in the community and by that time you'll actually have some power and some and some self confidence and some competence and some creaminess and they'll be much more, much less likely to stupidly hit something complicated with the stick and say that you fixed it, but you have to start low. You have to be Carl Jung said, very uninteresting. One is fairly interesting phrases. He says that the reason that monitor people can't see is because they won't look low enough. I really liked that. I mean he is an extraordinarily wise person than what he meant by that was something like what I'm telling you, this, that the secret to your existence is right in front of you and it manifests itself as all those things you know you should do, but you're avoiding because one of the things you might ask yourself this curse, you're useless and weak and miserable and and cruel than all of those horrible things, but partly that's because you're also not what you could be an part of.

Speaker 3:          00:58:01       The reason for that is not doing what you know you shouldn't be doing, so you might ask herself, because this is a very interesting game. If you started doing the things that you know you should do, this is a discussion with your own conscious. If you started doing those things that you know you should do and you did that diligently, what the hell would you be like at 10 years? Now? That's an exciting game. That's an interesting game and if you play that, we'll find that you're a hell of a lot more than you were and that's something at least you might not hit the pinnacles that you're going to be a lot lower than you are, and then if you're not leaking miserable and wretched and sovereign, dismal and self pitying and all those things, you're going to be a lot less resentful. You're going to be a lot less broom.

Speaker 3:          00:58:42       You're gonna be a lot less cruel to yourself and to other people. Well, that's pretty good start. You know, even if you're not a positive force for good in the world, if you just weren't wretched horrible, that would be a good additional contribution. No, I would say too, there's a corridor that goes along with that and I, and this is so, so, so you could look at it this way. This is something that I tried to explain. I did a video on Pinocchio, couple of Videos About Pinocchio, which I've been fascinated by it because it's a very good illustration in poplar culturally of how archives manifest themselves and how people understand the archetypes even if they don't know they understand them because it was a very interesting movie and think about it. You know you, you might ask, well, with modern people, think about people going to church.

Speaker 3:          00:59:36       They think, how can people believe those superstitions? Fair enough. Question, well, what the hell do you think you be moving. What are you doing here? Here you are. You're probably on seem to Nokia, but whatever. You're an adult, you bring your five year old to see, to know you. You're just as interest is here, so think about what you're doing. First of all, you know what? Those are drawings. They're not real creatures or draws. Second tuck wouldn't topic. Who actually happens to one who is being guided to cricket was highest goal is to sell for reasons no one can understand and somehow that makes it very turn them into something that's real. It's like that's strange people, right? The fact that you're doing that is very peculiar and it says something about what people are means that we understand the things that we don't normally understand, and so now it's a very interesting movie.

Speaker 3:          01:00:33       I can tell you what it's fundamental presupposition here, so I'll just guide you through it very, very rapidly. So the beginning of the movie, Japan, who's who's the archetype of the good father, by the way, which is an archetype that we've forgotten about. It does exist because our culture isn't just a tyrannical patriarchy. As you can tell by the fact that we're comfortable with. We're not tearing each other to shreds at the moment, which is what you do in a state of absolute chaos, right? It's made freezing and starving, right? And that is what one cap. We have a piece and it's rare and it's amazing that we have and we shouldn't take it for granted because it's not the normal order of things. The normal order of things is destructive chaos and if you're fortunate enough to live somewhere that's peaceful, productive, you should thank your lucky stars every second of your life and if you don't do that, all that means is that you don't know anything about history and you know nothing about it because things can get out supposedly monsters and it happens all the time and there's always a fraction of the population thinks that's how they like things to be and perhaps there's a fraction of you that's like two and I wouldn't nurture that fragment if I miss you, unless you want to go where it will take you.

Speaker 3:          01:01:45       Anyways, back to

Speaker 2:          01:01:46       no thank you,

Speaker 3:          01:01:57       and then you can tell that he's got a warm allison. It's full of toys and it's full of music boxes, scar little kit and then these goldfish and he takes care of them and so he's a good guy. It makes this pocket and then he puts us on the puppet announced the final act and the pocket kidnap his capacity to speak. And that's what you want. If you're a good father is you want to take your son, turn turning into someone who can speak right, who can speak his soul, and soldier paddle puts a smile on his son's spaces as, wouldn't it be wonderful if he could be a good boy? Yeah, wouldn't it be wonderful, right? Because that's what you do. You're a good father. You think, wouldn't it be possible with this puppet could actually become something genuine and independent with its own voice?

Speaker 3:          01:02:43       While he says that sounds likely it goes off to bed and then star appears up in the window to be wishes on a star and you think, well, what does that mean? What does it mean to wish on a star? It's like, well, the star is the light that that gets in the darkness, right, and it's something transcendent. You go shopping to the night sky and it's. It's inspiring whether you're religious or not. You're looking into the Internet while you make a relationship with the infinite. By wishing on a star, you raise your eyes above the horizon and point at the light that beckons in the darkness and you say, I wish more than anything else that my son can become a real person. That's what you do. If you're a good for the employer may come into a slave. You don't want to be a tyrant.

Speaker 3:          01:03:26       You don't want them to be a puppet. You want them to be something strong and independent. Also, often over it goes out into the world. He faces all these different moral problems. He's armed with his conscious. It turns out to be a bug, right? Well, why? Well, it's because things bug you. You know you're conscious bugs you and the reason that the conscience is jimminy cricket is because that's the same initials as Jesus Christ and Jimminy cricket is southern US Slang for Jesus Christ and no doubt the other mangers thought that was very commonly. I'm not telling you that the bug is a very strange representation of Christ. That's for sure. What would make it into a cricketer and he's also rather error prone into movies. So he gets the movie doesn't have precisely the affordable Christian structure, but part of the reason this took me a long time to figure out too is that you have to have a dialogue with your conscience, but it has to be a dog because it's actually not 100 percent right.

Speaker 3:          01:04:19       It has to be something that you build by having a discussion with it across time, and that's actually worth Mq. With junior cricket, as the movie progresses, both the puppet and the conscience get wiser by begging themselves against the world and the pop. It has to resist the temptation of fame and celebrity. That's the first temptation, right? Because he's asked to be an actor, which is an easy way to be celebrities like the Kardashians, right? It's, it's established without responsibility or or competence, and so that that exists and attraction and then he's, he's. He learns that lying is a very bad idea. Right? That's what he's knows grocery as, to get that sort of. No. And then he said he's asked to present himself as a victim of circumstances. That's what the Fox and the coyotes. And when you decided that he's too ill to go back to school, they take them to pleasure it degrees trained to be a jackass that works for slavers into soul lines, right? Not Bad for animation, I would

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       say. And then at the end of the movie, he tries to go back home because he's terribly lost and he's half Jack asked because the people that pleasure island have told him, taught him to do nothing but break, which I can help with offers or what would you. What would you say is, is an appalling parallel to what's happening? To educate people who are being educated in modern universities, which are increasingly play houses where you're taught to break in. Listen, I can't listen to protest is just. It just. It's just painful. Is this constant repetition of a soul. It's nonsense. Thank chanted this because the protesters, they're trying to convince themselves even more desperate than they're trying to convince them.

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       So anyways, Pinocchio goes back home, half jackass and half again. Then he tries to find his father. There's no going home right now. Once you're an adult, it's your young adult. You don't get to go back because there isn't anyone there that can tell you what to do anymore, and so they go and allocate those homes and his father isn't there and then finds out that he has to go to the bottom of chaos itself to rescue his father, and that's what we have to do it right, because our civilization is in this state of crisis now is predicted long ago by people like Nisha Dusty Dustier, and partly what you're trying to do with you go to university is to go to the heart of darkness right to the place that terrifies you the most and define your values, your culture really has, and that's what it means to go down to the bottom of the desk.

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       The thing that terrifies you the most, integrative before your father to very little story. The Egyptians were telling that story for a thousand years ago. It's one of the oldest stories of mankind, and so that's what you have to do. You and you united yourself with your culture, so you're more than just a week and simple minded individual, right? You dedicate yourself to the study of what's great about the past and you incorporate it so that there can be something to you and then you bring your father back up to the surface so that the culture can see and live yet, and then that makes you into a real individual. Well, that's the movie. Well, we watch it were captivated by it. Now it's time to understand. It takes time to understand that in an articulated and conscious map because it's too late for us to be unconscious anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:07:40       And so we have silla and shrimp. This, we have the chaos of the left. The left says, well, we need to tear down structures because they press. Obviously structures will press because something's good at the top of the structure and also good at the bar. So if you have any values dropped you, it's going to privilege somethings and exclude others, but if you scrap the value structures then there's nothing to live for. So we can't do that. That's just chaos. And then the radical right says back to the nations like really? You know, we went back to the nation a couple of times, so it doesn't really look that great. Part of the reason

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       for that is that the purpose of the nation isn't the nation. The purpose of the nation is to produce citizens who transcend and rejuvenate the nation and so the nation should be probably properly subordinating to the individual, right to the divine individual for that map, and that's what we figured out in the West. Now it is that we only figured that out in the west, but so far we've been fortunate enough to put it into a reasonable practice in our political institutions and thank God for that. At least it's worked somewhere and we'd be completely foolish to give that up because look at what it's provided us with. It's remarkable for free, as free as we can, but that doesn't mean that we're happy because freedom and happiness are not the same thing at all. But we did figure out that the state should be subordinate to the wisdom of the individual, to the site, and the wisdom of the individual puts a heavy responsibility on everyone.

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       That mean to you. Have to be the wise individual who can see at speed, that's your job, and if you do that, the thing that's so cool about that is you know you need a meaning in your life that enables you to bear to the suffering of their life without becoming corrupted. That's the basic rule and you have to build yourself into something that you can actually respect so that you can see yourself bearing that terrible existential burden properly and then you don't lose hope. Don't lose meaning because you can see that you're strong enough to stand up underneath that burden and then there's something about you that you can respect and then maybe other people can respect that will help bring suffering in the world to an end and that will help people develop fully as individuals and that will enable us to avoid the dehumanizing rigid a stair I'll uniformity of the nationalistic left and a hallway chaotic devouring chaos of the radical left. How about no

Speaker 2:          01:10:11       the individual?

Speaker 3:          01:10:13       That's the secret to the world and you're all individuals. You're all the secret to the world and then all you have to do to discover that is picked up in your damn responsibility. Stop listening to people who keep burdening you with rights. How many Goddamn right steel? Why do you need some responsibility? So pick it up, open your eyes and learn how to make yourself articulate and that way the world will just send them to the series of health that it already descended into in the 20th century.

Speaker 2:          01:10:53       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          01:11:09       Well that's probably just as good a place as any to end. I think in principle we have time for questions. Is that correct? You? Okay. So we'll start with you. Do you want to use the Mike? Yeah. Okay. So I'd ask you to try to keep your questions relatively short, so, so see if you can get them, articulate it out to the point where they can be relatively concise. So I'm weirdly you. We're talking about the idea that like when you see a distinction between gender and sex and like I'm not saying right, like you need are. You said they are connected and I'm wondering like the idea that because we can find an example of a non connected that means that they necessarily are connected, like where does that idea come from? It comes from wishful thinking. It comes from. There's a deep question underneath that and the wishes that human nature for the infinitely malleable and that the state will determine the direction that that malleability should, should take.

Speaker 3:          01:12:16       That's the fun. That's the unreliable. Now I suppose there's also a wish to some degree that we can all burst the bonds that define us, you know, in a particular way that you can ask yourself if you already want to do that. One of the things I see happening to young people that I think is terrible is that they're asked to abandon their identity before they even have one, and so then they turned to these group identities which are extraordinarily shallow or very, very shallow. How important, how are we going to get through life being a transsexual? It's not an identity. I'm not saying there are no transexuals. I'm not saying that, but you don't get through life as a black person. You don't get through life as a white person. You get through life by having a differentiated identity. That's the toolbox that you use to interact with others and part of now, part of that means that you have to accept certain limitations on who you are, but you want those limitations because there's nothing worse than total freedom. It's like you're dropped someone out in the ocean right in the middle of the ocean with no direction and you say, you're free to swim any way you want. What are you going to do with that? You're going to have an identity, so that's good. Thank you. How about here?

Speaker 3:          01:13:39       My blessing. I just want to say thank goodness I'm actually a transplant. If you put English language, orange, apple, you think any of us could actually be. Well, so the question is about gender neutral pronouns. Do you think any of us would be here? The issues that we're discussing would come up in another way? No, because I think. I think everyone knows that whatever we're talking about has very little to do with gender pronouns mean and people have asked me why I chose deliver data, let's say on that particular amount. And it's like, well the answer to that is you have to pick some place that's actionable to stamp. Right? And the problem with that is that it might be somewhat observed while you've been in a battle. You know, it's like, well, who cares if you take the next yard of ground, why would you die over that?

Speaker 3:          01:14:48       Well, when you think about it that way, it's fair enough. It's foolish, but you have to make the abstract concrete before you can actually engage with it. And so it just so happened that this was the issue. I do believe that if, if there were gender neutral pronouns in English, then then this will just come up some other way because political correctness and the and the polarization between right and left were occurring long before this particular issue manifested itself. So yes, with the glasses, I'll repeat the questions and then everybody can hear them. It'll be a little faster.

Speaker 1:          01:15:22       Just to start off, are you familiar with? Yes. Okay, great. What do you think my medic period, a usefulness is an understanding our components that go into how violence is created. And then, um, can you offer some examples of combating or opposing the norm of scapegoating individuals? Uh, uh, because it correct, uh, and societies and social groups or strengthened into their violence. Uh, how do we drive the wedge between them? No.

Speaker 3:          01:15:59       Well, I think you have to escape the right thing, you know, because the reasonable level, it's in the world. That's another thing that we've forgotten about in modern parlance. You know, I've talked about for a very long period of time is my, my colleagues tend to look askance at me because they don't believe in such a thing. And I think, well, well first of all, yes, you do believe in it whether you do or not. If you don't bring your heaviness end, unless you're willing to say for example, I think it was unit seven, nine one, you guys who don't think distance of evil, you go online and read about them at seven, nine months and then you see what you think about that. If I told you about this done in China before World War Two by the Japanese, uh, scientific investigative squads, let's say, that's the sort of thing that the things that were done by that unit were so terrible that I would not discuss them before an audience without a trigger warning, because they would burn themselves into your imagination and you would never forget them for the rest of your life.

Speaker 3:          01:17:06       And if you can invest, I think it was 7:31, by the way, if you can investigate that and come to the conclusion that there's no such thing as evil, then that's fine. You go ahead and live that way and just see how far it gets. Um, so we need to localize malevolence luck. And the other thing I want to tell you too, is that people have encounters with malevolence in their lives. And it often produces posttraumatic stress disorder, so very frequently soldiers develop posttraumatic stress disorder, not because of what they observed, what they observe themselves doing, so they observe themselves doing something absolutely vicious on the front and they think, where did that come from? I didn't think that's who I was at all. It's like you didn't think so because you were never in a situation like that. You've never had a chance to reveal to yourself exactly what you were light and then other people can develop.

Speaker 3:          01:18:00       Post traumatic stress disorder are often people who have been encountered with someone who is truly malevolent, who really truly wanted to hurt, and there's no room in their philosophy of being for that sort of that sort of event or action. It just fragments them and they never recover. They often never recovered. They have to develop a fully fledged philosophy of evil in order to recover. Understand that there are people who are malevolent and that malevolence exists in the world. When you can put it on someone else and even punish them for it and you can chase them away and then you can pretend that it's got, but it never goes away and the right way to deal with it is to find the thing in you that that into work, to comprehend them, to control it. It also, one of the things that's very interesting about that is it also makes you extraordinarily tough if you do it, and I can give you a pop culture example of that.

Speaker 3:          01:18:51       So Harry Potter obviously has an nmp right, and that's voldemort and if you can't see the sale Christ and safety lurking behind those figures, then you're really not using your imagination to any great degree. There. Archetype will fingers. Right? And the thing about Harry Potter is that the only reason that he can face photo artist because he's, he's got a touch of evil inside of it. It's embedded inside of it and that's extraordinarily useful to know that because it's very useful to be a monster or more importantly, it's very useful to be able to be a monster because if you can be a monster, you can stand up for yourself or for anything else. So the trick is to take that monster inside of me, went to incorporate it into using it, and then you don't have to escape to go to other people and you can constrain the spread of eagles starting with yourself. And um, you know, the people that you admire, whether you're men or women, have exactly that. Ask it because women do not like armless man. They like dangerous men who were civilized and men have no respect for armless man. They like dangerous men who are civilized. And so the trick for madness to turn yourself into a dangerous man. Civilized. And I would say that the most dangerous man is the person who can speak properly. So I mean, there's other forms of dangerousness. There's nothing with physical products.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       There's nothing wrong with all of the multidimensional ways that you could learn to be dangerous. But the highest, the highest order danger is articulated speech and wealth. For all these reasons, it's speech Buddhists in the world. And so get your scapegoats. Right? So you think great deal of time talking about free speech and political correctness on campus in the United States, we see places like University of Chicago stand against political correctness, free speech on campuses in Canada. Would you say that our universities in particular and a particular university departments that have done a good job at standing up for free speech and standing up against political correctness on campus? Well, I would say Canada or the sort of question is that Jonathan Heit and his people at the end or the Arts Academy have attempted to rank order American universities in terms of their allegiance to classical ideals. Liking that idea of the people that enlightenment ideals or free speech free discourse and the narrative social justice, and they put the University of Chicago at the tall and I think brown was at the bottom growing university or the talk.

Speaker 1:          01:21:26       If you're thinking about social justice. And then the question was, what do I think about Canadian? My answer to that would be Canadian universities have done such a good job over the over the decade standing up for free speech that everyone just takes it for granted, but now it's come under threat and I think it's come under threat because the postmodern movement, which basically started in the 19 seventies in which is deeply nested inside of a matrix of Marxism and accountant. The postmodernism themselves poses a substantial threat to the very idea of free speech because they don't believe in free speech. The postmodernist. You got to understand these. The like. I'm not saying that every social justice activist is a committed postmodernist because most of them aren't educated enough to be that by saying, I'm just saying that it takes a substantial amount of education before you're the incarnation of the political philosophy, right? You have to do a lot of reading and so I would say, you know, Michel Foucault or Jacques Derrida that are fragmented up into their tiny little book suffers no equal pieces of voldemort soul, and then they're distributed among the people who are possessed by that ideology. So if you take a particularly someone who's hyper politically correct, you'd say, well, 95 percent of them is normal person, that's five percent of them is like Michelle Foodco. It's the evil offspring of Michelle Fuco and Jacques Derrida, and so, but if then if you put 20

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       of them together and their mop and you'd get the whole philosophy blasting forward, happy. Well what? What's, what is the philosophy? The philosophy of commodity? It's quite straight forward from the postmodernist perspective. Value structures exclude, which of course they didn't, but they take it further. They say, well, that's the purpose of abandoned structures to explain. So if you're an Italian structural hierarchy, let's say, and you have the top positions, then you're privileged for doing that, but the reason that that and that you fight for it is because of privileges you and does have a part by excluding is that know that's pushing it a bit too far. So like value structure is excluded and they have because they're not instructors if they don't exclude. But to move from that, to say that the only reason value instructions exist is to exclude is palpably observed. Look, if you're going to go get your brain operating on, you're going to make it a presupposition that there's a hierarchy of competence among brain surgeons that's independent of their desire for power at least partly, and you're going to look for the best brain surgeon just like you look for the best auto mechanic or or if the best plumber for the best carpenter, anything that's worth doing by by by definition has a value structure implicit in it, and of course if there are good carpenters, they're also people who aren't good carpenters.

Speaker 3:          01:24:26       It's like prejudice to point that out. It's not prejudice to point that out. They're just not good carpenters. Luckily they might be able to be good at something out well, so most of our is that now I just dropped his excluded and that's why they exist and then what we should do is flat. You are limiting things or more perversely, I've been saying we should know that this is where the marks of Marxism comes into it. It's very strange, intellectual slightly that your identity is defined by your gender or your sexuality or what ever happens to the identity issue. Do sure and and because you're identifying with that idea and other people are identifying with other identities, there's no way of having a dialogue between them because well, for the postmodernists dialogue doesn't even exist. There's no way of developing a consensus between groups that are predicated on different identities.

Speaker 3:          01:25:22       The whole idea of consensus through dialogue is actually a trick that was generated by the people that you the most dominant positions and those are the fellows enter transitions that they're under always arm about. Well, so. Well it's, it's, it's an interesting idea because value structures are prejudicial. There's no doubt about it and one of the ways of thinking about that, you think you're not prejudice. It's not yet. You swimmed with anyone who asks you to you. Now, some of you might say yes and ask very often, but, but, but I make it very, very straightforward. The point here is that in our most intimate relationships were precisely most

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       prejudicial. You want to take that away from people or do you want to start knowing that certain kinds of prejudices and things that are desirable or valuable or actually being taken apart, making intelligent choice so. Well that was a bit of time for one more question. Okay. So according to what you said earlier, you pointed out differences between men and women and just following from what you said, it stands to reason that different ideas are going to resonate more with women versus men in general. So I'll give you the woman studies and say seek help from therapists a lot more than men do, which allows me to positive or negative feelings you're experiencing and move through prices a lot better than me on this. Another. Another advantage we have generally trump dramatic sort of crazy situations, but to what extent do natural propensities legislatively versus correct?

Speaker 1:          01:27:26       Absolutely valid. Just because man is less likely to. Doesn't mean that that's just because of the woman's consent. Central judge everyone. Well, it's very complicated question, but if you listen to the central question is that given that there are differences between men and women that say to what society is structured so that the negative consequences of those differences might be in this specific example, it was perhaps that women are more likely to seek medical attention and psychological health, which does happen to be the case and that that's perhaps beneficial. What would it be better if family we're more prone to seek help as well and they have called. We don't know, but we could assume that might be the case. Well, let me just think about that for a second here. See if I can figure out how to answer that properly. I think the way you started this by trying to figure out what the differences are first, you know, because I always think I'm very leery of broad scale social solutions because I think there are so low resolution that they tend to cause more trouble than they than they. They tend to cause more trouble than they forestall. We're just at the beginning of starting to understand what the differences between men and women actually are. You know, like the Scandinavian studies that I talked about, there are only about 15 years old and it isn't, takes about

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       15 years for scientific information generally sort of leach out into the general public if it's going to do so. And so the question to what degree the differences between men and women exist and to what degree the biological versus sociological. It's something that we're just starting to sort out the next question might be, okay, well what did we do in the face of those differences? And that sort of that is like I don't know what we should do about it. I do think that we should, we should for, for go the temptation to jump to premature conclusions and we have some real problems with this. So one of the things that's happening in many of you may have noticed it is that men are bailing out of the humanities and social sciences like map. You know, if you, and this has been happening for about 15 years, 20 years, I mean overall enrollment in the humanities is declined substantially and that's because I think most of what's being, and this is all simplified postmodern nonsense and it's very, very hard employment and go there and they have whatever cherished assumptions they might have fragmentary as they are.

Speaker 3:          01:30:05       They bring to a humanities class and have those demolished. It's like a giant hits your raft with we have an emerging problem which is what we're going to do when there's no men left in the social sciences. Is that actually going to work because that I'm not sure of the work. I guess we're gonna find out and then we have the inverse problems say with regards to engineering and women. Women don't go into engineering well should it? Well, the first question might be who said that they should come in? My sense is that what we should do is open up opportunities for people because I think the idea of leveling the playing field to the degree that's possible to equalize opportunity is a good one from a sociological perspective because you don't want talent to go to waste. Now, that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that the way that's done commonly is intelligent or appropriate because it often doesn't work at all, but it is best if we can open up society so that people can let their talents flourish.

Speaker 3:          01:31:02       I would say we remove unreasonable prejudice to the degree that that's possible. When you do that by constraining it in your own life and then you let people make their own decisions and let us sort out the way it will.
