Speaker 1:          00:45          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45          Hey, so as some of you may know, I went to give a talk at mcmaster university on Friday.

Speaker 3:          00:53          Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:58          And, uh, it was originally supposed to be a panel with three other people and also a moderator and the panelists and the moderator either chose to or were forced to buy wild as a consequence of public pressure being applied to them for being willing to appear with me on the same stage. And so anyways, I went there and talked and there was a lot of protesting,

Speaker 2:          01:31          um, a lot of disruption and that's fine because people can say what they want and I suppose they can do what they want to and I'm not complaining about that. But, um, when I got home tonight, I found this other, uh, missive from mcmaster university, uh, this organization called, uh, pack vic. And I want to read it to you because it actually does, it irritates me half to death. And so, um, I'll, I'll read, I'll read it to you and you can make up your own mind. March 16th, 2017 statement re mcmaster event featuring Dr. Jordan Peterson, professor of psychology, University of Toronto. We are deeply troubled. The Dr. Jordan Peterson has been invited to speak at mcmaster at an upcoming event about quote, freedom of speech and quote and political correctness. Most recently, Dr. Peterson has gained notoriety for his refusal to use the preferred pronouns of trans and gender nonconforming colleagues. The students at u of t defending his callous disregard for their personhood through a misguided deference to his freedom of speech and his distaste for political correctness, but freedom of speech doesn't now it hasn't ever meant that we can or should be able to say whatever we like in public spaces regardless of the impact of our speech on others.

Speaker 2:          02:53          Instead, the concept of freedom of speech has most often been mobilized to protect specifically counter mnemonic ideas, ideas that actually challenge rather than reiterate the status quo. Freedom of speech was also not conceived as a means to protect normative ideas from contact station by marginalized communities, but to protect those who speech might actually contest normative or nationalist ideals from sensor punishment or retaliation by state forces. There's nothing rebellious or revolutionary about insisting on the naturalness of the now long debunked gender binary or of what Dr. Peterson describes as quote, the biological fact and quote of sexual difference. Neatly categorizable as quote, male quote, end quote and quote female and quote a quote, God, you can hardly read this. There is nothing rebellious or revolutionary about insisting on the naturalness of the open parentheses. Now long debunked, closed parentheses, gender binary or of what Dr. Peterson describes as the open quote, biological fact closed quote of sexual difference, neatly categorizable as open quote, male and quote and open quote, female end quote, open parentheses, open quote, fact closed quote, subjected to intense critique, questioning and reconsideration by numerous scholars in the humanities, social sciences, and even the biological sciences for several decades now, which demonstrates the limited extent of Dr Peterson's knowledge on this subject since he seems either an entirely unaware of this body of literature or else unwilling to engage with the challenge it poses for his own arguments, close parentheses.

Speaker 2:          04:47          There is nothing subversive or radical about suggesting that one ought to be entitled to read the complexities of gender identification on the basis of a quick and unwanted scrutiny of others bodies and appearance. This is not a freedom that needs to be defended, but rather than simplistic reassertion of the status quo of ideas about gender and sexual difference that have become and stubbornly remained very widespread and common sensical, even in the face of mountains of academic evidence to the contrary and legislative changes made to protect the human rights of trans and gender nonconforming persons. So let us not pretend the Dr. Peterson is a staunch defender of any sort of open quote, freedom close quote. What he is defending instead appears to be his misguided presumption that is right to uphold the status quo. Trump's the right of others to exist in public spaces and be treated with respect and dignity, free from hatred and discrimination and in a world where hate and discrimination continued to flourish and appear to be on the rise, his way of expressing his right amounts to a presumptive sense of entitlement to deny others their status as fully and complex Lee human.

Speaker 2:          05:57          There was nothing new about Dr Peterson's position. Then it is a position taken by multitudes of others before him. There was also little to be gained by debating Dr. Peterson because he presents no argument founded on evidence that would actually be worthy of debate unless one is of the view that certain people are less than fully and calm, flex a human of course, and are deserving of being treated with callous disregard for their personhood in public spaces, in which case such views because they rest on faulty evidence and because they stand directly in the way of the substantive inclusion of marginalized communities in our public institutions are deeply unsettling and required critical questioning and contestation whenever and wherever they articulated. We stand in solidarity with Trans and gender nonconforming members of our communities who have been called upon repeatedly in the last several months to publicly respond to and challenge Dr Peterson's views and to articulate again and again why are they should be able to participate fully and meaningfully and public institutions in ways that reflect their humanity. We anticipate that Dr Peterson's talk will and should result in public critical opposition to his ideas, including public opposition to how he's treated trans and gender nonconforming people, which may take the form of public protest

Speaker 2:          07:37          in the present climate. Proponents of free speech may try to paint such opposition. That's just another indicator that Dr Peterson's freedom of speech is in fact under threat. In fact, we suggest that were ever free speech is valued protest to must be valued as a legitimate exercise of that freedom, but protest does more than this. It also leads to articulate and demand the kind of university and the kind of society many of us are fighting for one in which we recognize that speech or action that reduces the humanity of any group or people is not an exercise of freedom, but instead poses a threat to us all. Statement issued by the President's advisory committee on building an inclusive community's priority and planning committee and Lgbtq plus working group that mcmaster students, union diversity services director, the McMaster students, union queer students, community central coordinator and the mcmaster students union women and Gender Equity Neck network coordinator.

Speaker 2:          08:34          Okay, fine. So here's the point. This letter states there is nothing rebellious or revolutionary about insisting on the naturalness of the now long debunked gender binary or of what Dr. Peterson describes as the biological fact of sexual difference, neatly categorizable as male and female, a fact subjected to intense critique, questioning and reconsideration by numerous scholars in the humanities, social sciences, and even the biological sciences for several decades now, which demonstrates the limited extent of Dr Peterson's knowledge on this subject since he seems either leak, either an entirely unaware of this body of literature or else unwilling to engage with the challenge it poses for his own arguments. Okay, no problem. So this is what I'll say about that to the members of the PAC buik president advisory committee on building an inclusive community. If you would like to debate with me about the issue of gender and sexuality, I'm willing to do that with as many people as you want to put forward at any time you want, at any place of your choosing.

Speaker 2:          09:42          Hopefully sooner rather than later. And if you're not willing to do that, and you're going to write cowardly little letters like this and make them make them public instead, I might suggest that if you're unwilling to defend your ideas of public, that you should just shut up and go away. And I might also suggest that you should stop teaching students to kind of nonsense that you are teaching them anyways. I don't have much more to say than that, except I'll just repeat it. I have no problem defending my ideas about gender and sexual difference. And if you guys think that you know what the hell you're talking about, then why don't you come out and face me instead of sending your student proxies to complain about me when I come to your university to try to make a case. I think you're a polling Lee cowardly. And so I'm calling you out. Come and debate me whenever you want. Okay?

Speaker 1:          12:34          Yeah. Get me killed. You see, in this world, there's two kinds of people. My friend loaded guns.
