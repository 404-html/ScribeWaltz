Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Hey everyone, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       So I, I saw somebody ask right off the bat if there were any women, I think they said girls actually, if there are any women in the audience, um, and if there are, well that's good. So welcome. Um, thanks to all you Patriot people for your continued support. It's a really big deal. It's made a huge difference in, you're a big part of the reason that Biblical lecture was so ridiculously successful. I think more than 2 million people have watched it so far. So that's success by any stretch of the imagination. So let's start with some questions here. I've got to live chat going and um, we also set it up so that, uh, we had, we had questions taken to begin with without people could up vote, which seems to be a good idea. Let's start with one from practice cube. What would be a practical approach for developing your shadow?

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       Well, that's a good one. Let's, let's do a little review of union psychology. The first thing is if you want to know about this, the proper sources, Carl Jung's collected works volume nine, volume nine, and there's two parts to volume nine a and be published as separate texts. And volume nine is called archetypes of the collective unconscious and the other one is called a ion. But in archetypes of the collective unconscious, there's a good discussion of the persona and the shadow and the persona you could say is a good way of thinking about it. You know, you watch all those Rom coms where there's always kind of a Beta male guy who's being real friendly and always failing miserably with women because basically he's lying to himself and to them. Um, he's a persona and a persona is the face that you show to the world when you're trying to pretend and to convince yourself and others that you're, I would say harmless, but we could say a good person, but a good person isn't harmless.

Speaker 1:          00:08:50       A good person is capable of, well, maybe a good person is capable of anything, but is willing to hold that in a beyonce. I read this interesting commentary a little while. I'll go on a statement by Christ in the New Testament. And the statement generally interpreted is that the meek shall inherit the earth. But I was looking up the multiple translations of the word meek. And Meek is actually derived from a Greek word of course. Um, because the Bible, at least some of the original forms of the Bible were in Greek. Um, and that word didn't exactly mean meek. It meant something like,

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       those who have weapons and the ability to use them, but sir, but determined to keep them sheets will inherit the world. And that means that people who are capable of force, let's say, but decide not to use it, are in the proper moral position. And Neat. You commented on that a fair bit too. You know, he, he, um, thought of most moral morality has cowardice not because morality itself was cowardice, but because most people who are cowards disguise their coward, cowardice as morality and they claim that they're harmlessness, which is actually a consequence of their fear and inability to be harmful, say, or to be dangerous is actually a sign of their moral integrity. And that's a really bad idea. So, you know, if you're an ax murderer but you don't have an ax, that doesn't mean that your moral. So now with regards to it, so that's the persona and the persona is the mask that you wear.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       And that's what persona means is the mask that you wear to convince yourself and the world that you're not a terrible monster. So that when you look at yourself in the mirror, you don't have to run away screaming. You know, when you might think, well that's a bit of an overstatement, but [inaudible] was very interested in phenomena such as say, psychological, the psychological phenomena that would characterize the actions of someone who might be an Auschwitz camp guard for example. And uh, you know, that's pretty monstrous form of behavior. And the thing about Auschwitz camp guards is that there's no reason to assume really that they were much different than normal people. Now, there would have been exceptions obviously, but, and what that means is that perhaps you two could be an Auschwitz camp guard and perhaps he would even derive some enjoyment out of it. And you might think not, but you shouldn't think not so quickly.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       And what that also implies is that if you could see what that meant when you looked in the mirror and looked at yourself, you might run away screaming because you'd have a revelation of just exactly what the human being is capable of. And that's a very unpleasant revelation. And also one of the things that stops people from being enlightened because that revelation of the evil of the self is part of the journey to enlightenment and an early part. Now the shadow be all the parts of the personality that the persona rejects. And that might be the aggressive elements. Certainly the case that's the case with for people who are hyper agreeable. And now you can tell, I think one of the best, there's two pathways to the development of the shadow and they're tightly aligned with one another. Um, the fundamental pathway is truth and that's to face the bitter truth about yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       But to break that down more particularly, you might think about that as the capacity to observe your own resentment. You're going to be resentful and bitter in many situations because you don't get what you want. And if you watch that resentment, bitterness, clc, that it produces fantasies that can be unbelievably dark and that can be very frightening. And you might not want to admit to yourself that you're actually capable of having fantasies like that or impulses like that, or aggressive feelings like that. But the thing is is that if those aggressive feelings and impulses and fantasies are integrated into your character, it's like you're opening up a dialogue with a part of yourself that can be very forceful and strong and dangerous. And it's really useful to be dangerous because if you can, if you can be dangerous, you often don't have to be, and it's, it's often weak people, for example, it's weak men generally speaking, who rape, you know that that's a very, very common occurrence and that's a violent act, but it's born out of weakness, not out of strength, that's for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:13:17       And so anyways, you attend to your resentment honestly, and you observe yourself and what you're actually like. You got to pay attention as if you don't know yourself as if you might harbor hidden devils and then maybe they'll emerge. Now you'll also felt that sort of embedded inside the shout at where the contras sexual tendencies. And so for example, sometimes you see people who are well developed men let's say. And we can, we can also talk about women in this regard. Men who've integrated their shadow often also develop a kind of peculiar grace that would be a consequence of not only allowing their aggressive side to step forward but also their, their feminine and Compassionate side that might, that they may have kept squelched because of embarrassment about it or because they'd been harassed for being weak or any number of things. So, but the practical approach for developing your shadow I would say is to contemplate and consider your resentment and notice what it says and cause your resentment will also tell you what you have to say.

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       You know, look at, look at what happened to Google this weekend. You know, James Damore wrote that memo and you can imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps even somewhat resentful at having to attend that diversity seminar. And I'm really just using this as an example, but what he did was decide that that meant that he had something that he had to say and then look at the consequences of that man. It's an absolutely unbelievable. And so you know, if your feet and pressed at work or you're oppressed in your life for or you know, or you're oppressing yourself, then you got a notice that you're feeling oppressed, then you have to notice that you're feeling resentful, resentful and angry and bitter. And maybe even like Cain in the story of Cain Abel Cause Cain is sort of the architectural bitter man. And then you have to decide what it is that you need to do in order to remove from yourself that bitterness.

Speaker 1:          00:15:01       And that's usually means that there's something that you have to say. And then you have to say it because you're sold depends on it. And not only does your soul depending on it, I would say the fate of the world depends on it because you know you might be wrong and then you should be straightened out. Maybe you're just being whiny and you have to talk to somebody about that. But it may be that you're actually detecting something wrong, some tyranny that's directed towards you and other people and it's like your moral obligation to speak up about it. And so many workplaces become toxic to use a terrible clash cliche because of the people in them won't speak up for what they actually want or they speak up too late and then they're all twisted up about it and, and you know they're torturing other people because they're so unhappy and so forth and so on. So practical approach for developing new shout of fundamentally is radical honesty. And Young said that I know a genuine moral effort was a good substitute for psychotherapy.

Speaker 2:          00:15:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       What is my opinion on open relationships, polyamory, other forms of non monogamy? Well, I think that as a medium to longterm strategy, they're completely untenable because human beings, as far as I'm concerned, are fundamentally pair bonding. And you know, if you're just talking about casual sex, first of all, I think casual sex is a contradiction in terms. I don't think there's anything about sex that's casual. And I think that people are deceiving themselves badly whenever they think. So they might like to live in a, you know, 1970s playboy adolescent fantasy. But I don't, I've never seen that work under any circumstances whatsoever. And I think people get hurt badly. It's also a bad medium to longterm strategy because, you know, pair bonding is, uh, is the most stable arrangement we know of at least so far. Well, I won't even put it that way. It's the only stable, uh, mode of being that we know for the long run.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       And that's especially the case when you bring children into the equation. So, um, I think it's delusional fundamentally. And I think that people who are, who believe that such things work, I mean, sometimes they're open people in their creative and their exploratory and all of that and fair enough, but often they're just unconscientious and they don't want to take any responsibility and they want to live in this wish fulfillment fantasy where everybody can have all the sex they want all the time. And it's always wonderful and no one gets hurt. And it's like, sorry, that just doesn't work in the real world. So my girlfriend is quite overweight, but I really love her. Should I try to encourage her to lose weight? Aside from personal preference, is this likely to explode into a major issue down the road?

Speaker 2:          00:17:27       Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       I don't think that you can fool yourself about what you're attracted to and yes, it's certainly likely to develop into a major issue down the road.

Speaker 2:          00:17:41       Um, it's tough, you know, uh, because, so the devil's in

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       the details, you know, should you try to encourage her to lose weight? I guess the question is how would you do that without disrupting the relationship? Um,

Speaker 3:          00:17:58       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       And without knowing more about the details of that, I would say that I don't know how to tell what to tell you to do about that. I think that it's necessary to be truthful in a relationship period. But I also think that you can't use the truth to hurt, you know, the truth is a very complicated thing and it's, it's a sword and it cuts and you can't use it to hurt. Now, you know, maybe you would be subtle enough to figure out some way that you could both embark on a health promoting endeavor together and that would work out. Um, but I would say, you know, if you, if you're in under stable longterm relationship with someone, it's pretty much necessary for both of you to address all the issues that are making you unhappy with each other. Um, you know, assuming there's some give and take on that because otherwise the relationship can easily come apart at the seams.

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       Like I would say, my wife and I are both very hard on each other about our physical appearance, let's say. And I had gained a fair bit of weight from the time I was say 40 until the time I was 50 about probably because I was eating things that weren't good for me. And I would say that was primarily carbohydrates. I can tell you if you want to lose weight, you stop eating carbohydrates, man, you'll lose weight. Like you wouldn't believe. Um, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it because it has some dangerous, but it certainly works. But you know, the, the alternative to protect to the alternative is to pretend that everything's all right. And all that means is that you're likely to get drunk sometimes some day and have an affair out of bitterness and spite in the fact that you're no longer attracted to your partner.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       So it's pretty rough. So that's a pretty rough way of thinking about things, but life's pretty rough. So what is the story behind the logo that you use in your intros? Where did it come from? That's, that logo is called the meaning of music. And it's actually a sculpture that I made in 1985 that's about s five and a half feet by half, five and a half feet and about eight inches thick. And it's made out of foam core, which is this bay. It's a subset. It's a material that's often used as a backing for paintings or for when you get them framed, it's it's styrofoam sheet about a quarter of an inch thick with paper on both sides and you can cut it very accurately with an exacto knife. And so what I did was make a stack of those, um, uh, those foam core sheets about 80 inches high and it made the thing in quarters and so that it would fit together on the wall because it would have been too big to maneuver easily. And, um, it's a very complicated image. It's actually a three dimensional representation of a,

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       it's a three dimensional representation of a two dimensional representation of a four dimensional object and that four dimensional object you could think of as it's a representation of time and space. And I can tell you, I kind of have to hint at what the painting means. It or the sculpture, it means the same thing. That music means, you know, how music unfolds and then something else unfolds within it. And then it unfolds again within it, like a rose opening into the, into the day, or like a lotus flower that sort of comes up from the darkest steps up through the dark water and then blooms on the, on the surface of the water and the sun. And that's where the Buddha, you know, um, what would you say? Symbol symbolically rest. So it can imagine that thing opening and then imagine that that's what that painting is an image of.

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       And that's the same thing as music. So it's a Mandela image. And for young, the Mandela was a symbol of the self and the self was something that unfolds like music, which is actually why we like music. And it's like the, the rose, the rose that you see, the, the, the geometric rose that you see in stain glass. It's the same thing. Um, that's the Stain Glass Window that Pinocchio's reprehensible, compatriot. Um, what's his name? Lamp. Wick breaks when he's in pleasure island and he throws it rock to destroy the model home and to demolish the substructure of Western civilization. And so I had a very intense religious experience at one point when I was contemplating that. So when I drew the image to begin with, I drew it in about 10 minutes, kind of rough. And then I used a straight edge to straighten it all open and a protractor to, or a compass to make the curves.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       But I drew it very quickly and I'd been thinking about, I've been reading young a lot at that point, like for, for months, months of intense reading. And that image sort of popped out of me very, um, very suddenly. But it took about three months to make the actual image. And then I had only a quarter of it hanging on my wall because it was so big. And I had finished it after about three months of work. So this was back in 1985 when I was a graduate student and I was listening to the Jupiter symphony, which is the piece of music that I use, um, that was used for the intro to my, to my videos. And it's a Mozart symphony. And this happened, man. So this happened. So I was really watching that, um, Mandela that quarter, Mandela, that I had made intensely and caught listening to the music, trying to understand what the music music was signifying, you know, because music has intrinsic meaning, which is a very strange thing.

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       Now, the part of the reason for that is that language has meaning and our language has a musical quality, right? And that's process mostly by the right hemisphere, so that when people speak, there's a, there's a melody in their language and that carries a lot of the emotional import. And then what musicians have done is figured out how to use that, that, that, that musical faculty, let's call it that, no one semantic musical faculty to sort of purely denote meaning. That's part of what music means. And so, but I was still trying to understand what the meaning was. You know what, because it's the meaning of music and I was trying to figure out how to articulate that. And that's partly why I made the, the sculpture was to get a grip on it and to understand it in anyways, I was really, really concentrating hard on that.

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       Mandela and that sculpture and I had been working on it intensely for about three months, you know, so that's a lot of meditation on a single idea. And I was standing in my living room and then I had this very strange experience. I, I, and I, I can't explain this properly because there's no way of really describing it, but I'll do my best. So you know, when those renaissance painting sometimes you see, well first of all, you see great cloud, great, great sunny skies with, with massive what? Stupendous impressive bills of clouds and then light shining through the sunlight shining through in streams. Sometimes that's captured very beautifully by especially English later, later artists usually that or later than the renaissance. But you see it renaissance paintings too. And you all, you also see it in, in, in renaissance paintings, especially in the earlier phase of the renaissance, the sky opening up in God sort of peering for through the clouds.

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       And that's exactly what seemed to happen to me is that I had this sense, it was like a vision, although I was still in my living room in Nuuk, but inside the theater of, of my imagination, I could feel the, the sky opening up now, it wasn't the sky, it was, I would say the only way I can really think about it is that with was something like another dimension and then I can feel this force descend upon me, which I think was something that, you know, would have been considered classically something like the holy ghost I suppose. And it filled me with this intense sense of, of, of, of, of Paradise. A Paradise Ul. Wow. I don't know how to say it though.

Speaker 3:          00:25:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       While it was like being in heaven for some, some, some brief period of time and I could feel myself transformed, transmuted as a consequence of this experience. And, and it was as if I was in the presence of something that was living, you know, and I, I suppose that was an experience of God, if you want to put it that way. Um, that's certainly what it seemed like an, and I felt that I could live that way. I could live transfigured like that permanently if I desired it. And I thought, my God, I wouldn't be able to walk down the street in this sort of elevated state, let's say. I don't know how I would act. I don't know how he would interact with people. I don't know how people would interact with me. I just don't think that I could do it. And then I felt that whatever had descended, it seemed that as if it was soro full in it and it, and it departed from me slowly and um, with no, like with no punitive intent.

Speaker 1:          00:26:30       And, and I wouldn't say with any dissatisfaction, it was as if the gift had been offered that I wasn't in no position to receive. And, uh, I went, I talked to my wife soon afterwards. I shook for about physically for about half an hour after that, uh, experience like, like I was shaking, you know, like, like, like you shake after a car accident if you've ever been in a car accident. And my pupils were completely dilated and I had a couple of experiences like that, like echoes of it a couple of times after that. And so anyways, that was a very, very powerful experience. I've certainly never forgotten that. And um, well, you know, I dunno why, I dunno what to think about that. I mean, God only knows what the world is really like, that's for sure. And I've had a variety of very strange experiences that have convinced me that we know very little about anything.

Speaker 1:          00:27:16       So, um, for those who are very creative but high in neuroticism, how should one work to gain emotional stability in order to go out into chaos to do more creative things? That's a really good question. You know what? I learned about that by reading Ewing's works on El Camino, weirdly enough. And so back again in graduate school when I was writing, starting to write maps and meaning and really tearing myself apart psychologically, I'm trying to understand evil, I suppose the evil of the Cold War and the evil of the individuals who compose Nazi Germany and Stella, this Russia. Um, uh, I, I was reading Carl Jung because he, he, he wrote his tracks on alchemy where a lot about self transformation and he talked about, uh, it's hard to explain his works on Alchemy, but suffice it to say that his advice was something like, the advice he derived from the alchemist was that if you are going to make mess around with very complicated and dangerous matters, that's a good way of putting it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       That you should really put your life together. And so I would say the right way to deal with your neuroticism is to increase your conscientiousness because we also know that the higher your conscientiousness, the lower year neuroticism conscientiousness does seem to keep neuroticism and check. And so I would say, and have said this to many people, um, clean your room, organize your life, like get a routine, get up every day at the same time. Go to bed at the same time. Established disciplined habits and that will help a lot schedule like, and here's how to use a schedule. Use it. Use a calendar. I use Google calendar, but don't use it as a tyrant. You know, you want to use your, use a calendar as if it's your, um, your confidant and advisor. And what you want to do is use the calendar, sit down and open the calendar and think, okay, well here's what I'm going to do.

Speaker 1:          00:29:02       I'm going to design a week of days that I would really like to have. So what that would mean is that you would schedule things that you would consider meaningful and productive, you know, on a daily basis so that you feel that your life is justified by having a day like that. And also to schedule enough of your responsibilities so that you make progress day by day instead of falling farther behind. And what that'll do is it doesn't directly affect your neurophysiology, but you know, you're reacting as a neurotic person, a person high in neuroticism say you react to uncertainty and the unexpected with more physiological preparedness and more expenditure of energy than the typical person. And so what you want to do is organize your surroundings because it's a lot easier to organize your surroundings at least to begin with than it is to do radical reconstruction on your fundamental temperament, which you might not be able to do at all.

Speaker 1:          00:29:57       So I would say discipline, discipline. And the other thing I would say for creative people, and this is true for people in general, but it's really important for creative people, is that if you want to be creative, which is very, very dangerous and very, very unlikely to succeed, although absolutely necessary if you happened to be high in openness, is that you should organize the rest of your life except for your creative endeavors in a pretty traditional and conservative manner. If you can do that, because what that does is buttress you against the unexpected and give you some stability on many, you know, along many of the potential dimensions of your life. And that frees you up to take larger risks in the creative domain. Now it's hard for creative people to do that because they're sort of blasting out, you know, laterally in all directions simultaneously.

Speaker 1:          00:30:44       But you exhaust yourself that way and you also risk scattering yourself. Um, Louie waterson here at, at a question, how would you suggest someone who's a jack of all trades and master of none conduct themselves while you're probably high in openness, high in creativity. And one of the dangers of being high and creativity, especially if you're also high in neuroticism, is that it's hard for creative people to catalyze an identity because they're basically pan like, you know, like Peter Pan or like, or like Pan, which means everything that God of the forest is the god of everything to some degree. And the problem with being everything is that you're also nothing at the same time because you never specialized. And so I would say that if you're, I think that being a jack of all trades, it's pretty damn useful. But I would also say that it's really necessary to buckle down and find one primary motive discipline and Jack or Louie.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       If you can't figure out what you should do, then guess, just pick something that you think that you could hit hard and concentrate on. You don't have to be perfect at it. You don't even have to get it right, but pick something rather than nothing or pick something rather than all things. And then set yourself to master that because you know, you need to have a, uh, um, uh, discipline, a primary discipline. It's absolutely necessary to succeed in life. Now, once you have a primary discipline, then you can branch out and become a multiplicity in your disciplined approach. And then you're absolutely bloody unstoppable. But you really need that initial disciplinary routine. You know, this is something neat you knew, knew very well. He said, for example, I just wrote about this today, that um, it was the long unfreedom of, of Europe subjugation to the dogmatic structures of the Catholic Church that in noble the European mind and gave it the capacity to widely range that it eventually developed.

Speaker 1:          00:32:36       But it was that initial subjugation, that initial voluntary slavery that produced the discipline that produced the spirit that can then go out and do other things. And it's really, really useful to subjugate yourself something to something voluntarily. You know, I think that's partly why it's useful to practice a religious faith because you subject yourself to a disciplinary structure that way. And you might think, well that's all oppressive and all of that. And of course that's true, but it also makes you disciplined. And once you're disciplined, like you're, you're like a sharpened sword man, like well tempered blade and then you can go out there and operate in the world. So, and if you haven't found your passion, then I would say, well don't wait around till you find the damn thing because you may never find it is pick something and focus on it, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:33:21       And if you move strongly and forthrightly towards it for a number of months at least, or even a number of years, and then you find, well that wasn't the thing for you, it isn't going to be a waste anyways because most of the time the pursuit of any discipline, knowledge pays off even if it doesn't pay off in the way that you initially expect. So Alex Burnstein said, what is the female equivalent of the hero archetype? Hmm, that's a great question man. Um, I spent a lot of time thinking about this and of course the women in my class and perhaps some of the women online to are irritated or, or put off or maybe just alienated and perhaps properly sold by the fact that the archetypal hero is masculine. Now there's complex reasons for that and I would recommend for those who are actually interested in such things to read Eric Noi Amens the origins and history of consciousness and also the great mother, which are two great works of union psychology.

Speaker 1:          00:34:16       Uh, Camille Paglia, by the way, is a big fan of both of those books. For those of you who might be interested because Norman does the best job that I know of, of describing why the symbolism of the hero is laid out the way it is. Why Mother Nature, his mother feminine and why the hero is masculine now, now. But here's how I've come to understand it and I'm going to use Christian symbolic language because I uh, because it's, it's the quickest, it's the shortest route to this sort of explanation. So I would say that in the male psyche, the Dragon, the dragon slaying hero is at the forefront. And so that would be Christ in the architectural mode. Because this dragon, he defeats is the evil that that is encompassed in, in within the figure of Satan. So that'd be like the ultimate dragon. And then behind that is the feminine, that compassionate, the caring.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       And that would be embodied say in the Christian figure of Mary. So you have an in both male, in the male and female soul, let's say you have Christ and Mary, but in the mail, Christ is foremost, foremost, that's the dragon slayer, we'll say. And Mary is the secondary character. And although both should be very well developed and, and, and, and that means that makes for a much better character. And in the female, it's the other way around is that the maternal slash feminine. So let's say Mary is, is at the forefront and Christ is in the background, the dragon slayers, the background, but should be well developed. Um, young felt that, you know, it was possible for men to develop the more feminine side of themselves, especially in the last half of life, which is also when he felt that women should develop the more masculine side of themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       And you know, we can, could debate that, but it's a perfectly reasonable proposition. Now we should note that the figure of Mary is actually, uh, is, is actually, what would you say, a heroic figure in and of itself, because like you can really understand this. If you look at Michelangelo's Pieta. So in that great sculpture, you see Mary Who's holding the crucified Christ and that's basically her son, right? Her, her, her son, who's just being offered up to the world and betrayed by his friends and broken on the cross. In other words, he's being subject to the worst that life can throw at him. And the thing about Mary is that she knew initially when she agreed to give birth to the savior of mankind, that he would be broken. And that's an archetypal story because women know in their heart of hearts that their children are going to be broken and killed by the world.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       That that's the human condition. And so there's a car. And of course a woman who's a, who's a woman who's well developed, loves her child more than herself, loves her job more than anyone else, which is something you can't really understand until you've had a child. But he's still willing to bring that child into the world knowing full well what his or her fate will be. And so there's a real heroism and APP. And so, and then there's the standard here wisdom that a woman can undertake where she develops her masculine side, which is basically what happens for example, in sleeping beauty, when, when, when sleeping beauty is awakened by the princess kiss. You can think of that. You can think of her being rescued by an actual man. But you can also think of that as the masculine part of her psyche, waking up her unconscious femininity so that the two of them can unite and rule the kingdom.

Speaker 1:          00:37:22       It's perfectly reasonable interpretation of that story. And so, and so that would be the development of the masculine side in, in, in a female that decide that stout stalwart and forthright and willing to go forth into the world and con and conquer uncertainty. And, and then there's the beauty and the beast archetype, which I think is, is in some sense the primary female sexual archetype and beauty and the beast is another kind of dragon slaying story. It's more like a dragon taming story, I suppose, where the, the woman, um, the virginal woman who's, who's out for an adventure finds a beastly male. And that's the dangerous man that I was talking about earlier, right? The man who has the capacity say to kill the capacity to harm the capacity for violence at hand, right at hand, and then proceeds to tame him, which is a real adventure.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       And you know, we know that this is the case because again, we can refer to those, you know, bro or those raw rom coms that are so popular now with the failed Beta males always trying to make friends with the girl and failing. The girls are interested in the rough guys who have, who have the capacity to also be sophisticated and to be, let's not say tamed, but civilized into channeling their harsh roughness, their capacity for evil, even into productive competition. And, and because competition can be very productive. And then the sharing fourth of the fruits of that competition with, with family. And so those are all heroic aspects of feminine being and, and they're not to be taken lightly there. Major life tasks and major life contributions, you know. And I guess another part of the heroic element of the female is the subjugation of her own privacy with regards to her child.

Speaker 1:          00:39:07       Because my daughter just had a child by the way. So I'm a grandfather, so hooray for that. And it went really nicely. And I'm so happy about that because a, I love my daughter and be, I really, really liked kids. I think they're so great. And so now I've got to have kid around again. So that's great. But I mean, you know, one of the things you notice very rapidly if you're a parent is that you bring someone into the world who is now more important under all circumstances than you are. And there's a, there's a heroic subjugation of selfishness that's, that goes along with that. That's characteristic. Deeply characteristic of the property, develop feminine spirit. So what is that that you are doing to avoid becoming arrogant? You're current situation is very inviting for that. Yeah, well I would say a good dose of existential terror curia that you know, there's a, there's a saying in the old testament that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and like, first of all, and there's some real truth in that, you know, like I don't want to make a mistake.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       And so I live in constant terror that I'm going to utter some damning phrase that's going to sync everything I've done. And so I'll tell you, if you feel that way about the situation, then either probability that you're going to be arrogant. It's pretty damn low and like I don't feel I have any reason to be arrogant. You know, like here's, here's something you could do if you're really interested in this, but it's really hard. There's a paper by Carl Jung called the relations between the ego and nonconscious and it's an unbelievably brilliant paper. It's very difficult to understand, but it has to do with what young called ego inflation. And so imagine that as you move up a hierarchy of authority or competence, we're not going to call them dominance or power hierarchies because I don't think that's reasonable. But as you move up, you know you're, you have the, you have the temptation of having your ego inflate to match your hypothetical position of status.

Speaker 1:          00:40:56       But what that is is in some sense the taking on of the archetype as if it's a personal triumph or a personal construct or a per personal invention, and you'll one very, very strongly against that. And he knew what he was talking about because of course you had his followers and was an extraordinarily powerful man from a spiritual and a physical perspective. He was certainly no pushover and a very brave person and he had the temptation of becoming, well, a cult leader for example, which people have accused him of being in, which he certainly wasn't and he knew that, you know, if you, if you have the privilege of in a, in a hierarchy, what that means, if that rising is real, is that the archetype is operating through you and that you can't take credit for that. You have to, you have to separate your personality in some sense from the architect.

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       I can give you a funny example of that. It's like, and I hope that nobody takes this wrong, but it's very comical. You know how all the superheroes have an alter ego. So you can't be superman unless you're also Clark Kent and you can't be, well, Batman isn't such a good example because he gets to be playboy billionaire like iron man, but Superman's better example. You know, he's this mild mannered in meek reporter and without that he can't be superman. It's like, well that's the reason that's such a well established comic trope is because comics are deeply mythological. And there's the idea there that the person has these two elements. One is the archetipal and it's associated with the infinite. It's like the God in man. You could say that. Um, there's a great icon by the way of Christ as pantokrator. One of the very earliest icons that show him with two different facial halves.

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       The eyes are different and the face is asymmetrical and one one face is the face of God have faces to have face of God and the other is the half face of man. And he's holding a book. It's, I'm having Jonathan Pashto who's a brilliant carver. I'm having him carved me that image so that I can put it in my front porch because I love it in a Christ is holding a book. And so, you know, it's, it's such a beautiful image, this idea of man as a duality between the finite and the infinite and, and simultaneously holding forth this, you know, wealth of knowledge that's been gathered by the human race. It's mine mind expanding visual imagery. Anyways, I mean, back to the arrogance issue is that, you know, I'm, I'm so Kara co I'm so what would you say attuned to the fact that I'm barely staying on that line between chaos and order and that any foolishness on my part or any attempt to manipulate the situation for my own, let's say selfish, personal gain, you know, that sort of impulsive, um, and, and shallow and immature and, and, and shortsighted personal gain that, that, that willingness or wished to Lord it over other people or to feel in some sense superior man.

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       If I go there with the exposure that I've got right now, I'd be so fast that it wouldn't even be funny. And that would not be pretty and I would not want that. So I'm, I'm doing my best man to keep myself on the ground and whereas where I want to be and I've got my family to help me without and I've got my friends who are offering me, you know, corrective criticism on an ongoing basis and I listened to the negative comments on eat on youtube and I try to pay attention to them and evaluate them and not just dismiss them out of hand. You know, if their crude or crass or any of those things, then I'm less likely to pay attention to them. But you know, even when I'm called far right, I pay attention to that. You know, because well you got to listen to your enemy.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       That's the thing. That's another new testament. In junction you should listen to your enemy because your enemy will tell you things about yourself that no one else will tell you. Now, some of those things might not be true, but some of the might be. And if your enemy tells you something terrible about yourself, that's true, then he's immediately become your best friend. Because you bloody well want to know if there's something terrible about you so that you can get it rectified before it ruins your life and ruins your family's life and you know, detrimentally affects the course of the world and all of that. So, um, in one of your lectures you said the film frozen was garbage. I don't think I said garbage. I think I said reprehensible propaganda, which I believe it was. Can you elaborate on your thoughts on the film? I can't because I haven't seen it recently enough to, um, the only thing I can say is that I left the film with a strong sense that it was produced for ideological reasons and it was produced as a sort of anti sleeping beauty.

Speaker 1:          00:45:23       And I felt that was entirely inappropriate because it wasn't a genuine artistic attempt. It was an ideological statement. I actually really liked [inaudible] I hope I'm pronouncing that properly. I thought it was that. I liked that, you know, that little girl in the movie allied herself with is very, very powerful but rather uncivilized masculine force. And I thought they got the archetypal balance in that film really quite, really quite nicely. So I thought it was quite beautifully done. So I liked Marianna quite a bit. What were you like when I was 25? Hmm, well, I was obsessed. I'm 25, so that would have been 87. I'd been in graduate school for two years. Well, you know, um, when I was 25 or so, I probably weighed about 138 pounds. I smoked like a pack of cigarettes day. I drank tremendous amount of alcohol. I was from northern Alberta, this rough little town up in northern Alberta called fairview.

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       And you know, there were long winters there and my friends were heavy drinkers and most of them dropped out of school by the time they were 15 or 16. Went off to work on the oil rigs. And you know, it was a rough town and we drank a lot. And I started when I was 14. And you know, um, and so I was, I had a lot of bad habits, let's say, and, uh, things that were, and I wasn't in great shape physically, and I was also still intellectually obsessed by as I am now. And, uh, so that would've been, that would've been an 85, but when I, but I decided around that about 85, 84 or something like that, maybe a little earlier that I was really going to try to get my act together. And, uh, so I started doing that. I, you know, I, first of all, I quit smoking.

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       Oh, that took a long time because I eventually had to quit drinking too in order to quit smoking. And I started working out, started playing sports, which I'd never done. I was a small kid. I been skipped a grade and I was a small, small for my age. So sports were never, especially team sports were never really a domain of expertise for me. Um, although I skied and went trapping with my dad, went, you know, cross country skiing and camping and all that. So, but, uh, when I went to graduate school, I started swimming the first, the first, uh, physical exercise routine I did, I enrolled in a swim suicides course, I think it was called. So it was me and this like really overweight kid and like these 60 year old women and men, they could out exercise me like mad. It was really embarrassing me in the overweight kid, you know, we'd be just panting ourselves three quarters to death at the end of the bloody workout in these 60 year old women who weren't in great shape or like, you know, chatting away as if nothing was going on at all in the pool.

Speaker 1:          00:48:03       So that was quite embarrassing. And as was going to the weight room, you know, because when I started I could barely best bench press 75 pounds and people used to keep coming over and helping me, which was last thing I bloody well wanted but certainly needed. And I got to the point where I could bench press 225 pounds. I think that was the best I did. And I gained about 30 pounds of muscle in a year and a half. So that was good thing. So like I was kind of a wild man and you know, I'm a little bit manic in my, in my, uh, temperament and so, you know, I was, I was kind of going every direction at the same time, so, and uh, you know, I don't regret that I had a fine time when I was a kid and uh, I needed really to get disciplined and I had to do it because I was working on these hard problems that, you know, that I've been discussing with all of you and I've been working on them really, you know, obsessively since I was probably about 18, maybe even earlier than that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       Got to the point around 25 when I was in graduate school trying to get my Phd's doing all my research. Like I published 15 papers by the time I graduated with my phd, which was by I think by a fairly large measure, the most papers that any graduate student at that time it ever published at mcgill. I think that's right. Might have been twice as many or maybe twice as many, maybe even three times as many. And at the same time I wrote maps of meaning, which was a terrible, terrible, terribly difficult thing to do cause I was writing about three hours a day doing that and I couldn't do all that and continue with my misbehavior. You know, my sort of my, what would you say? My, my, my hedonistic, my hedonistic ma, my massive hedonistic consumption of alcohol and all of that. I just couldn't keep it up and also work seriously on the issues that were at hand.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       So you know, I had to stop. That's a sacrifice I had to stop messing about and straight myself out. And I, I got married when my, the woman who is my wife Tammy, who I've known since she was eight years old, she lived across the street from me and this little town called fairview and I was in love with her like the first time I saw her, which is quite bloody thing. So that's worked out pretty well for me. But she came to live with me about the same time. And, you know, we decided jointly to get our act together and we swore that we tell each other the truth, which I think she's actually done better than me. Like I don't think, I don't think she's lied to me ever in our entire marriage, which is unbelievable. You know, it's been so useful because I can really tell her things that we can really talk. So I tell you, if you want to have a good relationship, man, you embedded in the truth. Because if you don't embed it in the truth, you don't have a relationship. It's, it's just lies. It's, it's a tissue of lies and it will, it will dissolve in the chaos as soon as a crisis comes along. So the truth is a terrible thing, but not, not compared to false hood. So, all right. So let's look at the live chat here.

Speaker 3:          00:50:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       Please get a better quality microphone. While I'm really hoping that the microphone that I'm using right now is working well, um, it should be, it's a really good microphone. It's a, it's, um, um, what do you call on a road? And I thought I was using it for quite a while there, but I'd reorganized my office and I actually had unplugged the road. And so my voice was unwittingly, unbeknownst to me coming through this little, um, large tech, high def micro or a video camera that I have on top of my speakers. And it might even be doing that for now. Right now as you know, for all I know, I hope not. No, it says the microphone is road in team n t u s B. So, um, maybe God, I hope so. Anyways. You know, I've been mastering a lot of technical equipment in the last year and so I've got most of it under control, but I don't know if I have all of it under control. So some fan, and I wish I remembered his name because he deserves it. Sent me this microphone. So Hooray for him and hopefully I'm, I'm going to get access to it. So, um, let's see here.

Speaker 1:          00:52:27       I'm 20. My parents had made it clear they don't want me to leave home. They are both drug addicted,

Speaker 1:          00:52:34       depressed and antisocial. How do I leave without killing? The only positive relationship they have. Well I think you'll have to ask yourself a different question. I think you might have to ask yourself the question of how do you maintain that positive relationship into the future if you don't leave and have your own life. You know, cause you have to be thinking over five year periods here or even decades. And first of all, you deserve to have your own life. Like your parents should be fostering your independence. It's their moral duty to foster your independence. Now hopefully they can do that in a way that makes you strong and that makes you better able to have a relationship with them. But they have no right to use their, their, their dependence, let's say as an, as an impediment to you becoming independent drug, addicted, antidepressant and anti antisocial.

Speaker 1:          00:53:20       Despite all of that, they should be saying, you get the hell away from us as fast as you can and you get out there and have a life. And if you can put yourself together and we get to see you from time to time, wouldn't that be a wonderful thing? So you know, you, you, you don't get in your children's way, you don't get in your children's way. So, um, I would say, and I can't give you advice because I don't know you and the devil's always in the details, but I can say generally that you won't be able to maintain a positive relationship with your parents if you do. So at the cost of your own destiny. Let's say that that isn't going to work out. So when no one has the right to deprive you of that destiny, family or not, man, you're to operate out there in the world like an independent soul and to make your way through the world and to offer what you have to offer and those who love you should be behind you and encouraging you to do that in every possible way. And if they aren't, then you have to seriously think about whether or not a, whether or not they have your best interest in mind and B, whether or not it might be better for you and for them if you went and did what you needed to do anyways. So I would say that. So.

Speaker 3:          00:54:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:29       Do you have in mind a more specific breakdown of the social sciences? I presume you mean in relationship to the postmodern, neo, Marxist and have taken over so much of the university? I would say philosophy seems to be in pretty good shape, strangely enough. It isn't exactly clear why. Um, that's mostly my impression. I would say that in the rest of the university, if the discipline has at least one foot in science, then it's relatively safe. And so I would say psychology is relatively safe discipline because it's quite nicely constrained by the necessity of taking biology into account. That's less true with social psychology. But it's certainly true with clinical psychology and it's even more true with neuroscience and the animal behavioral side of things and stay, well statistics, statistics isn't science, but at least it's a rigorous methodology methodologically. If the discipline is very heavy, heavily theoretically theory dependent, like say sociology or let's say women's studies, which I have virtually no respect for.

Speaker 1:          00:55:23       Um, not that that's really relevant because whether or not I respect it isn't the issue. The issue is whether or not it actually is a high quality discipline. And I don't believe it's a high quality discipline at all. I would also say though, if you're, and I'm going to make a video about this in the next couple of weeks and advice to university students when I launched that website, had been talking about that helps. It'll help people identify their courses as postmodern slash neo Marxist so that they can either take them if they want to be indoctrinated or avoid them if they want to actually have an education. I would say it's your responsibility, you know, um, it's your responsibility to get educated at university and sort of, despite the university we could, we could say that, um,

Speaker 1:          00:56:10       you, there are great books. You can find out what they are and you can read them and you know what the university does. And Society is our, for you and identity for four years, you're a student, you're a university student. And so that's a credible identity. It offers you a lot of freedom. And so you might say, you might have to get educated despite your courses and you know, you think, well that's a bad deal because the courses should be educating you. It's like, well, you got to look at it from a more realistic perspective. You can't expect the university to be a perfect institution any more than you're a perfect person and at least it offers you an identity to shield yourself with while you're undergoing the difficult process of educating yourself. And so I would say,

Speaker 2:          00:56:51       um, you know, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:56:56       take responsibility for education. Find professors that you respect and who's who and who, who, who, who challenge you. And, and don't, don't fall prey to the, to the, to the cynical attitude that, you know, you take the course for the grade or that you should write what the professor wants to hear. I mean, you have to be a real corrupt professor before you'll mark a student for, for producing an opinion contrary to yours. That's high quality. I mean, even the more corrupt professors even in the more corrupt disciplines I think are fairly rarely guilty of that sort of thing. So, um, anyways, if it's grounded in science, it's more likely to be

Speaker 2:          00:57:35       b, a

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       reliable, that's the first thing to do. But the second thing is, and the second thing is to know what's your responsibility to get educated. And the libraries are full of great books. You can figure out what the great books are. You know, in half an hour you could make list of 50 great books. I have one on my website. You can read all those, you know, that takes about two years probably to really do a proper job of it. We read the great classics, Scientific and Literary, historical, all of that. You'll get educated and then you'll be sharp and coherent and articulate and powerful and able to formulate arguments and able to negotiate and able to formulate problems and solve them. And you know, that's exactly what you should be doing when you get educated and it has tremendous, tremendous economic value. And that includes education in the humanities. So, all right. Did I fail any classes in university? I had to retake stats. I wasn't good at stats. I got it eventually. Um, I needed to know,

Speaker 1:          00:58:34       well, I'm no mathematical genius, we can start with that. But I also needed to know, I couldn't take the assumptions on faith, which was really quite problematic. And so I couldn't just memorize, you know, I had to understand and that didn't work out so well for stats analysis. It didn't understand at that time that I had to keep up with it sort of rigorously. But I got to be a pretty decent statistician. At least I understand the statistics now. So yeah, I didn't do very well in statistics, but most of my grades otherwise were they in my grades in high school except for grade 10, when I bet my dad that I could get a straight eighties. And I think God, exactly that, um, my grades in junior high and high school are pretty dismal because I absolutely detested school. Partly for my own reasons, you know, because of my own problems, but an immaturity. But also because I found it painfully unchallenging

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       let's say. Um, but in university, college and university, I got very good grades and which was a good thing because I would have never got into clinical graduate school without that. So yeah, to 25 pounds isn't bad. Yeah. Well I only weighed one 60, so you know, it was pretty good. I thought it was funny because it was only one day I was able to manage that. I could do 200 with fair bit of regularity and a bench press. But one day man, I did two oh five and that worked and I did two 10 in that worked and I got all the way to two 25 and I was never able to duplicate it again. So that was pretty interesting. So jared, chance as you claim hierarchies are efficient enough yet you claim 99% of creative people get stuck at the bottom. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:00:02       Well that's not a contradiction. Um, what kind of propels you up? Hierarchies of authority is intelligence and conscientiousness. Right? And so then you might say, well, what about creativity? And it looks like creativity. Creativity is, as you sort of know, is an out of the box phenomena. And the problem is, is that if you're within a hierarchy, there's a ladder upward that you can climb rung by rung. And basically to do that you have to do your damn job. Now. Now you might say, yeah, well isn't creativity, you know, necessary. And the answer to that is absolutely, but it's not that useful when you're at the bottom because who the hell wants to hear your damn creative ideas when you're just starting out? You know you're just a pain in the neck even if you're right, even if you're brilliant, you're just a pain in the neck if you're creative at the bottom because you come up with all these radical ideas that are going to shape out, shake up the structure of the hierarchy, and plus you haven't what indicated your credibility of demonstrated your credibility to any great degree.

Speaker 4:          01:00:57       So people are going to just write you off as a, they'll just going to write you off because it's easier than taking you seriously. Now, the funny thing is, is that as you climb up the hierarchy, creativity becomes increasingly necessary until when you're at the very top, it's absolutely vital. And many, many companies suffer from the fact that they, um, would you say promote conscientious people continually up the ladder and then they end up at the top with no creative people. But it's hard for the creative people to climb to the top because creativity isn't one of those things that ratchets you up a hierarchy of competence. So, so there are efficient on the conscientious end and efficient on the intelligent and but creativity is a whole different thing. I mean partly because how the hell do you evaluate a creative person? You can't by definition, because to have a structure of devaluation means that something has to be done in a tried and true and measurable manner.

Speaker 4:          01:01:51       And that is what a creative person does. He like, they make a left turn, you know, 90 degree turn and they say, well, I'm going to do it completely differently. It's like, well how are you? How is someone going to evaluate you if you do that now you might be right and you know, creative people are often wrong but sometimes and vitally dead right when no one else's. But it's a really, it's really problematic. I mean, if you're a creative person, you're your best bet I would say is to discipline yourself and ground yourself in something relatively practical that will enable you to eek out some sort of living. And then to practice your creative endeavor on the side, you can head, ha ha, you can head to head long into it and try to make money and be creative at the same time. But I'll tell you, man, my experience has taught me, and this is a lot of experience and a lot of watching and it's not something I'm happy to say, is that it's very, very, very, very difficult for creative people to monetize their creativity.

Speaker 4:          01:02:42       And most of the time it's an exercise in futility. So what you have to do is stabilize yourself in some sort of productive and traditional domain. And then, you know, use your extra time to work creatively and see if you can branch out that way. You know, you can always try to start a small business to, or even a big business. But again, not some, that's a high risk, high return proposition. And Yeah, actually there's a technology that goes along with that too. You can't do that like a fool, you know, you have to know what you're doing in order to do that. So, um, what evil daddy will enslave the human race come the eclipse. I think that's probably the god Keck. That would be my guess as far as I'd been able to tell us. So forth. Could you please tell the difference between equity and equality and why is equity dangerous?

Speaker 4:          01:03:28       Well, it's not actually equity and equality. It's equity and equality of opportunity. Well, you know, it's a truism, I think that's agreed upon by liberals and conservatives alike, that the interests of individuals and society are best served by opening the door to the participation of all who are qualified regardless of their, uh, of attributes in domains that have nothing to do with the qualifications for the position. So imagine that as a worker, um, and that would include managers, executives, et Cetera. As a worker, you have a function like a tool. You're a tool. And, and I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't be too down on that. It's good to be good for something. And um, we W W it's in society's best interest that those who are able to be the most efficient tools are the ones that are placed in the position. And so you want to open up the competitive landscape to all players, not least so that society can most effectively exploit the people who are most productive.

Speaker 4:          01:04:29       Now it also has the side benefit of allowing individuals to utilize their talents and to take their place in the social world. But people are very diverse in their abilities, like incredibly diverse in their abilities and that's mostly evidence for example, in the domain of intelligence, you know, because while the, the, the range that includes the majority of people runs from an Iq of about 85 or let's say 72, an Iq of 130, although there's plenty of people who are outside those domains is like at 70, you're pretty intellectually impaired, right? You're not going to graduate from high school with an Iq of 70, except under very, very extreme circumstances with an Iq of 83, which is about 10% of the population, 85 is 15%. You're going to have a hard time reading well enough to follow instructions it on with an Iq of 115.

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       You're going to do pretty well at uh, uh, sort of mid level community college. And so an Iq of 145 is going to prepare you for like high success and complex domain, say like law or, or managerial positions where the environment is transforming very radically. There is immense differences between people in their cognitive ability and so and in their conscientiousness and in their negative emotionality and all and in their energy levels and oh and in their creativity and all sorts of traits. And because of that, that individual diversity, there's no reason to assume that there is going to be equality of outcome. And that's what equity is. I've got to change the battery in my camera

Speaker 3:          01:06:36       and we're back.

Speaker 4:          01:06:46       Apologies for that. With this Dlsr Dslr, whichever it is. Um, there's some, I won't go into it. I have to change the battery boat about after about an hour or so. Anyways, back to intelligence. Um, what was I saying? Talking about individual differences and the differences. Differences in intelligence. Oh yeah. Equality of outcome. Well, the only way, given the wide range of human capacity,

Speaker 3:          01:07:26       mmm.

Speaker 4:          01:07:28       First step for you don't want to, uh, organize your society

Speaker 4:          01:07:36       such that every single category of outcome has exactly proportional representation from every single possible category of person. Because that isn't you. You have to use so much social force in order to make that occur. That the consequences, the negative consequences will far outweigh the benefits. It's better to open up the marketplace to allow a very large range of hierarchies to emerge. And then to let people compete for their position to compete and cooperate for their own positions. And the other problem with equity is like who the hell is going to make the, who's going to decide which groups are to be categorized? You want to, here's an example for you. Let's imagine you stratify the population by Iq, which, which we do by the way. Although, although we don't do it as evidently and obviously as we do say, buy sex or perhaps even by race, are you, would you actually recommend that an equal number of people be drawn from every category of Iq to be surgeons?

Speaker 4:          01:08:36       I mean, that's palpably absurd. So there's too much social engineering required to produce equity of outcome now, well, having said that as well, um, the, the, the historical data on equity are absolute declare. The societies that have tried to aim at equity are the terrible communistic societies of the 20th century and they were so goddamn ma so unbelievably murderous. And counterproductive that it beggars the imagination. And so I can't even believe we have a conversation about equity because it's such a pathological idea. It's, it's completely invalidated by the historical data. So, all right. What does my average daily schedule consist of? Well, that's fairly straight forward. I get up around somewhere between six and eight and then I work till 10 as, as hard as I can flat out every single day. So, and I've been doing that for, with very little variation, although it's been much more extreme in the last year for like, since 1985, like I work probably, well I work, I would say 14 hours a day, at least 14 hours a day.

Speaker 4:          01:09:44       And so that said about a hundred hours a week and that time that I don't do that, I spend with friends and, but mostly with my family. And so, um, yeah. And I work as efficiently as I possibly can. I'm always trying to do everything I can as fast as I possibly can. And I'm accustomed to that because like I said, I've been doing it for, I've been doing it for 30 years. So that's my daily schedule. And I don't know even what I would do if I didn't do that. Um, I have this cottage that I go to, although I generally spend time writing up there and I go swimming with my wife and we go canoeing and I can take a break in that way. But most of the time if I take a break even up at the cottage, generally what I do is like carpentry and fix the place up.

Speaker 4:          01:10:29       And I don't like to be unoccupied. I have to be occupied doing something productive all the time because otherwise I'm not pleased with myself. And so, I mean, you know, I decided a long time ago that I was going to try to live a hyper efficient and hyper productive life. And so it's been a challenge. I, uh, it's an enjoyable thing for me to some degree because I'm very interested in trying to figure out how much I can possibly do in the shortest period of time, all the time. And that keeps you alert and awake and it's a great challenge and it lends my life a substantial amount of meaning and it's, it's been very successful. So, um, you know, so that's kind of what it's like. Oh, okay. Let's see what else these chat people say, um, oh wow. Apparently.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       Broken mind. In tolstoy's confession, he talks about meaning in faith. He had many problems with religion and the church. How can a nonreligious person find a meaningful nonreligious faith? Oh, well, you know, it depends on what you mean by nonreligious. You know, I would say for broken mind, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:11:33       let's, I was thinking about this today. I was writing about this today. I was reading about Dostoyevsky as compared to Nicha, you know, and nature was a great critic of Christianity and so as Dostoyevsky, but dusty Yefsky I think trumped Nicha with regards to his attitude towards Christianity. And I think you could really see this. He could read the brothers [inaudible] I would really recommend that broken mind. Everything. Get your hands on Dostoevsky, read everything you can. He wrote cause Dostoyevsky re really and you like tolstoy's confession, you know, read Dostoyevsky. But you know, Dostoyevsky has this character in the brothers Karamazov um, Alioscha

Speaker 4:          01:12:08       and Osha is a monastic novitiate and who's kind of a naive guy intellectually, although very good person. I'm a simple person intellectually, let's say, perhaps not naive and he has this older brother Ivan, who is a devastating intellect and a handsome man and a rake with a women and like really, uh, like a well put together human being. Although quite nihilistic and cutting and his intellect and Ivan can absolutely demolish Ellie Osha in a debate and does quite regularly. But Ellie Osha basically wins the argument in the book, let's say as the book plays itself out by acting like a good person. And I would say, you know, if you want to develop a religious faith in some sense, forget about trying to develop faith in God. I don't think you can will yourself into that. I'm not even sure that you should, but I do think that you can decide that you're going to do what you can to live a meaningful life and be a good person and start to meditate on what that means and then to start to put it in practice.

Speaker 4:          01:13:05       And then you find your religious faith in the domain of action rather than conceptualization. And that's really the primary domain in which it should be manifested anyways. Like the, the primary Christian commitment for example, is the imitation of Christ, not the belief in his divinity, you know, or the belief that he died for the sins of mankind or any of that. And I'm not making light of that. But the primary moral injunction is to try to live the archetipal life within the confines of your own subjective being, to try to live the most divine life that you can. And if you try that and if you take that seriously and if you meditate upon that and ask yourself what it might mean, that I think you'll find the religious element of your life fleshing itself out quite nicely. So that's the answer to that question. Thoughts on the drug epidemic? Well, I'm not sure there is an epidemic any more than there always has been. I know that there is now a tilt towards drugs in, in the u s in particular like meth and, and, um, fentanyl and the other opiates. Now it's quite a catastrophe. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:14:16       a lot of that is occurring among people who don't have meaning in their lives. I would say you might think that's a fast I'll answer, but it's not, you know, like here, here's the wrap literature. Like it's, if you take a rat lab rat, typical lab rat is, you know, genetically bred to be identical with many other lab routes and he lives alone in a cage and he, he's got a pretty miserable route life because routes are social animals and they don't like to live in cages by themselves. And you can get a lab rat in a cage addicted to cocaine, cocaine and no time flat. And he'll, he'll like press a lever for cocaine reward to pretty much to the, to the exclusion of all else including sex and often including food. But if you take that same rat and you put them in a rat family, you know, in a rat social hierarchy, in a rat environment and give him something that rat rat like to do so that he can be satisfied, it's very difficult to get them addicted to cocaine.

Speaker 4:          01:15:10       And so I would say the reason that people take psychomotor stimulants and all the drugs have serious abuse or psychomotor stimulants regardless of what else they might be, they activate the dopaminergic system, which is the system that tracks reward and that that is associated, that's activated when you pursue velop valuable goal directed behavior. Um, if you don't have that, if you don't have a valid goal, if you don't have no, no real valid meaning in your life, you don't have a valid ambition, then you don't have any way of activating that system. And why the hell wouldn't you take drugs? It's like you have to have something better to do to not addict yourself, you know, so, so I would say that a huge part of the current epidemic in, in, in the u s in particular is, is manifest among broken men who have no real place in society and providing them with money isn't going to help that they need a productive and meaningful existence. And which is the paramount, the paramount goal should be the paramount goal of social, of social policy. For example, we, we, it isn't the alleviation of poverty. That's really the issue because people in the West aren't poor. There might be a bit of a distribution problem, but we're not poor. What we have is a, uh, what would you say? Hey, we have a problem of meaningful engagement and that's what has to be addressed and that's why I do the work that I'm doing. So

Speaker 3:          01:16:31       yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:16:32       Are you aware of the similarities in the work of Anthony Robbins and with lot of what you are doing in the self authoring suite? Um, I'm not specifically aware of the similarities, although I know that Anthony Robbins is a well known motivational speaker and generally motivational speakers try to motivate people to pursue something productive in their life. So, um, you know, I would say likely that there are motivational.

Speaker 3:          01:16:55       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:16:56       There are people who are concerned with motivation that are working at different levels of the communication strata. And I'm working at a fairly abstract level and hopefully Mr Robinson's working at a level that is productive, helpful to lots of people. He certainly had a very stable and long career. So, um, although I'm not aware of any specific similarities past that. So

Speaker 4:          01:17:23       what do you think about Adhd? I have it, I am frustrated by my failures in life because of it. I am trying to become a cam a chemist and I am failing at school. Um, I think adhd is a catch all diagnosis. I think that people who are extroverted and unconscientious for example, often manifest the traits of, of, uh, attention deficit disorder. Um, I know that there isn't any real evidence of longterm utility and cycle and cycle. What a psycho pharmacological treatment for Adhd. Um, I would say though, if you are having a hard time concentrating on your goals, that what you should probably do is set yourself up with a therapist, find someone you can talk to, you know, so see two or three therapists. I know it's expensive, but so is not having a life. Find someone you can talk to and then make it and someone practical, probably a behavioral therapist would be best.

Speaker 4:          01:18:15       And then have them set goals with you and help you strategize to stay on track week to week. That's the best thing. Or to set that up with a friend if he can't do it with the therapist. So that's, that's the best advice I have for that. And keep at it, man. You know, but break your, you gotta learn to schedule. You got to learn to break your days down into disciplined sub sections and you got to practice out at and practice at it. And there isn't an easier answer that I know of. But having someone that will help keep your responsible, I think can be useful. I've seen that be useful for people who have attention deficit disorder. Let's say

Speaker 4:          01:18:56       you compare at once compared religion and science as tools that can be used more accurately to understand your position. Do you think gender and biological sex are two tools in describing an identity? Not really. I think that most of what I think most of the work on gender is rubbish to put it bluntly. Um, I get what is meant by it. You know that there is a socio cultural layer specifying gendered behavior on top of biological sexual identity. But I think it's been so polluted by political idiocy that it's, it's a concept. It's almost entirely invalidated. It's used for perverse purposes. It's not used as a tool of understanding in most situations. So, um, I think that the concept of gender could be useful if it was used to specify the purely socio cultural layer of, of like sex type behavior. And I think it could conceivably be used in that way. But I see very little evidence that it ever is. So,

Speaker 3:          01:19:55       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:19:56       My brother is a soldier in Iraq as a clinical psychologist. What should one do when coming from such a chaotic place back to a tame and structured one? Well, I guess that would depend to some degree on exactly the nature of his experiences in Iraq. Um, so it's hard for me to elaborate on that further. I mean I would say though that one thing he could really do, and, and this is somewhat self serving I or could appear to be somewhat self serving I suppose is I would strongly recommend that your brother do the self authoring suite when he comes back because it'll help him and probably concentrated on the future authoring program to begin with because it might take a while when he gets back, before he can meditate on his experiences without that meditation being harmful. So for example, there's pretty good evidence if you've had a traumatic experience that you shouldn't re subject yourself to the traumatic experience repeatedly before say about 18 months or something like that is past. And it isn't exactly obvious why that's the case, but there's a pretty good literature indicating that it is. So I would say that when he makes the transition from Iraq back to enormous normative society, that the first thing you should do is generate a plan.

Speaker 3:          01:21:05       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:05       And our plan about how we would, and this would be the same even if you were coming out of something like prison or, or making a change, a radical change in your occupation, is you need a plan, right? You need a plan so that you can fake because you can't just make that adjustment without knowing what you're doing. So that's what I would recommend. And if he does come back traumatized, and I would say, you know, traumatic, traumatized soldiers often have to develop a very comprehensive philosophy of good and evil. And, and so that would either mean perhaps talking to a, a decent clinical psychologist about what his experiences were or perhaps reading some of the literature. And I've outlined those books on my website@jordanbpeterson.com that can be really helpful in understanding and helping someone understand the evils of atrocity and warfare didn't. And even the necessary evils, let's say, of atrocity and warfare. So, okay, let's see here. Do you think a lot of your work is the form of the bargaining stage of grief? No. No. I don't think that there's these stages of grief that had been identified. Uh, I can't remember who did the work. Um, um, it, it seems to have been quite helpful work for many people. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:22:25       but I don't think, I don't think I'm bargaining exactly. I don't think I'm suggesting that people bargain. I think I'm suggesting that people work in sacrificing, you could think about that as bargaining. Bargaining has the connotation more of pleading.

Speaker 3:          01:22:41       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:22:41       Well let's say, and I don't think that work and sacrifice constitute pleading. I, I think that they're actually really effective means of dealing with the world. And I think that people can be highly effective and competent much more than they think. And so, uh, it's an interesting question and I can see why you posed it, but, no, I don't. I don't believe it. So,

Speaker 3:          01:23:01       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:23:02       Could you comment on the Buddhist concept of impermanence and the nature of reality being given, being what gives it meaning? Oh yeah. That's a good one. And how that concept conflicts with ideas of eternal life in heaven. Jesus, man, that's a lot of questions. That's a lot of hard questions. Well, whoa. Let's start with, I'm going to only answer one of those. I think it's just too much effort to get all three of them in the same. It's like hitting three fast balls with the same swing of the bat. I don't think I can manage it.

Speaker 4:          01:23:34       How does the finite nature of reality give it? Meaning? How is it that the finite nature of reality is what gives it meaning? God, that's such a good question. Well, I can answer this. Oh, Bleakley I'm going to talk about something that happened to the comic book character Superman in the late seventies so superman was extraordinarily popular from the 1930s right up to the 1970s but one of the things that happened is that as he became more and more popular, he also got more and more powerful. Right? So by the 80s Christ, you know, you could bounce a hydrogen bomb off superman's chest and he could, he could juggle planets and you know, that's all well and good. Except what are you going to, what kind of adventure is he going to have? Right? Like, you know, if you can't blow them up with an a hydrogen bomb and he can juggle planets, nothing interesting can happen to him.

Speaker 4:          01:24:25       He can be anywhere he wants at any time and he can do anything he wants with no effort at, at, at, at, at an under any circumstances whatsoever. So he's like a permanent deus ex ex Makena. I think I've got that right, which is superman is boring because God always comes in at this last moment and saves him from whatever predicament he's in. Well, you know, contemplating that perversely enough can give you some appreciation for the finitude of life. It's like we're, we're like infinity captured in, in the finite, like, like a genie and capsulated in the, in the lamp, you know, and genius, the gene root word of genius by the way. So that's not an accidental comparison. And it's this strange combination of, of infinite capacity that characterized as human beings to some degree with this terrible finite limitation that does in fact make our lives the adventures that they are.

Speaker 4:          01:25:20       And so this is quite nicely documented in the Tao Te Ching, by the way. And I would really recommend, uh, the, the, the translation by Seth Rosenthal. I already think it's elegant and that the Taoists are very good at, at, at, at formulating the utility of nonexistence. In fact, I think there's actually a verse in the Tao Te Ching called the utility of nonexistence where they talk about the, the, the empty space in a part, giving it its utility and the, you know, the, so that's what the pot isn't in some sense that makes it what it is. And, and that's also the case with human beings is that we have these intense limitations that we can then attempt to transcend and that it's meaningful to transcend those limitations in such an interesting way. And I don't know what that means in the final metaphysical analysis, but you see that we do this voluntarily to ourselves too, because board people will place restrictions on themselves just for entertainment.

Speaker 4:          01:26:16       That's exactly what we do when we play a game. So, for example, if you're playing chess, you subject yourself to all sorts of arbitrary limitations, right? There's only a certain number of things you can do with the chessboard and the chest chessmen and then, um, you, you open up a whole universe of possibilities by adopting those limitations. And there's something about that that speaks deeply to the absolute nature of reality and maybe justifies the, the tragic finitude of being. It's something like that. And, and that's, that's how it looks to me. And I've thought about that quite deeply. So

Speaker 4:          01:26:51       can an introvert thrive in the field of law or should they avoid it altogether? Yes, actually we, we gathered a lot of, of data on lawyers and, and extroversion. It doesn't predict law. Uh, what would you say proficiency at law at all? It's not associated with it at all. Um, what predicts proficiency in law, his intelligence and conscientiousness. And then after that, relatively low agreeableness because it's a very competitive enterprise, high emotional stability. So low neuroticism, but introverted lawyers do fine. Now, if you're an introverted lawyer, there's going to be some challenges. And those challenges would be developing the social skills necessary, say to stand up in the courtroom if you happen to be a lawyer who's going to do courtroom work, but there's plenty of like solitary work that a lawyer can engage in. But then the other problem might be for an introverted lawyer that you know, you want to develop your web of connections, your social network, and of course you want to do that in any enterprise, right?

Speaker 4:          01:27:51       So it's a challenge for introverts in general. But I would say there's absolutely no reason whatsoever to assume that law is a discipline that an introvert should avoid. So, you know, go for it. But you need to be conscientious, right? Cause low. It really matters if you're conscientious as a lawyer and you should have a pretty decent verbal intelligence because otherwise it's going to be a hard road because the lawyers have to deal with an awful lot of verbal material and they have to formulate complex arguments. They have to be able to write and communicate. And so, you know, you got it. You want to think about those elements of your temperament more. I would say.

Speaker 3:          01:28:28       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:28:29       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:28:30       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:28:30       Dr. Peterson, do you believe the evidence for God lies primarily inner inner, inner, inner personal experiences?

Speaker 3:          01:28:45       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:28:48       Well, it, it lies to a great degree in interpersonal experiences, although I don't even know if you could call that necessarily evidence for God. It depends on what you're willing to accept as evidence. Like even that experience that I had, um, that I described earlier in the q and a isn't evidence for the existence of God. You know, it was, it was certainly a religious experience and I found it extremely, extremely compelling. But from a scientific perspective, it's almost worthless as evidence because it's purely subjective. Now, I think there are elements of experience that cannot be God at objectively. And so I'm willing to take subjective experience under some circumstances as evidence in so far as if I have a subjective experience that I find credible, I'm willing to act on what I believe to be its meaning. And so I'll test out my interpretation of that experience pragmatically. And that's good enough for me. I'm willing to consider that evidence, but you can't really consider that scientific evidence. So, um, but then what other evidence is there? Well, there's also, let's call it the evidence that's instantiated in the great religious texts of mankind, the great philosophical texts and the great literary text as well. And I wouldn't exactly call that subjective experience because you can, you can garner it through your exposure to culture and, but you know whether or not that constitutes evidence depends on what you're willing to define as and accept as evidence. So

Speaker 4:          01:30:21       I'm told that my overanalyzing is double edged sword, but I'm suffering from being this way. Yeah, well you're probably, you know, hi and openness and maybe you're very verbally intelligence, so you're pretty much stuck with that. Maybe you've got a bit of mania to you too. And I don't mean that in a negative sense. I find relief when I drink alcohol, smoke or take certain drugs because it slows down my thought process. How can I use my over analysis to my advantage? Well, I would say find yourself a difficult cognitive problem to solve. You know, pick a challenge, pick a challenge. But you know, you also might consider, you might consider talking to someone you find relief when you drink alcohol. That might be, that might be an indication that some of what you're overanalyzing isn't so much a consequence of access cognitive power, but an excessive of high negative emotion.

Speaker 4:          01:31:06       And so that would be illustrated in say high trait neuroticism. We're going to release the big five aspects scale here later this month and you'll be able to take that and it'll give you a pretty good detailed description of your personality. And there's two dimensions of neuroticism, withdrawal and volatility. And you know, if you're overanalyzing because you're, you're um, what do you call that? Ruminating that can be a consequence of high levels of anxiety. And the reason I'm suggesting that is because you said you find relief when you drink alcohol. And alcohol is a very powerful and anxiety lytic agent, antianxiety agent. And so lots of people who have high levels of anxiety do ruminate and so overanalyze, let's say. And they find relief when they drink because alcohol is a primary anxiety. Lytic like valium, like Benzodiazepines, barbiturates. So the fact that alcohol gives you relief probably indicates that some of what's driving your overanalysis is anxiety and then you could exercise can really help with that. I would also recommend, this is something we need to think about. I don't know what your eating habits are like are your sleeping habits. But if you are an anxious person and that's manifesting itself in say neurotic over analysis, there's two things you can do very rapidly. Three things really that will help quell that. Um, well for things even number one,

Speaker 3:          01:32:22       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:32:23       get up at the same time everyday and I would recommend in the morning cause that's when people generally get up and it's good to do what everyone else does is nuts. You have a good reason not to. Number two, eat a large breakfast, right? Keep it carbohydrate light, you know, don't, don't eat toast, toast and like uh, fruit loops. That's not going to do the trick. Make it fat and protein heavy and eat more than you want. You might say, I'm not hungry in the mornings. Like this has nothing to do with what you want or what your appetite is. It's like you need to eat in the morning. If you're an anxious person and you don't eat in the morning and then you stress yourself out, your body hyper produces insulin, it takes all the blood sugar out of your blood and that disregulates your metabolism for the entire day.

Speaker 4:          01:33:05       You can't reset it till you go to sleep at night. And I've had lots of anxious clients who would say fall into the over analytic category who were like virtually cured by eating a large breakfast every morning. I would highly recommend that you could try some physical exercise. Weightlifting is really good for curing anxiety. And the other thing you could do, as I alluded to earlier today, is to make a schedule and start attending to your daily micro routines. So you know, you've got to figure out what your over analysis is. It might be cognitive, like maybe you have a very active mind, you know you're fast, verbally are you fast verbally. One way you can find that out is to do something like write down as many letters, words as you can that begin with the letter s for example. In in three minutes, do that with a bunch of your friends. And if you're someone who writes down way more words than anyone else, then you're verbally fluent and that might be driving some of your over analysis. But my guess is that you're suffering from some rumination that's related to anxiety. And so I told, told you what I think the simplest ways aren't to rectify that. So hope that works out for you.

Speaker 4:          01:34:10       Let's see, what else have we got here? Okay. Alhmad warrior says, can you answer this question, Dr. Peterson? And the answer is I can, but I'm not going to. Okay, let's see.

Speaker 3:          01:34:33       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:34:40       Loki doodle says I cleaned my room finally. That's good. I hope that it has a pronounced positive effect on the rest of your life. You know it's funny because since last September I would say I redid my house. I'm going to put a video online about that cause I had a camera crew in here this week videoing the whole house because it's quite interesting I would say. But since I've stepped into this chaotic domain last September, my room has been a mess. The rest of the house hasn't been too bad, but I've never got to cleaning my room. I finally did this weekend. And what was interesting because when I did it, I mean I've been doing a lot of other things, but that's, no, no, that doesn't help. Uh, keep at bay. The negative psychological consequences of being in, in, in material chaos. When I cleaned my room this weekend, it made it easier for me to finish this chapter that I've been obsessing about. So that was quite interesting. So, you know, cleaning and organizing your room is no joke. It's a great meditative exercise, especially if you take it seriously and you're not trying to make it look neat. Although that's not a bad aim. You're trying to turn the room into somewhere that the person you want to be could live. So

Speaker 4:          01:35:51       what

Speaker 4:          01:35:59       do I believe that there was any connection between leftist identity politics of past decades in the emergent white identity politics of the alt right? Yes, I think there's a direct causal connection. It only stands to reason that if identity politics is going to be the acceptable mode of communication, that the, that there are people who are on the white side of the equation. Let's say we're going to decide that they're going to play exactly the same game, clearly, obviously, and, and horribly. You know, because I'm no fan of identity politics, but what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the Gander. So, but I would recommend that people don't do it because you know, the radical leftists and their damn identity politics is, that's unbelievably pathological. And if you decided to fight that by playing the same game, you think, well, I'll play the same game and then I'll win.

Speaker 4:          01:36:45       It's like, you know, you won't because by playing the game you lose. That's the thing about your political opponents is you don't play the damn game. You play a different game. And so, you know, what I've been trying to encourage people to do is instead of playing the collectivist game, and that would include alt-right identity politics, say, um, is to play the individual's game and to get their act together the best revenge I would say, but you shouldn't be doing it for revenge. But the best revenge against the collective last of us collectivist leftists is to live a stalwart, meaningful and high quality individual life. And that's also the pathway that requires the most responsibility and sacrifice. And so I think is the most honorable and least self deceptive. So

Speaker 4:          01:37:35       what is your view on the Book Slash Movie Fight Club? I thought fight club was deeply fascist in a very interesting way. Um, I mean I, I'm saying that I'm saying that some in some way dismissively although I actually liked the movie. I also think it was a, it was fascist because it, it, it was a celebration in some sense of force. It was fascist sort of in the same way that the iron man character is fascist, you know? Um, but I also thought it was a really interesting exploration of the idea of developing the shadow. And so, and I do believe that if men don't become consciously dangerous, they become unconsciously dangerous. And so it's much better to become consciously dangerous. And it's something that every man should really aim at. So you should be someone that no one will mess with now, but then you should keep that under control, right? You should be, first of all, you should be harmless and naive, then you're a child, then you should develop your capacity to be dangerous, then you should bring that capacity to be dangerous under control. Then that makes you a man as far as I'm concerned. So

Speaker 4:          01:38:39       Jared Chan says, I just wanted to thank you very much. Love you heaps, man.

Speaker 4:          01:38:44       Lol. I'm slowly reading all of hume's books. Thanks to you. Well, you have to read them slowly, man. There's no way you can read those fast. Like, watch out for yourself because those things play vicious games with your mind. So praying for you. Well good. I could use some prayer, man. So thanks jared. Much appreciate it. So good luck with the reading and, uh, you know, make sure you're doing something practical and easy at the same time because young, he's hard on person. That's for sure. If you really want to twist your head and a knot, you could do some reading. You could read some niche at the same time. It's a nice adjunct. Uh, though you'll wrote some books on nature like, um, his, his commentaries on thus spake Sarah Booster. So, uh, yeah. Good to hear from you. Thanks. Thanks very much man.

Speaker 3:          01:39:28       Okay,

Speaker 4:          01:39:28       so let's see.

Speaker 4:          01:39:51       Whoa, still haven't quite mastered this live chat thing. It zooms around quite a bit. Hey, when was that high school student program? You were coming without coming out with happening? Oh, that's the, uh, that's the future authoring. But the self authoring program for high school students, man, we're trying to get that out by, within a month, but I can't say for sure because it's a software development program, but we're aiming out to fall, that's for sure. So, um, I know we're hoping it'll be a killer. Like, like the university self authoring program was, you know, uh, for those of you who don't know, you probably all know cause you're patriotic subscribers. But the future authoring program seems to improve the performance of college students by about 25%. We're hoping with the high school students to uh, um,

Speaker 4:          01:40:33       we'll have the same impact at a much earlier age and to teach kids to define themselves voluntarily and to start charting their destiny. That would be a lovely thing. And we're going to sell directly to the high school students instead of trying to go into schools and so forth, which I think would be just an exercise in frustration and utility. I shouldn't say that. And I don't know how this got set up. I probably push some button that I didn't even notice is that some of you seem to be donating money and the money is associated with questions and I've clicked on some of those and I hope, I'm not sure what to make of that exactly. Because I don't know how it happened exactly. And I want to make sure that I get questions from everyone as much as I can. So if I miss you, I hope that you're not donating unless I actually click on your question.

Speaker 4:          01:41:15       So, but if that isn't the case, then I apologize. I'm trying to keep up with as many questions as I possibly can't. Thoughts on the Jews. Well, the first thing I could say about Jews is that a lot of my friends are happen to be Jewish. And I think that's partly because Jewish people and me and that's in part a cultural thing, are very, very interested in ideas. And I happened to be very interested in ideas and so I have a great affinity for Jewish people. And so, um, and I think that Jewish people are overrepresented in positions of competence and authority and that's often because they're extraordinarily competent. So, you know, hurry for them. That's how it looks to me. So what do you have to say about girls who grew up without fathers? Be Very careful in who you choose as a mate because you don't have that much experience with what constitutes a good man.

Speaker 4:          01:42:06       And so I would say be cautious, man. Be Cautious. Look for someone who treats you well and not because of weakness. You know, who's who, don't be, don't confuse being afraid to offend you with treating you well. Someone who treats you well as someone who's tough and forthright and self reliant, but who is able to listen and to negotiate in particular and to tell you the truth. And so, and, and don't give yourself away too easily. And that's what I would say to girls, period is don't give yourself away too easily. It's a big mistake. You'll regret it. You'll regret it. So

Speaker 4:          01:42:50       I'm starting to slow down here. Nature was pretty fun to read. Got All his works. Nino, the sinner. Well that should really help you with your sitting there, Nino. So yeah. Nicha he's a, he's a trip, that's for sure. If you guys are thinking about reading each of, don't start with thus, thus spake Sarah through story. You should read that last, I would start with beyond good and evil. And uh, a fun is a pretty weird way to describe it though. Read Dostoyevsky too. That'd be good for you. What advice would you give to a person high in agreeableness and conscientiousness get a significant other who is left leaning or one who is leaning towards radical leftism? I would say get a significant other. Don't get a significant other based on their political, uh, predispositions, you know, um, get a significant other that you can trust and that you are attracted to and that you want to build a life with and leave the political stuff for, for when it's necessary because the political stuff should only be engaged in when it's necessary. Do you think Islam is compatible with the West?

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       Not In any self evident manner. So, um, although I would also say that Islam is part of the West, you know, we should actually give that some consideration. Do you mean is Islam compatible with Christianity? Um, I hope so, but it isn't obvious to me in what manner it's compatible with Christianity. We'll see. That doesn't mean that Muslims aren't compatible with Western society. You know, I mean, many Muslims are no more radical Muslims than Christians are radical Christians. In fact, many Muslims aren't any more Muslims than many Christians are Christians. And so, you know, I would say generally speaking across populations, people are pretty decent and as individuals, you know, generally speaking, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the belief systems that they inhabit or commensurate. So,

Speaker 3:          01:44:39       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:44:40       All Cap, right? Says I think you should fortify your ideas on Christianity. I am doing my best to do exactly that. So Dr. Peterson, what was your relationship like with your mother and father hits pr? It was, andy is pretty good. They're both still alive. Thank God. I just went up and saw my dad for his 80th birthday. He's in good shape. Um, I actually gave him a Keka Stan, he flag as a joke, which he really appreciated. So I think he's got that flying up in his cabin way the hell up in northern Saskatchewan, which I think is pretty comical. Um, I loved my parents deeply there. They've been a great source of support for me. My father, I had some struggles with my father when I was an adolescent, partly because I think partly because I was depressed and so was he. Um, he was a great father when I was a young child.

Speaker 4:          01:45:28       He spent so much time with me and paid so much attention to me and taught me to read and like I have nothing but great memories of him before grade six. And then we had about three years that were rocky mall, more than that, probably about five years that were rocky, um, which we both contributed to. And so did other circumstances, but mean since I moved away from home, which I did at 16, um, we've got along just fine and I think we have an absolutely superb relationship and they've been incredibly useful and supportive in the last year. So, and my mother is a wonderful person. She's a little too agreeable for her own good, but she's tough. And she had a, you know, she raised three kids and she went out and had a career and she's put up with my dad who's a pretty tough, stubborn guy. And, uh, she's a lovely person. I love her deeply and she's been very good to my kids. And, uh, um, I've had, uh, I have, I have had a good relationship with them and I, I would say it's just gotten better and better as we've got older and straighten ourselves out. And I would say that about my whole family, including my sister and my brother and their family and it's functioning pretty damn well. And so thank God for that man. So

Speaker 4:          01:46:37       I have a friend who's considering majoring in psychology. What advice would I give them? Um, stick to the biological end of it as much as possible. Uh, with the exception of the clinical great clinical works because they're very much reading master your damn statistics because that'll open up career doors for you, nail your grades, go get a degree. In clinical psychology, a phd in clinical psychology is so valuable that it's, it's almost incomprehensible. So, um, that's what I would say and, and uh, learn to analyze the research reports and pay attention and it can be an absolutely great career. All right guys, it's been a long day. I spent most of today writing my chapter seven of my new book called 12 rules for life, which is absolutely deadly chapter. It's just about killed me. I have gone over today, I went over every word and every sentence and rewrote them. And it's a chapter on sacrifice and work and the battle between good and evil and Christianity and, and the nature of a meaningful life. And it's, it's been hard. And um,

Speaker 3:          01:47:45       yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:47:45       And I'm tired and although this has been great fun and I would like to say in closing, once again, thank you very much for the support and for all of the, I mean, I'm absolutely overwhelmed by the positive response my work has got over the last year. It's been very, uh, I've been amazingly well compensated both financially and psychologically for my efforts, which I'm thrilled about. And I hope that I can keep delivering to you what it is that you seem to be. Um, what would you say? I hope that I can continue to deliver whatever it is that I'd been delivering in the past. That all of you have been finding a value. I am doing my best to do that. I think it's the right way forward out of this bloody chaotic political mess that we're in. It's the, Oh, and I mean, I've been thinking about that for years. You know that the way out of the ideological morass is the strengthening and fortification of the individual. And I hope you all participate in that because it's, there's, there's, there's, it's a Cliche, but I'm getting tired. So it's the best I can do. There's no limits to what a person who decides to put themselves together can do. And so I would very much encourage all of you to aim at that because what the hell else have you got to do in this like veil of tears? That's tragic. Veil of tears, but put yourself together and prevail. And so on that note, man, over now, and I'll talk to you all in a month.
