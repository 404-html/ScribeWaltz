Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Talk about constructivism and I'm going to primarily discuss John Piaget, although the readings extend to stumped some degree out past his thought. Um, PSA is generally regarded as a developmental psychologist, which is not what he thought of himself. He thought that he was at genetic epistemologist, which is a term that I think has ever only been applied to him. An epistemologist is someone who studies the manner in which knowledge, um, who studies knowledge itself. And that's what Piaget thought that he was doing. And he wanted to understand how it was that knowledge unfolded across time. And more importantly than that, he wanted to understand how the cognitive structures that made up in the individual developed across time. So that's generally why he's regarded as a developmental psychologist because of course he also studied children. Now I'm going to read you something that piaget rope to begin this.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       Um, he wrote an awful lot of books and a lot of them haven't yet been translated and some of the ones that are translated are translated pretty badly. And I think this is probably an example of a fairly bad translation, but regardless of that, the point that's being made is both valid and interesting. So the Garmin postulate a various traditional epistemologies, which are theories of valid knowledge is that knowledge is a fact say or a set of facts so that you would go to class and learn a set of facts and that is what would give you knowledge instead of a process. And if our various forms of noman drawings incomplete as we know they are, because they're replaced sequentially, I mean, for example, recently in the domain of physics, physicists revealed to us that they really didn't understand what some massive percentage of the universe was made up.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       I think, I can't remember, it's 75% or 95% made up of dark matters, which has never been detective. And we know how to think about it. So that's a good example of how our fundamental assumptions can be challenged at any moment. And how a fact can turn from a fact into a clear fallacy if our various forms of knowledge, you're always in complete. And our various sciences still imperfect that which is acquired is acquired and can therefore be studied statically. So the proposition there is that you come and you learn the facts and the facts themselves are solid bits of information and they don't change across time. And so that once you have them, you have them. Now of course piaget, obviously delts that hence the absolute position of the problems. What is knowledge or how were the various types of knowledge possible as an alternative under the converging influence of a series of factors, we're tending more and more today to regard knowledge as a process more than a state, any being or object that science is attempt to hold fast dissolves.

Speaker 1:          00:02:56       Once again in the current of development, it is the last analysis of this development and the vid alone that we have the right to state. It is a fact. What it means by that is the fact that human beings learn facts is in fact a fact, right? So you are capable of learning things and he thinks that's sort of the fundamental fact. People assimilate information and they transformed as a consequence of it. And so studying that as he says what we can and should then seek is a law of this process. We are well aware on the other hand that the fine book by Kuhn Scientific Revolutions. Now the reason PSA throws them in at the end. How many of you know about Thomas Kuhn's book on scientific resolutions?

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       No one just to three people. Okay, well that's probably not good. Um, Kuhn was one of the 20th century's foremost philosophers of science and he made a distinction between two different modes of scientific process. One, he called normal science and the other he called Revolutionary Science. And normal science was the kind of science then you'll do as undergraduates unless you're incredibly lucky or unbelievably brilliant. Um, or probably unbelievably really an Andy, incredibly lucky. And so normal science occurs when you generate knowledge incrementally from within the confines of an already developed scientific theory. So a normal science would be a say the application of big five models of personality to the prediction of some other variable like say relationship success. You're going to uncover something new, but it's not going to shake the foundations of knowledge itself. Now, coon observed that from time to time there were discoveries that were made that shook the foundation of knowledge itself.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       There's some well known revolutions in science, so the Newtonian Revolution was a revolution in science. Uh, Einstein's were produced another revolution in science. Darwin's were Mendel's work. Um, those are the revolutionary transformations of thought that people often considered. Did I say Darwin? I certainly should have said Darwin because his was probably the most revolutionary of all. Um, now the reason that I wanted to tell you that, and the reason I kept it in here, even though it seems like it's funny, little additional statement pin to the end of Piaget's Caucasian, is that cool, observed at scientists science seem to progress in accordance with the same mechanisms that Piaget observed, that the knowledge of children appeared to progress. Now, one of the things that you'll learn about piaget, which is generally all you learned if you learned about piaget, is his idea that children go through sequential stages of development and usually people have you memorize those stages.

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       I should let you know that piaget really didn't care that much about those stages. And when they occurred and how they could be sped up at what they were. He was much more interested in deep philosophical questions. And that element of his work generally goes unrecognized by the North American psychologist who purport to understand what he had to say now because he wrote dozens of books, some of which are not yet translated. It's not surprising that people come away with a partial view of key Jay when you're that prolific. He was so damn smart. He was offered the curatorship of a museum when he was 10 because he had published a scientific paper on, I think it was on snails and but his parents requested that he turned it down. So you know, piaget was a major genius and if someone puts their mind like that puts their mind to work for an entire lifetime and he lived to be an old match, they can produce an awful lot of intellectual material and it's not necessary, especially if it can't be summarized easily as a single, you know, coherence theory that you could memorize in one page.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       It's pretty hard for people to keep up. So it's not surprising that his thought gets reduced to, you know, a set of axioms is in a sense, but the devil is often in the detail with great thinkers. And what that means is that to really understand what they had to say, you actually have to read them because a lot of the information is at the sentence level of analysis and not at the summary Level of analysis. You know, if you're really smart, it's not that easy to summarize what you have to say because most of what you have to say is in fact informative. So you can't just throw it away. It's hard to compress it. So anyways, this initial paragraph opens up the world of Constructivism to now the constructivists are interesting people because you know, you'll often hear people ask is it genetic or environmental, which is, it's not a good question because it's a false dichotomy that the genes formulate structures in accordance with environmental demand right from the beginning of the organisms emergence.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       And so there's a constant interplay between the environment and genetics. But the environment isn't also just a thing that's out there that's like made out of lions and Tigers of Moose and buildings and you know, the sky. It's, it's an information field and the constructivist point outrightly that partly what you're doing when you're operating in the world is interacting with this field of information and incorporating it structure into the structure of your mind and body, which is how you adapt. So you could say in some sense that you're built out of information and matter. That's a good way of thinking about it and the constructivists or very interesting interested in how you go about acquiring information and how you then transform that information into the sort of knows that you can apply to the world. So they're also very pragmatic, especially piaget because Piaget regards knowledge as um, like the prerequisite for adaptive action.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       So again, again, he's less concerned about the facts that you know about the structure of the world that he is about. How is that you modify and adapt your behavior so that you could survive in the world. So, so that's the first pos, that's constructivism. And then the next postulate is that there are revolutions in this internal structures that you construct that emerge as a consequence of you acquiring new information. Sometimes that information can already be fit into a knowledge structure that you possess, but sometimes the information is so anomalous or novel that it blows out fundamental precept positions that you've already established and forces you to not only add some information to your repertoire of information, but to reconfigure the structure you use to represent the information you don't like that people don't like it when that happens, it's too dramatic and upsetting. So which is often why revolutions in science or in an APP, any other field, our first resistance, I mean it's very complicated.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       The reasons people are opposed to new ideas are very complicated. There's lots of theories about why that occurs. Precisely. But I'll briefly outline and good theory. There's a bunch of them, but a log line one. So let's say there's already a scientific theory and it's instantiated in the world. So people accept it. And let's say that you are a proponent of that theory. So you might say, well, that theory therefore governs your worldview. And if I threaten it, then your world view is going to fall apart and that's going to make you fall apart. And that's not a bad theory, but here's a, here's a variant of that which is similar, but which I think is better. So I'm a professor, let's say I have a theory now what I'm doing with my theory is buying my right to be a professor. So I would come to the University of Toronto as a job candidate and I would say, here's my theory and here's why I think the facts support it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       Here's what it's good for. And they'll say, okay, it looks like you know enough about what you're doing so that you can occupy this position in this dominance hierarchy. Okay. And I'm pretty happy about that because that position in that dominance hierarchy is pretty permanent. That's one of the advantages to an academic job. It's like once you have it, as long as you're relatively confident and relatively ethical, then you can, you can maintain it across time. So, so it's a big deal to be granted that slot. And then being in that dominance hierarchy is not only a matter of what you believe, obviously the fact that I'm in the donuts, he means I get a certain salary and that's not hypothetical that allows me to eat. So I'm happy about that. It's not only psychological and I can pay my housing payments with it and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       So it protects me from the cold and the offers me something to eat and it gives me a certain public status. And so if some others, joker comes along, say they're young and they say, well, I have a different theory and it makes your theory looks stupid, then I'm not going to be very happy about that. Partly because it upsets the way that I could figure my understanding of the world. And that's a drag. But I might recover from that. But it also undermines my, undermines the validity of my claim to that position in the hierarchy. And so it sorta makes me an imposter, say it and say the guy turns out to be right. It's like, poof, I'm an imposter. And I knew really no longer really have the right to occupy that position. Someone might even point that out, although it doesn't happen very often.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       In the case of professors, you know what happens fairly frequently in other sorts of occupations. You know, all of a sudden your position has made useless because somebody figured out how to automate you and poof you're gone. Like that's hard on your world view but it's a lot harder on your celery. So a lot of the reasons that people claim to the validity of their theories is because it gives them a claim to a certain kind of, uh, what would you call, skillset and utility that then gives them a claim to occupy a certain position in the dominance hierarchy and that protects them from, from, you know, all the horrors of reality. Not Completely, but you know, I mean I have health insurance for example. Sometimes that's really, really helpful. So I don't want some joker coming along and pointing out that my theory is, is right. Anyway, so far that hasn't happened. So that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker 1:          00:13:03       So psg concludes and says, if all knowledge is always in a state of development and consists in proceeding from one state to a more complete and efficient one, evidently it is a question of knowing this development and analyzing it with the greatest possible accuracy. Okay. So Piaget fingers, you're a information foraging machine so to speak, and the process that you engage in while you're forging from information for information and then figuring out what to do with it is typical to human beings. And there's some constancy of structure across human beings. Okay. So that's, that's the first idea. It isn't that we all do it in a different way, even though there's individual variation, obviously. Um, the other sort of fundamental postulate of constructivism, especially the Phn Ian version of Constructivism, is that you sort of build yourself from the bottom up, starting with your body. So Pia, this is one of the things about Piaget's theory that's unbelievably sophisticated, I think.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       So when people were first developing models of artificial intelligence, they thought they'd be able to develop machines, that sort of model of the world and then figured out how to act. In the world sort of abstractly and then would after they figured out how to act in the world would then act in the world. But that proved to be impossible. And as you can tell, because we don't have, you know, ambulatory robots that could like bus tables at a restaurant, which turns out to be, by the way a very complex job, fast mathematical operations. Computer can handle that easily or easily, but bussing a table. It's like no computer is smart enough to do that. So that's pretty peculiar. But it turned out after like 40 years of investigation that you couldn't build computers that would operate as independent robots by teaching them tomorrow the world.

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       And then by having the model, the potential action that they were going to undertake and then implementing it. That did not work. Partly because modeling the world is way more complicated than anybody ever suspected. It's like infinitely more complicated. And so some robotics engineers such as Rodney Brooks who worked at Mit, started building robots from the bottom up. He made these little mindless robots that really didn't even have a sense essential processor that we're action oriented. So like the first things he built where he's literally the sec, like things that could skitter away from light, that's all they could do. It turn a light, poof, they'd go find some dark. And it's as if, so imagine the world to that roadblock was a binary place. It was either a light place where a dark place and then you might say, well what did life or dark mean to this little robot?

Speaker 1:          00:15:37       Then you have to ask yourself, well what does meaning mean? And that, that's a very good question. It's one that piaget answers meaning means to that the robot move to a different place. So light to that robot meant move to a different place. So what the, what the robot in a sense was doing was transforming one form of information, light versus dark into another form, which was skitter away. And so I love that because it's not easy to understand what meaning means until you relate it to the body. And so piaget's fundamental proposition is that the, the elements of your understanding are not perceptual abstractions. In fact, there's even elements of understanding that underlie your perceptual abstractions that are more fundamental and what those are essentially our sensory motor skills. Things you do with your body. It's a lovely idea. It's extremely profound and I think it's absolutely correct.

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       It, it does wreak havoc with the idea of disembodied intelligence. However, because for Piaget and also for Rodney Brooks who is responsible by the way, just so you know, some of you've seen big dog, big dog look up Darpa, Da Rpa. How many of you have seen big dog? How many of you are terrified by big dog? Yes. Big Dog is this robot that's being developed by the U s army that it's about this big and it's four legged. It's got ahead and it could run like faster than you and it can run in snow and it can run on ice and it can run up hills. And if you kick it, if balances and stands back oxen hypothetically it's going to be used to transport like the heavy things that soldiers have to carry. But you know, don't believe that that's a stupid idea. Once these things can emulate by themselves and they can already follow each other because now they have visual systems, um, arming that is going to be a very simple matter.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       And so the probability that we'll have unbelievably super fast robots that can shoot you in 10 years is like, to me as far as I can tell from the development is absolutely certain. I have a friend who's a computer engineer and he's a really good, and he said, you know how in science fiction movies sometimes when those robot shooting at you, they miss. You said when the robots shoot it, you not only will they shoot at where you are, but they'll shoot it. The six places that they calculate your most likely to dark too and they will never miss. So that's a lovely thing to think about. So hopefully that will come to pass, but it probably will.

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       So here's the sort of thing that PSA was interested in. These are very fundamental questions and he was a very deep intellect. So he tried to go right to the bottom of the structures of knowledge to find out what was down there upon what does an individual basis judgments. That's a good one. How do you know where they do a or b or what the differences between right and wrong. How has that instantiated in your, in your being, what are your norms? How is it that those norms are validated? What's the interest of such norms for the philosophy of science in general, which, which is a question like, well, there's a consensual reality that we all share to some degree, which is why we can communicate, but there's not a one to one relationship between that consensual reality and the categories of science. So Piaget was interested in the similarities between our consensual viewpoint and the scientific viewpoint.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       And the differences. So for example, people use to hypothetically assume that the world was flat. Um, and you could say, well, the reason they assumed that was because it looks flat when you look at it. So it was an empirical observation, but obviously there were other observations that we managed to produce. It indicated that the world wasn't flat and then our scientific conceptions and our interpersonal, uh, consensual norms became divorced from one another. And that's becoming a really serious problem, say with branches of science, like quantum mechanics, which you know, there are absolutely completely incomprehensible from a pragmatic perspective, even to those who formulate the mathematically I pay a piaget would say the reason for that is that, well, when we interact with objects at the phenomenal, phenomenal logical level, which is the level that we can most easily perceive, they act Newtonian, you know, so can I take your pen?

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       So you know, you can sort of predict what this penalty, because it acts like other objects of about its size and shape with mass. And so your understanding of this is actually based upon your knowledge of what will happen if you manipulate this thing with your body. You know it's solid. You'd be very surprised if you could like put your fingers through this pen. You'd be surprised if it broke because you expect a certain hardness. You do expect it to write, although pins off to dote, you expect it to be pointy. You know that you can take it apart into many objects. Even though like you can ask how many objects is this? Well, it's one pen, right? But you could take it apart.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Now it's two objects. And then you can see that there's other objects in here and sometimes you can put it back together and it'll still work. And so, so Psj, his point is that what we regard as understanding to say that you understand something is to indicate that you can predict what is going to occur if you interact with that object with your bottom. Okay. And that's, that gives you your intuitive understanding of things. And so because this is material other, you already know something about other things that are material right and you can transfer it from place to place. And that's again an embodied knowledge because material things are those things through which you cannot put your hand right. You'd get some weird things like smoker clouds and it's like, well are they, what are they? Are they objects? Is a cloud and object?

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       Well No, not really. Cause an object is one of these things that you could sort of manipulate as a unit. Now the categories of quantum mechanics, of course, which deal with these incredibly tiny things that are really don't want particles and are really not waves, they're in comprehensible to us because we never manipulate anything at that scale. And so because we can't play with it, we have no real way of understanding it because our understanding is based on the mapping of objects onto our body. So any object that we can map onto her body is therefore fundamentally and comprehensible. It's very cool theory, you know, and it very body centric theory. So how does the fact that children think differently than we do affect our presumption? In fact itself? That's a very interesting question too is like, so you've got three year olds and of course they're pretty clueless about the world but, and, and you know more, but there's the three year old is alive and everything and functioning.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       And so then you have to ask yourself, well, if their conception of the world is qualitatively different than your conception, how is it that you can both survive in the same world? And what does that mean about, about what knowledge means and about the limits of knowledge. I mean not, you know, I could say the same thing above you that you might say about a three year old, which is, well if I took you from this place and dropped you in the jungle, you know, soon you'd be dead, first few be visible, then you'd be dead. And so that's sort of like the three year olds state of being. If you, you know, if you were supposed to take care of them and you disappeared. So obviously even your knowledge of the world is limited by wall. It's limited in its necessary generality by the context.

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       But that also has something interesting to say about the validity of your knowledge itself. Very context dependent. So, okay, so that's the sort of thing that piaget was interested in. Here's some other ones. What do you mean by number? That's an interesting one. So you don't have, they say you can't compare apples and oranges, but you can. So if I said, well what's two oranges plus two apples for fruits? Who just said that you sound very good. So the way you solve that was by generalizing, I'm a level, right? So if I sat down, um, what's two desks plus two rocks, what would you say? Yes ma'am. You're very good at this. Pretty thing it was done. That's an Iq. That's, those are their Iq questions by the way. So if you did get them now you could feel disappointed, depressed. If you've got the wild, then you can pat yourself on the map.

Speaker 1:          00:24:10       So that's good. Yeah. So number is a funny thing because well, as I pointed out with the Pan, well one can become many very rapidly and many can become one. One of the whole idea of announcer is extremely difficult to understand. You know like what is in common between singular entities that allows you to represent all of them with one well animals don't do that. They can in a sense they can sort of intuit three or four, which is about all we can intuit to. But once we get the nomenclature done property man, we can use numbers like crazy and then they bill us to manipulate reality like mad. So whatever it is we're extracting from the commonality between objects seems to be something that gives us incredible power. So that's a problem. What do you mean by space? Since we know for example, from Einstein's work that you know, space spaces is not an absolute in any sense.

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       It isn't the speeds we move. So what do you mean by time and speed? What is an object permanent and when it isn't it, and when do you learn that? What does it mean that an object is the same across time? That's a good one. So, you know, I don't know if there's a single molecule in your body that was there five months ago, six months ago. There's some, I don't remember what the turnover duration is, but it's fairly, it's fairly quick. So it's weird day because there you are and you were there two years ago, but none of your constituent elements are the same. So how is it that you can be the same now that physicist Schrodinger Schrodinger of the Schrodinger's cat fade solved that by claiming that you were at dissipative structure. It's very interesting way. That's when you thought life was dissipative structures.

Speaker 1:          00:25:55       Uh, dissipate. Dissipative structure is the same as a, you know, when you, when you pull up the, the, uh, he pulled out at the bottom of the sink stopper, I think. So stopper, if you're a saint is full of water and you pull up the stopper, you know, you get a whirlpool, right? And all the water's spins as it as it goes down the drain hole. And you'll notice that that whirlpool look sort of the same across time, even though obviously the water molecules that make it up are different. He called that a dissipated structure. It was a pattern that maintained itself in spite of the movement of matter through it. And that's what you are, by the way. So it requires energy to keep a dissipative structure intact. But, uh, you take in energy. So thanks to the sun.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       What do you mean by chance? Huh? Why do you have moral concerns and what does it mean that you have moral concerns? That you have ideas about how people should behave and how they shouldn't behave. And you have a very deep understanding of that. And it's characteristic of all human beings and many, many animals. So where does that come from? Is it developed form of knowledge? What are children doing when they're playing? What are people doing when they're dreaming? And, uh, what's the significance of the fact that you can imitate other people? Now I'll, I'll start with the last one briefly. Um, you know, you might think that one of the things that really distinguishes us from other creatures animals is the fact that we have a thumb. And that's a big one. We've got very good functional thumbs and Hooray for that. And we stand up on two feet.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       So we get a chance to use our thumbs and has to carry things round as a great things and to take them apart and to swing sticks and so on. But there are other animals who can do that to a limited degree. And then there's our ability to talk. That's a major one. But one of the other things that really differentiates people from other animals is, you know, you hear monkey see monkey do, right? Well that's wrong, monkey. See that's the end of that really can't imitate one another. And they certainly can't imitate any even randomly generated normal behavior that another monkey producers think about it this way. You know, we hear these claims that chimpanzees have culture. It's like, well, no, they don't. Not really. And the reason for that, it's easy to figure out that they don't have culture. I mean, let's say chimps have been around roughly speaking for 50 million years, which is not a bad estimate because we diverged from them about 7 million years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:28:26       And the evidence is pretty clear that the thing that we diverged from looked a lot more like a chimp then it looked like us. So like we've been booting it ahead, madly developing like mad and the chimps would be laying back and eating leaves, you know, so. So do they have a culture? Well, hey that 50 million years, you know, they haven't even built a hot yet. And the reason I'm telling you that is because if you're a culture generated creature and you only magine match, you'll only manage saying one discovery of a hundred years between all of you. If you have 50 million years to get your act together, that's a lot of hundred year segments. And so even if the chimpanzee was building culture at the rate of 0.0, zero, zero 1% a year, if you calm, calm, that over 50 million years, you have the empire state building and there are the empire state buildings that chimpanzees are living in.

Speaker 1:          00:29:19       And so therefore they don't have culture. Now they might be able to recognize the, their peers in the dominance hierarchy. They can do that and they can use, maybe they can use simple tools, but the tools they use seem to be dependent on the environment that they inhabit. You know, cause some people say, well some chips use one tool on some chimps. Use another button. You know, if you're going to live in a rocky place, then he might use rocks. And if you're going to live in a place that has sticks, you might use sticks. But that's not because you're a different, it's because the environment's different. So anyways, chimps, candy, imitate one another very much. Um, but humans, man were ridiculous. Like we're, we're so imitative. It's absolutely crazy. You know? And that's so cool because what it means is that once you get a pattern of behavior, you, you know, you whip up a new pattern of behavior, I can watch you and I can just instantiate it in my own bloody, you know, maybe a bit awkwardly to begin with.

Speaker 1:          00:30:13       Although maybe sometimes better than you can. And Bang, I've got that. And so we're always looking around at each other, seeing what we're up to. And as soon as we see someone who's up to something interesting, then we can do the same thing. Children do that cause they imitate, right? But there are even better at it. They generalize across instances of imitation. So for example, you remember when you're a kid and you're playing, maybe you're playing house and you're the mom, or maybe, I don't know, maybe you're the house cat because children will certainly do that. And so let's say the child is being the house cat. So he or she is down on, you know, all forest zoom room, like a cat maybe meowing and rubbing up against there mother's leg and looking for a male milk. And the below. They're not exactly imitating their cat because if they were exactly imitating their cat, they would be moving exactly the same way the cat move.

Speaker 1:          00:31:03       But now they're not. What they're doing is they've observed the cat across a wide variety of in of environments. They abstracted what constitutes generalized cat behavior from all of those instances. And then they can instantiate the spirit of the cap, which is sort of the movements that make up cactus. And then you, because you're so smart, you can watch them zooming around on the ground and despite the fact that they don't have a tail or ears or refer, you're going to figure it out pretty quick. That that is now a cat. And children do the same thing with their parents. Like if they're playing house and the imitate their father, you know, they may to some degree to try to imitate the sound of his voice and maybe even use a couple of his favorite phrases. But basically what they're doing is trying to act like a father rather than imitating their father.

Speaker 1:          00:31:52       So it's like imminence, Metta, imitation, right? It's like, watch you, I watch you, I watch you, I watch you. There's commonalities across all of those instances. I extract the commonalities, I embody it. And then when I played that's what I'm doing. I'm figuring out how to embody the commonalities across multiple exposures. And that's, that's you're doing that when you're like three, you're so smart. And then even if you're asleep you're doing it because you're doing it and your dreams and so human beings do that. No other animals do. So when you're thinking about the ways that we're weird, you want to put invitation way up there on the list because you can, you know, think about death. People like congenitally deaf people don't have much access to language. You know say they don't learn sign language because that used to happen in the past. It's like they can still wander around in the world and in well why?

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       Well because they're so good at imitating, you know they get all the non verbal stuff and that's a lot. So languages, you know, great to all that APP which actually enables you to imitate across space and time. That's what it's for. Because, you know, maybe you whip up a new action and then you write it down in words and then you sent it to someone and they, those are instructions by the way, cause that's what instructions are you send out to someone and then they read your code for behavior and then they act it out. And so language enables you to move invitation across space and time. And that's a really good way of conceptualizing and language because it's a phd anyway because sometimes we might think that language is there to describe the world. You know, in the scientific sense, George Kelly kind of thinks that, that thought that, that human beings are sort of like natural scientists, but natural scientists are much more concerned with what is then with how to act. So Kelly's wrong. What human beings are more like it's natural engineers because we're always zooming around and trying to figure out how to fiddle with things much more than what they are. And as I mentioned to you earlier, a pragmatist would say, well it's an artificial distinction because things are what they are when you fiddle with them. That's in fact what they are. So it's, that's pretty smart.

Speaker 1:          00:34:06       He goes, he also says this is part of the constructivist notion cause constructivism is a philosophical school. He says no does nothing to get in the eye and it does not begin in the object. It begins in the interactions. There's a reciprocal and simultaneous construction of the subject on the one hand and the object on the other. There is no structure apart from construction, either abstract or genetic. I really liked that. I showed you some of the symbolic categories and a couple of you know, previous lectures and I mentioned for example that one of the symbolic categories is the great father and a great father kind of stamps for cultural structure. Whereas the great mother stands for novelty and and then and, and sometimes the terrifying. Anyways, back to the great father.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       There's a precondition in constructivism that there has to be three things that exist. They map right onto that symbolic structure. One is culture. So when you look at something or really with any creature looks at something, there's an inbuilt structure that characterizes the creatures, some of which would be biological built in, there's some of which would be acquired that they must have in order to structure their perceptions of what they're looking at. So you don't come to the situation blank. You know, for example, you have two eyes so you can have stereo vision. Most of the time, you know when you have five senses in there at the same census and there's more than that. You have snake detection circuits for example. So you're sort of primed to respond to a certain class of predators. You like sweet tastes and sour taste, but you don't really like spinner tastes. So on and so forth. Like right from the beginning, you've written how landscape of interpreter structures in order to frame and simplify

Speaker 1:          00:35:55       the world that you are exposed to. Now the world itself is this sort of amorphous thing. It's amorphous cause it's so multidimensional and complex. There's so much of it. It's like a fog that contains everything. And so unless you can frame that and simplify it and narrow it, it's very difficult for you to understand and interact with it at all. I mean, you, you know, you just can't deal with everything at once. It's hard enough to deal with one little thing at a time. And you know, this internal structure is partly what enables you to deal with one little thing at a time. And then so there's you and there's the, the source of all information. There's the structure of you and the source of all information. And then, then there's the process that's you in the process that's you, is you using your appendages fundamentally and your census to interact with things and to make the manifest new properties.

Speaker 1:          00:36:46       Right? And so those are properties that they might not manifest without you there. And it's very difficult for you to tell when you're interacting with the world, even at a perceptual level, how much of what you observe wouldn't be there if you weren't there. No. So because one of the big philosophical questions is, well, what's there? And when you're not there. And that is a much more complicated question than you might imagine. Um, the, the Dallas would say, well, what's, there is so much an amalgam of everything at once that it might as well be nothing at all. And it's sort of a, I can give you a way of understanding that. So let's say you took every symphony that was ever written, recorded, hey, and then you took all those recordings together and you laid one on top of the other and you'd say, well no, I've got like every symphony at once on a tape. And then you played the tape. What would it sound like? It sound like white noise. So it sounds like,

Speaker 1:          00:37:47       so you could say white noise is functionally equivalent to every single symphony that's ever been written. Every piece of music that's ever been written, all being played at once. So what, you know, so when the Dallas would also say, you have to remember that what something is, is just as dependent on what it isn't as it is dependent on what it is. So that's a tough one, but it's very, very smart. So the constructor, this would certainly agree with that. No. Bruner who was a constructivist of sorts, put a little twist on Piaget's idea, which I'm going to borrow because I think it makes explaining piaget easier. At least it makes it easier for me. And since I'm explaining it, that's that's what we're going to have to go for it. Bruner said, we seem to have no other way of describing live time. Save in a form of narrative.

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       Now the reason I think this is a Ph in constructivist claim is because piaget is concerned with knowledge as it emerges from action. And action is clearly represented narratives, right? Because the narrative is about what the characters are doing. So narrative is the way that we represent the information about doing so and knowledge for Piaget is about doing. So I just put the two together and that and that. There's other reasons for it too. And that makes it simpler to explain. So here's, here's a way of thinking about how we put a structure on the world. So I'm not mentioned, I kind of introduced you to this idea before. So you're headed somewhere wherever that happens to be because you're an active organism and so you're, you know, even if you're don't have any immediate needs, you're going to poke about things just because you're curious.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       It turns out that your dopaminergic system, which is the system that drives curiosity, fires at a certain constant rate, even if you're not hungry or tired or thirsty or you know, even if no primary needs are clamoring for your attention. So your, your default comfortable status, mildly curious about everything. And so that's part of what makes you an information for a jury. Because when you have nothing better to do so to speak, you'll just poke around and see what happens because you never know that no itch might come in useful in the future. So anyways, you're always going from point a to point b because you're active and in the way you get from point a to point B, even if point b is an abstraction because it often is, you know, I am going towards a better future. Well that's kind of a weird abstraction. How are you going to get there? Well, you can be sure that at the base it's going to involve movement, right? Because you get to that future, there's, there's movements you're going to have to bake. So

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       see structured this going to go ahead to something sick.

Speaker 1:          00:41:07       Okay. So we're going to look at this. We're do look at this diagram, then we're gonna go back. So, um, let's start with an abstract philosophical concepts. I want to be a good person. While you might debate forever about what the good beans, right? It's the sort of philosophical conundrum that you can fall into because you take an abstractions and then you might think of it as a property if the world, and it's something that's subject to put in the bait, which is exactly what's happening in the history of mankind. But there's another way of looking at it that's actually probably more accurate. And I would say almost more useful. And this is the way, so you're going to try to be a good person. Well, the Phn and view, it would be being a good person. It's not a state of mind. What it is, is it abstraction that represents all first other associated abstractions.

Speaker 1:          00:42:04       Because we could say, well, being a good person, it's a multidimensional problems, right? You can't, you can't just be good and then it's done. It's like being a good person might be being good at. Well what? Well good at being a friend. Good at being a lover, good at being a parent, good at being a child, good at being an employee. You can know, you could say what good is, what's the same across all those things. And PSJ would call that a scheme just so you know, because the scheme is what's the same across multiple different things. So, and the scheme is the basis of abstraction for Psa. So good person is the sum total or the or the commonalities between being a good teacher, student, employee, etc. Okay. So then we'll say, okay, so now we can move the problem with analysis one level down and we can say, okay, well what does it mean to be a good parent?

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       And then you'd say, well, maybe you have to have a good job because you know, otherwise you and your child starved. But we'll forget about that one for a moment. And then you might say, well, you have to do a good job of taking care of your family. Okay, so you notice we're zeroing in on an element of the good here and it's still an abstraction care for your family. That's an extraction. So then they might say, well one of the things you would do if you care through your family is playing with the baby. And another might be complete a meal. So we'll take the play with the baby example, and then there's three things you can do with your baby peek at it. They liked that. So optic permanent. Say there's nothing more thrilling to a baby. Then discovering that you're still there when you disappear like a baby, you can amuse her baby for hours with that discovery because it's by no means self evident to the baby.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       That's a Piagetian notion. They lack off object permanence. So as far as they're concerned, it's a hell of a shock when you disappear because they were just appreciate it and you'd be there and then they're just a shark when you reappear and you can, it's so interesting to watch them because when a baby gets startled, like when you get started with, you know, you might go like that if you're really starting a baby, it's like it's whole body is starting, right? Like it makes a weird face and it moves its arms and its legs and then it takes me like five seconds to recover. You know, they really have a startle reflex, so, and they'll often laugh. I'm sure you've seen the laughing babies on youtube because of course there's like a 2 billion views of laughing babies, which is a good thing. It shows that we like babies.

Speaker 1:          00:44:28       I think there's one that's very famous where a baby is reacting to his mother either sneezing or coughing caught. It's absolutely hilarious. This baby just has a fit. And what's basically happening is it's mother costs, I think it's coughs or sneezes. He knows. Oh, okay. Oh yeah. She blows her nose. So she makes this weird elephant like noise and the baby's mother could do this and then get surprised at its own startle. And that makes it, that's a really interesting phenomena from a Piagetian perspective because one of the things that Piaget noticed the children did because they could imitate, was imitate themselves. That's how they got to know who they were. So for example, if a child would say chub would actually up north that off, but the reading, well that's a hell of a thing to discover. You know, if you move your arm just a little bit, that will fall off.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       That's cool. So then maybe you can do that 60 70 times while you're supposed to be eating. And the other thing that's really cool about doing that as that mom, Lou immediately rushed over and picked it up and put it back. And this is an excellent game. You can entertain yourself with that for like a month. And basically what you're discovering is the relationship between your movements and gravity, right? It's like this is a major leak discovery. It's no wonder you're obsessed with it. So. So anyways, the point with regards to the invitation is maybe the baby does this accidentally to begin with. That startles them and then it's put up again and then they think, well that was cool. Wonder if we can do that again. And then they're pretty happy with that. And then they'll keep practicing that until they get like expert at doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       So instead of using like gross body movements to do it, which is how they'd start, they get developed finer and finer and finer body movements until they've got the whole narky light thing off a table down. And it can even be fascinating as an adult. Some of them, you've probably played table hockey, you know with the quarter, you know how to do that. Put a quarter on a table. It's not very complicated. You make little goals. Your, your job is to flip the thing so that it just sits that far over the table and so that the appointment can flip it up. That's, that's like your opportunity to score a goal. My point is playing with how things move in relationship to friction and gravity is so engrossing to human beings that you can even make a game out of it if you're, you know, a relatively board and stupid adult.

Speaker 1:          00:46:57       I played that game all the time with my son by the way. So I put myself in that category as well. Now what the child is doing is they will accidentally in some ways bumble into something interesting and then it recognizes that it's interesting in because that's a reflex action on his part. And then once it recognizes that it's had that reflex action, which is kind of, it's pleasurable, is as long as it's not too intense, it's at least interesting. Then they'll try to imitate what they just did. So part of the way you master yourself is by imitating yourself after you've asked. Definitely do dot. It's something interesting. It's so smart. So that's a phd had no shit. So anyways, you're playing with the baby and you can play piece with the baby. That's a good one. You're teaching it that you're still there even though you went away and you can take all the baby, which is best done in moderation because it's not exactly clear that babies enjoy that.

Speaker 1:          00:47:48       They just laugh when you do that so that you like them. Don't throw them out the window when they're being annoying and then you can clean the baby to say tho those are elements of the care of a baby. I know that's not very sophisticated, but you know, those are some of the basics. Now the thing that's different about playing with baby and tickled baby is that play with baby is an abstraction. Whereas tickle baby is an action, right? And so when you're trying to solve the mind body problem, this is how you solve it. The mind is those abstractions, the ball, and he's the actions that those abstractions ground themselves in. So it sounded like the mind is attached to the body. It's the mind is a sequence of hierarchically arranged abstractions, the bottom level of which are not abstractions, their actions. There's a qualitative transformation at the bottom of the higher, the highest resolution level of the hierarchy.

Speaker 1:          00:48:39       It's action. Now you can understand piaget very, very easily if you understand that the way a baby develops as far as piaget is, concern is from the bottom up. So the baby starts with, it's laying in his crib, it's a useless thing. It's laying there. It can't even focus its eyes, you know, it's just barely getting going. So it's sort of floating in space trying to figure out what's going on, you know and it doesn't even know that it has arms really just sort of detects texts these things off to the side and loft it bomb itself in the face with its arms or scratch itself cause you have to cut baby's nails really short. It's otherwise they scratched themselves because their arms are just, you know, wandering around randomly and the baby sorts. From a Piagetian perspective, the baby starts to learn that, learn what his body is capable of doing and some of that it just discovers by accident.

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       Now there's no doubt some natural neurological progression that's going on. So the baby is learning along the past that babies can learn. But still my piaget's perspective, the baby is doing quite a bit of exploring to facilitate its neurological development and more complex animals may be doing that in the womb, you know, trying out their legs and so on, so, so that they can run it as soon as they, you know, as soon as they get up. So it's not even obvious that all that sort of thing is reflexive and automatic in an animal that is more active when exported. So the baby is begins by basically it sort of develops from the middle outward. So what's the baby got when it first pops into the world? Well I can't see very well, although it can focus on about 12 inches, which conveniently is about the distance that his head is from its mother's eyes if it's breastfeeding.

Speaker 1:          00:50:23       So that's good for social communication. So the mother can gaze at the baby and the baby can gaze at the mother and for some reason they both find that fascinating. So babies also very well wired up around the mouth so it can use its mouth quite a lot and it can use its Tom, those, those come pre wired. So, and this is kind of a frightening observation. So at the beginning the baby really is oral because that's all it works. Like it could smell too, you know. But, but it's, it's, it's, it's voluntary capacity for action is really centered around its mouth. And you'll notice that babies infant are toddlers even love to put things in their mouth. My son, when he was a kid, he used to go in the backyard. We did feed them. So that is the reason he goes to the backyard and pick up acorns and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       His cheeks with them, just like a chipmunk. And so, you know, then we take them up to the bath and we'd have to like dig all the acorns out of his cheeks. And he did that for oh God. Way longer than you'd expect any same child to do it. So, but the reason that he would put things in his mouth and you think about this is there's nothing that's a better exploratory Oregon. Then your tongue, I mean, check out one of your teeth. Bloody thing feels like it's about this big to your tongue. As you'll notice if you ever get a two, three boom, it's like the Grand Canyon was just extension inside your mouth. And then of course your tongue will work like mad of its own accord to investigate every tiny little crevice in that new hole because your brain wants to know what's your mouth and what isn't.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       So that if there's something in your mouth that either should or shouldn't be a, it can tell it from you and B, it can tell whether or not it's supposed to be there. It turns out to be very important, right? Because while there's tooth decay, that's a problem. But you know there's also insects and poison and all sorts of other things that you shouldn't put in your mouth. So don't underestimate the degree to which you can zoom around the world like a know hoover vacuum cleaner and pick up our god awful amount of information. And of course you're also seemed that way obviously. And so you know, you're checking out your mother with your mouth and your tongue and a very meaningful way to, and well, you're feeding at the breast, you're establishing the basis of social relationships. Now this puts a bit of a warp into the piaget, the hypothesis, because piaget sort of assumed if the baby built, he builds himself from the bottom up, right?

Speaker 1:          00:52:46       But one of the things you have to understand is that the baby is always picking up how to behave and see in a very, very, very social context. Even when it's so young. That phd would regard it as primarily egocentric because what the hell does a baby knew about you? You know? But the mother is teaching the child how to act right from the time. It's a little tiny thing. Like if it's going to breastfeed, it has to do it in a relatively civilized manner because if it bites his mother or her mother, which are baby can do, they can really chump you a good one. If their minds are made up to do that, it's like unpleasant consequences are going to ensue. At minimum the mother is going to start [inaudible], you know, stop feeding the baby and maybe she'll put the baby down or, or God only knows.

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       One time when my son was very young, I guess he was about 13 months, he had just learned to walk and he walked up to my wife who was wearing shorts and he bit her right here and a good chunk. He was just teasing and she reflex reflex and he like, he must have flown six feet. It's like that's how you socialize children against the sudden bias. So even the smallest alterations of their behavior take place within an intensely social context. So even at this level, this society is, is helping guide and restrict the development of the child's motor activities. Now children tend to develop, as I said, they develop gross body movements first. So they kind of learn to fling their arms. So maybe you put a mobile in the crib for your baby, look at, by the way, most mobiles you'll notice maybe their fish.

Speaker 1:          00:54:33       So you're a parent, you're standing here and this is the side of the fish and this is the bottom of the fish and that's what the baby is looking at. It's like the baby is looking at lines because the fish in here for the adults, it's like that's a stupid mobile. You get that fish turned over so that baby can see the fish and then you make them out of like black and white because babies are very good at picking up high contrast and that's a baby mobile rather than a mother and mobile. So you got to decide whether the mobile is for you or for your baby. So anyways, you put the mobile above the baby and he kind of want to put it within limb length and then the baby will watch this thing. Who knows? Maybe tonight to Devin. By this, the, we know, it's like, you know, and then it'll will sort of flail boat. Like it does not very well controlled better. And maybe it will flail an arm or leg and now I'm to get lucky and it'll nail one of those fish. And now starbucks. And so usually that it might try that because that might have just, if it's a neurotic baby, it'll cry. It's like that's too much for today.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       But if it's a kind of a outgoing, exploratory maybe, then the next thing it's really good to want to do is to figure out how to make that fish move again. And then it'll sit there and practice flailing its leg. It's like it's throwing its leg at the fish and if it gets lucky it will nail it a good one. And then that'll make it laugh. And then, you know, the practice doing that over a sequence of babies are persistent manner. So when my daughter was little, she was about 18 months old. We bought her this little cardboard box that had little cardboard, Disney books in it, you know, and she didn't care what the Disney books where, what she was really interested in is getting those three books out of the Disney blocks and then trying to get the back end. Cause it turned out that was quite difficult because they fit tightly. So this was a great puzzle for her. Cause you know, she was still getting the whole coordination thing going and she'd sip for like three hours getting those bother those books in that box. And that was like a toy for, for a week until she figured it out. And then she was on to bigger and better things.

Speaker 1:          00:56:43       But that's a big deal, right? You can imagine what you're doing. You're logically, when you're doing that, it's like first of all, you've got to grip that book property second you go to oriented precisely third as you add the additional books to the box, the shape changes because the book's flop over, you know, cause they'll flop over diagonally. So the shape changes. Who's going to figure out how to adjust that and then the book itself will open and that will get in the way. So you're going to keep the book closed and you know the tolerances that are like an 18th of an inch. So, so you want to master that. And like some people don't. I had a client once who had a very low fluid intelligence, probably 75 80 you would have known it by looking at him but he couldn't find employment.

Speaker 1:          00:57:29       Surprise, surprise. There's, there's no jobs in our society for people who are at that end of the cognitive distribution. I got to the volunteer job at one point and his job was to put paper in envelopes, had to fold it up in three cause that's how you fold up a piece of paper and then you have to put an envelope. But that actually turns out to be hyper complex. I probably trained him for 28 to 30 hours to do that. And because when you do it next time or you could do it now, you just think about what you're doing is first of all, merely by observing the piece of paper, you'd have to figure out how to make the first full and it better be damn close to one third. Because if it isn't, when you make the second fold, you're going to compound your error and then you're going to find, to your chagrin than a piece of paper does not fit in the envelopes because the envelope is exactly the same size as the piece of paper.

Speaker 1:          00:58:20       So if you're out by your estimate, say a quarter of an inch in your first full of road by half inch of your second fold, it's like it's not going in there. Or if, if you don't fold it completely at 90 degrees, you know, so the edges line up, say you're out by a 16th of an inch and then you do that again. So now you're out by eight, it won't fit in sideways. So then you have to mangle the envelope to, to get the paper in there. And then by the time you've done mangling the envelope, not only does it look ugly, but he will not go through an automatic sorting machine. So, and then added to that was the problem that on these pieces of paper, there were often photograph staple because he was working for a charity. So then, but the photographs weren't always stapled at exactly the same place on the piece of paper.

Speaker 1:          00:59:02       So then you'd have to look at the piece of paper and he'd have to figure out where the photograph is and then you'd have to figure out how to fold a piece of paper so that he didn't bend the photographs so that it would still fit in the envelope. And that just used to, he just sweat himself to death trying to solve that problem because there was time pressure too. So, and there's an added level of complexity on top of that. And the reason I'm telling you this, because you'll give it some sense of how you know, simple actions are aggregated into increasingly complex operations. Some of the envelopes were French and some of them are English because it was Canada. And so you couldn't put a French letter in an English envelope if the French ones had to go in a separate pile. And then there was a huge stack say of English letters and a huge stack of English envelopes, all of which hypothetically had been stacked so that each one on to the other, but now and then one of them would be out of alignment.

Speaker 1:          00:59:55       So then you had to figure out whether it was the letters that were out of the alignment or the envelopes. Well that's a, that's a high complexity working memory problem that just bring him to a standstill. So anyways, you know, during typical development you develop those incredibly fine motor skills, easy early, which is part of the reason why it's kind of Nice to have your baby, toddler, infant do something by itself, you know, like sit there with a box until it gets a little bored and then it'll start to figure out what to do with the box. And that's part of play. And that's part of the development of its in boarding conceptual structure. So, okay. So, so you basically the chain these things together. Now the way that piaget, he thought, well what's the motivation for doing this?

Speaker 1:          01:00:55       So the motivation is essentially is that, well sometimes it can be sort of random. You accidentally do something interesting and then try to repeat it. But as you sort of develop the number of times that you do something accidentally that results in something interesting starts to decline. Now what part on what happens to you as you mature is that the opportunities that are provided for you by your body as you exercise and then develop it, start, continue, you know, start to really ramp up and develop so that you can do a lot more interesting things with your body by the time you're two then you can, when you're nine months old for example, you can zoom around, which just opens up a whole universe of things to pull over and dump over and pull off tables and you know, and there's things lying around that you can write on walls with and you can pull out cupboards and it's like, it's, it's, it's, you know, paradise for an exploratory date.

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       Maybe. So, but what happens is that as the child puts himself or herself together physically and develops additional skills, then they can elicit additional manifestations of novelty from the world. So for example, right? Well, here's a good example. So the child finally manages to get itself upright, which is like a colossal, colossal, an amazing accomplishment. You know what I mean? First of all, that's hard to do. Like no, there are two legged creatures in the world except for us, you know, and we're so good at this. You can even, isn't that wonderful? I learned that when I was two. So you know, you can do these amazing things with your body, but the child is like trying to put itself together neurologically and it's a hell of an operation to get this call them of bone. It's like jellyfish on a bone, you know, or, or stack bones and you got to get the thing to stand up upright.

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       God ridiculously difficult. So the child manages that. There's a lot of pain and anguish associated with that, right? Because those little creatures, they just fall down and you know, and they got these little short arms. So they're not much good at protecting themselves from impact. They're just bouncing off the walls like mad and the floor up and they're trying to learn to walk. Then they finally get themselves up right and tartar along and followed and so on. But then you know, then the world turns into a different place because all of a sudden now you can stand up underneath the table. That's the fun. That's a fun thing to do for the first time. It's like lack. So now your new body has taught you something about the world that you did not know. So what piaget would say is, well, you've got the scheme worked out, which is the standing up scheme.

Speaker 1:          01:03:27       And it turns out that at works pretty well if you're in an empty space. But if you're in a close space with a low ceiling, the whole standing rock thing, it's just not going to produce, produce the results intended. So he had stand up and whack yourself and that's a sign that it's time to update your representational structures. And so you can think of that technically as the emergence of the normally into what would have otherwise been a conceptually protected space. PSA has this idea of acrylic ration. So let's say your baby crawls and let's say it's a Nyquil upgraded crawler, which means it's kind of an expert in babies get pretty expert crawlers by about, I'd say 1213 months, hey can zoom around and they know how luck I bumped into things and you know how to crawl around without hurting themselves. So when they crawl around only the things that they want to have happen half most of the time, and there are cooperating at that point because their actions and their conceptions of the consequence of those actions match.

Speaker 1:          01:04:35       They've got no problem. What they expect or want to have happen when they crawl is what happens. That babies APP has mastered a developmental stage. So that's the stage idea and that's the calibrated stage idea. Corroboration is a brilliant idea and I'll tell you why in a minute. But then all of a sudden the baby learns to stand up. It's like, oh, I did advance. But it's like a revolutionary advance, right? It's equivalent to a revolution in science, which is why psg mentioned coon. It's like, well, now I'm a standing creature. The whole crawling expertise is hardly worth it at all. You know, there's some transfer of knowledge, but the you new universe that's made accessible to the baby by it's now daunting ability to stand forces it to revolutionize its entire cognitive structure. Now I'll give you want to tell you a very quick story because it's a very good one. So this is a good indication of the function of dream in place. So when my daughter was three, she couldn't talk very well. She, she learned to speak late and we lived in Boston and when she learned to speak, cheat, developed a Boston accent, which we were completely flabbergasted by because we didn't have a Boston accent and neither did any of our neighbors. It turns out there's a speech impediment that sounds just like a Boston accent. But anyway, she was usually goes away except in Boston.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       So anyway, she, she was, she was three and when her brother was born, there's always the possibility of sibling rivalry, right? Because, and for good reason, it's like, okay, time to get rid of that thing. All it's doing is taking a hold of mum's attention. You know, like that's a hard reality for a child who's under three to manage because they're still pretty dependent and it's like, well why should they be liking this horrible, noisy attention grabbing interloper? So we tried to, we tried to teach her right from the time he came home, her, her, her brother, that the idea where she was going to lose something, which was some parental attention, especially from her mother, but she was potentially going to gain something which was maturity, independence and the possibility of a new relationship. Now we couldn't tell her that. Some parents will tell their three year olds that it's like in your three year old is learning.

Speaker 1:          01:06:58       But look at you when you talk. But they're actually hearing, you know how dogs in cartoons here, people talk. It's like one on one on one, one on a walk. Why don't want to walk. That's how children hear you talk when you're talking to them about something like independence. Like what the hell did they know about that? That's way up there on the hierarchy. But we tried to teach her to interact with the baby in such a way that she would elicit positive feedback from him and so that they can be friends. And then we also taught her that she should take care of the baby and that gives her something to do. So that worked. We also didn't let them tease each other. Not much. You know, they're going to tease each other a bit because it, siblings often bloody hate each other when they're, when they're young.

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       And sometimes that just destroys the relationship for their whole life. It's like you don't want that because you're stuck with your dad and brother until he dies, hopefully, or until you do. So. Anyway, so my daughter was taking care of this little guy and you know, she used to watch them on the stamps and sort of shepherd him around and she was, she was pretty good at it. And then, um, one day he started to walk and she kept talking about her baby and we told her that, well, he wasn't reading a baby anymore and we didn't realize that this was setting off a cognitive revolution of the Piagetian cert because of course she'd Kinda grown attached to this baby, just like mothers and my do sometimes get so attached to their babies that they really don't want them to stop being babies. And so they end up living in their house till they're 55, you know, wanting to destruction of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:08:23       So you don't want to have that happen. So, but it was happening in the microwave with her. It's like, well there's this baby and I spent a lot of time getting used to it and figuring out what to do with it. Now it's not a baby anymore. What the hell is it? So she had this amazing dream and it ties back to the [inaudible] stuff that I caught you guys about earlier. So this is the dream. She dreamed that the baby crawl into a hole in the backyard. Now, the way the whole got there was that a tree from the park beside us had moved into our backyard and then hit burned down and left this hole and then the whole was full of water. And so the baby crawl into the water and it reduced them to a skeleton. And then there was a bug in the water and the bug pulled him out.

Speaker 1:          01:09:04       And when he came out he was a new creature. So it was, it was perfect. Like she came and told me that, I don't know, like two in the morning in her little three year old voice and they go into all type down. It was absolutely spectacular because it wasn't straight shamonic tree, like the tree burned down. And so that's a transformation motif. And then water is the place of rebirth and you know, the kid was dissolved into a skeleton and the little bug that pulled them out, it's like a representation of the underlying process that guides transformation. Your own brain was working like mad and trying to figure out continuity over change. That's a tough one, right? Because it's almost like a butterfly urging from a cocoon. It's a big deal, baby to toddler. That's a big difference. You know, she's supposed to figure out, well that's the same thing. Well no it's not. So underneath her unconscious mind, you know, three year olds are not stupid. Even though they can't talk, they've got this brain that's like 3.5 billion years old. It's not stupid. So, so anyways, no, why was I telling you that?

Speaker 1:          01:10:11       Oh well then it's another indication of how, so the transformations of cognitive structure are forced upon a child, at least in part by the development of increasing physical ability, right? Because as you increase its physical ability and capacity, then the world transforms and then your cognitive processes have to transform to keep up with them. And sometimes that's a radical transformation. So Piaget's fundamental hypothesis is that part of the reason that people are motivated to undergo cognitive transformations and learning per se is because as they mature, they re they automatically come into contact with anomalous information, information that they cannot process from within the confines of the current world model. And because they kind of process it, it interferes with them getting what they want. And so they're motivated to keep their cognitive structures updated. So in, sometimes the revolutions occur at a micro level and that might be like when you're learning the difference between this and this, you know, it's like it's a major difference but it doesn't disrupt the whole fabric of your conceptual universe.

Speaker 1:          01:11:16       Whereas a divorce, Mike, the baby transformed me into a toddler might. Puberty does. It's just like you just find the gun used to your body. You're 12 years old, so you're sort of at the pinnacle of childhood. You're like an adult child, you know what you're doing. And 11 and 12 year olds are often lovely creatures because they're pretty mature and they've got their act together and then all of a sudden bang sex hormones kick in. It's like you are no longer the same thing and neither is anyone you interact with. And so it's like turbulence for three, four or five 2030 years until you sort of sort that out, which she never really do. And so you can see how

Speaker 1:          01:11:58       the physiological transformations that are attended on development, some biologically predicated and some and emergent consequence of learning disrupt the cognitive structures that people use to orient themselves in the world. And that some of those disruptions are sort of low key equivalent to normal science now to be assimilation and some of them much broader. And that's equivalent to accommodation. Assimilation means you learn something new that you can already handle using the constructs and scheme is that you have at hand. You know, so maybe you have to pick the thing up like this instead of like this, but you already know this and you know that. So who cares? It's like a little minor alteration and sometimes, well no, you have to readapt your whole body in order to handle the next level of complex problem solving. Learning to drive is like that. Learning to ride a bicycle is like that. And you can see that there's sort of a, there's not really normal versus revolutionary transformation. There's sort of a continuum that Mac themselves onto that hierarchy I showed you. You know? So if at the very highest levels of resolution, it's minor transformations, send up the higher levels of abstraction, you can blow out whole huge chunks of yourself. So it's a continuum. But Piaget and coon sort of conceptualized it hasn't.

Speaker 2:          01:13:18       All right. Let's see. That's a map of that which you can look up. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       Oh yes, this is the, this, this, this is the thing I really want to get out to this is, it's so brilliant. And so psa was concerned about morality and he's one of the few psychologists I think, who like, he nailed it. It's this is like the most important thing piaget discovered and maybe it's one of the most important things that a psychologist has ever discovered. It's like how do you become moral? Well, we've already mentioned that when you acquire a behavior, you inevitably acquire in a social context. So what that means is that right from the time you're little and learning things, the demands of society are encoded in the behaviors that you're allowed to manifest. And so science to some degree, by the time you behave the way you do behave, you're three. If you've been properly socialized, you already act out the embodied moral structure of your entire community.

Speaker 1:          01:14:21       So you know when you talk about law, as you say, there's a body of laws and the body of law is used to be the cake. So you have to do with the king set up. But now the body of laws is an abstract conceptual representation. But those representations are actually semantic representations of allowable and not allowable behavior. And so by the time you're three and you're a law abiding three year old, which means you're well socialized, you're already acting in accordance with the law, the patterns that characterize your beating, the behavioral patterns that characterize your Ba have already been molded into the patterns that you manifest. And so what that means in some sense is you're already, as Nietzsche would say, an unconscious advocate of your culture because you're acting it out. Now here's an example. Here's an example of how that can be transformed into actual moral knowledge.

Speaker 1:          01:15:07       So he has, he goes to the studies kids playing a game. So here's an example. So there's a bunch of kids and they're standing around in the playground and they're all playing helicopter. Maybe they've just got sticks and they're always, you know, when they're flying in helicopters around and they're all doing this and maybe they're diving in each other. So what's happened is each kid wants to have a helicopter and each kid wants to be a good helicopter pilot. But each kid wants to be a good helicopter pilot in the way that other kids appreciate. Well, they're being good helicopter pilots. That's tough phase. So not only do you have to figure out how to coordinate your behavior, you have to figure out how to coordinate your behavior with other people, coordinating, coordinating their behavior in such a way that the shared activity not only does not come to a stop, but precedes an enjoyable way.

Speaker 1:          01:15:54       Jesus, that's really tough. Now if your kid can play well with other kids, that's what they've managed. Okay, so you've got four kids doing this and there's rules. Actually there's not, there's rituals that the children are embodying that they've agreed upon. Well, they set up the game and they've just sort of bash the ideas up against each other and they came up with a solution. And you can tell that because the game is continuing and everyone is having fun. It's like, is everyone playing nice? Yes, that's an equivalent rated place state. And it's a moral organization because all the children are participating voluntarily towards a shared end. And as for piaget, that was the model of a functional society. That's so smart. So now imagine that a kid comes along and maybe he's a popular kid, so he has a reasonable chance of getting into this playgroup.

Speaker 1:          01:16:38       You'll still be robust like 50% of the time. Whereas if he's not blocking her kid, it's like forget, they're just not going to let him into the little helicopters circle. And there's probably because he's developmentally delayed or an in some other way, he doesn't understand how we asked to configure his behavior so that he can enter this complex, dramatic scene without disrupting it. Or maybe he's one of those kids who says, I don't want to bring helicopter, we should play something else. It's like, no, unless you're a creative genius. That's a pretty bad idea. So what the popular kids do, if they sort of side loft to the group, maybe they find a stick cause they watch what they're doing, maybe they find a stick and they sort of started going cause this is sick and they're sort of looking at to see if that stick helicopter behavior is acceptable to the peers.

Speaker 1:          01:17:27       And maybe, you know, one of the friends sort of notices that they're playing helicopters and they open up the circle of Maca and gets to come in and play helicopters. But he might fail it out even if he's popular. Because once in the little play thing is going, it's like a plague, right? It's got a dramatic structure. You can't just come in there and you know, start playing basketball or something. So now what Piaget noticed was that when children were playing your game, maybe they were playing, Barbara's not so rough game and you because you can win and lose it. Marvelous. And you might say, well, children shouldn't play competitive games. But if you say that, that's a sure sign that you don't know what the hell you're talking about because all games are competitive and cooperative at the same time. If they share a single goal and it's really not a game unless there's a goal.

Speaker 1:          01:18:12       Cause goal games have goals. And so what the children do is they, they organize themselves. So they all decide what constitutes an acceptable goal. And the goal with marvel says when some marbles and lose the marbles without whining about it, that's another goal. And that's an important thing to learn. So the children say, well, here's the foundation of our local moral universe. Here's the rules that we're going to abide. By and large, those are ritualistic. They might've learned them from other kids. So they play marbles. You extract out a kid and you say, what are the rules for marbles? And if it gets like seven, they don't know. They can't tell you. But if you put them in with a bunch of other seven year olds, they can play marbles perfectly well. So what that means is the morality is coated in their behavior or in the behavior of the group, like a bunch of feeds, you know, cause there's knowledge in a hive of bees or making it a school of fish.

Speaker 1:          01:18:59       So it's embedded in the child's behavior and in their patterns of action across time. And then if you pull them out, they can only give like a partial of the counter, but they're not conscious of the morality. It's like it pulled a war fighter of a wolf pack and say, well you know what's up with the wolf pack and the wall, you know, bites you because that's just, that's how it answers questions. It's not going to tell you about the rules. It's only later in development that the children become conscious of the rules and then they become very irritated that people break them and they don't much later do. They start to understand that the rules can be adjusted by mutual agreement and that is associated with the Phn and development of higher order of morality. It's brilliant. You learn your actions, your actions are conditioned by other people. The actions are integrated into a voluntary game. Then the actions are integrated into a series of voluntary games. That social interaction, then you learn the descriptions. Then you learn how to manipulate the descriptions. Brilliant. Moving up the hierarchy, snatch a Piagetian theory. In a nutshell constructed, this is a nutshell. See you on Thursday.
