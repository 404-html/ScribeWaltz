Speaker 1:          00:09          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:12          I haven't seen people since the last time I was.

Speaker 2:          00:23          I was originally planning to speak to you about responsibility. I wanted to suggest that you should be leery of trusting people whose primary concern here's to be their own rights or the rights of the hypothetically oppressed groups that they hypothetically could by no means necessarily to speak for. It's still want to do that. It's better for young people to concentrate on the responsibility rather than the rights they've been cared for all their lives, but other people being as of yet unable to give back to the world what it takes to mature their survival. It's not merely initiative obligation either. Young people, not only young people need meaning in their lives as well as do regard from others. Meaning is to be following in responsibility. People find meaning and the responsibility of their careers, their families, their friends, the chairman, the work they do for others, the education they pursued, the voluntary obligations they undertake and the suffering they endeavor to reduce.

Speaker 2:          01:30          It's not the rights that are granted to you by others so that you can be awarded your rewards and privileges that will make your limited and mortal life worthwhile. It is. Instead, the sacrifices you make to the highest good that you can conceptualize and strive to attain. Beware the peddlers of rights and wish to turn you into someone who is similar, Tanium, asleep, privileged and victimized. Why narcissistic, noisy, demanding, chronically unhappy and of little use to themselves or other people. Instead, sort yourselves out shoulder your responsibilities, make yourself useful to others. Find the heaviest burden you can bear and bear it stoically forthrightly and admirably.

Speaker 2:          02:23          Having dealt with that, I'll turn it to something that I believe is more pressing. You're all here because you're concerned about the future. I'm concerned about the future too because of that concern. I feel it necessary to say a few words, which I'm still trying to formulate properly about the newest form of political pathology to manifest itself in this. Our district, they confused in chaotic Western society. Truly. However, I should not say newest. I should stay say in stamp the resurgence of an exceptionally dangerous logically and thoroughly discredited older ideal one the dude entire societies and huge populations to unnecessary suffering and the bloody and done fortunate and all too forgotten from 20th century. The idea equality, the reasonable value placed among other values, but again the dog, but he only made it to the highest place and promoted blindly later with an undertone, undeserved, nuorder, Devon's resentment, jealousy spike in hate.

Speaker 2:          03:33          It's not just equality and it's more of Banal. Next prestige is not merely equality of opportunity. To say that I don't talk about what equity and quality of outcome, the ultimate can rapid wolf in the most caring, the sheep's clothing. It's line of equity is being raised as a group and it's the very social justice warriors, the very postmodern, neo Marxists activist activists whose words I despise. We're waiving it everywhere. The danger, this presents can barely be overstated. It needs to be stopped. When I spoke at mcmaster university last year, the profane chapters students under the spell of the reprehensible professors, ideological idiocy insisted repetitively. This is where we draw the line. This is where we draw the line. This is where we draw the line referring to my hypothetical bigotry and uncaring attitude towards the individuals they reported to represent. Today I want to draw a line of my own and I encourage you to join me.

Speaker 2:          04:34          In doing so, we have to bring the confused historically ignorant and resentful purveyors of the terrible doctrine of equality, of outcome to a halt. We have to draw a line before the functional structures that make up our society, our underminded damaged beyond repair. So I'm going to talk to you today about the great errors, the self, righteously caring attitude of the equity purveyors hide within the confines of their low resolution in cautious elder, rhythmic ideological propaganda. I cannot present a complete argument, but I can at least help like the territory that must be mapped in more detail and publicize broadly for Dan takes hypothetically well meaning people on the left had been beating the drum for a society where equality of opportunity is the norm by large. This is also a goal supported by people in the political center and on the right. Society is better served in individuals, better provided with the means of moving forward forthrightly and with hope when arbitrary impediments to the realization of their abilities are eliminated to the degree that is possible.

Speaker 2:          05:47          However, even the elimination of inequities related to opportunity is something that must be attempted with all new carer. The ability to raise children thoughtfully and carefully and to provide them with high quality education, social networks and the opportunity to develop their own skills and interests is not something equally distributed among all parents. It's beans that some children will be provided with opportunities that others will lack. Governmental or other organizations may attempt to provide redress for such inequality, but that's done at some risk. A substantial proportion of what has done positively for children and good families occurs at such a young age. The government intervention, however well meaning would mean invasion, occupation and colonization of the sound salmon to a degree like they do produce negative consequences. It's far outweigh whatever positive good might be done. A good rule is done. It might be that nervous society, you should strive to do whatever good to be done for disadvantaged children and their parents.

Speaker 2:          06:50          It does not civil tediously interfere with or make more difficult. The Goodman is already being done by parents who are skilled and fortunate enough to do the demanding job in an admirable and socially productive manner. Substandard debate between those on the left interested in broad scale social interventions to improve life quality for those who are less fortunate and those on the right who wish to protect and maintain the integrity and the rights of the family must continue. I'm cramming so that the dangers that lurk on the unmoderated extremes can be minimized. We don't want to let any children suffer unnecessarily. We don't want the abilities and skills. They might develop an offer to society to be wasted, but we don't want impersonal, large scale systems suffering from the pathologies of gigantism to interfere with the function of the basic family unit, which despite me to this inadequacies has yet to be replaced. Even conceptually I anything remotely as functional.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Okay.

Speaker 2:          07:51          The provision of universal secondary and to a degree postsecondary education has 11th the planes deal substantially. The safety net provided by universal healthcare plays the same role as does the offering of old age pension, disability allowances, unemployment insurance and welfare. Although individuals across the political spectrum continue to debate the details of size and implementation associated with such benefits of income redistribution, there is substantial agreement among all regarding the essential utility.

Speaker 2:          08:26          It might be also noted that there are conservative as well as liberal and left wing arguments to be made in favor of some flattening of income inequality. The data indicating that serious crime including most important they nail on male homicide, maybe driven to levels that threatened social stability when inequality increases beyond some hypothetical optimum are solid and persuasive. Thus there is a case to be made for enhanced social stability through the intelligent of at least opportunity and perhaps I didn't come stuff as well as the case that is made by more or less bleeding individuals on behalf of abstract fairness. Nonetheless, there are already questionable practices associated with improvement of the quality of opportunity, of equality, of opportunity that it be set in place. In addition to those over you noted, these include most particular the so called affirmative action programs that have become almost universally instantiated into higher replaced within promotion processes that characterize most large, large modern institutions in place theoretically to provide redress for historical inequalities.

Speaker 2:          09:35          Shows is the history of slavery that characterize the American black population some six generations ago. Perhaps a case can be named for such things as well, although they are associated with clear dangers. The most egregious of these is the insistence tied it. Take me to the claims of those enamored with postmodern identity politics that certain group oriented aspects of human identities such as race, sex, and now sexual proclivity of gender identity are sufficiently real and important. So the judgment of people on the grounds of the individual competence alone should be suspended in favor of ill defined. Planes of social justice are the minor and these include statements in job postings indicating that applications from individuals with certain specified group level attributes are particularly welcome. What dangers are associated with such practices? Well, the first is that specified particular welcome on the part of some groups clearly implies less welcome on the part of others as the postmodern theorists who push such things forward would be first to point out such thinkers constantly make the claim that value structure is by necessity exclude and should be flattened.

Speaker 2:          10:50          For that reason they don't extend the same rationale to attempts to hire a preferentially. However, because the Marxism that lurks behind there hypothetically pure postmodern reasoning justifies identification of people by group identity and selection on that basis because of its insistence that the dialectic of oppressor and oppressed characterized as all so called power structures. The second problem is that only a very narrow subset of the wide range of potential group identities and therefore group paid qualities can possibly be identified and rectified by such practices privileging those alphabets of group identity above all others. Again, using the hollowing terminology of the postmodernists themselves means instantiate those and those and only those elements as vitally characteristic of the individuals in question to encourage or select on the basis of race and sex. And the other is sacred descriptors of the modern anti individual left is similar tediously to insist that those are the categories upon which people should be judged. It doesn't take much in the way of intelligence and insight to see how easily this process can be reversed and used in the opposite direction by those on the radical right who might be inclined to insist that ration sex are precisely the relevant categories by which people should be judged for the very purposes of exclusion and prejudicial discrimination. Those on the left, hypothetically oppose with sauce for the goose is sauce for the Gander.

Speaker 2:          12:29          Such a reversal is making itself currently manifest in the increasing proclivity of those attacked, for example, for their quote white privilege and quote to start insisting on their racial identity as a primary hallmark and to shift from guilt to overt claims of supremacy. What else could we get possibly expect? Something very similar happened with the black power and black is beautiful movements in the late sixties and early seventies the third problem is the tendency for demands for equality of opportunity to devolve evermore rapidly in serious into demands for equity, which has now become defined as equality, not opportunity, but the outcome itself. This is happening currently at a rate that beggars belief give the absolute catastrophes that social, economic, and political policies predicated on equality of outcome have produced in the past. What does equity mean? It's predicated on two ideas, each more pernicious than the other. The first is that all social institutions must produce outcomes of whatever sort that are precisely equal across all possible group identities.

Speaker 2:          13:44          The second is that social institutions that do not produce those equal outcomes do not produce them because of institutional racism, sexism, or other ism. That is as well characteristic of the explicit and implicit prejudices of those individuals who make up the institutions of questions. Health. There are a number of logical reasons why sex demands cannot be net and they're not desirable. Even in principle. Surrounding those logical reasons is a plethora of historical data indicating most recently in Venezuela that economic policies predicated on the idea of a radical equality are catastrophic. Even genocidal. We'll start with the logical reasons to determine whether or not a given institution is inequitable. The institution is first stratified according to the hypothetical privilege and power get awards to different individuals who occupied different positions within it. Then the demographic makeup of those strata are analyzed along lines of racial, ethnic and gender identity as well as sexual proclivity and contrast it with the demographics that have obtain in the general population surrounding the institution.

Speaker 1:          15:02          Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:02          What is wrong with this

Speaker 1:          15:05          first

Speaker 2:          15:07          section? Analysis are predicated on the idea that institutions primarily the function to distribute resources and reward. That's only one of the many functions. It's a hallmark of the kind of ideologically rigid conceptualization, the dry such assessments. Then only one factor is ever considered. This makes being right and being self righteous above it, a very straight forward manner, radically and observing, reducing the cognitive demands that a truly comprehensive analysis would require. Complex, hierarchical social organizations are not simply your mechanisms for distributing resources and rewards nor are they in case it needs to be said merely structures of power, privilege and oppression. They are in part of course both of these until radica societies they be mostly me. Both of these, my name is functional. It's free societies

Speaker 2:          16:07          such as those that primarily characterize the west. Despite it's flaws, they are also structures of responsibility and production. The evidence for this is overwhelming by historical and current world standards. People in the West will house and wealth stay. In fact, we're more currently threatened Michael obesity than by starvation with few exceptions. Everyone has indoor plumbing, central heating, access to education and connections to the worldwide web, which provides on an entirely rely on a basis more information at lower cost and this ever been available previously. The fact that the West does this with great efficiency comparatively speaking, can be seen in the fact that immigrants move virtually without exception from the great balls of dysfunctional to radica societies from all over the world to the comparatively freedom productive countries of Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. And not the reverse.

Speaker 1:          17:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          17:19          are complex social tools of production make and do things and we'll report bleed maybe and do things the people want regardless of what might be regarded as their consumers. Triviality. No centrally planned economy produces a selection of shampoos or toothbrushes or automatic and watch blinders were kite surfing kinds of things or lightweight bicycles or video games. A hardy minded and judgmental social justice advocate might dispute this. Such a hyper productionist trivial, but it's still very likely to spend hours per day texting his or her friends and desirable political cliches on expensive I iphones and androids one minutes. Meat is another man's poison is by no means clear. Who should judge whether something that someone else desires. Maybe acceptably produced in a world where absolute privation still exists.

Speaker 1:          18:17          Okay.

Speaker 2:          18:17          Because our hierarchical organizations make new things that people want and because the people differ in their competence. In doing so, different people experience different demand for their services. We adjudicate such demand with pay. This is the alternative to slavery. If you are producing things that people want, then you are entitled to charge what people are willing to pay for your services or to refuse to provide such services at your whim. If you choose, you get this privilege because what you provide for other people as value and it is therefore useful for other people to encourage you to continue to provide it. They don't have to buy your offering either anymore than you have to produce it. Although that's not the very definition of freedom is certainly constitutes an important element of freedom.

Speaker 1:          19:08          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:08          Because some people are more confident making or doing those things, they can demand a higher price for their participation. This is because of what they're offering, not because of what they intrinsically deserve. It may be the case that I'm early elements of identity determined to some degree the differential probability that any given individual will come to occupy a place for he or she can offer the fruits of their labor. But if there's also the case that their skill at production is a major contributor, this is the demonstrated empirically complex jobs, administrative, managerial, nonacademic required, high intelligence and high levels of the big five personality trait conscientiousness that most careful of psychometric investigations into such things have clearly demonstrated that a combination of intelligence and conscientiousness, which can both be accurately measured correlates at about 0.6 with longterm life success in such occupations, some of the remaining variation in success can be attributed to random factors such as health and even counterproductive of fair systemic prejudice alone with a fair degree of measurement error as productivity and success for notoriously hard to quantify.

Speaker 2:          20:22          Now, nonetheless, correlations of that magnitude are exceptionally rare in the social and health sciences and they are not to be easily and carelessly dismissed. The same thing can be said with regards to success and entrepreneurial and creative endeavors, which when complex also require intelligence but demand big five traits, openness, which is a dimension indexing capacity to produce novel ideas and perceptual frames. To the degree that traits obviously logically lead to productive success actually predict steps to success. The systems in which success such success manifests itself can be regarded as examples of fair and reasonable gauge. It should also be pointed out that many said games exist so that people who are not conscientious or intelligent work creative still have the chance to win it popularity and say it desire for vision, time in the formulation of close interpersonal relationships are in the provision of safety, insecurity, these other domains of potential achievement or differentially valued by people in accordance with their intrinsic traits of personality.

Speaker 2:          21:29          This means that a person who was primarily agreeable for example, may well choose to maximize their engagement in interpersonal relationships out the cost of career or entrepreneurial success, and who is to say that's not a reasonable trade off. It is also the case that there are many more elements of group identity that must be reasonably considered if the case could be made that the elements of race and sex, et Cetera, must be considered. People are differentially successful because they are older. Older people are wealthier. Well, why? Well, because they've had their whole life to generate wealth. Is that fair or unfair? Should it be rectified or is it reasonable? There are younger. They're better at sports. If you're younger, you're more likely to attract sexual partners if you're younger. Some things are better for men and some things are better for women. Some things are better for attractive people.

Speaker 2:          22:26          Some things are better for people who are up the majority race or religion or tribe or language. Some things are more accessible to unattractive people, so character acting, for example, falls into that category. People have different interests. People have different education. People have different levels of mental and physical health and people differentially regulate their use of drugs and alcohol. Those are all dimensions upon which people can be categorized by group and there's no reason to privilege, race, sex, sexual identity, gender identity, gender expression and um, above these other dimensions of group identity which are equally valuable, which are equally valid and play into who we important role. People judge different outcomes as a different worth, love children's leisure, power, duty, surface pleasure, aesthetics, novelty, spirituality, all of these factors and many more to determine inequitable outcomes. How then should people be properly categorized to ensure equity?

Speaker 2:          23:34          Even a small set of entities can be categorized in near infinite number of ways. Who's going to measure all these differences? Who's going to determine which of them are important and which of a mark who's going to measure the outcomes and some of the up to complicate issues further, who is going to determine whether they are biologically instantiated, socially constructed or mere choice? Apparently like gender. Are they mutable or fixed and deterministic if they're immutable merely as a matter of choice as legislation in Canada. Now, incest is, for example, with regards to gender identity and gender expression that should those differences and also be regarded as relevant determinants of an equity. If people could make change their hope categorization merely as a consequence of an act of will, why would you consider that a relevant category to determine levels of inequality? Furthermore, who's going to measure and determine the rewards? Are we going to insist that everyone must be equally posture and outgoing, equally assertive and enthusiastic, equally private and introverted, Carrington polite or demanding and competitive, industrious and orderly, creative, interested in ideas. What are those outcomes? Less important or less worthy of note, that corporate position or economic compensation,

Speaker 2:          25:02          are we going to swallow without question? The idea that career position in monetary gain or the old be Jenkin values that exist that should be considered that are worthy of merit. It's a very strange thing for those on the radical left to insist that the very criteria by which large corporations judge the utility of individuals are precisely those that should be used to assess equality of outcomes, fairness and diversity. Let's say it again. It isn't what you deserve for intrinsic reasons that determines your outcome. It's the word that others attributed to your offerings. Think of an offering on Ebay. No sellers says, I am Azur Bay Sham and my mother was had mother has Alzheimer's and I'm not well educated but I tall and strong, although not very attractive and I was bullied as a child but I'm quite musical. Although I only have one print and I'm slightly overweight and prone to anxiety, so you have to pay the $50 for my secondhand crock pot.

Speaker 1:          26:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          26:18          they say, instead I have this item and you don't care who I am and I don't care who you are except that I would describe it honestly and ship it and you will pay for it. You can agree on a mutually beneficial price that's trade. The reward runs both ways. Trade is not charity. Trade is mutually beneficial. Trade does not and cannot rectify historical or biological injustices. It can only hardly and momentarily satisfying. The people engaged in the particular trade. Attempts to redistribute through trade tend to kick it back. Look at that is the way people there have now lost an average of 18 pounds. Cuba can barely feed itself. Everything is running down and barely functional. I think one of the most comical things I've seen in recent years was the motor convoy transferring Fidel Castro's damned corpse to the, to the, uh, to the cemetery breaking down in the middle of the front

Speaker 1:          27:27          session.

Speaker 2:          27:34          Everything is run down in Belize, functionable. Why? Because the problem of distribution is so complex that it has to be outsourced to the collective intelligence. Knows person, group of persons or imaginable computational device can perform the calculations of the price. The measurements can even be made. This is because of the price of anything is dependent on the price of everything else. And to make it worse is always shifting flawed as the free market system is. We don't have anything better, but let's say instead we transfer determination of power, status, privilege and desire to a group of people. What group, how do we regulate their biases and correct for the rape? It's how do we limit their power, how do we protect ourselves against their ideologies and hatred? And entrance. How do we discriminate the desire to help the unfortunate from the wish to destroying the weld constituted and successful?

Speaker 2:          28:42          We don't and we can't and we won't, but we'll have those basket political maneuvering, most convinced of their righteousness, least aware of their ignorance and limitations of knowledge. And Sue, most filled with resentment and hatred will instantly rise to dominate such positions. And then all hell will break on it. How do we know this? Because it already happened and it killed 100 million people. And maybe I'm told the others destitute and miserable, and it just about destroyed the world. We already ran this experiment and fail, and then we ran it again and it fail. And then we ran it again. And then they fail. And then we replicated the failure. No one who was not eight, your rent would dare to experiment concepts, things again, unless they were malevolent. So which it is, which isn't youth purveyor as an equity. You merchants of yesterday's poison. Are you ignorant or 1100
