Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       it's looking good here today with Gregg Hurwitz, who's a novelist and a screenwriter and a comic book writer and a variety of other things as well. And uh, we're going to talk a little bit about his latest book, the nowhere man, and then we're going to talk to him about writing more generally. That's the plan anyways. So how are you doing? Great. I'm doing well, thank you. So why don't you start by telling us a little bit about your new book and then about who you are.

Speaker 3:          00:00:45       Well, my new book, I started a new series with my last book, um, and usually I write standalone thrillers, but my last book was based on, uh, I've, I've sort of done a lot of really dumb things in the name of research over the years. So I've gone undercover to mind control bolts. I've gone up and done airplanes, I've snuck on a demolition ranges with navy seals and blowing up cars. And one of the things that kept coming up when I dealt with a lot of the SPEC ops guys were how these off the books programs were implemented over the years. The sort of history beneath the history that we're all aware of and I got really interested in this and I thought about a character who was taken out of foster homes that the age of 12. This is a program called the orphan program and basically raised up to be assassins to be their full training.

Speaker 3:          00:01:35       It's their full life and that's orphan x. that's the first book in the series. And so in the second book, the one that's just come out called the nowhere man. This acid is taken by somebody who doesn't know who he is, but want something from him and he's taken off and spirited off out to this remote chateau. He doesn't know where it is and the people don't know, have no idea what his real identity is or who he is. And they think that he's trapped in there with them. And in fact they're trapped in there with him and they're soon going to realize that they have a major problem on their hands. And so it's the second and the folding out of this new character. His name is Evan Smoke.

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       So this is the first time that you've written a series. I know it's the second time you've written a series, is that right?

Speaker 3:          00:02:19       Yeah. I heard a series early in my career and then I went, I've, I went about nine books with Tiana loans and then I returned to wet. And part of that is, it takes so long. I mean the majority of my waking hours I'm spending inside of manuscripting with a character like I spend more time with my characters who were fictional that I do with my wife and kids. And so it took me years to find your characters or less complicated, which is actually one of the themes of, uh, of the books. Um, one of the ways in which, uh, the complications that arise from intimacy because my character was, I was raised with the veil of perfection. You know, a lot of the notions that I played with him. I came to when I was writing on, on Batman. I wrote Batman Comics for a couple of years and there were some notions in there, the interest in me, and one of them was the balance between perfection and intimacy.

Speaker 3:          00:03:14       That was my main focus with Batman because part of the reason why I liked that man so much is you know he doesn't have a magic ring light green lantern. He can't fly like superman. He's just a human who represents the pinnacle of what can be accomplished through sheer discipline. But part of why that works is his parents are dead. He's not married, he has no kids. He lives up in Maine, in Wayne Manor, and he's completely undisturbed by everyone and everything so we can hone it. And the more that you let people into your life and the more that you allow intimacy in your life, the more complications come. That sort of detract from this previous notion of perfection.

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       I've got a question about that. So that seems to me to reflect in some sense the problem, maybe the different problems or maybe the different orientation of of men and women. So it's possible for men too, and I think many men can do this too, is to sacrifice everything, including intimacy to become really good at one thing. Whereas women, as far as I can tell, and of course this is a broad generalization and one that will undoubtedly get me in trouble,

Speaker 3:          00:04:24       we would never get in trouble.

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       No, no. I know women are, I think more concerned with intimacy and relationship. And that's an interesting dichotomy that you established between those two. And so what, why you said that intimacy detracts from perfection because it's sort of, it spreads you out in the world. Why did you come across that particular paradox? Why do you think that one fascinates you?

Speaker 3:          00:04:54       Well, I'm, I'm hyper

Speaker 4:          00:04:58       and one of the things that I noticed is, and I think that's the thing, when you find a character who you need to live with more than you do with your family, you have to find something at the heart of them that's uniquely compelling. And for me, I think I have.

Speaker 3:          00:05:10       I have a strong perfectionist drive and as I've got when I was younger, it served me well, right? A lot of the traits that we have or negative traits that might be survival instincts that got us through a key period of our life, um, they're easy to discard when they're not helpful. Right? So like, if you can have a bit of a temper, it's easy to get rid of it. The ones that are really hard or adaptive, you know, qualities that we have that have gotten us very, very far. But now we're starting to interfere with our lives. And so one of the things that I noticed is that my drive for severe discipline and perfection, uh, is tough when you're married, when you have a wife, when you have two kids, when you have a dog, if you're singularly focused, but it's also not something that the answer is to just give up completely, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:05:55       So it's trying to find a of maintaining the value and the drive and the discipline that's necessary to be a novelist and a screenwriter and comp writer and, and also the exhibit discipline in other areas of my life, while also a lab allowing for sort of the complications that come with intimacy. And so with Evan Smoke, with my main character, for me, the whole series coalesce around a certain exchange that he has, which is, you know, one of the things that I did when I first was thinking about him being pulled out, he's this broke foster kid, pulled out of the projects in East Baltimore at the age of 12 and he's raised only by handler. No one even knows who he is and his codings or fanatics. And I thought instead of making this the usual Sabi backstory, what if that handler was a really fundamentally good man and became like a father figure and actually loved him.

Speaker 3:          00:06:47       And at one point Jack Johns, who's his handler, tells him the heart when he's a kid. He says, the hard part is not going to be making you a killer. The hard part is gonna be keeping you human and forever and the thing that stuck in my head was it would be so much easier if he was just purely as an acid, if his moral compass was never broken, but because of the way that he was raised, he at a certain point, the ambiguity's of committee, these assassinations in different territories where we're not supposed to be and he has limited information that the moral ambiguity is become too much and he leaves and become sort of a pro bono assassin for people in desperate need. Like that's where we meet him in the series and it's only because Jack had gave him a human connection that opened up the complexities that make this complicated for him. You know, when I was writing the punisher is a marvel character. That's not hard. The punishers families, all dad, he just wants to kill everybody. He wants to punish everybody. With Evan, there's this thing at the heart of it that like he still has to function with this humanity that was given to him from his father figure. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:07:50       I was thinking that of the Batman movie with Heath Ledger, and one of the things that happens in the movie is that the joker accuses Batman of being exactly the same as he is fundamentally like there you could say opposite sides of the same coin or maybe even closer than that. And it seems to me that there's something in what you're saying that mitigates against the deadly danger, maybe even what you call it, a psychopathic intensity of single mindedness because one question you might ask yourself is that if, if, if intimacy interferes with perfection, then why bother with it?

Speaker 3:          00:08:28       Probably not, right. And well, and also like how do we widen out the definition of perfection? It's like, okay, so if you take Bruce Wayne to his logical end and he's, you know, killed a lot of bad guys and maintain fit physical perfection, uh, and dies alone in his manner is that actually perfection. Like you have to broaden our definition of what you apply perfection to. And um, I didn't

Speaker 2:          00:08:53       do as good a job of laying out that dichotomy in my earlier question. I might've, but one of the things you mentioned was that it was his presupposition that men were after perfection and women were after wholeness. That's a more inclusive than the issue with perfection is, but it's single minded, right? And that only focuses on, let's say one thing, whereas wholeness seems to be something more like the balance between a variety of, of, uh, positive and valuable things. And you can't be perfect at a variety of useful and balanced are valuable at balance things you have to settle for maybe b plus at a, at a variety of them. But the question is, is the totality ethan more valuable than perfection along one axis? And I suppose it depends on the situation, but, but obviously that's something that you're continually toying with and you said it because it reflects a similar situation in your own life and with your own character.

Speaker 3:          00:09:52       So you,

Speaker 2:          00:09:53       you've managed to integrate intimacy into your life. And so what's been the advantage to that?

Speaker 3:          00:10:01       Well, the advantage is it's, I mean, a lot of the things that give that ultimately give I think pleasure and meaning to life come from intimacy. You know, it's that thing, it's like there's the old saw that people say when people die, it's rare that they're going to say, Gosh, I wish I worked more in regardless of what the work is versus spending time with your family and with your friends. And it's like I've noticed increasingly as I get older, there's a shift in priorities and values, but it stills one that's, it's hard for me at times because I get, I can get single minded. I mean I can get hypo manic when I'm writing. I write generally 10 hours a day, but I've written as much as 23 hours straight, you know, when I was on a TV show that was a risk of shutting down and we needed a script and there's just not a choice for it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:49       So I can get incredibly focused. But the more focused that that I get with writing, one of the things that you're doing with writing when you're in a venture that's difficult is you have a very high error recognition, um, alarm system, right? That's cliche. That's not gonna work that's been seen before. And you want to do something that's new and if you're in a field that's hard, that's turned up really high, well that can make living with you really difficult or interacting with other people. Very effective for work to say, how do I make everything better? What's everything that's wrong with this? It's sort of an approach to a manuscript, but it doesn't work as well if you have a two year old or a five year old at home where you're trying to to to deal with something else and you can also lose perspective.

Speaker 3:          00:11:28       So there's a, there's a single mindedness to the range of perfection that you can lose things at the periphery. So like having some pe pluses and other arenas I think are better. I mean that's one of the things what relationships are good for is literally providing perspective. Like we always say that, you know, my friend gave me a good perspective, but it's like there's somebody literally outside you looking at you aware of what your blind spots are aware of the things you're doing wrong, but we just can't see. And that's one of the intimacy is immensely useful is it's like you can be on perfection and just tell often, but wilderness and be gone if you don't have other people looking at you and keeping you human, you know. And so it's.

Speaker 2:          00:12:08       Right. Right. Well that's actually one of the arguments that I've been making up here as you know, for the necessity of freedom of speech is that it isn't so much that you get to say what you think and be right. It's that you get to say what you think and be exposed to the corrective views of other people and they have the same responsibility and right with regards to their own speech, they have to say what they think, but they have to be open to corrective input from other people.

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       Well, and, and it's, it's impossible. Like if we want to evolve into a society where if you misspeak, like for instance, there was a Saturday night live writer who made it a tweet that was denigrating Barron trump, right? And she ultimately regretted it, right? And so she apologized. Doesn't matter, sign out, live kind of a suspended, are either suspended her or let her go, suspended her indefinitely and so there's this interesting question of like if you're a comedian and your job is to be funny, being funny revolves on being a reverend and on being surprised and you're the court jester in a certain way. You have to go too far sometimes in order to do your job properly and maybe that's three times out of 10. So she said something that she believed that she went too far and she apologized for us and we've gotten into this place that people don't accept apologies anymore

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       worse. Actually, I think it looks to me like we've got to a place where if you, if you make an apology, people regard that as a final proof of your guilt.

Speaker 3:          00:13:44       Right? Which it. Yeah. And then it encourages a lack of insight and apology from people who are increasingly rise in power. But the thing for me that so interesting is it's like when I write, I give myself permission to write a vomit draft of a book. I talked to so many aspiring writers who say, I sit down and I just walk up, I write a paragraph and then I don't know what to do. I've conversation after conversation with people and I say, don't be afraid to make mistakes and fail. You cannot fix a blank page. Get something down. I call it the vomit draft and then you can fix it. And if we're losing that ability in speech like everyone has to speak like Winston Churchill upon first pass everyone else a perfectly constructed sentences perfectly regarding thought. We're going to lose our ability to interact in ways that are meaningful to stop and pause and say, you're right that, that did go too far. Let me back off. Yeah. Students,

Speaker 2:          00:14:37       my graduate students and my undergraduates as well to write a really bad first draft. And I also tell them, you can't play around with that. Like you can't pretend that you're going to write a really bad first draft and then uh, and then you know, break the rules of that game and rights and tried to write something good anyways because that doesn't work. It doesn't free you up and you know, I tell them that at the same time if they're trying to write a 2000 word essay to write a really bad 3000 word essay or 4,000 word essay so that they can feel comfortable throwing away 50 percent of it and

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       amazing how you get to good through that. Like a lot of times I sit down, uh, you know, and if you're not feeling it, and if I just start writing at a certain point, it's sort of like if you set. I always tell young, younger writers set time that you make sap percent. You know that as above all else that you have to. Right? So even if it's an hour twice a week, at a certain point, you're going to hit the hour mark and realize that you're at an hour and a half years at an hour and 45 minutes. It leads to more. And so if you're willing to write into mistakes and errors and not be overly concerned with, you know, if everything is an impeccable he detailed, you will get to stuff that's better. At a certain point you'll start doing real writing. The language will start to actually be alive as opposed to dad. It's a way to, to access it. It's like a warm up jogging, a warm up clamp on a track before you sprint and we need to be able to have that, you know, and it's,

Speaker 2:          00:16:09       you have to push yourself out to the place where you're actually making errors. You were talking about comedians and it seems to me that that's, if you're exploring a set of new ideas, instead of just writing down what you already know, which would sort of be like imitating yourself or parodying yourself, you have to push yourself past what you already know. And if you're not doing that, if you're doing that, you're going to make mistakes. And if you're not doing that, then you're not going to be doing something that's creative and interesting. And so there is some kind of,

Speaker 3:          00:16:40       excuse me, but there is some kind of optimal ratio of error to creative thought. I remember that there was a good study done about relationships, um,

Speaker 2:          00:16:53       and their longevity. And one question might be, how many positive interactions compared to negative interactions do you have to have an order for a relationship to maintain itself stably across time and you'd think, well, the higher the positive to the negative, the better. But that isn't how it turned out. It turned out that five positive to one negative interactions, roughly speaking was the lower bound. If it got, if the negative, if the ratio God lower than that, then people got unhappy in the relationship degenerated, but if it got above 11 positive interactions to one negative interaction, it also became unstable. And I think the reason for that is that there is no corrective information. Yeah, that's a tough one for people to grasp because they often don't get to contentment, but is it content that exactly? Or is it spaces or. Or it's also there's something horrific about only seeing the positive reflected back to you. It's

Speaker 4:          00:18:00       take things for granted. I always, I always say about blocks. It's like when I'm writing any project, if there's not a certain point that I'm scared that I can't pull it off.

Speaker 5:          00:18:10       I haven't chosen the right project. I mean, and I'm, I don't know, 18 novels in, I mean I've written 10 scripts, I've written 80. Um, and part of that is how to change things up and this whole notion that we're talking about with, with this character, with them and smoke started with that. I was like, I was thinking about writing this ultra bad ass assassin character. It's a thriller or deals with other themes, some of which we can get into. But part of what I thought about was, you know, we never see. We never see James Bond go home. We never see Jason Bourne and a bad ass mission. He's bleeding in his arm and he gets in an elevator with a single mom who is an elderly woman who's a neighbor in the nagging him to go to his homeowner's association meeting because you haven't done it yet.

Speaker 5:          00:18:55       So it's like, if I can create a character who represent these archetypical ideals, but crossing in the world with me and you, no one's done that. And the whole time I was writing that, I was thinking, is this going to just fail miserably? Is this not going to interest people and my birth because we're using, you know, anyone who's writing genre, we're using a previous mole, which I don't, I don't mean in a way that's denigrating. I mean, that's what, that's what Shakespeare, Dan, you know, some of the, the destructuring containment and traditions of reform form can be enormously useful. But I'm always trying to tap it and break it at the edges. I did that a lot when I was writing Batman.

Speaker 2:          00:19:32       So. So let's talk about the comics and bit. You wrote Batman for hold on

Speaker 5:          00:19:37       two, two years. I started writing six months of the pain boy, um, and I had this really funny thing. I was writing for marvel or Wolverine and punish her or her, two of my favorite characters and dc came along and told me I could do sort of whatever I wanted and you know, pick a character. And I said, what I really want to do is write a graphic novel of the pain Goin. And he sort of looked at me with alarm because of all the choices that I had. That was totally bizarre. But one of my big inspirations and comics is the killing Joe by Alan more. That's the the essential origin story of the joker. And I thought the pain one had always been kind of a joke. And furthermore I thought how interesting, because if you're the penguin then Batman is the enemy at that man is a bully. Right? And so I wanted to do this alternate thing and so he was like, you know, the Polisher dc let me do it. But I still remember there was an online poll that said that they listed 10 upcoming comics, mind among it and asked how much readers work. We're anticipating them. And I got point, oh, three percent of the vote. And I still remember one of my favorite denigrating comments of all time is one guy just wrote, I'm so glad her, his mom voted for him,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       which was great. And so he came out to like the interest of no one. But what happened is, is that the critics really spoke to us and then readers really sparked to it and people all of a sudden said, we've never looked at the pain when this way. And it was this very interesting object lesson that like, had I gone for the obvious and said, let me write Batman right away, or let me write superman right away. I chose something that was super bizarre that I had to write. And then I knew that I really wanted to write and could do well and from the most unlikely position it led to me having, it sort of led to a whole other phase in my career, you know? And then I found myself, you know, all of a sudden I'm working on Batman for two years with the best artists in the world. But

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       he took a, he took a lowly approach and an approach to something that people actually phoned contemptible

Speaker 3:          00:21:36       Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       And, and, and through that you got what you want. So what in the world wasn't about the penguin and the story that you wrote, the why in the world. Did the Penguin grip you like that? Do you have any idea, and tell us again, tell us what you made of it as well.

Speaker 3:          00:21:51       Well, I, I had a strong affinity, like I said, for the killing joke and I always thought the pain one was so interesting because of all of Batman's rivals. He's the only one who's saying that right of the hole, you know, of all of the nemeses. And the other thing that just really struck me was this whole way to view Batman through completely different prism. I mean like you can look at the joker who's insane and then you look at Batman, but, but that means semi insane too, like there's craziness and it's such an interesting prism. So with the pain one I wrote about his upbringing and you know, he's this unappealing overweight kid. His brothers were, you know, athletic and robust. He was always bullied growing up. And it's like, well guess what Batman is. That means like this paragon of a physical specimen.

Speaker 3:          00:22:39       So he's always appearing in the background. But I was like, if I can get people to empathize with the penguin and view Batman is a villain or not as a villain necessarily, but just to really, if we can really relate to the penguin and what his position is in that universe. Um, I just thought that would be cool. But also a lot of it was. And Alyssa lot what happens is like, I don't have a conscious thought about it. I was literally driving to the meeting with the publisher dc and I just was thinking, I know the story, I know how to write it. I know how I want to sort of directed on the page. I know what I want to say with that. And it's only in hindsight I can look back and untangle it and realize that, you know, oh, well, part of what I was interested in were, were, was the aspect that it's, that he's actually saying and there's a bullying way. And it's a way to look at that man through a new.

Speaker 2:          00:23:29       Yeah. Well, there's a, there's an interesting idea lurking in there as well, which is, if you think of Batman as an, as an ideal, now he's kind of a one dimensional ideal. An ideal is also a judge because it's something that you can't attain exactly or, or that if you look at it, um, makes you acutely aware of your, of your lack, and so on the one hand that ideal is something that is positive and we're striving for, but on the other hand it's necessarily something that's got this. It's not exactly a bullying element, but it's something similar to that because you're insufficient in its presence, might say as well, to the degree that the ideal is one dimensional. The fact that you're insufficient in its presence is actually a bit. It's a bit unjust or unfair because there may be other dimensions of comparison along which you're, you're doing fun.

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       It's actually a claim that's quite similar to the postmodernist idea. You know that if you erect a hierarchy of values, then by necessity you exclude people from that hierarchy and that that is in some sense it's oppressive and it's wrong. Of course they issue, they don't address is that if there's no hierarchy of values, there's nowhere to go and there's nothing to do, but there is a point there that if you're the exemplar of something you make everyone else feel insufficient in your presence and you could also imagine it would be easy for that to take on a bullying aspect.

Speaker 4:          00:25:03       I still focused a lot on the villains and their perspective, so I did it with David Finch on Pearl Harbor Event and for the new 52 and then I did one with the mad hatter with with Eaton Vance, skype or some of these amazing artists. But one of the things that I put

Speaker 3:          00:25:21       in one of the comics is one of the thugs who batman comes along and says like, you don't remember when you do you have that meant says no, and you guys, you came flying through the window and you know the typical Batman scene and kick me with your, you know, your, your boots leaned on my jaw. Here's what that surgery was. Here's what I'm living with. And he goes down this very detail because so often it's Batman swings through window and smashes a bad guy and we all move on and I took these pauses sometimes to kind of look at things from a different angle and it was horrific and fractured his skull and his, you know, his sinus was out and it was this horrific injury that took, you know, 15 screws and I sort of detail of the whole thing as he throws it back to Batman to be like, you know, I'm, I'm kind of cannon fodder and your mission, maybe what I was doing is wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       Here's the level of pain that you've inflicted on me nonetheless. And it was this interesting pause and I'd say the things that. There's always a tightrope act when you're writing a comic book character because they're sort of in a public trust. You know, I don't own them. DC doesn't fully own them though. They owned them legally. But like the stuff that you know, that you can't do, you can't have Batman and kill a bus load of nuns. I mean there's the obvious. But part of what they hire me is it's like I need to bring something new to this character, but also I need to honor the traditions that have come before. So it's like I've been entrusted with this thing where I have to play with it and I have to navigate that tight rope very, very meticulously to do something that makes it worth them bringing me on to give readers something new and to make myself feel like I've put my own stamp on the character but not stray too far.

Speaker 3:          00:27:01       So it's a real exercise in being this sort of, you know, holding the flame of this tradition. One of the ways I did that a lot too, that, that did was I would make fun of the tradition itself. I got slightly mete with it, for instance. So it gives you. One example is I did a scene where Jim Gordon, the police commissioner is talking, you know, it's late at night. Batman appears in his office. They're having a conversation, it's darkly lit. And Jim starts to muse on something and he walks, you know. So the frame is just with him and he's looking out the window and he talks for two panels. Then he says, oh, this is the part where I turned around and you're no longer there, right? And there's a blank, and then Batman says, nope. And then they turned around and regard each other very awkwardly for a panel and then they go, all right then. And then they will walk away awkwardly. So it's like it. It's knowing that we all live in a world of Batman comics and maybe Batman himself even does also. And some of those little nuances are, or a way to kind of massage, massage it into something in, in a culture that's increasingly pop cultural where.

Speaker 2:          00:28:03       So, so I was thinking about this perfection issue again and the issue of monstrousness. So I read this, I think it was a billion wicked thoughts, which is a very interesting book of the Google engineers were looking at google searches and trying to do psychology as a consequence. And because they're engineers, they're, they'll think anything they want to think and they don't care much about how politically correct it is. For example. And one of the things they noted was that they were looking at pornography use and it's no surprise to anyone, of course the men use images for pornography fundamentally, and everyone knows what the images are like. It's, it's, it's usually young women who are symmetrical and so forth and, and youthful from associate biological perspective because that's associated with a fruitfulness and fecundity and that sort of thing. And, and, and

Speaker 3:          00:28:58       that's actually my favorite website is young women who were symmetrical not call the advertisement has to be slightly different, but nonetheless point is taken. Yes, exactly, exactly.

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       They also looked at female pornography use and that surprisingly enough, and it was almost all literary it was written and it was stories and they pointed out. But the basic story, and this is something that I found extremely useful because in some ways I'm, I've always been looking for the fundamental female myth, um,

Speaker 2:          00:29:32       because it's not exactly the same as the hero archetype, which is perhaps the fundamental male myth. But anyways, the female myth was essentially beauty and the. So the guy was basically obviously, and she would, she would entice him into a relationship that would tame him in some sense and he would become humanized but under her tutelage and devote himself to her and they named the five most common beasts in this kind of literature be soft corporate Augie or maybe even hardcore pornographic literature. I know that even a Harlequin, the big purveyor of romance novels has a pretty hardcore side imprint. Anyways. The five most popular beasts were surgeon, billionaire, pirate vampire, and we're wolf, which is, you know, really quite comical as far as I'm concerned. But it made me think, well you were talking about perfection, that there is a kind of monstrousness imperfection as well.

Speaker 2:          00:30:40       And so, you know, again, women, they, the research evidence seems to suggest that women made across and up dominance hierarchies where men mate across and down socio economic dominance hierarchies. And so the women are in some sense attracted to guys who are unit dimensionally monstrous enough to climb to the top of a given dominance hierarchy. But then, and so that begs the question, which is that in that drive for perfection, if there isn't something intrinsically monstrous and that has something to do with the willingness to sacrifice everything else to that single minded pursuit. So I wonder if those things are even if you can even take them apart because Batman who's obviously a creature of the night, I, I would say he's probably the superhero that has the most self evident integration of pathology associated with his character, something like that because he's this dark guy and he definitely operates outside of the parameters of the law quite clearly and is motivated to know small and by vengeance I would say like the end, the borderline between vengeance and justice is of course very murky. So then you talked about the, the, the requirement or the utility of intimacy in buffering against that perfection. But that makes you wonder too if it also provides a necessary buffer against monster business.

Speaker 4:          00:32:13       Well that's to the hard part than turning into a killer and the hard part of keeping you human

Speaker 5:          00:32:22       and that that's the law that he deals with. But I can say, you know, with, with orphan x, I mean this is a book that connected with readers. It's been translated and published in 20 languages. The vast majority of emails that I get or about his relationship trying to navigate way through the normal world.

Speaker 3:          00:32:41       That's the stuff that people love with it. So there's the mission, there's the spy stuff. I'd say there's two parts. One of them is that he is a trained assassin who now is become a pro. Bono was asset. His moral compass was never broken because of his upbringing with Jack. He now helps only the truly desperate orals to turn evil capitalist. Exactly. Well he has. He has money stash and bank accounts everywhere for when he was operating off the books. So there, there's a, there's a good capitalist string still going on. But the other thing is these interactions, like you know, there's a single mother who's been widowed with a young boy who lives downstairs from him, who he is, who he is in amherst have but has no idea. He doesn't speak the language of intimacy. So there's this like distant flirtatious relationship with her.

Speaker 3:          00:33:30       The boys very enamored of Evan, he doesn't quite know what to do with her to complicate matters further. She's a district attorney, so she actually knew anything about him that's legitimate and she'd have to prosecute him and those, those moments of him trying to figure out, I'm, I'm carrying out this mission that requires comprehensive discipline and focus and yet here's this draw to this woman and her kid and they'll kind of warmth of a house that's, that's an immense draw for him and I think at the heart of him, there's this conflict where like I always, I view it. Then he's kind of got his face up to the glass and he's looking at it. All of these people leading ordinary lives that he himself could never leave. Like he can never live those lives. But so what he can do is to protect people when those ordinary lives are disrupted and when they're put upon by horrible men.

Speaker 3:          00:34:20       Right? Are horrible. Unfixable solutions. The cops can't help you. Nobody can help you and you're powerless. You've been bullied nearly into oblivion and there's a huge risk to yourself. They can call him and he can fix it so we can constantly reestablished and protect the lives of other people, but he can't ever have that and so that for me is what's really interesting and that takes a twist in the knower man, as we discussed, which deals more with kind of different thematics since he's the one who's captured about aging versus you know, about trying to be everything versus trying to be one thing. Yeah. You played that out differently in the nowhere man was different. Yeah. That's it. That's a slightly different theme, right? That's, there's a peter pan theme there. Yeah, go ahead. No, no, go ahead. Well, so I mean, so again, in the nowhere, man, I mean for the second book, it's always tricky to follow up a book that, that, that, that connects with the readership in a certain way, but I really wanted to turn reader expectations on their head.

Speaker 3:          00:35:19       So I thought, well, what if instead of of avid going and doing another mission that we're used to, he gets the anonymous phone call and goes and help someone. What if he finds himself in exactly the kind of predicament that other people usually call him before, so the no, Amanda opens with him and finishing out the end of an operation somehow manages to get kidnapped, as I mentioned. He comes to in this distant chateau where he's being overseen by a guy called Renee Peter casserole and we're not quite sure why he's there. They don't know who he is. Yes, things are going to get really bad. There's dozens of armed guards, but ever now is the one who he would normally call and has to free himself, so it's about his own liberation to get back to finishing the mission that he wants to do and to protect other people were at the chateau.

Speaker 3:          00:36:05       But what was interesting to me is that conversation that we seem to always have in in thrillers and mysteries and comments. You're just like me, I'm. Renee has a similar thing to have and it says like me, you don't have any rules. He knows he's a vigilante, doesn't quite know what he does, but he thinks he's might be a drug dealer or you know, an arms dealer. He's, he's ambiguous, he's really just after a particular bank account that evidence attached to it hasn't yet learned to realize and Evelyn says, no, you want to be everything. I want to be one thing. Well, and it occurred to me when I was doing that. So Peter, Renee, I'm sorry. Renee. Peter Cassar. Roy casserole is a play on the French word for Pan, so it's sort of read a Peter Pan. He's, he's, he's obsessed with luxury, with being all things with, with not making choices, with turning back the clock on aging. He takes a regimen of pills he's obsessed with, with the aging process. And it occurred to me again after I wrote it, because I don't go in charting these things out like an engineer. I go in writing a story that I want to write, but it occurred to me that Evan statement to say were as different as can be. You want to be everything. I want to be one thing. Well that being one thing, well is our only antidote really to aging. So it's the exact opposite of what renee is trying to do. Who's

Speaker 2:          00:37:26       the antidote to remaining that? That it's the antidote to to becoming an old child to which is of course it depends story, right? There's this idea that you have to give up everything to become one thing and it, but if you don't give it up, then you become no thing eventually because aging drives. Maybe that's also why your character casserole, right? Has to find off aging because aging is forcing him to become well at, if not to become one thing, at least to lose his capacity to become anything or everything.

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       Exactly, and that's the only thing that, that that's your board. I mean that's the other argument to perfection versus intimacy. At some person, at some point, the toll of aging takes perfection away from us in every way. If you're a sharp shooter, if you're an athlete, if you're young Paul Newman and look like young Paul Newman, who is probably the best working human humanum, either gender in history at some point, no matter what, you are a perfect app, you're a great surgeon. Perfection will be taken from you. So well, what's the antidote to that? They ended up to that doing something, doing something else. Well at making choices. Are you a good husband? Are you a good father? Do you have a good. Yeah. Well that community around you and your friendships around you so that when an agent comes and starts to kick out those stilts, you have enough under you that you're just topple over.

Speaker 2:          00:38:51       Yeah. Right. Well, so that's interesting because the. You talked about the necessity for, for uh, for perfection as an antidote say to the Peter Pan Problem, but what the case you're making now is more of that even perfection as an antidote to the Peter Pan Syndrome has its problems, but maybe those aren't echoed with intimacy and you know, because you talked about getting older and the fact that your family and friends become more important to you, which is definitely something that I've noticed.

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       Um, and

Speaker 2:          00:39:30       I guess on your death bed, let's say,

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:39:34       one of the things that's going to matter is who's around there with you?

Speaker 4:          00:39:38       Right?

Speaker 2:          00:39:39       And I. and as you get older and you get robbed if things. I wonder if it's the intimate relationships that you have to provide solace with regards to that. I mean, one of the things that distresses me about the way that our world, the modern Western world is unfolding is that we act as if we're never going to be any older than 35 young talked about. Carl Jung talked about that he thought it was a flaw in our founding myth because if you think about Western culture is predicated on Christianity. Of course Christ died when he was about 32. That's the. That's the theory and so there's not necessarily any model there for moving into the latter house of life and there is this obsession in western culture with youthfulness and with the possibilities of youth and people. People Act, I would say is if they're never going to get old, and so they. One of the dangers there is that you don't establish the kind of relationships that are going to buttress you in your old age. You ended up finding a sample in your forties or whatever and it starts to get pretty ugly. It loans

Speaker 4:          00:40:46       in La because La is the land of the perpetual adolescence,

Speaker 3:          00:40:52       right? Everyone comes out here off their proverbial bus from Des Moines or northern Alberta and they want to make it. They're the best looking person from their hometown and who started their hometown play and you know, it's squeezing the universe through a funnel for people. We're actually going to be a movie star, actually going to make it as a singer, but it's sorta this intermittent reinforcement thing that happens is it's like they'll go two or three years working on jobs because they need to keep their schedule open for auditions and then they'll get cast as an extra in one thing and then they go three or four more years because, you know, because at any point you could hit the lottery and everyone has the story of the, you know, the guy who was a, you know, know our, our culture is also built around never give up, right.

Speaker 3:          00:41:38       You know, follow your dreams. And there's, there's, there's, there's a pervasive notion that you never settle. Um, and, and I'm not denigrating those things. I'm saying that that's part of our culture is built, but you see a ton of people here in their forties, fifties who never sort of moved onto a job or a scaled. It's gratifying there. Their whole life has been spent waiting for another break and it's heartbreaking because, you know, they had where they had some success for a period of never recaptured it and didn't reinvent themselves. I noticed something really interesting when I went to Australia for book tour and I'm going back there, uh, and a couple of weeks, which was amazing, which is I did a lot of events with really famous Australians who didn't cross over to the US. So like you have your ACDC that came over here and just blew out bird, you know, Nicole mean fill in the blank.

Speaker 3:          00:42:30       But there was people who were like big movie stars who didn't make it here. I'm a big, like an enormous rock band there that just didn't make it to the US. And the one thing that I was amazed with is for some reason I came into contact with them either for festivals or you know, we we had reading together is they all had meaningful second slash third acts. So this guy who was a big huge movie star there was now a big crime fiction reviewer, so I met him because you just don't make the sort of money and fame here and have the kind of blown out at exposure that you linger in and capture catch. After the guy who was a songwriter for one of the biggest rock bands in all of us wrote it, wrote this amazing memoir, was like incredible and was working on that. And it's sorta like if you don't achieve a sort of astronomical level of exposure, fame and money, you still have to make a living. And making a living is a really good motivation to, to continue to search for and find meaning.

Speaker 2:          00:43:32       Great. Yeah. Well that's why. Yeah, that's one of the problems with having wealth I think with regards to children is that if you're wealthy you're children can be deprived of necessity.

Speaker 3:          00:43:43       Right. And they and also usually by the time one his attained wealth. You've sort of baked in the discipline of your end, the love for your field that led to us. I mean I guess we can exclude people that do a job that they hate forever, but usually people who really make a lot of money sort of love what they're doing at some level I find. And by the time you get to a point, do you know what her after work, you love the work so much and you start to realize that the money once people stopped chasing you for bills is what brings you the happiness. Because you couldn't take all the shortcuts when you were younger. Like trust fund kids can.

Speaker 2:          00:44:24       Yeah. Well the, the empirical evidence on that is pretty clear. Just give me one sec here. There is a relationship between material wellbeing and happiness, roughly speaking or let's say wealth and happiness up to the point where you're basically in the lower middle class I would say. And that's basically the point where bill collectors stopped chasing you around. There's definitely pain in privation, but there isn't a tremendous amount of advantage by, by, by the evidence in moving far up the economic ladder beyond that, and I think it's because money solves a certain set of, yeah problems, but the ones that doesn't solve it doesn't solve it all right? She doesn't solve love that it doesn't solve. Ensuring that your children are doing well. It doesn't solve health. Um, in any final sense that the problem with the oral health, I was also thinking with regards to perfection and intimacy, there's another kind of opposition between them, which is that if you're after perfection, you can't have intimacy because you have to. You mentioned that we have this idea that you shouldn't settle and people often say that in relationship to their relationships, but they forget that the person that you're having a relationship with has settled for you.

Speaker 6:          00:45:56       And, and

Speaker 2:          00:45:58       that means that they've settled for imperfection in every sense of the word.

Speaker 6:          00:46:02       And you,

Speaker 2:          00:46:05       if you're after perfection in your relationship, then first of all, you have impossible standards. Second year, impossible to live with. And third, if you meet someone that triggers that ideal, then you're going to feel so inferior in relationship to them that you're going to make a fool of yourself. Now it's the classical animal, randomness possession from the union perspective, you know, you find someone who meets your ideal of perfection and then you're so tongue tied in their presence that you can't help but act like a complete deer in the headlights or something equally pathological. So to get into the scene you have to give up that you have to give up that demand, at least for immediate perfection May. Maybe you could work towards it within the confines of the relationship. But that's a whole different thing.

Speaker 4:          00:46:50       Well driller perspective, I mean for me, what was so interesting in building that with Evan is

Speaker 3:          00:46:57       it's like he's trained as a lone wolf, right? There's an orphan program that kicked out orphans, but none of them know who each other is. They operate alone, but he's chosen to live in the middle of this residential tower in the world corridor. Kind of hiding among people. But so he's constantly among people. But if he sticks to his normal routine, which is just training, he's got like a hidden vault that's like as operations comm center that's hidden in the back of his super modern penthouse. There's all these sort of fantasy elements to it, which I think I undercut enough to not turn it into like sort of, you know, weapons foreign or spy car. Like he, like there's, there's, there's an awareness that, that, that I, I roamed it, Debbie, even as I revel in some of these archetypes, but if he just sticks to his routine, there is no one there to tell him or point out his imperfections.

Speaker 3:          00:47:46       Right? When he's on a mission, it doesn't matter. He's operating Solo. He's kicking ass. He has the righteousness and the moral, the legitimate moral superiority of doing what is the right thing in the protection of other people. That's all fine. There's no one to literally gaze on Hammer. Even look at him and notice where his imperfections are. Notice where his tongue tied. Notice what skills that there are that he's lacking. If his life stays in that narrow lane, but he doesn't want his life to just be in that lane, but every time he widens it out, there's all these complications where it's like, what do you do with an unruly eight year old who's asking you inappropriate questions? These are things that his training wasn't for. And there's a real interest in that. And one of the other things I wanted to add as you talked about the, the female or erotica or the or the that women tend to read and the types of monsters which I love that the surgeon is included.

Speaker 3:          00:48:39       And um, and you know, I'm sure a lot of them can. We can start combining them. So you get like a werewolf surgeon. You can really start upping the ante. But I think one of the things that's really interesting in terms of what constitutes a successful balance to me, it's not also the full teaming of the monstrous of perfectionism. Whether like in this instance we're talking about that being from the male side of it. It's also like I had a question that was I did an interview yesterday and somebody asked me who knows, who knows me and my wife pretty well, and so does your wife get, does she get upset when you're like, okay honey, I'm off to like the Mexican jungles to go down class for a Whitewater rafts to the researcher. I'm going to go, you know, like I just was on a range in vegas shooting a lot of insane weapon where you're, you know, when, when I'm, when I'm doing these sort of more dangerous elements that are for research.

Speaker 3:          00:49:31       And it was interesting because I hadn't been asked that that specifically, but I was like, well I would as a writer when I met my wife and she liked that, a new that and one of the primary themes is if that's something that you liked in me, she, that's the last thing. She wants to erode it me now. And we also have a relationship where like obviously there's things like if there are things about me that are annoying to my perfectionism or need to be reined in, that's a good discussion. But it also doesn't mean that you want to hollow out the aspect of the, of the perfectionist drive or the aspects that involve sort of dangerous with danger, having one foot and monstrosity from your spouse or partner in either direction. It's like, you know, my wife and I just genuinely like each other. We don't want to erode in each other. Those things that caused the initial attraction. And it's interesting. [inaudible], I think that's something you see a lot in marriages. I don't know if it's particularly in America where you get the sort of domineering controlling wife and the husband is like the little boy getting away with things and you know, trying to get things done and there's this imbalance that happens really quickly as they push each other into these roles and forget the very things that more attractive to begin with.

Speaker 2:          00:50:42       Yeah. Well you see that, you see that operating in the other direction. Although I would say in a different way, because you can see husbands who punish or failed to reward their wives for being attractive. Even though,

Speaker 3:          00:50:53       yeah, the domineering husband. Your, you said something once that stuck with me when I think someone was bragging about how they never cleaned the house or something or some such thing. You said, well, if you turn your wife into a maid, then you'll be married to a maid.

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       Yes. Yes. I think it was toilets. Actually. I'm not the sort of guy who cleans the toilets. I think I said, yeah, you're the sort of guy who makes your wife cleaned the toilets, right? Yeah. Well that's the thing is that it's also very difficult within a relationship to continually reward your partner for the traits that make them attractive because that also makes them attractive to other people and so if you're concerned in any way about your fading attractiveness or if you're jealous or resentful, then you may come to punish your partner for what makes them attractive and of course that's. That's daft because you'll also have contempt for them and for you if, if you get away with that, but it happens a lot.

Speaker 3:          00:51:49       Yeah. Well, you know, it goes down to the. We've had. We've had this conversation before that at the end of the day, there are any, there are no decisions that aren't fundamentally moral. There's no good decisions when you're looking at something of like, well, this is 90 percent moral, but 10 percent shady, but I can reap huge financial reward. It's like, don't think you'll get away with it. And likewise, you know, within a marriage, you know, if you have a spouse who you're denigrating or you're concerned about their attractiveness because of your own insecurity and you haven't put that to rest and you're unwilling to look at that, that will cost you. You know, I think about it a lot as pertains to writing because I think a lot that the qualities for me at least that didn't make me a better writer or the same ones that make me a better man and a better human.

Speaker 3:          00:52:40       And it's not something that people talk a lot about, but a lot of it is, you know, if you're. If I'm in a conversation, it's like, can I acknowledge what my shortcomings are and what my flaws are? Can I acknowledge and an argument what's going on? Can I pay attention to people enough to recognize small moments of vulnerabilities and to try to honor or respect those? Those are all the things in writing that it make people connect to character. Those are all the things in writing that you need to round out a character. And I remember when I was like, I started really young and had a lot of luck early. I started my first book. I was 19. I sold it out. I think it was 22, 23 and you know, there's stuff in there that's awful, like no one should ever be accountable for anything that they thought when they were 19.

Speaker 3:          00:53:21       But you know, I have a line in there where it's like he was the best of the best, you know, about like an agent and it's like those are the people we don't like. You just feel like as I get older, a lot of. I put the characters are the times where you say something out of a, a more base instinct and then you feel like shit about it. Like that's something that makes you relate to a character. Like I did this thing and I said something, I reacted in anger. I have a petty jealousy, but that I'm aware of it. I acted badly and I feel I feel badly for it. I wish I could've acted better. But do you need to have the, the, you know, the uh, pretty you need to iris pretty wide opening to, to take that input in if you want to be talented artists

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       because you're trying to capture all of those things which means you have to look at them in yourself, not just another people. It's something you see in good comedians. And I was watching Louis C K recently, like he definitely goes too far quite often. And one of the things about Louis C, k that's, and you also see this as Sarah Silverman. I think we're either of them know something will come into their hand and they'll say it and they know perfectly well that they've gone too far but they're not going to not say it. And then they have the good graces to be like self disgusted. I would say that they actually said it, you know, and Louis said it's a mix of self disgust and enterprise. Yeah, exactly. At the same time, but I need Louis Ck has the good graces to be embarrassed at least 20 percent of the time for me and for good reason to like the cinema in the airport. Yeah, no, he's. Yeah, but I mean that it's a big part of it is like if you want to shut down self awareness, everything shuts down. So.

Speaker 3:          00:55:09       And we're talking about with aging, we're talking about with marriage and relationships, but I'm also talking about if you wanted, if you actually want to engage in an endeavor that is interesting, whether that's writing or teaching or being a psychologist or being. I mean fill in the blank for anything that you want to engage in, in a way that's new and unique. You better reflect, you better think on yourself. You better not armor yourself solely an ideology, right? You better be able to maintain it. It sort of openness to the world. Even as you're learning, you better not get too arrogant. Like if you go down that checklist, I find a lot of them really apply to my writing and ways that, that are, that are more direct than I ever would have thought would be the case. I didn't start kind of thinking about this till I was in my thirties, which is also rather on the time that I started becoming a better human, um, uh, but you know, to really think about like getting caught short at times or engaging in something where I'm so adamant that I'm right about it.

Speaker 3:          00:56:06       And then reflecting on it afterwards and realizing that I'm wrong. And it's like there's so much fodder. That's where all the gold is in writing. That's where all those pieces are and really paying attention to people and not overlooking their own quiet everyday tragedies and recognizing their everyday triumphs because that's what rounds out of character. If you can capture that, all of a sudden you feel like you're reading something that's alive and if you don't, you're reading something that you feel like is fill in the blanks. You know? And especially with with a forum like, like a thriller, Crime Fiction, which I'm far from denigrating. I think it's an incredible forum.

Speaker 2:          00:56:45       I think that's interesting too. Is that you, that's a form that you've stuck with in many ways throughout your writing career. And that's been about 20, 20. You have 23 books now.

Speaker 3:          00:56:57       I have a seven, 17 or 18 out maybe. And three more than the pyre lot.

Speaker 2:          00:57:03       Okay. So you've been basically putting out something like a book a year. Yeah. So there's, there's two places we could go with that. One is that I'd like to talk with you a little bit about how you've actually managed to have a successful career as a writer because that's a very difficult thing to pull off. And the other issue is why you've, you've inserted yourself in this very limited form, John Reform and I'm curious about why that one and also what it is about the genre and the fact that it's a very, very commercial and very attractive in a sort of, I wouldn't say easy way, but in a very accessible way. It, it's very accessible to people. And so what's, what's the attraction, like why not? It's something that's arguably more literary.

Speaker 3:          00:57:54       Well I don't, I mean the first thing is, is it's like it's not selected. Like I can only write stuff that I feel in my gut that I need to write. And fortunately for me from a financial perspective that tends to be stuff that that's highly commercial. But you know, one of the things I think about, like for me, the, the, the gold standard is always hitchcock. Like no one's like, oh see commercial or was he a critical six ass? And what's interesting is, you know, you talked, we talked about all this stuff that we only see in hindsight, like you follow only the things that are of interest and then in hindsight they all make sense. So. Right? So in college I studied English and psychology as you know, you were there and I got really fascinated with shakespearian tragedy in particular and it's like, okay, so I'm studying young Ian, analysis of Shakespearian tragedy.

Speaker 3:          00:58:41       All that is about narrative. All of it is narrative. I only chose it because I was interested. I got, I was very into Freud, you know, those case studies. We'd like short stories, but. So it's like, let's take Shakespeare. Okay, so why would shakespeare choose this form? That is limited, right? Everything's got five back. He basically wrote a highly convention bound, highly structured narrative driven form, sometimes tipping into propaganda that deals with last intriguing murderer designed to sell out the most, you know, he's the most seats in the globe theater to put asses in chairs. He had no interest in enduring literary value, you know, um, a lot of people are interested in during literary value, don't enduring, we don't tend to. Enduro is another discussion, but when you cut that glue, yeah, I, you cut the globe theater and half and it's a perfect cross section of Elizabeth and society.

Speaker 3:          00:59:35       So I'll have a joke from audit to metamorphosis and then he'll make a dick joke for the groundlings. He's trying to appeal everywhere. And within the, the, the, the, within the constraints of the form, there is a liberation. So he takes the Jew of Malta in terms of the merchant of Venice in very few original plots. Right. And so there's this reworking of trying to do something that's great within a form that's recognizable, but I think it's recognizable because it's pleasingly archetypal and people forget, you know, look, this can movies. The Stranger was, was inspired by James and Keynes. The Postman always rings twice, like these forms are, are, are, you know, you want to talk about existentialism. You, these chandler. Oh yeah. You know, so there's an enormous amount and it's been, it's been said quite often that that door is modern tragedy, but instead of falling from the throne, you're falling from the curb into the gutter, right?

Speaker 3:          01:00:35       You're just starting lower. It's also been said the crime fiction has replaced the social novel. And if you look at, um, you know, you look at like Mr wherever from Dennis Lehane, it's like that. That's such an interesting story, right? You know, I wrote a book called town allies takes place in San Francisco that is built around a thriller, but it's all about class in society and ethics in San Francisco. And in a weird way for me, when I'm playing with these notions of intimacy versus perfection, when I'm playing with this notion of a, you know, aging versus focus, um, the themes around humanity about being better, if I can wrap them in what I hope is an enormously entertaining page turning story that's propulsive that people want to read. That's the kind of thing that I most enjoy and engage in that for me, sort of the ultimate win.

Speaker 3:          01:01:28       I'm going to get to write about everything that I want to write about in as exciting and compelling fashion that I can manage within the restraints of my skill. And I don't do that as having a ceiling. You know, I don't think anyone's going to come along and go, you know, look, mcbath pretty lacking on the, on the quality scale, you know, you look at. And so there's always an aim for it. And also I just love thrillers, you know, instead of writing a thriller with more meat on the bones where I'm really stretching and there there's a number of people to do it in the forum. And so I, I'm the only one, um, it's just a great, it's a great focus and you know, again, if you don't focus on something, where do you wind up? And also look, this goes back to narrative to archetypal narrative too, like I believe that there are fundamentally fundamental story structures and that our is selected for as opposable thumbs and islands. You know, and I think

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       you'll find a tribe that's been, you know, in the middle of the Amazon, the ted no exposure. And we'll have eyelids, opposable thumbs, and a hero archetype. This is the archetype. Gilgamesh is a thriller. You know, Beowulf is a kick ass thriller. That's what those things are. And that's the form that just appeals to me. You know, Moses, the exodus is the thriller. Yeah. The Ta, you know, I look, I collect faulkner paperbacks from the fifties and they're insane. Like they have these Harlequin type covers, you know, like another from America's leading purveyor of murder and lust. William Faulkner, I mean, they were packaged as such, but you read sanctuary with the courtroom case and the corn cob. I mean, good God, there's, you know, he's, he's got, he's, he's up to his elbows and in Jordan certain genre conventions as originally went to Hollywood and adapted Chandler novels.

Speaker 5:          01:03:09       Great. Great. Great. You know, so for me it's all about. I mean he already slug away. Yes. Yeah. Well then he also did the big sleep. I want to say I need someone to freight back checked out to make sure I got that one right. But, you know, I'm, yeah, that's true. You know, at the end of the data, like I, I am a structure slot. I think structure is essential structure slumped. Watch me structure slut and fun and that, that'll be my website instead of young women who are symmetrically perfect and represent a particular gummy and ideal. Um, but I, I feel like I like to know where I am within a story. You know, I like to, I'd like to know where the terms are. I can, I like to play with them lies with Batman. We talked about once you have the conventions, you can start to play with them. You can start to find more elbow room within them.

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       Yeah, well that's a nice thing too is that people often think about creative freedom as the freedom for many structural impositions whatsoever. And that's, that's the Peter Pan thing or what did you call your character? Castle. Oh, casserole casserole. Yeah, without obstruction. And without limits, you have freedom. It's like you don't just have chaos.

Speaker 5:          01:04:31       Well, and I have like, you know, having written all these novels and the nowhere, man, there's one novel did something really. I'm sorry, there's one chapter that something really bad happens to Evan and each chapter in the orphan accent in the Norman has a title that's taken from something in the chapter, usually a sort of humorous way that it can be double rent, but it's a phrase from the chapter as a chapter heading. And so one of the chapters after this horrific thing happen to evan is just cold and the whole chapter is just the word cold. That's the whole chapter. So one more chapter and then you move on. So it's, that's not conventional writing. I'm not, you know, there's ways that you can start to play once you're within it, but you know, I don't want to write in a whole, you know, book in Haiku and like the mass experimentation or you know, I wrote a book called a crime writer where I literally, it's a crime writer who lands on something that's in the middle of seemingly one of his own story.

Speaker 5:          01:05:28       He's a disaster situation and he realizes that in order to understand what happened, he has to write it down. So then I introduced a typewriter font. That's the first sentence of the book that we read or the first paragraph of the book. And then at a certain point his editor comes in and has hand written edits in the margins of the typewriter so that we see the development process of the writing, which mirrors the process of his own writing. Which is the story of what happened to him, which has been all of that. We're reading. So there's all these ways that you can play within the form to make an interesting. But at the end of the day, I want to know where I am in a story. That's what always appeals to me.

Speaker 2:          01:06:04       Great. So look, let's, let's, I'd like you to talk a little bit about, about your career from a practical sense too because you've been able to maintain it for a long time. So I think people would be interested to know what your typical, how you learn to write and what your typical day looks like. I don't know what we're passing like across the last 20 years because one of the strange things about being an independent artist is that you don't have those external constraints precisely driving you the same way that you do. If you have to go to work everyday. If you have to be up at nine for someone else and it's very easy for people to drift in a situation like that because you can always put off what you have to do until tomorrow. Or You could also always substitute the long, medium, or longer term ambition for something short term that needs to be done right now. So let's start out by how you learn to write.

Speaker 3:          01:07:07       I never did a writing course or read a book on writing. I mean, how do you learn to write a novel,

Speaker 5:          01:07:13       you know, 2000 novels and then you try and write one and screw it up. That's it. Same with screenplays, you know, watch a million movies. Love the thing itself. My first book, I wrote a disastrous first draft. I mean the, the end of each chapter was better than the beginning, literally from what I've learned while writing the chapter. But again, don't be afraid. I've had two things that have benefited me a lot. One is I'm not afraid to fail, I'm not afraid to embarrass myself. Um, and I also don't have any delay between wanting to try something and trying it. Like I don't hold back and wait and think about it. And I just was like, I want to write a novel. I'm 19. I think I know more than I do. I'm just going to jump in and do it. I wrote it. I had a really shitty first draft, the vomit draft. I sat down and took it apart like an engine block and then I looked at it all and reconstructed as,

Speaker 2:          01:08:06       what do you mean exactly?

Speaker 5:          01:08:08       It's kind of just kind of chapter by chapter and like this plot isn't working and this is two longest stretch without action and this character developed enough. You know, I took the chapters out and it felt like I did it. My first draft was half the length of the final model. Um, it wasn't till my third novel that I wrote a rough draft that could constitute an awful on its own. It's functioned.

Speaker 2:          01:08:31       Yeah. So part of what you were doing was separating the production end of the process from the editing end. I mean, that's what, that's what a bad first draft doses you allow it.

Speaker 5:          01:08:41       Yeah. And I, you know, and then as I get further along, it's like I like my first draft now is what my 10th draft used to be. Right. It keeps it, it keeps sort of evolving, but then know all, try something new like orphan x. I did more rewriting on than any of my previous six books. It still wasn't anywhere close to my first, you know, three dolls, but if I really was doing something new, I was building an entire character and entire mythology and launching this big new franchise into the world. And so in some ways I overrode it and pull stuff back that I save for future books. I mean, so I'd say that's one part of it. The other is I think it might've been advised you gave me when I was shadowing or 18, but you said when it comes to writing and if you didn't say we can just pretend that you did.

Speaker 5:          01:09:30       We'll give you credit for gambling. I'm taking credit that then you leave me. If it's not wise, then they'll be like Wiley, coyote out over the cliff. Just watch. We all know. But you said there's always going to be a dozen things that are more pressing to do then. Right. Always. And if you don't decide to make that time sort of holy and protected, nobody else will do that for you. And that's essential. And I was already kind of into my first book and doing it and I thought that's exactly right. Like it's always more pressing to clean the house or pick up your dry cleaning or you know, pick up one of your kids if you don't just carve it out. It's not like I'm a surgeon, I'm in an office, one of those monster surgeons where I'm in an office and no one can reach me.

Speaker 5:          01:10:17       And my day is sad. I mean at any time right now I could be disturbed all the time by anyone. My phone can ring. So unless I say this is my writing schedule, I'm unplugged, you know, kids leave me alone unless someone is on fire or the house is on fire and it is us. I need the same amount of space that I would have Brian Accountant or a psychologist or you know, a doctor or a lawyer, you know. And so I had to make that time kind of holy are sacrosanct. And then I would say the other thing is that mattered a lot is I realized early on that the one thing I'll say, there's two other pieces that I'll say. The one thing that I could control absolutely was discipline. That's the only controllable thing and it's such an impossible field and so you have to wait for luck.

Speaker 5:          01:11:03       And I had a lot of luck early, which I don't say with false humility or fishing for compliments. Like my first book was good and I think it was sellable and there's a lot of first books that good in sellable. You never know when that luck's going to come. And I thought in sort of work ethics, if I flap my wings as hard as I could that I'm just bumping along the ceiling all the time. The one moment that that hatch opens, that the lucky break comes, I was going to be right there to fly through it. And so from day one I was like, I'm going full speed all the way no matter what. And I still do. I mean, I still feel like the one thing I can control is I've never been late on a deadline, you know, and I write all day every day I built it up like a muscle.

Speaker 5:          01:11:44       So how much time do you spend writing in a date now? At minimum I write from six to 4:30 or five on laundry days. If I'm on deadline or if I'm near the end of a book and I can smell it, it will be 13, 14, 15, sometimes 16 hours. And I've had spells of, like I said, I once wrote a script for a TV show and 1:23 hours sitting because there was a risk that a micro economy in Vancouver would shut down if I did it. If there's a shutdown, the show, it's problematic. So I can go when I go. But at a minimum I'm writing all day every day, you know, with a break to work out in the middle. And the other thing I'd say is really interesting is like, you know, it's funny seeing which values get. So people look at my resume and I went to all these fancy schools and people always ask me like they asked me about Shakespeare, the throughout my educational background.

Speaker 5:          01:12:36       Okay. You studied English and here you went and did a masters in England. I think in some ways one of the biggest values for me was being was came from being an athlete because I was a pole vaulter in college. Right. I played soccer growing up. I played soccer in England and writing is like training. It's like working out. It's building a muscle. And as with pole vaulting when I was training day 27, when the heptathlon will championships were on day 275, I have 100 things more important to do than train on day 27 and know that I have to go that far. That's like a 27 or writing a novel, you know. And so there's a lot of, I think people undervalue the value sports now for health and for, you know, being active and being well rounded, but we don't tend to talk about the values that they instill and a lot of like discipline, longterm planning, you know, like I, when I was in high school I sucked at pole vaulting.

Speaker 5:          01:13:30       I mean my whole first year I was too small to bend the pole. Sophomore year it was awful. And we're talking to is a three year process to build up to start jumping at a high level and eventually, you know, at a national level and then in college. But it takes a lot of discipline. And so there's the discipline aspect of writing I think is really important. And then, you know, for people starting out, one of the things I say is like, pick a certain amount of time that you do no matter what and force yourself to get stuff on the page. And if you say all I could find is an hour day or two hours a day, uh, or I'm sorry, two hours, twice a week. That will soon turn into two hours and 15 minutes or two hours and two and a half hours. It will expand itself as your discipline goes on.

Speaker 5:          01:14:11       It's like running and the other thing I say is that, look, I mean a lot of people who want to be writers and I meet very few who actually want to write. I love writing. I actually loved the writing process. If you don't, don't do this. There's a million other things you can do and make more money and it's easier and you can be happier. And when you say you love it, what do you mean exactly? I mean that doesn't mean it's easy by any stretch of the imagination. What does it mean exactly? What do you mean by that?

Speaker 5:          01:14:46       Well, it's, it's the one place I really clearly lose time. You know, when things are going well, an hour and a half, two hours will pass. That happens to me when I'm on the soccer field. Two is like I just, I feel fully inhabited in something else aside from me in a manner that is productive and I feel like I don't. I'm not one for getting precious about writing with beckoning menus and whatnot, but like there's an ask, there's a part of pleasure. I have these really loud keyboards that I hammer on. I've a whole broken slu or keyboards that I've gone through. I feel like a carpenter, I feel like I'm pounding and hammering and cutting and pasting and I liked the keyboard to be really loud so then it's a muscular action and I just feel utterly engaged and fascinated in what in this world that like I'm in control, but there's endless opportunities and my job is to be open to opportunity while also making sure that I'm kind of steering the ship and there's an enormous amount of responsibility and at the same time I'm living in a world of my own making and holy alone.

Speaker 5:          01:15:49       So first let's hear your keyboard.

Speaker 5:          01:15:56       Yeah, you just like the 19 thirties newsroom or if my friends joke with me about as the. When they're on the phone and if I'm rude enough to be writing or finishing a sentence there would say you sound like the asshole travel agent where they can't move your flight. We're like, okay, so Dallas has shut down. Can I go through Chicago? No, I'm terribly sorry. Can Be an issue. Can we get me? No, I'm sorry. Your flight's been delayed six hours. I mean it's still loud. Old fashioned angry travel agent keyboard. Right, right. It's very funny. So. So your toe. Yeah. So you talked about discipline and you talked about responsibility. When you're writing, like what do you mean by that exactly? Well, your ego is constantly subservient to the plot, so to write, well you come up with a basic set of tenants that start your story. It's like, it's, it's like, it's so complex. It's like, it's like surfing, like there's so many factors. So when people are like, you know, there's, there's sort of like the idiot criticism of certain movies like you know, passenger, 57, you remember where Wesley Snipes is the super bad ass Spec ops guy on the airplane that gets hijacked and some people are like, well what are the odds that you'd be on plane that got hijacked?

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       And you're like, well, it's 100 percent because no one wants to write a story about the other 99,000, 999 times that a plane got hijacked and passenger 57 wasn't on it. Like that's why we're writing this story. So you have a unique set of circumstances that can involve, that can involve coincidence at the outset. That's first act stuff, right? So, okay, this is a story about the one time that an orphan who was taken out of her program at the age of 12 and trained to be an assassin, you know, left the program because his moral compass was broken. And that's his story. It's like whatever you think the odds of that are, that's the narrative contract. That's what I'm doing and I can't introduce them in the third act of a realism based mystery. That's a drawing room, Mr. that takes place in Vermont. So we set the course of that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:58       Right. Okay. So that's the contract with the narrative contract and the contract with the reader. You don't get to break. You say, look, give me leeway while I set this up.

Speaker 3:          01:18:09       Yeah. Here's the coincidence, the coincidence, or here's the unlikely set of circumstances that are why I have decided to sit down at my type typewriter sounding keyboard and devoting your life to this. Okay, so we're all in on that. Then you round out your characters and what you want us to give them freedom. But you're also steering like, I don't believe all this stuff that like, you know, oh my gosh, I just start to channel everything and it's magic. Like you're controlling it. But when I'm writing, well, I have characters who are wittier than I am in real time. Not Meaning, like one of the things that's great with writing books is that a year later, go back with the perfect comeback to, uh, you know, like I have a year to come up with and polished the dialogue. And that's great. So whenever you've been in a party and someone slights here when you're driving home going, oh, I shouldn't have said that.

Speaker 3:          01:19:00       We get to say that when we're writing. But I've had that happen in real time. So there's something that starts to go on with characters as you engage in them that they're doing stuff that I feel like I'm typing just behind it happening, like it's just moving and that's a great feeling and there's this really weird thing that you want to get to, which is by the end of a book, the conclusion should feel at once inevitable and unpredictable. So you want to have things happen and we've all had that. I don't know if some people had it with the success some people had it with. We've all had that feeling in a movie or reading a book where you're right on the lip of discovery and then the thing happens and you're like, oh my God, that makes so much sense and completely caught me off guard at the same time. That's the win, right? And so you need to sort of. You have a responsibility to always make your needs subservient to the plot. Like the story is paramount. And so as much as you're the creator, you have to give free will to the story. You have to give stuff up that you don't and wouldn't otherwise. I might have spent weeks research on something

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       if it doesn't fit the story per our properly, I have to, you know, they, they call it killing your babies, right? You have to get rid of it, you got to throw it out and you have to.

Speaker 2:          01:20:16       It's really useful for, I think, beginning writers to know that we touched on previously, which is that yeah, you have to be willing to throw things away. Lots of things. I mean what I do to kind of take the sting out of that to some degree is I always have a document open on my computer called Kols and I'll pull out a paragraph that doesn't fit and throw it in there and you know, there's always the possibility that I'll find a place for it later. But often I do something with it later too. So the writing is necessarily. But yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:20:48       Well, and you know, so you're, you're trying to make everything work and you're trying to be surprising at the same time. But also you have to be open to opportunity. And I, I had my third book in particular learn this because I got all the way to the end and the ending that I thought was the exact opposite of the ending of the story that I had created and I realized I had a choice. I can either honor the story that I've created and, and make this thing that's better and surprising and unplanned for. Or I can write propaganda, I can see purpose story to my own means. And like that's like, that's an brand, right? It's like there's never going to be a shocking reveal where they're, you know, in an an brand, you know what it is and she's filling it out. You know what all of her thoughts are. So the writing for is in a process of discovery necessarily. It's a process of furthering the set of philosophical points

Speaker 2:          01:21:39       she does. That's second rate, I think is that all her heroes and all her villains, like all her heroes are the same hero and all her villains are the same villain. And all the villains are completely villainous. And all the heroes are completely heroic.

Speaker 5:          01:21:54       Well, snaps. Propaganda. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:21:56       yes. Well, it's exactly the opposite of Dostoevsky, you know, where he makes his, his villains are more heroic than his heroes by a substantial margin he makes superman to, to, to argue against fundamentally.

Speaker 5:          01:22:10       Right. And so, you know, one is about being open and the other thing I would say with writers is I see a lot here who were, you know, and this is true for, you know, fill in the blank for artistic feel and a lot of people who were like, you know, I went to beverly hills high, I studied screenwriting Undergrad, I got a masters in screenwriting and here I go and I'm ready to go and I want to write. And you're like, well, what the hell are you going to write about? You know, a lot of people. I think having a broad range of life experiences important. You know, there's some of the writers who I admire the most. Like James Ellroy was like borderline homeless, not homeless for awhile, just knocking about and figuring stuff out and on jobs and like living out in the world. And so if you want to write this or, or, or, or create some sort of constructed amalgam of previous things that have been constructed, go all the way through all the course work and do all that. But it, it, it's huge benefit to just pursue anything that interests

Speaker 3:          01:23:05       you because looking back it makes sense. I don't know why I chose young, you know, and looking in hindsight it's like, well no shit, right? He didn't write about anything but storytelling, but I didn't choose him in some way. And I remember even in college, so I was an English and psychology, but like I, I sort of wanted to, you know, I took a course in opera and I took a course in classical music. I mean, which I have zero aptitude for music, but I really was, you know, in, in art and all these different arenas to just have at least have a basis of things to write about. And I think the same is true for life experiences. Like do it, a lot of stuff do stuff that's dangerous, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:23:45       So let's. Okay, so we should fill in a backstory here for people too, because I imagine there are somewhat curious, I mean I've known you for a long time. We met when you were a student at Harvard when I was teaching there and you're actually the only one of the undergraduates that I knew there that I've kept up a relationship with over this protracted period of time, um, for, for a variety of reasons, but it's not like I didn't meet all sorts of remarkable undergraduates there. But um, do you, uh, do you, do you have any particular memories of that period of time when we were interacting? I can certainly tell one story, but I'll see what you come up with first.

Speaker 3:          01:24:24       Well, I remember you were, I remember you were formal in a way that I respected that because I still remember we were, we were friends or seeing each other outside of school for like four years before I finally was like, is it okay if I call you Jordan instead of Dr Peter said, and I think that the, the, the, the formals, maybe the wrong word, you, you, you, you, you had a certain authority that I think was key to the teaching process and you didn't Brooke Fools, I'm an all like if someone came in with an argument from either end of the spectrum, uh, from an ideological perspective, you had no interest in us. And so that was really palatable for me. And then I think what happened with, with young was that I like, I just sort of fell in love with all of that for like, that just, it, it, it's weird how much our interests aligned along those fronts because I had been very interested obviously in storytelling and thrillers and all this stuff, but dealing with young and dealing with the shadow.

Speaker 2:          01:25:28       We encountered some early political correctness there together. If I remember correctly, because you were in the English department and you were studying Shakespeare and you wanted to study Shakespeare from a union perspective, and if I remember correctly, at that time Shakespeare wasn't exactly popular in the English department and, and you was, um, well, Nazi. Yeah, exactly. The very opposite of popular. So that was also very interesting.

Speaker 3:          01:25:54       Yeah. Well when I was hitting a lot of that though, I think it wasn't, it didn't feel like it was the pitch that it was now, but it was at a sort of nineties were.

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       And it also felt kind of more interesting where like, it felt more conversational, a weird way. Like where people. Like I had my favorite feminist, like I was like, I really liked Naomi Wolf. Like someone, what she says really makes sense to me. Like there was conversations about stuff in a way that felt different and there's, there's sort of this rigidity now with people snapping to both sides of the equation. But I mean, I think one of the things that I, you know, in our courses that I liked a lot was that if somebody raised something that was clearly just some ideologically based, here's what I'm supposed to be saying and reiterating, you wouldn't have any tolerance for us. And I always respected that because it was like, and it also wasn't from a perspective of being shut down to it. It was like, I love eating conversation that you want to have on the merits, but I'm not going to engage in a conversation with a false bit of scaffolding that you're inhabiting. It was sort of the vibe. So that was interesting. Um, so I written there.

Speaker 2:          01:27:01       The thing I remember, one of the things I remember was, and I'm sure you remember this too, is that in one of my personality classes, I had asked the questions for a scale called the sensation seeking scale, which was what of the early versions of a big five variant and to sensation seeking scale asks people in park about minor juvenile rule breaking. I think shoplifting might've been one of the many ways. And so I asked everyone questions and I had them score it and then I asked people to put up their hands at each level of increase in scores, like are you in the bottom 10th percentile percentile, the 10th percentile or whatever. And if I remember correctly, you were the only person who put up his hand in the highest of the categories. And if I also remember correctly, I laughed about that quite a bit. And then if I also remembered correctly, you got a date out of that.

Speaker 5:          01:27:58       Yeah. Somebody asked me who is either like the top percentile in sensation seeking or where will surgeon it was going to be pretty much, I pretty much hit it, but we should also keep in mind that this was at Harvard. And so like the skills for like crazy sensation seeking daredevils, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:28:19       one of the things that's going to be surprised about when I, when I administered that scale to the whole class was just how low the overall scores were. And we know that conscientiousness is a really good predictor of, of academic performance. And so I would say that, you know, the kids there tended towards hyper conscientious miss more than towards say entrepreneurial, the entrepreneurial sort of thing.

Speaker 5:          01:28:42       It's like if you want the wind, like we're talking about this from the big five, it's like obviously conscientiousness, better predictor in some ways than Iq, right? On the street scale. But it's like if you can have the talent and conscientiousness, that's where you see people killing it in like three or four

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       shows. I mean like that's just a win. And so, you know, one, it's rare to have that entrepreneurial artistic, creative ability and also to ally that with say industriousness, which is part of conscientiousness. And it's rough too because the orderliness part of conscientiousness scenes to constrain creativity. So there's a real big mean. One of the things we found, for example, is that on the political continuum, imagine that that runs from, from left liberal to conservative, something like that. The fundamental one, the conservatives are high in conscientiousness and low and creativity, but mostly what they're high end these orderliness. Whereas liberals are high in openness and low in orderliness. I'm one of the things that comes out of that that's really interesting is that I've been thinking a lot about lately is I've been trying to figure out why conscientiousness and openness aren't correlated, so there's no real reason for them to lay together to predict political temperament.

Speaker 2:          01:30:00       But one of the things that struck me really hard and I think trump's discussion of the wall between the US and Mexico really got this active in my mind, was that as well as all this stuff I've been involved in recently with regards to what you can say and what you can say and and, and that kind of political correctness, is that I think the fundamental political question boils down to whether borders should be opened or closed and high orderly, low creative people like everything to be in boxes and they don't get much of a kick out of the potential creative interplay that can come from loosening the borders between things. But they're also willing to subject themselves to the discipline of order. So that's one of the things that gives them an advantage. But on the other side of the spectrum with them

Speaker 4:          01:30:47       willing.

Speaker 2:          01:30:49       Yeah, there is. They wouldn't think that up. It's like, oh look, there's a wall. I better turn around to go home. Well we could put a ladder over it. How would that work? Or. Yes, yes. That's, that's different.

Speaker 4:          01:31:03       The underground.

Speaker 2:          01:31:05       Yes, yes, exactly. Well, and so the liberal types they like, they like to uh, take advantage of the possibilities that are set forth by breaking the borders between things, but they're also unwilling to accept the discipline that working within an orderly structure will, will provide anyways. I think the border issue is pervasive at every level of analysis. So the conservative types like the borders around everything to remain tight, sexuality, identity, nationality that the state itself, whereas the more

Speaker 4:          01:31:43       conventionally right now with trump and advocate, but conventionally conservatives are returned even though Clinton cooperative with like when it comes to money,

Speaker 3:          01:31:53       it's sort of like only rules around maximizing money because free trade, I

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       know that it's a funny one. I mean you never get a pure manifestation of these things. I mean conservatives can be protectionists too at times. Right? You know? So I guess the political expression depends to some degree on what's happening in the environment at that particular point.

Speaker 5:          01:32:16       But Surf, surfing all these walls is like. I mean that's the trick, right? It's so much easier to armor yourself and one pure ideology. You know, one of the things I think about a lot is with the skin, so I've just gotten back from a two week for a two week leg of the tour. I'm in a different city every day and it's like it's reviews and it's readers and it's all the stuff. And I've been thinking a lot about how much work it takes to, not to stay open creatively but stay focused enough. I'm pretty high in orderliness. That's something that, that, that, that, that can interfere. But it's weird because, I mean, one of the things I think about, it's like to be a writer, you sort of need the sensitivity of a butterfly with the hide of a rhinoceros. Like you need to be so sensitive and attuned to things and also so willing to accept, you know, rejection or negative reviews are all kinds of weird feedback and everything else. And I'm saying this from someone who's been fortunate enough to be largely successful, but it's still there. There's a, there's a battering that you take when you try and advance something outside the normal structure. So you're starting to sound like Madonna.

Speaker 2:          01:33:26       Oh, I actually watched that speech she made the other day and I think she's depressed actually. What was the speech? What did I say that sounded like Madonna oven of the year award or something like that. I happened to watch a version of it where she was intercut with Milo Yiannopoulos, which was actually quite comical. But uh, she spent a lot of time complaining about how hard it was to be Madonna and to be a woman. And I was watching it very carefully because she, she didn't say one positive thing about her life and I thought and she seemed to be close to tears most of the time. And I thought there's something wrong. She looked, she looked at me like she was actually depressed because it was, you know, I mean, she's had a pretty successful go of it. And to only focus on the negative is, is, is, is kind of rough, so,

Speaker 5:          01:34:13       but neither of those things are bad that I'm, that I'm pointing to meaning like you want to be as sensitive as possible so that you're attuned to constant kept this whole butterfly Rhinoceros Eminence image. It's like, yeah, I can see what I mean is there's a, there's a trick to trying to be floating to maintain all your openness and also be tough as hell like that. That's sort of one of the ways to do it because you need to blaze forward with it, with it like butterfly Rhinoceros blazing forward. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. As, as the common refrain is socrates said, a butterfly sting like a rhinoceros, but when you're breaking away from those structures, those structures, when you're in a space that's entrepreneurial, that's the chow. I mean, look, that's part of the challenge that we're seeing people not resisting with group thing. Like there's such a need to apparel and armor yourself in inset ideologies, you know, and, and to, to have things be a certain way, to just go all the way off on orderliness. But to try and maintain high discipline, I orderliness and high opendesk the. There's a constant tension that's moving. Yep.

Speaker 2:          01:35:39       Yeah. Well, I think that that's partly why high level creative performances so rare is because it's very difficult to bring those things together because they actually. They're mutually constraining.

Speaker 5:          01:35:50       Well, I think that's interesting. For me, I've worked with a lot of celebrities who are at a fairly high level in the highest level, let's just say whether it's acting or singing or household name people who, some of whom carry with it. The press reputation of being smart and some who do not. The one thing that always amazes me is like anyone at a certain level of fame, how has the level of unbelievable. I'm sharpness, like there's no one who accidentally stumbled their way all the way up to having a top 10 hit or a number one movie or something else. It's very, very rare. And so even people that we look at and go, that's some stupid celebrity. That's a dumb actor, that's an idiot singer. People are running empires, you know? And they somehow have to do that while keeping their antenna up and focused and, and letting enough end to keep creating in a way that's meaningful. Um, it's, it's, I've yet to meet someone. There's a lot of people who are a pain in the ass, but I've yet to meet people at that level. I'm not impressed.

Speaker 2:          01:36:57       One of the things I've learned in recent years is to go watch famous people when they come to Toronto, no matter whether or not I like the. So for example, I went and saw Dolly Parton with my wife about six months ago outside at the amphitheater. And like, I wouldn't say I'm a great fan of Dolly Parton's music. I mean, she's quite the phenomenon, but, but she was absolutely amazing. Absolutely amazing, brilliant, witty, self denigrating, a incredibly musically talented, a really engaging with the audience. She really seemed to like to be there. It was a real treat. And, and I agree with what you said, is that it's a rare person who, especially who manages to sustain that across any amount of time who doesn't have something truly remarkable about them.

Speaker 5:          01:37:46       I'd also like to point out my magnanimity of not taking the open revenge shot through your Madonna comment about you go into a Dolly Parton concert. I just want, I just want that knowledge and let the record show that I'm showing enormous restricted at this point. And you have the entire discussing. I'm very. I'm very happy about that too, right? Yeah. Have a movie coming out in June. You want to talk a little bit about that? It's called the book of Henry. Um, and it stars Naomi Watts. We are Jacob Tremblay in it. He's the boy from room. Sarah Silverman, who we mentioned earlier. Dean Norris. Terrific cast. I'm Maddie Ziegler who is amazing gate and leaving hers, the boy from St Vincent and midnight special and it's about I'm constraint because we have a very kind of under wraps. We want it to be a surprise. It's a very unusual, very special kind of film.

Speaker 5:          01:38:41       I wrote the rough draft of this, the first draft 18 years ago. I, this script has literally grown up with me. Um, and I, it's, it's about a single mom. Naomi Watts plays the character who is raising two boys, one of whom is a prodigy and something very bad is happening next door to them and working with her son who was a prodigy, she has to figure out she's a lot like the child in the relationship and the 12 year old is more like the adults and they have to sort of navigate through their way to a solution. It has a very strong thriller elements. It has some humor. I mean, one of the things I said I was thinking about is that I hope there's a lot of emotions in it that will catch people off guard. Um, and how it got made, why it took so long to get made is it was so unusual.

Speaker 5:          01:39:29       How it got made was I found a director, I'm off a movie called safety, not guaranteed that it's a wonderful little small independent movie called Colin trevorrow. And we were moving forward toward production. And then he said, look, I just had a meeting with Spielberg. There's no conceivable way he would give me Jurassic world off my tiny little movie that costs probably less than the catering budget for Jurassic world, but I just want to give you a heads up on two weeks later he called and was like, dude, I got dress mortal. And so I lost him and he said to me, you never know. Maybe that will reveal, you know, make all this money, we can just come back and get this screen less. Um, and so he went off and made it, you know, maybe I think one point $7,000,000,000 for universal and true to his word.

Speaker 5:          01:40:16       And I have enormous regard for calling for a variety of reasons, but, but this being one of them, you know, he came back and called me and said, well now I'm doing one of the next star wars movies and I have a window and let's shoot this thing and go. And so we had the small window. I did, I did the rewrite in like four or five days, the production or garage. And we just, he casts it like that. I mean, at that point he was someone who everyone wanted to work with and off we went and it was amazing. It was like, you know, 18 years later, an overnight success. Cool. So yeah, that was good. Great. We should probably call it quits. I think it's been about 90 minutes,

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       which seems to be about the right amount of time, so thanks very much for talking with me and uh, well we'll talk soon and we'll see how this goes as a youtube video and as a podcast. So I think you'll be the first one up on the. I'm going to hopefully do a number of interviews. I interviewed a Canadian composer yesterday for 90 minutes as well, but I think that one's going to take a little time to get the audio editing right. So you might be the first one out, so obviously I'll let you know as soon as possible. Thanks very much for taking an hour and a half today. Yeah, thanks. Thanks

Speaker 5:          01:41:29       for doing it. This was great. All right, talk soon. Bye. Bye.
