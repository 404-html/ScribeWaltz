Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh, are you shocked at the amount of people that live in western societies here in Norway, especially when we were in Sweden a couple of days ago, but all the countries that we've been in that live in free societies yet are completely afraid to say what they think. Is it absolutely shocking to you?

Speaker 2:          00:20          I think the most. I think what I've been most shocked about in all of that is what's happened in the UK with the police starting to prosecute people for crimes of offensiveness. That's just. And I think that's probably partly because I'm an, I mean I see that as broadly reflective of, of something that's happening in the West in general, but it's particularly shocking and appalling to me as a, as a western Canadian, you know, because obviously Canada was part of the British empire and when I grew up, like there was a pretty tight affinity still in western Canada with the British empire. I mean our, our maps where the dominion of Canada, it was still pink, you know, it was still a part of the British empire. We saying God save the Queen Constantly at public gatherings. That's gone by the wayside and so, and you know, I've always regarded British common law and the British parliamentary tradition as well.

Speaker 2:          01:19          One of it perhaps the highest achievement of western civilization. I mean you could argue about that, but it's, it's in the top 10, let's say, and then to see the Brits who also have this phenomenal sense of humor, this ability to say anything, no matter how outrageous about anyone and to include themselves in the joke, right? Which is such an elegant way of expressing comedic freedom to see them going down this road is just, it just, it's, it's, it's what is it exactly? Well, it's deeply saddening. That's for sure. And, and what's horrifying and it's not exactly the right wording. I don't know what the word for it is there. Certainly sorrow that's associated with a disbelief. It's also that at, at, at, at watching that happen in what I still think is the central core of the idea of individual sovereignty and freedom as expressed across the western world.

Speaker 2:          02:20          And so, and then there's similar manifestations of that everywhere else, but the police per prosecuting people for, you know, asking people to turn in their neighbors if they say something offensive. And that's happening in the UK. Yeah. Litter. Well, we saw that, that, you know, somebody sent me posters, pictures of posters in the Scottish subway, in the, in the metro, in the tube, you know, saying inviting people to inform on their neighbors for being offensive. It's like, what the hell, what, what? So I knew this was coming because. Because I knew we brought our first speech laws in Canada back in the 19 eighties. We were after this character named Ernst Zandel, who is particularly despicable piece of work, hard hat wearing, right wing antisemitism Holocaust denier. You know, he had it all that guy and it was his shenanigans, careless malevolent shenanigans that entice Canadians into producing hate speech legislation. I thought, no, that's, that's not good. It's not good. You're making a big mistake. We're going to pay for this. It's going to unfold over a long time. Who defines hate

Speaker 2:          03:44          the crucial issue. It's not like it's a scientific category to judgment and the answer is those whom you least want to have the power to define it because they're the ones that will take that power to themselves. And if you think that isn't gonna Affect what you get to say, well you've got another thing coming. So I think it's, I think it's, we're going to pay for it and hopefully hopefully we'll wake up and push back before we have to pay too high a price to pay for it. So. Yeah. And we're going to deserve to pay for it too. He's talking to you

Speaker 3:          04:33          last night. Last night that

Speaker 2:          04:35          was on this British show called question time, which is very famous British show. And there was a, um, a woman parliamentarian. They're from Ireland who, who is pretty bright. I like listening to her, but I'm the host asked me about this character named count. Dang, Kyla, I don't know if you know about him and his girlfriend. He's a comedian while he thinks he's a comedian and. Well, but you know, there are lots of Comedians who think they're comedians that aren't funny. And I'm not saying he's not funny because other people think that he's a comedian too, but he presents himself as a comedian. Count. Dang killer. I mean that's actually a joke, that name and his girlfriend had a pug and I liked count Dan Kennedy because he hated that Pug and I'm not very fond of pugs. I think they're hideous little creatures and, and, and, and you know, I don't really hate them if a pug comes along then all pet it and everything, but it's just sort of like the, the, this little dog with these bugs, you know, if you hit it on the back of the head, the eyes will pop out.

Speaker 2:          05:44          And so because they've been so genetically mishandled and so, I don't know, man, it's just, you realize we're putting this on youtube and you're just done. You're unleashing a whole new world. People. I know, I know. I know. Whatever, whatever. So you can have your and you can love it. My Dad had this dog that was so damn hideous and useless that it was just a miracle and he loved it to death. And so, and you know, that's fine, that's fine, but there's kind of an ironic attitude in the dismissal of pugs and Denckla didn't like his girlfriend's punk. And so he thought he'd play a mean trick and, or amine slash funny trick and teach it to do a hail Hitler salute. Which I actually thought was quite funny. It's like I don't, look, I don't see that as glorifying Hitler hits up Pug for God's sake.

Speaker 2:          06:33          It wasn't, uh, it wasn't a, what do you call those Doberman, you know, it was a pug that's like teaching a wrap to do hail Hitler. Salute. I love how this has come down to the breed of dogs with you. These things matter in terms of their, the way they're represented, you know, and then, you know, he, he taught it to so horrible. He and I'm gonna be so killed for this. He taught him to do it's little salute when he said gas the Jews, which is not funny. It except it's horribly funny, you know, that's the thing. Well look, and so yeah, you laugh. That's right. Because you're all horrible and you know, and you know perfectly well that it's horribly funny

Speaker 2:          07:25          and you know, we need, we need to be able to be horribly funny because life is horrible and we and we need to be able to find. We need to be able to allow people the freedom to find the ability to transcend that horror with comedy and a mark of a free society is that comedians can be just exactly what the is, which there people who push the edge of what's acceptable. If you're a brilliant comedian, you get right to the edge, right? And you dance there and the audience is thinking, Sarah Silvermans a good example of that. You know, because you can just see her. She's gone all politically correct recently. But when she was in her heyday, you could just see Sarah, she's so smart. You'd see you're sitting there and she'd think of something just spectacularly evil and horrible. And she think, oh, and then she say it, you know, and everyone would just crack up because like the darkest part of their soul had once thought something like that and she dared to outer red 10. And by honoring it she also simultaneously transcended it, you know? And that's the beauty of comedy and, and, and well. So anyways, they went after Dane, Kyla and nailed him legally. And I thought that's an, that's in Great Britain as well last night. So they brought this up on, on question time and you know, the Irish woman who said she went off on a talk about how terrible Kristallnacht wasn't, what an awful thing Auschwitz Holocaust was. It's like, well,

Speaker 2:          09:00          you're not that morally virtuous to notice that. You know what I mean? It's like it didn't have anything to do with the topic at hand. It's like, yet you wouldn't say that. You notice that unless you were implying that where there are people around you, including this count, dank killer, who didn't notice that. Okay. It had nothing to do with whether he should have been prosecuted for his stupid joke. And you can say, well, you could say I was a stupid joke, which it certainly was. You could say that it was a hateful joke, which I don't agree with by the way, but you could say that and I think you could, you could make a credible case for that. But then to say that because you think that the holocaust was bad, he should be criminally prosecuted. It's like, no, sorry man, you've crossed the line and there's no excuse for it.

Speaker 2:          09:48          And so that's part of what's worrisome about the state of discourse in the free West. That same thing, comedians won't go to university campuses, same thing. You don't get to be funny. So if you can't be funny then you're not free. You know, the gesture and the king's courts, the only person who gets to tell the truth. And if the king is such a tyrant that he kills his gesture, then you know that the evil king is in charge. And so when we can't tolerate our comedians, it's like, well, there you go. They're the canaries in the coal mine as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker 2:          10:36          My wife that I wouldn't hit any hornets with any Hornet's nest with sticks for like a day and now I just hit a big hornet's nest with the stick. So sorry Tammy. She's here somewhere. Yeah. Give it up for Jordan's wife, by the way. She's been.

Speaker 3:          10:52          Thank you. Thank you.
