Speaker 1:          00:00:09       So I've been thinking this week about doing this one of them once a month on a continuing basis,

Speaker 2:          00:00:17       so thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       So I think if I do that, I think it will be here, although it's harder to rent this theater during the academic year, but if it isn't here it will be somewhere else and I'd like to continue doing this. I'm learning a lot from doing it and, and uh, once a month would really be good because then I could really do the background work and, and uh, and I could probably do that for a couple of years because obviously this is going very quickly, but that's okay. You know, I mean, it shouldn't go any faster than it can go and that's how it, that's how it seems to me anyways. So, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       this has been, this has been a very steep learning curve for me with regards to these stories because I didn't understand them very well and I've got better at using the resources on line to help me do my background investigation. I have a lot of books and some of you may have noticed that I'm online. I posted a conversation I had with Jonathan Otto and his and his brother Matthew. Um, I hope it's matthew. I re names escape me so badly, but I believe that's right. He just finished a book on the, on the Bible and so I've been doing a lot of thinking and talking about these stories, trying to understand what they're about. And, and then there's all these commentaries, there's a great site, I think it's called Bible hub that has every single verse of the Bible is listed there. And then with each verse there are like they've aggregated 10 commentaries from about 10 commentaries from over the last 400 years.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       And so there's like a dense page on every line and that's one of the things that's really interesting about this book too, is that it's, it's aggregated so much commentary that it's, that it's, it's much bigger than it looks. The book is much bigger than it looks. And so it's been very interesting to become familiar with those two. And the fact that this site is set up with all the commentary split up by versus means you can rapidly compare the commentaries and get a sense of, you know, how people have interpreted this over while at least several hundred years, but of course much longer than that because of the people who wrote the commentaries were of course reading things that were older than that. So that's been very, very interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:02:36       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       so last week we talked about a couple of things. We talked about how you might understand the idea of a divine encounter. And then we also paralleled that with the idea that God disappears in the Old Testament. He, he bows out as the stories progress. And that seems to be a, an emergent property. The sequencing of the stories, right? Because all the books were written by independent people are different people and then they were aggregated by other people. And so the narrative continuity, is it some kind of emergent property that's, that's a consequence of this interaction between people, readers and writers over centuries. And it's strange that given that there are also multiple coherent narratives that united, you know, it's really, it's really not that easy to understand that, but it does at least seem to be the case. And so, and the third thing we talked about was that as God bows out, so to speak, the, the, the, the individual personality seems of the, of the characters that are involved, the human characters that are involved seems to become more and more developed.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       And it isn't exactly clear what that, I mean, what it means is that God steps away and man steps forward. That's what it means. But why it's arranged like that or they or they say ultimate significance of that is by no means clear. And so. So Abraham, who we're going to concentrate on today is quite a well developed character. And I would say there are two, there are multiple endings and beginnings in the biblical stories. The most important ending, I suppose, is the ending of the of the garden of Paradise and and the the disenchantment of the world and the and the sending forth of Adam and eve into history, right into the future, into a, into a mode of being that has a future as part of it and that has history as part of it and that has the necessity of sacrifice and toil as part of it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       That's obviously crucial and then that's. That is replayed with the story of Noah because everything is destroyed and then the world is created a new and then sacrifices have to be made in order for the world to begin. And then you see the same thing happen again after the Noah story and the Tower of Babel. Because history, as we really understand history seems to start with Abraham because the stories of Abraham sound like historical stories and you know, scholars debate about the historical accuracy of the Bible. And I suppose there's. There's no way of determining once and for all the degree to which you might regard the accounts as equivalent to modern empirical history. But this is a psychological interpretation of the biblical stories, not a historical interpretation, and it certainly does seem to be the case that from a psychological perspective, we enter something like the domain of the modern conceptualization, relatively modern conceptualization of history with Abraham beyond the accounts of divine commands that Abraham carries out.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       This is from Friedman, man, I mentioned in the last lecture who wrote the disappearance of God in a variety of other books that are well worth reading. The narrative also includes a variety of stories in which Abraham acts on his own initiative. He divides land with his nephew lot. He battles kings, he takes concubines, he argues with his wife Sarah. On two occasions he tells kings that Sarah is his sister out of fear, that they will kill him to get his wife. He arranges his son's marriage in the place of the single story of Noah's drunkenness. There are, in the case of Abraham, the stories of a man's life. And one of the things I was really struck by reading this in depth and reading the commentary is how much like a story about a person it is, you know, Abraham isn't a divine figure in, in any, in any archetipal sense.

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       Precisely. I mean he has architectural elements because he's also obviously the founder of a nation. But fundamentally he's a human being and, and he makes, he has the adventures and he makes the mistakes of a human being. And that's, it's the mistake part that really struck me. You know, because it, it, it. I was talking with a friend of mine this week, Norman Doidge, whose a very remarkable person in many ways and he was taking me to task. He was reading my book, which I'm going to publish, which will be out in January. And in the book are in one section. I contrasted the god of the Old Testament with the god of the New Testament and made the case sort of based on North Road fries ideas that the god of the Old Testament was really harsh and judgmental, you know? And that the god of the New Testament was more merciful and you know, at least to some degree, more sweetness and light.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       And Norman took me to task about that, saying that that was a, an overly christianized interpretation, which would make sense because I derived it in part from northrop Frye. And I really have come to understand that more that, that he's right because that he's right about that because the god in the Old Testament is actually far more merciful than he's generally made out to be. And you really see this with a. it's good news for fundamentally, if you regard the representation of God as somehow key to the description of being itself. I mean, Abraham makes a lot of mistakes, you know, serious mistakes. And, and yet he has a life and he's, and he's blessed by God despite the fact that he's pretty deeply flawed and engages in deceptive practice. I mean, he's a good man, but he's not a perfect man by any stretch of the imagination and, and things work out really well for him.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       And he's the founder of a nation and all of that. And that's good news for everyone because perfect people are very, very hard to find. And if the, the, the, the only pathway to having a rich and meaningful life was through perfection, then we would all be in deep trouble. And so that's very satisfying to read that. And the other, the other thing that I've been struck by is that, you know, Abraham, and I think this is actually absolutely key to the interpretation of the story. Abraham goes out and does things. That's the thing. And so one of the things that I've noticed in my life is that nothing I've ever done was wasted. And by done, I mean put my heart and soul into it, you know, like, like attempted with, with all of my effort that always worked. Now it didn't always work the way I expected it to work.

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       That's a whole different issue. But the payoff from it was always positive. I always something always something of value always accrued to me when I made the sacrifices necessary to do worthwhile. And so I think part of the message in this story of a, the abrahamic stories is go do something. And, and I've, I've, I've thought about this in a variety of ways outside of the interpretation of this story because I have this program some of you might be familiar with which is called future authoring program and it's designed to help people make a plan for three to five years into the future. You know? And so what you do is you, you answer some questions, it's a writing program. You answered some questions about how you would like your life to be, what you would like your character to be three to five years down the road if you were taking care of yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       Like you are taking care of someone that you actually cared about. So you kind of have to split yourself into two people and treat yourself like you, like someone you have respect for and that you want the best. For now it's not easy because people don't necessarily have respect for themselves and they don't necessarily want what's the best for themselves because they have a lot of self contempt and a lot of self hatred and a lot of guilt and a lot of existential angst. And and a lot of self consciousness and all of that, and so people don't necessarily take care of themselves very well and I think it's. I think it's. I think you have an obligation. It's one of the highest moral obligations to treat yourself as if you're a creature of value and that is in some sense it's in some sense that's independent of your actions and you might think about that metaphorically as a recognition of your divine worth in the biblical sense, regardless of your, of your sins, so to speak.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       And I think that's, that's, that's powerful language as far as I'm concerned. Once you understand it anyways with the self authoring program in the future authoring program, you, you ask you answer questions about what, what, how you would like your friendships to be conducted because it's useful to surround yourself with people who are trying to move forward and more importantly, who are happy when you move forward and not happy when you move back backwards. Not when you fall. That isn't what I mean, but when you're doing self destructive things, your friends shouldn't be there to cheer you on and because then they're really not acting like friends. Obviously, you know, I know it's obvious, but it still happens all the time and people allow it to happen. It's not a good idea. And now how would you like to sort your family out, and I was thinking about this this week too because I was thinking about Noah's Ark and there was a phrase in that story that I didn't understand, which was that noah was perfect in his generations.

Speaker 1:          00:11:16       I thought, I don't know what that means and you know when you're, when you're going through a book like the Bible, if you don't understand a phrase that actually means you've missed something, it doesn't mean that that's just not. You know, that's not Germane to the story. It means you're stupid. You didn't get it, man. You didn't get it. You didn't understand it. And so the idea that Noah was perfect in his generations and that's why he could build an arc that would sustain him and him and and humanity itself through the flood. It meant that he not only did he walk with God, which is something that we talked about in the context of the sermon on the mount, but the established proper relationships with his family, with his children. And so what that meant was that his, not only was he well integrated as a person, but his level of integration had reached the point where it's stretched out beyond him and encompassed his family.

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       And so it was noah and the family that was in the arc. And I can tell you, and I really understood this this year because I had a very tumultuous year or you could think about it from a personal perspective. I could think about it as a year that had no shortage of floods. And My. And part of the reason that I was able to get through it. I also had terrible health problems. And one of the reasons I was able to get through it was because my family really came together around me, my kids, my wife, my parents and my friends as well, and particularly a certain group of friends and that's partly all of that came together in my mind this week and I thought, oh, that's what it means to be perfect in his generations meant that he hadn't just straightened himself out. He'd also straightened out his relationships with his family and I can tell you that when crisis strikes you, which it will, it will.

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       The flood will come, right? That's why the apocalypse has always upon us. The flood will definitely come into your life and to the degree that you've organized yourself psychologically and also healed the relationships between you and your family. That could be the critical element that determines whether you live or die when a crisis comes or or whether it's someone in your family lives or dies. And so the idea of the arc containing the man who's who walks with God and whose generations are perfect and that that's what sustains humanity through the crisis. It's like you couldn't be more psychologically accurate than that. You know, the other thing I was thinking about this week I, I was thinking about another line in the new testament. I think it's from the sermon on the mount, but I'm not absolutely sure. Christ compares the Kingdom of Heaven to a mustard seed and so I was thinking about a mustard seed is a very tiny seed and it grows into quite a spectacular complex plant and I was thinking about how you should operate in the world in order to make it a better place, assuming that that's what you should be doing and that is what you should be doing and there there's lots in the world to fix everything that bothers you about the world and about yourself should be fixed and you can do that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       And my dawning realization, I have a friend, he lives in Montreal. His name is James. Simon is a great painter and he's taught me a lot of things, helped. He's helped me design my house and beautify it and I bought some paintings from him a couple of years ago and he did this series of paintings where he went around North America and stood in different places and then he painted the view from here down and so it's his feet planted in different places on roads in the desert, on the ocean. I have one actually hanging over my toilet, which is him standing at a urinal. I'm now. Well, you know, he was trying to make a point and the point was that wherever you are, it's worth paying attention and that's because you know, so all these places that he visited, he looked exactly

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       where he was standing by the side of the road in the desert side of mundane in some sense. But then maybe he put 40 hours into that painting. You know, when it's very, very realistic painting with really good light. And what he's telling you as a painter is everything is worth paying attention to an infinite amount, but you don't have enough time. And so the artists does that for you. Right? The artist looks and locks and locks and locks and locks and then gives you that vision and so then you can look at the painting and it reminds you that right where you are is there's every everything that there is is right where you are and that's a hard thing to realize, but it's actually true. And so I've been telling people online in various ways and the lectures that they should start fixing up the world by cleaning up the room.

Speaker 3:          00:15:35       And I wanted to just elaborate on that a little bit before I get back to the lecture itself. So I'd say it's become this Internet weird Internet meme, you know, and, and, and, and it's a joke and good. It's a jewel. I really happy about the fact that so much of this has got the leaving of humor and it's really important because that's what stops things from degenerating into, into conflict humor. And I was thinking about this idea of cleaning up your room in relationship to the mustard seed idea. And you see the thing about cleaning up your room. This is also something I learned from Carl young and his studies on alchemy because for young, when the alchemist was attempting to make the philosopher's stone, he was not only engaged in the transformation of the material world, but he was engaged in a process of self transformation that occurred at the same time as the as the chemical trap, as the chemical transformation, so it was a psychological work in some sense.

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       Let's say you want to sort out your room and beautified because the beauty is also important and let's say that all you have is just a little room like you're not rich. You're poor and you don't have any power. That's another thing, but you've got your damn room and you've got this space right in front of you. You know that that's a part of the cosmos that you can come to grips with and you might think, well, what's there in front of you right in front of you? And the answer to that is it depends on how open your eyes are. That's the proper answer because you could say, w William Blake said this, for example, eldest Huxley made comments that were very similar that in a transcendent state, you can see infinity in the finite and you might say, well, you can say, and you can see infinity in what you have within your grasp.

Speaker 3:          00:17:12       If you look and you could save, maybe that's the case with your room, and so you want to clean up your room. Well, okay, how do you do that? Exactly? Well, a room, his room is a place to sleep and so if you set your room up properly, then you figure out how to sleep and when you should sleep and how you should sleep, and then you figure out when you should wake up and then you figure out, well, what clothes you should wear because they have to be arranged properly in your dresser, and then you have to have some place to put your clothes and you're going to have some clothes. You have to figure out what you're going to wear those clothes to do. Right? And then that means you have to figure out what you're going to do and then your room has to serve that purpose because otherwise it isn't set up properly and if it doesn't set up, if it doesn't serve your purposes, you will be unhappy and not happy in the room because the way that we perceive the world is as a place to move from point a to point B in, and then if the place that we're in facilitates that movement, then we're happy to be there.

Speaker 3:          00:18:07       And if the place that we're in serves as an obstacle to that movement, then we're unhappy to be there. And so what it means to set up your room is that you have to have somewhere to go that's worthwhile. Or you can set up your room and your room has to be set up to facilitate that. And then the next thing is, well maybe you have to make it beautiful, but that's not easy, right? That means you have to have some taste and that doesn't mean you have to have money. It doesn't because you can be garish with money and you can be tasteful with nothing. All you need is taste and taste, beats money when it comes to beautifying things, that money is trivial because it's not. The taste is crucial and people who are very artistically oriented can make beautiful things out of virtually nothing and not only that, the literature suggests that if you're going to make beautiful things, putting real constraints on, on what you allow yourself to do, facilitates creativity instead of interfering with it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:59       Because let's say you have to make something out of nothing, right? Which I suppose would be a Godly Act, right? You have to make something out of nothing. You have to be creative in order to do that, and so then to beautify your room means that you also have to develop your capacity to be creative and so then you can make your room shine, but then what will happen is that if your family isn't together, they will interfere with that. You will interfere with that because you won't have the discipline to do it properly, but then when you start building this, this, this little microcosm of perfection with what you have at hand and it'll evoke all the pathologies of everyone in your household. The wonder what the hell you're up to in there and they won't necessarily be happy because if you're. If they're in a lowly place, let's say, and so are you and you're trying to move out of that than the higher you move out of that, the more the place they're in looks bad and you might say, well, what they should do is celebrate your victory over chaos and evil, but that isn't what will happen.

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       What will happen instead is that they will attempt to pull you back down. They'll attempt to, and obviously all families don't do that, but, but all families do that to some degree and some families do almost nothing but that. And so what that means is that if you're going to organize your room, then you're going to have to confront the devils in your house. And that's often. That's often a terrifying thing because some of those devils have have lineages that go back many, many, many generations and God only knows what you have to struggle with in order to overcome that and so and so to sort yourself out into fix up your room is a nontrivial matter. You know, and you can do that. You'll learn by doing that and then maybe you'll learn enough by doing that so that you can fix up your family a little bit and then having done that, you'll have enough character so that when you to operate in the world at your job or maybe in the broader social spheres, that you will be a force for good instead of harm because you'll have learned some humility by noting just how difficult it was to put your damn room together well and yourself for that matter.

Speaker 3:          00:21:01       And so you'll proceed cautiously with your eyes open towards the good and so well. Those are some of the things I've been thinking about this week and they're Germane, Germane to what we're going to discuss tonight. Because what happens at the beginning of the abrahamic stories is basically God comes to Abraham and just says, go get going, man, do something, do something, get going. And you might think, well, where should I go? And God, God is somewhat vague about that in where he sends Abraham. It's a real fixer upper man. It's like there's starvation narrow, and there's tyranny and there's, and there's marital dissolution. And there's deceit. Like it's just like where you live, you know, it's exactly the same thing. It's, it's, it's tyranny and catastrophe. So that's great. The tyrannical great father because because Abraham ends up having to sojourn in Egypt and, and uh, there's a feminine.

Speaker 3:          00:21:56       So Mother Nature is on the rampage and Abraham lies about, his wife has, we'll see. And so it's the world. It's the world. It's tyranny and, and vulnerability and deceit. And yet God says goal. Because if you do go, then you'll become a father of nations. And you think, well, again, that's pretty good news, although it's strange because you'd expect that if God chose Abraham, then he'd send them immediately to the land of honey land of milk. And honey, and that isn't what happens at all. It doesn't happen at all and Abraham never gets there, but his mission is still regarded as divine and thank God for that because that's what your mission will be because that's what you will encounter in your life. Those are the arc archetipal things. Everyone encounters the tyranny of the social structure and the and the rapaciousness of nature and the deceitful, the deceitful quality of the human psyche.

Speaker 3:          00:22:46       It's like that's the world. Now. It's a negative. That's a negative view in some sense, but it's positive in the story because what it basically says is something that's akin to the sermon on the mount, which is that if you're aligned with God and you pay attention to the divine injunction, then you can operate in the midst of chaos and tyranny and deception and flourish, and you could hardly hope to have a better piece of news than that. Given that that's exactly where you are. So and I didn't see any of that neighbor having stories to begin with, so that's been very interesting to have that sort of reveal itself.

Speaker 3:          00:23:23       Abraham section nus develops the personality and character of man to integrate new degree in biblical narrative. Well picturing him in a new degree of responsibility in him, a new degree of responsibility. So here's the other thing that's really struck me and I think this is absolutely crucial importance and I don't know how much importance but it's certainly important to me. One of the things that has just blown me away in the last year because I've talked to lots of people, lots of people live, you know, but also lots of people online but it's more obvious live and it's obvious in this theater as well as I've. I've gone around and spoken and a large proportion of my audience has been young man young, you know, under 30, something like that. And I've spoken to them a lot about responsibility. And what's so odd about, about this is that of all the things that I've spoken about, because I can see the audience and I can feel how the audience is reacting because I'm always paying attention to all of you. It's in so far as I can manage that. So I, I, I get some sense of how, what I'm saying is landing, you know, which you have to do if you're going to speak effectively to people and what, what happens is if I talk about responsibilities, everyone b is silent just like they are now silent and not moving, right? Focusing attentive, say pick up your responsibility, pick up the heaviest thing you can and carry it and the room goes quiet and everybody's eyes open. And I think that always makes somebody break up.

Speaker 3:          00:24:56       I was,

Speaker 3:          00:25:06       I don't know why I was speaking to an English journalist today who's going to write an article in spectator magazine. I was talking about this and at the same point in the discussion the same, I had the same emotional reaction. I don't really understand it. It's, I think it's something. There's something about it that's so crucial because you know, we've been fed this unending diet of rights and freedoms and there's something about that especially. There's something about that that so pathologically wrong and people are starving for the antidote. And the antidote is truth and responsibility, right? And it isn't, it isn't. Because that's what you should do in some, you know, in some, some I know better or someone knows better for you, what you should do sense. It's that. It's that. It's that. It's that that's the secret to a meaningful life and without a meaningful life, then all you have is suffering and nihilism and despair and all of that and self contempt and and that's not good and so the man hits necessary for men to stand up and take responsibility and they all know that and and are starving for that message and the message is more that that's also a good thing to stand up and take responsibility because you're cursed so much.

Speaker 3:          00:26:20       Now from, from, from, from when you're young with this notion that your active engagement with the world is part of what is destroying and undermining the planet and adding to the tyranny of the social systems. It's like, how about not so much that, hey, because it's, it's, it's to soul deadening. It's andy human right to the core and my sense instead is that you know, if you, if you were able to reveal

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       the best of yourself to you in the world, that you would be an overwhelming force for good and that whatever errors might be made along the way would wash out in the works, and that's the other thing that you see in the abrahamic stories because Abraham is not a perfect person by any stretch of the imagination. He's a real person and he makes mistakes, but it doesn't matter. The overarching narrative is, you know, maintain your covenant with God, and despite your inadequacies, then not only will you prevail, but your descendants will prevail. It's great. That's really good news. You know, so it's been really something to see that in the, in the stories. It's not that. So that's responsibility. It's not just that Abraham is kinder, gentler, more intrepid ethical or a better debater than his ancestor noah. Rather. Both the Noah and Abraham, stories or pieces of a development of an increasingly stronger stance of humans relative to the daddy before the story is over, humans will become a good deal, stronger and bolder than Abraham, and that's really something to say because Abraham is pretty bold.

Speaker 4:          00:27:48       So we'll. Let's read the stories. The first one is about Abraham, Sarah, and lot. Now these are the generations of Tara. Tara begat a Ram, so his name is Abraham to begin with, and that actually turns out to be important. It's not Abraham knee, Horton, inherent, inherent begat lot. So heroin is Abrams. Brother and heroin died before his father, terah in the land of his Nativity in Er of the chaldees and Abraham and nay whore took them wives. The name of Abram's wife was Sarah and the name of [inaudible] wife Milka, the daughter of heroin, the father of Milkah and the father of Isca, but Sarah was barren. She had no child and Terah took Abraham, his son and lot the son of heroin, his son's son and daughter in law, his son, Abram's wife, and they went forth with them from the earth cellies from Irv, the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan.

Speaker 4:          00:28:40       That's exile and they came into heroin and dwelt there and the days of Terah were 205 years and Terah died inherent and there's a reason that Sarah is, is introduced as barren and to set the stage. I think it was Anton Chekov who when he was talking about this stage setting for a play, that if there was a rifle hanging on the wall, then it had better been used before. I believe the second act or it shouldn't be hanging there at all. Right? And so this is stage setting and part of the reason that the biblical writers are pointing out that Abram's wife is barren is because it's a real catastrophe for Abraham, for Sarah as well, that she's barren. And so it's showing the trouble that Abraham was in at the beginning of the story. And it's also. It's also see what happens as the story progresses is that Abraham, Abraham and Sarah are eventually granted his son, but it's way late in the story and they're very, very old by the time it happens and of course you're not going to be a father of nations without having a child, and so the the, the writers

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       who are attempting to make the case that if you forthrightly pursue that which God directs you to pursue, let's say that all things are possible. That's the idea and the narrative and you might say that's naive and you know it. It's not it. You think when you're naive, right, and then you dispense with that idea and then when you stop being the sort of person who dispenses with ideas, then you come to another place and that's the place where you think you have no idea what might be possible for you. If you, if you've got things together and pursued what you should pursue, you don't know how much what's impossible to you right now would become possible under those conditions. It's an unknown phenomena and like I've watched people who've put themselves together across time incrementally and continually and they become capable of things that are jaw, not only jaw, droppingly amazing, but also sometimes metaphysically impossible to understand and so we don't know the limits of human endeavor.

Speaker 3:          00:30:45       We truly don't, and it it's premature to put a cap on what it is that we are, what, what it is that we're capable of. And so you, you know, you're already something and maybe you're not so bad in your current configuration, but you may wonder if you did nothing for the next 30 years except put yourself together just exactly what would you be able to do and you might think, well, that's worth finding out. But of course that's, that's the adoption of responsibility. And one thing I've also learned over the years because I've been curious about this battle between meaning and nihilism. You know, and I mean I could see for a long while the rationale in nihilism and the power of the nihilistic argument, but it, it, it, it occurred to me across time that despite that the power of the nihilistic argument is more powerful than naive optimism, but it's not more powerful than the optimism that is not naive because the optimism that is not naive says it's self evident that the world is a place of suffering and that there are things to be done about that and it's self evident that people are flawed and that there's things to be done about that.

Speaker 3:          00:31:52       And then the non naive optimist says the suffering could be reduced and the insufficient c could be overcome if people oriented themselves properly and did what they were capable of doing. And I do not believe that that's deniable. I do. I do. I think that human potential is virtually limitless and that there's nothing, perhaps it's beyond our grasp before careful as individuals and as a society. And so I think that there's no reason for nihilism and there's no reason for hopelessness and, and there's no reason to bow down before evil because we're capable of so much more. And I think that you can easily, you know that first because you're not happy with who you are and you're ashamed and embarrassed about it as you should be. And you know it because if look out there, you see people who are capable of doing great things and you know that we're not giving it our all and still we're not doing so badly, you know? And so you might wonder if, if, if we devoted 90 percent of our effort to putting things right instead of 55 percent of our effort, or maybe even less than that, you might wonder just how well could things be put together. And I think that you can figure that out by starting with your room, by the way.

Speaker 3:          00:33:07       And the Lord said unto Abraham, and this is the, this is the opening of the story. Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show the. And this is one of those phrases where every clause is significant. Go somewhere you don't understand. That's the first thing. Get thee out of thy country. You know, back in the 19 twenties there was a whole slew of American writers who ended up as expatriates in Paris, hemingway among them, and who wrote the Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald, yes. And then a variety of others. It was very inexpensive in Paris at the time and part of their transformation into great literary figures was the fact that they were out of their country and now they could see what their country was because you can't see what your country is until you leave it.

Speaker 3:          00:33:56       So you have to go into the unknown and that's God's first command. Go into the unknown because you already know what you know and so and that's not enough unless you think you're enough. And if you're not enough and you don't think you're enough, then you have to go where you haven't been. And so that's the first commandment to Abraham. It's like, okay, that's a good one. That makes perfect sense. Go to where you don't know. Yes. And from my kindred will that. What does that mean? It means grow up, right? That's what it means. It means get away from your family enough so that you can establish your independence. And that isn't because there's something wrong with your family. Although perhaps there is, you know, as long as there is perhaps wrong with you, but it means get away. You know, I talked to people very frequently whose families have provided them with too much protection and they know it themselves and that means they're deprived of necessity.

Speaker 3:          00:34:47       You know, one of the things that you see in, in the United States for example, is that the children are first generation immigrants often do better than the, than the, than their children. And the reason for that is that the children are first generation immigrants, have necessity driving them. And you don't know how much you need necessity to drive you because maybe you're not very disciplined. And if a catastrophe doesn't immediately be fall, you, if you don't act forthrightly today, then maybe you'll never act forthrightly, right? Because the gap between your foolishness and the punishment is, is lengthened by your unearned wealth. And so you never grow up and learn and you have to get yourself away from your dependency in order to allow necessity to drive you forward. And that's to become independent and to become mature. And I think part of what's happening in our culture is that the, the, the force that's attacking the forthright movement forward of young men in particular is afraid of the power of man because it's confused about the distinction between power and authority and competence.

Speaker 3:          00:35:54       Like I know a man who's who has authority and competence has power as a byproduct, but the authority and competence, everything and, and, and people who can't understand that fail to make the distinction between power and authority of competence and they're afraid of power. And so they destroy authority and competence. And that's a terrible thing because we need authority and competence. What else is going to. What else is going to allow us to prevail? In the long run, and so you get away from your country and you get away from your kin and from your father's house, right? And you go out there and you establish yourself in the world. It's a call to adventure. That's what this the first lines in the Abrahamic story is a call to adventure. So great unto a land that I will show you. Well, you know, what does that mean?

Speaker 3:          00:36:47       You know? One of the things that I've been struck very hard by a number of writers, Carl Young, obviously among them, I mean he, he wrote things like Nisha, that if you understand them, they just break you into pieces and one of the things that young understood in the psychoanalysts understand it's one of the most terrifying elements of psychoanalytic thinking is very tightly allied with religious thinking, which is that you are not the master of your own house. There are spirits that dwelling within you, meaning you have a will and you can exercise a certain amount of conscious control over your being, but there are all sorts of things that occur within you that seem to be beyond your capacity to control your dreams. For example, that's a really good example. Are Your impulses. For example, you might, you might think of those as so foreign from you that they're not even.

Speaker 3:          00:37:37       You don't even want them to be part of you, but, but more subtly even. How about what you're interested in? What compels you? Like, where does that come from? Exactly. Because you can't. God, you can't conjure it up of your own accord. You know? So if you're a student in, you're taking difficult course, you might say to yourself, well, I need to sit down and study for three hours, but then you sit down and that is what happens. Your attention goes everywhere and you might say, well, whose attention is it? Then? If it goes everywhere because you say it's your attention, it's like, well, if it's your attention, maybe you will be able to control it, but you can't. And so then you might think, well jen and just exactly what the hell is controlling it. And you might say, well, it's random. It's, well, I better not be random.

Speaker 3:          00:38:20       I can tell you that that's. That happens to some degree in schizophrenia. There's an element of randomness in that. It's not random. It's driven by the action of phenomena that I think are best considered as something like subpersonalities or they'll even only a partial description. You can't make yourself interested in something. Interest manifests itself in grips you. That's a whole different thing. And so what is it that's gripping you and how do you conceptualize that? Is that a divine power? Well, it's divine as far as your concern because it grips you and you can't do anything about it. And so there's a calling in you towards what you're compelled by and what you're interested in. And sometimes that might be very dark and sometimes not, but you're compelled forward by your interest. And so and so the idea that what moves you away from your country and your father's house and the comforts of your childhood home is, is something that's beyond you.

Speaker 3:          00:39:20       And that you listened to in Harken to. That's exactly right. And you can say, well, I don't want to call it that God. It's like it doesn't matter what you call it. Exactly. It doesn't matter to what it is, what it's called. It still is, and if you don't listen to it, that's the other thing. If you don't listen to it, and I've been a clinician and talked to enough people now as old as I am, to know this. Absolutely. If you do not listen to that thing that beckons you forward, you will pay for it like you cannot possibly imagine. You'll have everything that's terrible about life in your life and nothing about it that's good and worse. You'll know that it was your fault and that you squandered what you could have had. So this is not only a calling forth, but a warning unto a land that I will show the and that's it, that I will show the that.

Speaker 3:          00:40:13       And you don't want to be too concrete about this. You know, there's all sorts of new territories that you can inhabit. If you. There's this abstract and conceptual territory of Gilda University and you study biology or you studied physics or or any discipline. You're in a territory, right? You're in the territory that all of the scholars have established, and then as you master the discipline, you move out beyond the established territory, into the unknown, and that's a new land, right? Maybe it's even a land of your enemies for that matter, but it's a new land to the frontier is always in front of you. And so you know when the earth was less inhabited than it is now. The frontier was the psychological frontier and the geographical frontier was the same thing and now they've separated to some degree because there's not so much geographical frontier, but there's the frontier is a place that never disappears and the land that's beyond the land that you know is always there.

Speaker 3:          00:41:03       And it's always where you should go. And all of that packed into these four phrases so well. So when I've been thinking about narrative, you look at the world through a story, you can't, you can't help it. And this story is what gives value to the world or or the stories, what you extract from the value of the world. You can look at it either way, you're somewhere and it's not good enough, right? That's the eternal human predicament. Wherever you are, isn't good enough. And to some degree that's actually a good thing because if it was good enough, well there's nothing for you to do. So it's actually maybe a good thing that it's insufficient. And that might be why sometimes having less iss is better than having more. I don't want to be a pollyanna about that. I mean, I know that there's deprivation that can reach to the point where it's no where it's completely counterproductive, but it isn't always the case that starting with little is you.

Speaker 3:          00:41:58       If you start with little, you start with more possibility. It's something like that. So you move from always from what's unbearable about the present to some better future. Right? And if you don't have that, then you have no, you have nothing but threatened and negative emotion. You have no positive emotion because the positive emotion is generated in the conception of the better future and then the evidence that you generate yourself, that you're moving towards it. That's where the positive and fulfilling meaning of life comes. So you want to set up this structure properly. It's very, very important and so what it means is that you want to be going somewhere that's good enough so that the going is worth the while and you can ask yourself that, and that's partly what we tried to build into the future authoring program, which is, well, we know what's wrong with life.

Speaker 3:          00:42:43       It's rife with suffering and insufficiency in deception and evil. It's all of that obviously. Okay, what would make the journey worthwhile? Or you can ask yourself that. It's like, alright, in order to bear up hundred this load, what is it that I would need to be striving to attain? And if you ask yourself that, that's to knock and the door will open. That's what that means. If you ask yourself that, then you will find an answer and you'll think you'll shrink away from it. You'll think, well, there's no way I could do that. It's like, well, you don't know what you could do. You don't know what's possible and you're not as much as you could be, and so god only knows what you could, what you could do and have and give if you sacrificed everything to it. And that's the reason that Abraham is constantly making sacrifices and it's archaic, right?

Speaker 3:          00:43:33       He's burning up like baby lambs, but like while they're alive, you know that something and they're valuable and that's something, it's you have to admit, even if you think about it as a modern person, that the act of sacrificing something might have some dramatic compulsion to it. You know, to go out into a flock and to take something that's new board and to cut its throat into bleed it into burn. It might be a way of indicating to yourself that you're actually serious about something and it isn't so obvious that we have rituals of seriousness like that now. And so it's not so obvious that we're actually serious about anything. And so maybe that's not such a good thing. And so maybe we shouldn't be thinking that these people were so archaic and primitive and superstitious. It's possible that they knew something that we don't.

Speaker 3:          00:44:17       It's certainly in the abrahamic stories. One of the things that maintains Abraham's covenant with God is his continual, a willingness to sacrifice it. It's so that sacrificial issue is so important because you are not committed to something unless you're willing to sacrifice for it. Commitment and sacrifice are the same thing and I think its borders on miraculous that those concepts are embedded into this narrative at the level of dramatic action. You know, instead of abstract explanation, people are acting this out and then the fundamental conception is so profound that it's really quite. It's quite inspiring and it's breathtaking really, when you understand what message is trying to be conveyed, you have to make sacrifices and what do you have to sacrifice? You have to sacrifice that which is most valuable to you currently that stopping you and God only knows what that is. It's certainly the worst of you.

Speaker 3:          00:45:11       It's certainly that and god only knows to what degree you're in love with the worst of you. So well, so you moved from the unbearable present to the ideal future and and you can't help that. You have to live in a structure like that. That's your house, that's another way of thinking about it and if you want to get your house in order and if you want it to be a place that you can live properly, then you have to plan the future. That is perfect. And then I think, well what does that mean? It means it's good for you. Right? And one of the things that I do all the time with my clinical and consulting clients is try to figure out what would be good for them, but we do more than that. We try to think, okay, well what, how can we set this up so it's really good for you and that all the side consequences of that are things that are good for other people.

Speaker 3:          00:46:04       And so because people are often also timid about trying to get something that's good for themselves because they feel that it's selfish or that they don't deserve it. So we set it up so that. Well, look, we're going to set it up so that it's plainly obvious that this will not harm the structure of the universe for you to have what you need and to do it in a way that's of benefit to other people. There's no downside to that and and so it's okay. It's okay if you reach out and take that. And one of the things that's interesting about the biblical stories, Abrahamic stories as well as the God doesn't really seem to be opposed to the success of the people that he's chosen. You know what happens to them as, as they progress through their journey, as they get larger flocks and they get more authority and they get, they get more, they get life more abundant.

Speaker 3:          00:46:50       That's what happens. It's God isn't, doesn't seem to be a miser in the old testament. It's like if you put in the effort and you and you accept the covenant and you make the sacrifices, then you get to be successful and maybe successful beyond your wildest dreams and that that's actually seems to be okay with God and that's pretty cool given that you know, that the general notion of Old Testament God is that all he's doing is casting out curses in death, you know, wherever he happens to wander. And I mean there's certainly no shortage of that, but. But again, it seems to me that that's very good news and that you also don't have to be perfect in order for to have that happen. And then the other thing, this is the issue about going into the unknown. It's like, well, if you leave your country and your kin and your father's house and you go out into a land that your intuition guides you to, you're going to undergo these radical transformations. This is a sacrificial transformation too because you're moving forthrightly and voluntarily into chaos. Right? And that's the same as the dragon fight. That's the hero's story. And what will happen there is that you will transform yourself, and so the call to an ideal is also the call to a sequence of deaths and rebirths that move you closer and closer to the ideal. And that's what that's what God is calling Abraham to do.

Speaker 3:          00:48:10       In the first sentence of this story, you see these things echoed

Speaker 3:          00:48:25       in the strangest places. And so these are stills that I took from Pinocchio and this little cricket. So he is this still small voice, right? That's the thing that calls to you. It's your conscious conscience in part, it's your intuition in part, and it's the thing that opens up the great book of the world, the great sacred book of the world. And that's what happens here, right? And the animators are at pains to show you that it's a leather bound book with guilt lettering. It's a valuable book and it's something that's quiet that's showing it to you, right? You have to meditate. Let's say you have to be somewhere where the world isn't drowning you out in order to understand how to open this, to listen to that voice that tells you where you should go with what you should do next,

Speaker 3:          00:49:06       and then what happens is that something beckons to you in the night. It's a star, right? It's something that transcends the horizon. It's, it's glitters, it's brilliant. It's not day to day it. It's something that's beyond you. It's something that represents a transcendent ideal and that makes it manifest to you. If you're quiet enough to listen and that's what you wish upon so strangely, right, and people do that they wish upon a star, they teach their children that and they don't know why. What do you mean you wish upon a star? What in the world does that mean? It means you lift your eyes to the heavens and make a pact with the transcendent and then your and then what your heart's desire will come to you. That's what it means and you think, well, that's so. That's not naive. It's the most sophisticated thing that you can know and it's the birth of the hero, right? Because that's the. That's the Nativity star obviously, and this is where it takes place. It's just

Speaker 3:          00:50:07       anywhere and the person who is just a carpenter and a toy maker, but that's pretty good at carpenter. If you're a deceitful carpenter than your house falls down and if you're a toy maker then you love children. It's a good start. You know? So. So Japan who lives in this little, it's, it's, it's a, it's not a grand house, it's, it's just an everyday house, but everything that's happening and it is good and so that means it's a palace because everything in it is how that's happening is good. There's a saying and I don't remember where it comes from. Then it's better to have bread and water in peace than a feast in conflict. And like that's not a saying, that's just the starkest possible description of the truth because there's nothing worse than eating a grande meal with people you hate and despise that are at each other's throats.

Speaker 3:          00:50:53       It's much better to have bread and water in peace. It's, it's not, it's, it's just clearheaded analysis of the structure of the world to say things like that, and so the magical transformation can happen in the most mundane of places because, and the reason for that is that the mundane nature of places is an illusion because every place is the potential birthplace of the Kingdom of God. That's the case and so Japan, he's a good guy. He has a kitten. The kitten likes them. He makes puppets and he's humble person and he knows that compared to the ideal that he's attempting to subscribe to, that he's. He's not a based before it or anything like that. He's not despicable in relationship to it, but the reason he's on his knees is because the thing he's pointing at is above him. You know, if he. It wouldn't be the right aim if it wasn't above him and so the fact that he's on his knees so to speak, is only an indication that his aim is proper because you should be on your knees to something that you actually admire.

Speaker 3:          00:52:01       And if you don't feel like being on your knees in front of it, then perhaps you don't actually admire it, and then that means you haven't got the stage set properly. It could be. It should be something that fills you with all your aim should, should be add something that fills you with all because what? Why do something else while perhaps because it's easy and perhaps because it's malevolent and all of those things, but, but those are no answer to the problems that beset you. They just make things worse and that's clear. And so then Japan will have as having made his packed his covenant, just like Abraham, he falls into a dream, right? He falls into a dream and the rest of the movie actually takes place in a dream. And it's a dream. It's the dream within which transformation takes place and that's laid out, at least in part time stops in, in the Pinocchio Story and everything happens to Pinocchio in some sense in Atlanta, that's outside of normal time.

Speaker 3:          00:52:53       And that's, that's the infinite archetipal space. And that's a real place. That's a real place. The infinite and the finite coexist and most of the time we're in the place of the finite, but that doesn't mean that the place of infinite doesn't exist. It just means that we can't get access to it. We just get intimations of it. From time to time, you know when things are going perfectly well for you on those rare occasions where everything comes together for the brief moment, you inhabit that divine place and you have some sense of what your life could be like if you organized it from smallest element to the largest element and that's a place that you can inhabit, if not forever, in a manner that at least felt like forever.

Speaker 3:          00:53:42       Well, because of Japan was decisioned, the transcendent manifests itself. It takes the form of the blue fairy here. That's the positive element of nature, right? So we could say, well, nature, it's not so clear that she's on your side, right? She's the Red Queen in Alice in wonderland who runs around screaming. When you go down the rabbit hole, she runs around screaming off with their heads and who says, in my kingdom, you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place. That's mother nature, but then we might say, well, how do we know that Mother Nature's attitude towards you isn't negative because your attitude towards things isn't proper and that's what this film attempts to indicate. The idea is that if you aim properly, then nature aligns itself behind you. Now it also a raise itself in front of you, perhaps even as an antagonist, but the power that it it, it provides you with from within might be sufficient to overcome it from without.

Speaker 3:          00:54:43       And I think that I think that the clinical evidence is clear about that because one of the things that we do know is that if you take people who are confronting terrible things and shrinking from them and you teach them how to structure their behavior so that they can advance with courage. Everything works better for them. Their fears decrease and their character grows and so there might be enough of nature within us to help us withstand the nature that's outside of us and it depends, at least to some degree on how it is that we orient ourselves in the world to some to some unknowable degree.

Speaker 5:          00:55:26       Now

Speaker 3:          00:55:28       Japan warrants an autonomous individual as a son

Speaker 3:          00:55:34       and that's also something that makes him a great person because autonomous individuals have their own will and if you're a tyrant, it's the last thing that you're going to want and if you're the tyrant who's jealous of his son, it's even more so the last thing you're ever going to want and so to aim high and to want the development of the autonomous individual or the same thing, and I would say that's the core story in some sense of of Western culture is to aim high and to develop the autonomous individual or the same thing and that's what happens in Pinocchio. That's what happens in the story of Abraham and the transformation takes place. The Magical Transformation and the Pinocchio Story. One of the things that's so interesting about it, and this is part of it's mythological substructure from the scientific perspective, there's only two determining forces with regards to the destiny of the individual.

Speaker 3:          00:56:25       There's nature, deterministic and culture, deterministic and then scholars wrangle about which of those is the greater force, but in mythological stories there's always a third element. The third element is something like autonomous consciousness and there's no place for autonomous consciousness in the deterministic story of nature and culture, but we all act as if autonomy is consciousness, is the primary reality and the biblical stories are predicated on the idea that autonomous consciousness is what gives rise to the world and I don't think that we're in a position to presume that that is necessarily an error, and so what that means is to aim high and to develop the autonomous individual is six is simultaneously the decision to formulate an allegiance with the conscious power that brings being into existence and that all takes place inside this little puppet and then he has his adventures, right? He's, he's, he's still half jackass and half deceptive, but he's still. Despite that, despite all the errors, he has the capacity to move forward and to transform into something to transform himself into something that can be properly considered described as a true son of God and that's the right aim

Speaker 3:          00:57:51       and it works like this. As far as I can tell. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:57:55       when I talked to people about doing the future authoring program, they often put it off and it's not surprising because it's hard and, and be, but it's more than that. They think, well, I don't know how to write. I'm going to do a bad job. I don't really like assignments. I'm going to have to do it perfectly. I need to wait until I have enough time and like one of those is enough to stop you cold and all five of them you're just done. And so I tell people do it haphazardly, a tiny bit at a time and badly because you can do that. I tell my students when they're doing their thesis master's thesis, write a really bad first draft and then we have a little conversation about that because they don't think. I mean that because it sounds like a cliche in some sense. It's not a cliche. It's not a cliche at all. It means

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       you're a terrible writer, but, but if someone put a gun to your head and said, you have to have your a hundred page thesis done by next Monday, or I'll shoot you, but I don't care how terrible it is, you would sit down and write it and the thing is then you have it right then, then you have something and then you can fix it. You can iterate and fix it. That bad first draft. That's the most valuable thing, and so that's what you need. You need a bad first draft of yourself and there's. There's an idea in the young developed about the trickster and the gesture, the comedian, right? That the trickster is the precursor to the savior and that's one of the things I learned from young that was just. It's so unlikely you'd never think that it's so amazing that that might be the case, but the, the, the, the satirical and the erotic and the and the troublemaker that the comedian, the fool, the fool is the precursor to the savior.

Speaker 3:          00:59:39       Why? Because you're a fool when you start something new and so if you're not willing to be a fool, then you'll never start anything new, and if you never started anything new, then you won't develop. And so the willingness to be a fool is the precursor to transformation and that's the same as humility. And so if you're going to write your destiny, you can do a bad first job. You're going to get smarter as you move forward. That's the thing is that so something beckons to you. That's what happens here. Maybe the star that you pedal wished on was the wrong damn star, but at least it was a star, right? At least it was in the sky. At least it moved him forward and so you say in your life or something grips you and fills you with interest and you think, well, should I do that?

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       And the answer is, if not that, then something. What if it's a mistake? It's a mistake. Rest assured, what do you know? You're going to stumble around, right? And what's going to happen is this, you're going to move to, you're going to not stay in spaces, you're not going to wander around in circles. And I see people like that. They said, well, I never knew what to do, and now I'm 40 so that's not so good. That's not so good. And you might say, well, and there is literature to that suggests that people are a lot more unhappy when they look back in their lives about the things they didn't do than they are about the mistakes they made while they were doing things. And so that's really worth thinking about too because there's redemptive mistakes and a redemptive mistake would be a mistake that you make when you go out and try to do something.

Speaker 3:          01:01:10       You know, you actually, you think, okay, I'm going to try to do this. When you're not good at it, you make a bunch of mistakes. It's like, what's the consequence if you pay attention is you're not quite so stupid anymore. That's the thing is you've been informed by your, by the results of your errors, and so what happens is you, you follow the beacon, you follow the light and you're blind so you don't know where the light is. It's dimly apprehended only and you're afraid to follow it, but you decided to take some stumbling steps towards it and as you take stumbling steps towards it, you become illuminated and enlightened and informed because of the nature of your experience, because you're pushing yourself beyond where you are and you're going into the country that you have not yet been in and you learn something, and so what happens then is the star moves.

Speaker 3:          01:01:56       You move 10 feet towards it and you think, no, that's not right. I didn't get it right. It isn't there. It's actually there, and so then you, you see it somewhere else and you shift yourself slightly and you move forward and that's what happens is that you continue as you changed the thing that guides you forward, moves, right? It's like God in in the, in the desert, in Egypt, the pillar of light that you're following gets moving. It's not a permanent thing. You move towards it, it moves away. It guides you forward and so you say, well, is what I'm aiming at paradise itself. And the answer to that is no, because what do you know? You see you couldn't see paradise if it was right in front of you, but you might get a glimmer of it and so you move towards it and you grow and then the next time you open your eyes you see a little bit more clearly and that's what happens is that just happens over and over, right? It keeps moving

Speaker 3:          01:02:54       and so you move like this, but the thing that's so cool is that all those zigs and zags you say on each of those Zags, zigs is a catastrophe. I hit a wall, my God, and then I had to die a little bit and I barely got back up. It's a phoenix transformation at each, at each turn, and it's painful, but the thing is is that even though you've. You've traveled 20 miles, let's say on that road, and you've only moved three miles forward. You've moved three miles forward instead of falling backwards, because that's the thing too is that if you stand still, you fall backwards. You cannot stand still because the world moves away from you. If you stand still and there's no status, there's only backwards and so if you're not moving backward, back, forwards, then you're moving backwards and that's more more of the underlying truth of the matthew principle to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing. Everything will be taken. It's a warning. Do not stay in one place. Well as you zig and zag, maybe the maybe the cataclysm of each transformation starts to lessen. There's not so much of you that has to die with every mistake

Speaker 3:          01:04:16       and maybe you end up oriented at least reasonably properly, and if you were sensible, that would have been your trip, but it wasn't right. It's that and perhaps it's a lot worse, did not. Perhaps there's no shortage of backtracking, but it doesn't matter because as you stumble forward, you, you illuminated and inform yourself, and perhaps that's partly because the world is made of information and if you encounter it and tangle with it than it informs you and then you become informed and then your information and then you're ready, and so God says to Abraham, I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing. That's, that's a good offer. Fundamentally, I mean it. It means

Speaker 3:          01:05:15       what does it mean to to be made a great nation of? Well, perhaps it has something to do directly with your descendants, but I don't think it's just that you know, is if you're a force for good in the world, then that radiates out from you and if you're good enough, it's difficult to say how much of an impact on things you could have. You know Dostoevsky, who was a very crazy person, partly because of his epilepsy, he said, a man is not only responsible for everything he does, but for everything that everyone else does, and you think, well, no, no, no, and yes, sometimes no. Sometimes that's what you think of your cataclysmic, cataclysmic, really depressed, right, is that your sins are so egregious that they're unforgivable and that in some manner you're at, you're at fault for everything that's terrible with the world, but there's actually truth in that and there's actually redemptive truth in that is that things wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so if you weren't so far from what you could be, and that's terribly pessimistic because it's all on you, man, but it's terribly optimistic because God, there's a lot of things that you could do and if you're crying out for something to do, then that's the best news you could possibly have.

Speaker 3:          01:06:34       It's like things aren't so good, but neither are you. So if you stopped doing the things that you knew to be destructive, which is the right place to start. You know, if you're going to clean up your room, what do you do first while you just get rid of the mess, you know when you know what no one has to come in and tell you. Hopefully what's the worst mass? It's just it announces itself to you and you can certainly know yourself and this is a very easy meditative exercise to sit down and think, okay, I'm doing one thing really stupidly that I should stop doing. It's like, how long is it going to take you to figure out what that is? It's about two seconds, right? You've known it forever. Then you could even make it less demanding. You could say, there was some stupid things that I'm doing that I know are stupid and wrong that I could stop doing that I would stop doing, and then you can just start with that and you can just do that and maybe it's just a little thing.

Speaker 3:          01:07:30       Although it's not because it's, it's a. it's a step forward on the proper voyage. It's not a small thing and you think, well, what would happen? You could say, let's do this for a year or even a month, just try not to do things, you know, to be stupid and wrong for a month. And that means not to say things you know, to be stupid and wrong as well. Maybe that's the most important thing. Just do it as an experiment, see what happens. And it's so fun because I have people writing to me from all over the world who are saying they're doing that. They're saying, well, you know, I cleaned up my room and, and then I stopped saying stupid things and my God, it's like things are way better. It's like who would have guessed it? You know? And so it's low hanging fruit man, because there's, that's the other thing. If there's a lot of things wrong with you, then it's really easy to start fixing it. You know, you've got so much. There's so much territory that you can inhabit. I will make of thee a great nation. I will bless thee. That's good. I mean the whole nation thing that's positive, but to have God on your side, that's you know, you might want that when things get rough, that would be good and make their name great and thou shalt be a blessing. Wonderful. That's a good deal, and I will bless them that bless thee. That's good too, and curse him that curses thee and in these shallow families of the earth, be blessed.

Speaker 3:          01:08:54       That's something that's something that wouldn't be something. If you could wake up and your day was composed in part of people thanking you for all the good things you've done in the world, would that be good?

Speaker 3:          01:09:12       It's not impossible for that to happen. So Abraham departed. Yes. As the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abraham was 70 and five years when he departed out of her own. That's all old now. Abraham lives a long time, but this is also part of the story. So he has a wife who can't have children. He has nothing. Obviously. He's been hanging around. Dad's shocked for a little too long given that he's 75, right? It's time. It's time to get on the fire, lit underneath him a bit and so he's not got much going for him, but he still decides to to move forward and I've seen this too, you know, like if you don't have your destiny in hand by your time you're 30, it's, it's rough. You start hurting and if you don't have your destiny in hand by the time you're 40, then you really start hurting and forties, a real fork in the road.

Speaker 3:          01:10:06       The fork in the road. That's always where you meet the devil by the way. And that's because every time you have to make a decision, the possibility of evil beckons. That's why that is. I had a friend, I've told you a little about him and he killed himself just after 40. No, he had had a book published with a very small press. He was quite a good writer, but he could not get himself together and it hit him too hard at 40. And I'm not saying that it's hopeless at 40. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that partly because of these verses, but also partly because of what I've seen in my clinical practice. I've had people come to me who have had very chaotic and the ill spent lives, let's say, who were in that neighborhood of age and and it's true for people who are older as well, who then decided to make a real effort and to try to make where they were better. You know, instead of being bitter about where they weren't because that's the bitterness that really does you, when it's really not good. It's the opposite of gratitude. It's, it's, it's the manifestation of resentment that makes you malevolent. It's very, very bad to be better. It's not, it's not. It's hell to be bitter,

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       and if you're 40 and you're not successful, then you have to accept your lot and you have to start to improve what's right in front of you and if you do that, it doesn't take very long. It's quite interesting to watch people. Things can be a lot better in six months and they can be way better in two years. It's a struggle, uphill struggle, but it's by no means impossible and I don't know again what the limit of that is. I suppose it depends on the degree to some degree on the degree of your commitment, but anyway, so aber, it's another indication of the real validity of this story. God isn't setting this up to be easy, right? Abraham was old and he and and his and his wife is old too, and more than that, she's barren. How is he going to be the father of nations? How is he going to be successful? Well, the initial departure point is insufficient, radically insufficient, and, and that's very inspiring because it means that you can start from where you are.

Speaker 4:          01:12:12       So Abraham departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abraham was 75 years old when he departed out of her around and Abraham took Sarah, his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered. And you know, he has a relationship with law, right? And he doesn't have his own son, but he, his brother died and so he takes his nephew as his son that's grateful, you know, did he could be very angry and have nothing to do with them because he didn't get his own son. But that isn't, that isn't what happens is he's offered to substitute let's say, and he accepts it and so good for him, you know? And that's. And that's also something that I've seen that characterize as people who can make the best of a bad lot is they don't get exactly what they want, but something comes along that offers possibilities that are sufficient perhaps if exploited properly, and they open their heart and welcomed them in instead of rejecting them in bitterness. And so that's a good thing. And that's part of Abraham's character. And Abraham took Sarah, his wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and all the souls that they had gotten in her. And, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan into exile, let's say, and into the land of Canaan. They came.

Speaker 4:          01:13:26       And that's another repetition of the transformation story, right? You have to go to a land where you're not welcome

Speaker 4:          01:13:36       an apron pass through the land unto the place of Chm onto the plane of Maura and the Canaanite was then in the land and the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto thy seed, I will give you this land. And there he built an altar to the Lord who appeared unto him and he removed from thence onto a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent having Bethel on the west and high on the east. And there he built an altar unto the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord. Now we don't understand these rituals precisely. You know, I don't know if the people who did this engaged in a meditative ritual was not the idea that you take something of value. You do this, you, you undertake this dramatic transformation of a life and death transformation. And is that an aid to meditation?

Speaker 4:          01:14:19       And what do you do? Do you sit down and think? Do you, do you pray? Pray being to ask, you know, to what do I do next? How do I orient myself in the world as a useful exercise to do that too. I think it's something that people could do every morning. I think it's useful to sit down and think, okay, what's the most important thing I should do today? What I have an array of things that call to me to be done, some of which I will do with joy and some of which I will bear as responsibilities, but they array themselves in front of me and what should I attend to first? Well, do you ask or do you decide and it seems to me when I do it because I do it all the time. I do it every morning. I try to sit down and think, okay, I've got things that I would like to do and things that call to me out of necessity, what do I do first?

Speaker 4:          01:15:09       And it's not so much a decision as it is a question and I don't know what I'm calling on. It's I'm calling on my capacity to think I suppose, but that's not my capacity exactly. I, I can, I can commune with whatever provides the answers and I can think that that's me thinking, but, and now it isn't that I believe that. I can't think. I do believe that I can consciously think, but that's not the same as calling for inspiration. It's not the same process. Just like a dream is not conscious thinking. It's something that happens to you and that kind of inspiration is also something that happens to you because I asked myself, well, what's the most important thing I could do next? And then I have an answer to that, but it isn't because I decided exactly. I've decided that I'll do it, whatever it is and that I want to know what it is.

Speaker 4:          01:15:57       Those are the decisions, but. But there's an involuntary aspect to the sorting that occurs and that's the psychological equivalent I suppose to this. And I guess the sacrifice is when I feel that I will do whatever it is that calls to be done. Then I don't do the other things that I might want to do. And that's a sacrifice. It's to me it's the proper sacrifice because my sense is that things don't go properly unless you do what's most important and if I want things to go properly and I do because I've had my taste of things not going properly, I want things to go properly and so then it's not so difficult to do what's necessary to to do what makes things go properly under those circumstances and it's hardly. See, this is partly why the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is embedded in the abrahamic stories, I think because that's an apocalyptic story, right? If things go badly enough, the whole city is destroyed. Okay, and then and

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       the reason it goes badly, it's because the people in the city do not behave properly and the people in the city might be you. And so if you're not behaving properly, then you go and so does the city and maybe you don't want. Maybe you do want that, but maybe you don't want that and if you don't want that, then maybe. And you know that if you don't do things property, then it's Un the city. If you actually know that, then maybe that terrifies you badly enough so that you're willing to make the sacrifice to do the right things instead of the impulsive things that you might otherwise want to do. You know, I learned from Viktor Frankl in from Carl Yogan, from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and for many of the people whose works on the Holocaust that I read and on the catastrophes in the Soviet Union, and the people who'd studied most deeply always came to the same conclusion. The state became corrupted because each individual allowed themselves to be corrupted or perhaps participated joyfully in the process of being corrupted. And the consequence of that was the end of the world. And so what that means is that if you don't behave properly, then you bring about the end of the world and maybe you think, well, that's only the end of your world. Fair enough. Or maybe it's the only the end of your family's world. Know. Which I suppose might give you some pause, but there's more to it than that because you're connected to everyone else and what you do that isn't good

Speaker 3:          01:18:45       distributes itself and all the things you don't do that could be good take away from the whole. And so if you know that, and I do think you know that if you take it seriously, because if you look at, if you look at the historical events, the cataclysmic events of the 20th century, seriously, I do not think that you can fail to come to that conclusion. And Abraham journeyed going on still towards the south.

Speaker 3:          01:19:20       That's interesting because to go south means to go downhill to it's not good to go south. It's colloquial for going to where you shouldn't go. And so this is what happens to Abraham. You know, he, his accent is preceded by a descent. And that's very common in life I would say. And so it. So the redemptive element of this narrative is that if the covenant is constructed properly, so it's an arc, which is your decision to align yourself with God for all intents and purposes. Then even the journey south can be part of a broader journey upward and there was a famine in the land. That's mother nature failing to cooperate.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       I mean, that's got to be pretty disheartening for Abraham, don't you think? Because he finally gets it together when he's 75 to leave and then you know, because God says, well, let's get going and, and so the first place he goes, everyone's starving to death. It's like, you know, you might think about that as a test of faith, wouldn't you say? But he keeps going, and then what happens? Well, he has to go to Egypt so great. He goes, where? He's starving, where everyone's starving, and then to get away from where everyone's starving, he goes to a tyranny. So the whole beginning of the story's not particularly auspicious, and Abraham went down into Egypt to soldier in there for the famine was grievous in the land. It's a repetition of the same idea again. There's downhill voyage out into chaos, right? It's repeated over and over that the beginning of Abraham's journey is basically a secrets of, of, of experiences, of exile, chaos, tyranny, and catastrophe. While you should be able to relate to that, you know how hard it is to get things together. You know, you go out to do what you're supposed to do, say, and there's your be set by the intransigence of the world and failure. Well, so what are you supposed to do about that? Well,

Speaker 4:          01:21:23       maintain your faith in the good and continuing to move forward. That's the idea. And part of that, even if even if you don't buy the metaphor, it's like what are you going to do instead? That won't make it worse. So even if there, if it isn't an APP that you're pursuing your at least for stalling the transformation of the chaos into your, of your life, into sheer hell. And that can certainly happen. You know, you see people who are having a terrible time and then you see people who are having a terrible time who were also inhale and it's a lot better to just have a terrible time than to have a terrible time and be in hell at the same time.

Speaker 4:          01:22:05       And it came to pass when he was come to near to enter into Egypt that he said unto [inaudible] wife, behold, now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon, therefore it shall come to pass. When the Egyptians cells see the, that they shall say, this is his wife and they will kill me, but they will save the alive. So look, I mean Abraham, Abraham is really having a rough time. He's a failure, right? I mean, he's wandering around through the land of starvation. Now he's going to go be a cause. I slave in Egypt, he has this incredibly attractive wife and all he can look forward to is the fact that the most successful man in Egypt, the Pharaoh will take her from him. So he's got the whole embitterment thing pretty much nailed down as far as I can tell. And this is when he makes one of his errors, let's say. And one of the areas that humanizes him. Say, I pray thee that thou art my sister. Then it may be well for me for my sake and my soul shall live because of the.

Speaker 4:          01:23:04       And it to pass that when Abraham was coming to Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. The prince is also a pharaoh saw her and commended her before Pharaoh and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house and he and treated Abraham well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen and he asked his men, servants and maid servants she asses and camels. So actually things worked out pretty well for, for Abraham, despite his deceit. Right? Which is quite interesting. And I guess it's because if the overarching structure is solid, something like that, it's something like that, then then errors can still be forgiven to, to speak about it from a metaphorical perspective. And the Lord Plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarah Abraham's wife. While it doesn't seem very fair, but because the pharaoh didn't know, but, but it's not the right way to look at it the right way to look at it.

Speaker 4:          01:23:59       See, there's a story later in the, in the Bible about David and David. David could be a pretty bad guy, you know, so one of the things he does is when he becomes king, he, he's in his castle and he's looking over the city and he sees a woman nude bathing nude, sunbathing nude on a, on a, on a roof out on the city, and he's smitten by her, floored by her, and he has inquiries made about who she is, her name is Bathsheba, and he finds out who her husband is and her husband actually happens to be a general in his army and he arranges for that generally be put at the thick of the battle and killed. And then he takes Bathsheba. So and, and, and the Lord is not pleased by that. Let's put it that way. And that's interesting. You know, it's an interesting story because you might say, well why can't the king do whatever the hell he wants?

Speaker 4:          01:25:02       Like seriously, he, he's the king, he's not. And he's not like the prime minister or the president, right? He, he's the king. And so you might say, well, why is the king subject to any rules whatsoever? What's the rationale for the king being subject to rules? Well, the rationality emerges in these stories is there are social strictures that are such that even if the ruler of the land transgresses against them, there will be hell to pay and that's continually presented over and over in the biblical stories and it's a natural law sort of ideas that there are. There are intrinsic rules to the game of social human being and if you and maybe intrinsic rules to the to the natural state of human being, you break those rules consciously or unconsciously at your absolute peril and not only at your apparel but at the peril of the state and it doesn't matter who you are and so I would say this actually an indication of God being fair rather than being unfair because the rule here is pharaoh or not. You don't get to take someone else's wife and the ignorance is no excuse. Now you might say that's a little bit harsh and perhaps it is a little bit harsh, but it's not without merit. The idea is not without merit, and of course Abraham is

Speaker 4:          01:26:26       complicit in this. Despite that he is successful and Farrell called Abraham and said, what is this that thou has done unto me? Why did so now tell me that she was very wife? Why said Thou you? She is my sister. I might've taken her to me to wife. Now, therefore, behold thy wife take her and go thy way, and Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent them away and his wife and all that he had and Abraham went out of Egypt. He and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south. And Abraham was very rich in cattle, in silver and in gold. And so what's interesting, you know, Abraham, he, he goes to the place of famine and then he goes to the, to this place of territory and then he, he lies and then he almost loses his wife, but because he goes,

Speaker 4:          01:27:17       things work out for him and so hooray for that. And he went on his journeys from the south. Even the best. I went to the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethel and high, under the place of the altar. So he makes another sacrifice which he had made there at the first and there Abraham called on the name of the Lord. Well, so he's had an adventure, right? He's, he's, he's, he's finished his journey. And, and so there's a culminating point in this narrative and now he doesn't know what to do. He's, he's left the place, he's out. He doesn't know what to do. So it's time to build an altar and make a sacrifice and figure out and to ask for divine guidance once again to figure out, okay, well I'm done that been there, done that. What's next? And the question is asked, seriously, and this is something to consider if you want to know what to do, ask seriously and say, I'm willing to see Abraham sacrifices a life to his vow. Well, so what do you do? Well, you don't sacrifice an animal. You don't. You don't make a blood sacrifice. You do it psychologically. You say, I'm going to sacrifice my life to this aim.

Speaker 4:          01:28:25       That's what you do. If you're serious, what do I do next? Well, I'm going to sacrifice my life to this aim. What is it that I should do that's worth sacrificing my life too? That's a serious question. Well, maybe that's the sort of question that people don't ask because they're afraid of the seriousness of the question and the and the what, the magnitude of the potential answer. Do you really want to know what you should do that would be worth sacrificing your life too? Well, the answer is yes because it's worth it, but the answer is also no because really it's your life. You know what? If you're wrong and you're probably,

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       but maybe that doesn't matter, maybe it doesn't matter because maybe the rightness is in the process and not in the naughty, in the decision, right? Because it's not. It's the beginning of a sequence of decisions as we've already pointed out unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there Abraham called on the name of the Lord and Lord also and lot also, which went with Abraham. Abraham had flocks and herds and tents, and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a strife between the herdman of Abram's cattle. The cowboys and the Herdman have launched council and the Canaanite in the parasite dwelled in the land. Well, and that's interesting too, because you know, Abrams having a pretty good time of it now, right?

Speaker 3:          01:29:44       He's out of starvation. Hey, that's good. He's out of the tyranny now. He's kind of wealthy and then the story flips on him. He's wealthy and now a bad thing happens to them, right? It's got all this wealth and so does his nephew and now they can't get along because they have too much stuff. So that's quite comical as well. I think that's a comic interlude here. Now they handle it properly and Abraham said unto lot, let there be no strife. I pray thee between me and the in between my herdman and I heard because we're brothers is not the whole land before the separate thyself. I pray thee from me. If you'll take the left, then I'll take the right or if you depart to the right, then I'll go to the left. So basically they sit down and say, well, you know, one of us has got to get out of town and it can be one or the other.

Speaker 3:          01:30:29       It doesn't really matter. We can flip a coin here, but we have to. We have to separate. And so they do it amicably and lot lifted up his eyes and looked at all of the plain of Jordan that it was well watered everywhere. So that's an intimation of Eden, right? Because you remember eating means well watered place before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt. As the outcome is done to soar. So interesting. You get four shout and we can hear again, right? So lot and Abraham are making the decision about where to go and and lot looks out and sees a reasonable place, but then this warning comes up that there's a. there's a city out there, there's a place out there where things are not going to go well. Things are being done badly and things are not going to go well.

Speaker 3:          01:31:16       Then lot chosen mold the plaintiff, Jordan and lot journey the eastern, they separated themselves. The one from the other Abraham dwelled in the land of Canaan in law dwell in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom, but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly. Now the word sin, I've mentioned this to you before. I think it's an interesting word. It's. It's the derivation of an archery term in my understanding of its derivation and it the Greek word was Hamartia and Hamartia is an archery term, which means to miss the Bullseye and you think it's worth thinking about that metaphorically because you've got to think about all the ways that you could miss the Bullseye, right? You close your eyes. That's very common. You could not lift up the damn bow and Arrow to begin with. You could face the wrong way.

Speaker 3:          01:32:02       You could be unskilled in your aim, but I have and I also like the, the, the archery metaphor because human beings are built on a hunting platform, right? And we always aim at things were things that were were ballistic creatures on a trajectory always, and we're always aiming at something. We're always aiming at the mark and which is of course what you do when you hunt, right? Because you have to hit the mark precisely. And that's what we're like. And so what we're like that psychologically we have to aim at something and then move towards it. And, and so to sin is to miss the mark, is to, is to miss the Bullseye, to fail, to take aim, to aim badly dame carelessly, or to not aim at all. And that says, well, that's, that's like a sin of a mission. That's to not do. And then to be wicked is to aim at what you know you shouldn't. A mad. And again, I don't, I don't think of that as an external morality precisely. I think that you can read the entire biblical narrative again from a psychological perspective and say, we're not talking about external codes of conduct here, although we could. We're not. The wickedness that's being described is

Speaker 3:          01:33:12       the act of you doing something that you know to be wrong, period, you know, and you may do something you don't know if it's wrong or not. That isn't a sort of thing that we're talking about and we're not talking about the things that you do that are right are there that other people think are wrong. We're not talking about those either. We're talking about those things that you consciously do, although you know them to be wrong yourself, and that's the things that seem to get people into the most trouble in these stories and I believe that to be the case. I think that's very accurate. Psychologically, it's amazing because I see this all the time. If you do something wrong and because you're ignorant, you don't know better and it doesn't go well for you, that's the case, but if you do something wrong and you know it's wrong, the punishment is is manifold and I think the reason for that. I think the reason for that is because that makes you cane. It means you betray your own ideal, right? If you just don't know, well, you haven't been trained, your ideal, you're just not together, you maybe you're even willfully blind, but if you do something you know to be wrong, then you've betrayed your own ideal and that lands you. Cain says to God, once Kayden destroys able, he says, I cannot bear my punishment,

Speaker 3:          01:34:22       and the Lord said unto Abraham, after that lot was separated from lift up, now look upward and look from the place where they'll are northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee. I will give it and the seed forever, and then we'll make those seat as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth than shell, all thy seed be numbered. Arise, walk through the land and the length of it and the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee

Speaker 4:          01:34:56       in the Cathedral. At short, I can't say that properly because my French is nonexistent. So a cathedral is a cross and that transformation takes place at the crux of the cross, which is exactly right because the the transformation takes place at the point of maximal suffering and the cathedral is designed to indicate that right symbolically. Now

Speaker 4:          01:35:27       what happens in a religious ceremony is also a journey and it's a journey in some senses to the holy city, and then that's also played out in the idea of pilgrimage, right? Because you go to the holy city, actually, you go to Jerusalem or wherever it is that you think the holy city is. You go there and that takes you out of your country and away from your kid and away from your family into the strange land. And as you make the journey, you transform and when you come back, you're not the same. That's the Hobbit, right? That's the story of the hobbit. But let's say you can't afford to go on a pilgrimage. So you go to the cathedral at chart and there's a huge maze on the ground and it's the world north, west, south and east, just as God describes here. So it's laid out and you enter the maize at one side and in the middle is a stone pattern that looks like a flower and it's. It's the place where being wells fourth and it's at the center of the Cathedral,

Speaker 4:          01:36:24       and what that means is that if you accept your suffering, then you move to the place where the spirit of being wells fourth, that's what that means, and so you enter the the maze and you walk and it's divided into quadrants and you walk one quadrant completely and then the main pathway takes you into the next quadrant and you walked that completely and then it takes you to the third one and the fourth one. And then when you walk the maze completely everywhere. When you've gone everywhere in the world, north, south, east and west, where you've. When you've traversed the territory completely, then you come to the center and then it's yours. And that's what this is. So I've noticed when I've been renovating houses, I'd like to do that. I paid a lot of attention to the psychological process of house renovation because I learned from young that you said this, this is something man. He said because he was. He was talking about the stages of integration, psychological integration, and he looked beyond piaget. I would say, um, although piaget looked very far, he said, here, here's a conjunction. You have to get your rationality on your emotion together. That's a male, female conjunction, symbolically speaking, male rationality, female emotionality. You want to bring those together so that they're oriented in the same direction. Your emotions in your rationale will be served the same purpose, so then you're unified in mind and spirit, let's say, but that's sort of good enough. Once you've got that together, then there's a boat. You have a body, and then that's

Speaker 3:          01:37:55       a male female conjunction again, a divine conjunction, the recreation of Adam before his division into female and male, and the reconstruction of the androgynous Christ that all that, all those ideas are linked together. So now you have your emotion and your rationality moving in the same direction, but you're not acting it out. So now you have to unite that abstract part of you with your body and start acting out what you think and feel, and that's the next conjunction, but it's not the last one. The last conjunction is when you realize that there is no distinction between you and your experience there the same thing and so then when you put together your house, you're putting together yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:38:41       So I've noticed when I've lived in places rented or owned, didn't matter. Then if there were part of the place, if there was a part of the place that I hadn't attended to, whatever that might mean, it might meant cleaned. It might've meant fixed, but it certainly meant at least thoroughly investigated. Then that was chaos. It was like it was. It was like the desert. That part that's, that's a way of thinking about it. It wasn't mine. Even if I owned it wasn't mine. I had to interact with it before it became mine and I had to interact with it and I had to put it in order and then it became mine and then. And then to the degree that it became mine and was in order, then I was also put an order. Now you know that because you go into places that make you uncomfortable and maybe it's your own house, it's highly probable.

Speaker 3:          01:39:26       It's highly probable. I, you know, I walk into, well Chinese doctors do this. Traditional Chinese doctors, they go into place people's place and they diagnosed their health conditions on the, on the balance of Yin and Yang chaos and order. They walk into a house that this is easy to do. You walk into a house, there's too much chaos. Hey, you can detect that in no time flat. Everything is out of order and chaotic. You don't even want to be there. You certainly don't want to open the refrigerator. That's for sure. And there are things that should've been done years ago, everywhere. And every one of those things is a fight that hasn't happened and something that's been avoided. And you can't even walk in there and maintain your health. As soon as you walk in there, you're sicker than you were when you were outside. And that's one sort of place.

Speaker 3:          01:40:08       And then another sort of places you go in and you look at the living room and the person has vacuum the living room rug and the lines that were vacuumed are parallel to one another and the and the furniture is covered with plastic and you get a glass of water and then just as you're going to set it down on the coffee table, the person rushes over and puts a coaster underneath it and everything in that house says to you that it would be a lot more perfect in that house if you were either not there or dad and that's. And that's the message that the whole house is blasting at you. And if you happen to live there, then you're going to be sick and what you're going to be sick from is too much order. And in the other house you're going to be sick from too much chaos.

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       And so when you interact with the house, the unexplored parts are the chaos that had the parts that you have not yet contended with are the chaos that has not yet been transformed by your embodied logos. Action into habitable territory. And it does not belong to you. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee, the neighbor and removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plaintiff camera which is in Hebrew and in built there an altar unto the Lord.

Speaker 4:          01:41:29       And it came to pass in the days of [inaudible], King of Shinar, Arioch, King of Lsr cheered a little more. There's a lot of kings, we won't talk about them. These made war with Barrett, King of Sodom, and with Burger King of Gomorrah, she nap king of Admah and the king of Bela, which is your. And these were joined together in the veil of system, which is the salt sea [inaudible]. Now, this is actually very much relevant today because you see the veil of see them, which is the salt sea is the farthest south you can go if south is down because it's the Dead Sea and the Dead Sea is the lowest place that there is. So what's happened is that there's chaos in the lowest place that there is. That's what this story says. And what happens to Lord as he gets tangled up in the chaos of the lowest place that there is,

Speaker 4:          01:42:25       and in the 14th year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the Ref fames and asteroid name, and the zooms and Hammond, the eminence and Chava Korea, Korea theme and the whites in their mount sire onto elpar in which is by the wilderness. And they returned and came to end Mishpat, which has Kadesh and smote all the country. The male acolytes, amalekites, and the amorites that dwelt in has a has is zoned to my. Hey. Hey has azonto mark. There we go perhaps and their window with the King of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah and the king of Babylon, and the king of Bela. The same as Zara. And they joined, battled with them in the veil of sodium. So this is absolute chaos and mayhem in the lowest place. It's hell essentially

Speaker 4:          01:43:14       with Cheddar, a little more of the king of a lamb and with title of King, of Nations. And Amarillo fail. King of Shinar and area king of Ella's or four kings with five and the veil of system was full of slime pits. Low inhale like with war isn't enough. They had to throw the slime pits in there. Apparently around the Dead Sea. There are pits of a bite bitumen like the like the tar pits in near La and so that this seems to actually be historically accurate and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there and they've remained, fled to the mountain and they took their goods and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way and they took lot. Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom and his in departed.

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       So Abraham has a family member who falls into the lowest place and there came one that had escaped and told Abraham the Hebrew for he dwelt in the plaintiff or the amorite brother of his goal. And brother vainer. And these were confederate with Abraham. And when Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive. He armed his trained servants, born in his own house, 318, and pursued them on to Dan. Well, so now we also know that Abraham is a pretty brave guy, right? He gets word that this horrible war has broken out in the worst of all possible places and that his nephew is involved in the first thing he does. His mountaintop is posy and get the hell in there and rescue his nephew. So Abraham's no, whatever goodness is from the Old Testament perspective, it isn't harmlessness, right? It isn't emasculation and castration.

Speaker 3:          01:44:38       It's not that it's not weakness, it's not the inability to fight, none of that is associated with virtue. It's the sort of strength and enable someone to mountain arm team of 300 people when he finds out that his nephew is being kidnapped in a terrible war and to get the hell out there and take them back. And so that's, that's a, that's a, that's a call to two. It's a coal to power that not, not a kind of peaceful meekness. That's funny too, because you know there's a line in the new testament, the meek shall inherit the earth. I've got to look at my phone for a sec here because I don't know what time it is. There's a line in the new testament that says it's in the sermon on the mount, says the meek shall inherit the earth, and that I read that line always bothered me.

Speaker 3:          01:45:21       I thought, no way. That's not that. That's not right. Knee can't be the right word. So when I was doing the story of Noah and talking about the sermon on the mount, I spent a bunch of time looking at commentaries on that line, looking at the roots, the, you know, the Greek roots in the Hebrew roots and trying to figure out what that meant and it meat does not mean meek. That's wrong. Here's what it means. Those who have weapons and know how to use them, but still keep the machine will inherit the earth. Jesus, that's a lot different, man. It's a lot better, right? Because the way it's normally knits, normally interpreted is if you're so weak that your harmless, then things will go well for you. It's like, no, that's not right. That's and that's not. That can't be right. It doesn't fit with the narrative is certainly doesn't fit with this narrative and he divided himself against them.

Speaker 3:          01:46:14       He and his servants by night and smoke them and pursued them into Hobart, which is on the left side of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and his brother lot and his goods and the women also ended the people. Good work. Abraham and the kings of Sodom went out to meet him after his return at the slaughter of Charitable Omer and of the kings that there were there with him at the Valley of [inaudible], which is the king. Stale and Melchizedek King of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him and said, blessed be Abraham of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth, and blessed be the most high God which has delivered

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       thine enemies into thy hand and gave him tithes of all. And the King of Sodom said to Abraham, give me the person's intake diet goods to myself, that the goods that Abraham Abraham rescued right out of the kinks. And Abraham said to the King of Sodom, I have lift up my hand unto the Lord. What does that mean? It means I've made a vow. That's what it means. That that's what that phrase means. I've made a vow to God, the possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take anything from a thread even to a shoelace. I won't take anything that's yours. Less you should say, I've made a broom. Rich. I'll take only that which my young men have eaten and the portion of men that went with me and Aner Eshkol and let them take their portion. And so Abraham decides here he's, he's made this immense sacrifice and in and done this incredibly brave act and rescued his nephew.

Speaker 4:          01:47:43       And rescued the king's goods and they offer him a reward and he says, I'm not going to take the reward. And the reason for that is that he doesn't want to contaminate the, the, the ethical, purity of his actions. He doesn't want to be paid. He doesn't want it. He doesn't want to benefit from doing. He doesn't want to have. What is it exactly. He doesn't want to benefit inappropriately from doing the right thing. It's something like that. And so it's another testament to his character in a very complex testament, right? Because he's not a CEO. He's not a good man in any simple sense. I mean, look what's just happened. He's, he's mounted and armed. He's mounted in armed. Uh, he, he's, he's led an army into battle and park and, and participated in a slaughter. He refuses to benefit from it except to get back. What was his. That's it. He refuses to benefit from it except to get back what was rightfully his. And in that way, he maintains his covenant with God

Speaker 4:          01:48:46       even to a shoe latchet I anything don't ever so smaller mean less dao should claim a share with God and the honor due to him. This is from Matthew Pool, who was an English nonconformists theologian commenting on that line even to a shoe latchet. Anything they'll never saw, meaner, small, lest thou should claim a share with God. And the honor due to him to his blessing alone, I do. And I will own my riches or less, thou should say, Abraham is enriched with my spoils. And however he pretended kindness and charity, yet indeed it was his covetousness that put them upon this work. After these things, the word of the Lord came unto Abraham and division saying, fear not Abraham. I'm a shield and die exceedingly. I exceeding great reward the vision issue again. Well, we went through that last week. Fear Not Abraham, I am Thy Shield and thy exceeding great reward. And Abraham said, Lord God, what can you give me? Seeing as I'm childless tagless? And that's the only thing that matters table at this point, and the steward of my house is this is easier of Dem Damascus, no kin, and Abraham said, Abraham said, behold to me, thou has given no seed, and Lo one born in my house is mine. Air and behold, the word of the Lord came unto him

Speaker 4:          01:50:06       saying, this shall not be there in heir, but he that shall come forth out of known bottle should be nine here. So he gets promised the impossible once again, and he brought him forth abroad and said, now look towards the heaven and tell the stars if that will be able to number them. And he said unto him, so shall thy seed be, and he believed in the Lord and he counted to him for righteousness. Seeing that this, this, this is the covenant idea, this belief, because here's the belief. It's the willingness to act as if the world is constructed so that if you do the right thing, the best possible outcome will occur. It's a decision. That's the covenant, right? It's a decision about how to live in the world because the evidence can't be there before you make the decision. Right, and so you might hedge your bets, you know when, when Christ comes back in the book of revelation to judge people because he comes back as a judge and virtually everyone gets cast out with the chaff and not saved with the wheat and he, he says something very interesting. He appears in the vision with a sword coming out of his mouth. It's a horrifying vision and he divides the. He divides humanity into the damned, in the safe or the day. Yes, the damned and the saved. He says something very interesting. He says

Speaker 4:          01:51:32       to those who were neither hot nor cold, I will spew you out of my mouth. And, and it's, it's a, it's a, it's a disgust metaphor, right? T? And what it says is that the worst punishment isn't waiting for those who committed to something and did wrong. The worst punishment is reserved for those who committed to nothing and stayed on the fence. And that's really something to. That's really something to think about it. And it's also something that I believe to be true because I see that stacy, this is

Speaker 4:          01:52:10       utterly destructive because there's no progress. All the resist movement backwards, there's aging and suffering and no progress, and so to not commit to anything is the worst of all. Transgressions to commit means to put your body and soul into something. To offer your life as a sacrifice means that you're willing to make a bargain with fate and the bargain is I'm going to act as if if I give it my all, then the best possible thing will happen because of that and to to not see the analogy between that and the act of faith in God is to misunderstand the completely. And it has to be an act of faith because how are you going to know?

Speaker 4:          01:52:50       You can look at other people, but that isn't going to do it. It's Kierkegaard was very clear about this sort of thing. There's certain sorts of truths that you can only learn for yourself through experience. And that's of course why Abraham also has to go out alone, right? He has to leave this candidates. It's an individual. It's the individuation process like dying. It's something that you do alone. There's no way you can tell what is within your grasp, let's say, unless you make the ultimate sacrifice and there's no way of finding out without actually making it, and so that's the sacrificial act, right? That's, that's really emphasized in the active Abraham

Speaker 4:          01:53:27       being called upon to sacrifice Isaac. You think about that is Abraham, he's been doing. He's been like breaking himself into pieces, trying to progress forward through starvation and tyranny and war and deceit and the potential loss of his wife and childlessness and like everything that can really be following you in some sense. And finally God grants them. Isaac, when he's old, it's impossible. He gets Isaac, his son, and then what does he do next is say, well, you know, that son that you've been waiting for. So for so long it's like, I'd like to see just exactly what you're made of. So I think you should offer him up as a sacrifice. And I mean it's a very barbaric story in a sense, and maybe in more than just the sense, but Abraham does maintain his covenant. He's willing to make the sacrifice he's willing to make. This is the thing he's willing to make whatever sacrifices necessary to keep his covenant with God intact, and that's that, and that's the decision. Well, maybe it's no surprise that people don't do that,

Speaker 4:          01:54:31       and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought the out of Ur of the Chaldees to give this land to you to inherit it. And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I show inherited? And he said to him, this is a sacrificial story. Again, take an F. I have for three years and a goat of three years in a realm of three years in a turtle. Dove and a young pigeon is fairly specific actually, and he took all of these and divided them and laid each piece one against another, but the birds divided, he not. Now there's a reason for that and I don't know the reason for it. And when the walls came down upon the carcasses, Abraham drove them away and when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abraham and low, a horror of great darkness fell upon him had didn't mean he was afraid of the dark, which is what I thought it meant when I first read it.

Speaker 4:          01:55:23       It isn't what it means. It means that he fell into a trance or something like that. And then he was enveloped by absolute horror. So that's how this story begins. And here's the commentary from Joseph Benson who was an English methodist minister who lived in 17, 49, was born in 17, 49, and the sun was going down about the time of the evening, evening ablation, the washing for he abode by them praying and waiting till toward evening a deep sleep fell upon Abraham. Well, this was not a common sleep through weariness or carelessness. Don't know what a sloop is that's supposed to be asleep. Not a common sleep through weariness or Carolyn carelessness, but a divine ecstasy that being wholly taken off from things sensible, he might be wholly taken up with the contemplation of things spiritual well, it really makes you wonder what Abraham was up to in his campsite, so

Speaker 4:          01:56:22       he was participating in something that enabled this experience and low or a horror of great darkness fell upon him. This was designed to strike all upon the spirit of Abraham and to possess them with a holy reverence. Holy fear prepares the soul for holy joy. God humbles first and then lifts up echoes of Psychedelic Experience, and he said unto Abraham, no of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and she'll serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that nation whom they shall serve. I will judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance and now shall go to vi. Fathers in peace, thou shalt be buried in the good old age, but in the fourth generation, they shall come hither again. For the inequity of the Amorites is not yet full

Speaker 4:          01:57:10       commentaries of Joseph Benson. Once again, they shall come hither again. Hither to the land of Canaan. We're in vow note art. Now art. The reason why they must not have the land of promise in possession until the fourth generation is because the iniquity of the amorites was not yet full. The righteous God has determined that the Amorites shall not be cut off until they arrived at such a pitch of wickedness and therefore till it come to that the seed of Abraham must be kept out of possession. So the interpretation of the story essentially is that Abraham's descendants will end up in slave in Egypt for a long, lengthy period of time and eventually come back to the land of Canaan. And it's interesting too because this is part of Abram's bargain with God and in this divine vision. I mean, he's been promised everything, but it's a pretty tough bargain because you know when, when, when God is pushed or reveals himself, let's say, he says, look, you're going to get your damn descendants.

Speaker 4:          01:58:03       You know, but it's not going to be our. It's, it's, it's going to be a tough journey. They're going to be slaves and slave for a very long time and eventually come back and you won't see it. You'll be dead long before then. And so it's a realistic promise in a sense. And you might say, well, Abraham is so dated, desperate to keep the faith that he's willing to read good into what isn't good. But I think, I think, I don't think that's the right way to look at it. I think the right way to look at it is the people who wrote these stories for very realistic and they knew that even if things turned out well for you, I mean it was still going to be real. You know, it wasn't going to be some fantasy. It's like, let's say you have a family that flourishes. People are still going to die, there's still going to get sick, they're still gonna have, they're still going to be alive, you know, with all of it's suffering, but it'll be, but it'll be a life that's rich enough and complete enough so that it'll justify its, its nature essentially. And so,

Speaker 4:          01:58:59       and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between the pieces. Albert Barnes, American theologian commented on this, the oven of smoke and lamp of flame symbolize the smoke of destruction in the light of salvation, they're passing, passing through the pieces of the sacrificial victims, and probably consuming the mess and accepted sacrifice, or the ratification of the Covenant on the part of God as the dividing and presenting of them were on the part of Abraham. In the same day, the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying unto thy seed, I haven't given this land from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the River Euphrates, the Canaanites and the Kennedys sites and the cadman nights, et cetera. Now Cri. Abram's wife bear him, no children. And she had a handmade. Wait a second. I think we'll stop there. I'm tiring out. And it's just. And it's 9:29. So that's a very good place to stop. So yes.

Speaker 2:          01:59:58       Thank you. So I should,

Speaker 4:          02:00:07       I should close properly and just sum up. So what happens here is that that Abraham enters into a covenant with God to act in the world, and the action is an adventure story essentially, and the adventures repeat and their and their punctuated by success and sat and sacrifice and re contemplation. Right? And it's so. It's this, it's this journey. It's the, it's the hero's journey uphill. I'm here, there's a crisis. I collapsed, I reconstruct myself to a higher place, and life is like that continually. And that's the story of Abraham and that's all contained though. It's all contained and this is the thing that's so cool because that is what your life is going to be like. Whether you plan out your life or not, it's going to be punctuated like that. Maybe it won't go up, maybe it'll go down. And the question is, what sort of container do you need to be in in order to tolerate the movement up and down? And that's what the story of Abraham provides. It provides a, it provides a description of the covenant that's like the Ark of the covenant and the Ark or the same thing, right? Except the covenant is the psychological equivalent of the Ark of the covenant is

Speaker 4:          02:01:19       have faith in the structure of existence and go forth. That's the covenant and that and this story is, that's the best possible solution that you have at hand. Alright, so I'm going to make a request with regards to the questions which may mean have to reorient yourself in the line. I would like the first two questions on each side if possible to relate specifically to tonight's lecture and then I can and then I can address more general issues if that's, if that's okay. So, and I again, I would like you to carefully speak into the mic so that the people who are watching can hear. Can you hear me? Yeah. I can.

Speaker 6:          02:02:09       The story about Abraham saying his wife was his sister. You referred to that as him making a mistake. I'm not quite sure I understand how you're reading that does a mistake seeing as it was a very deliberate decision and it had a pretty good outcome for him and he does the same thing a few chapters later.

Speaker 4:          02:02:29       Yes. This is true. You see, I don't, I don't, I don't feel that I've cracked out part of that story properly. Now, the reason I said it was a mistake is because it's clearly an act of deceit and it and it, and it does put the Pharaoh in a very awkward position. Not to mention survived by the way, or how do you say that? I don't know how to say that. Surrey, Surrey. It's sariah to begin with. Yes. Is that right? Surgery? Yes. Okay. And then it's Sarah and Abraham means high king, something like that. And Abraham means father of the people in Surrey means Princess and Sarah means mother of the people. It's some, I haven't exactly right. I'll tell you next week, but that's part of the name transformation, the, it seems to me that at least in part it's an indication of Abraham Abraham's willingness to use a sub optimal solution when driven to it by necessity.

Speaker 4:          02:03:24       I don't think it's a heroic act to pretend that your wife is your sister. Now you know, and, and, and maybe you might say, well, under the circumstances there was nothing else he could have done, but it does seem it. I can't see how you can interpret it other than as a departure from the truth, but I know that that's not all there is to it and it does seem to work out well for him and my interpretation is that, well, if you're oriented properly in the world, the grace of God allows you a few necessary mistakes, something like that. Do you have an alternative idea? Well why not? What is it about that, that that means it because it's Abraham and it isn't reasonable to attribute mistakes to him or what is it?

Speaker 6:          02:04:11       Because at least I think it says in the text that he's looking to get out of a bad situation and he does whatever is the best thing that's available to him and not dimension. As I said, he does the same trick a few chapters later.

Speaker 4:          02:04:27       Yeah, well maybe. Maybe it is the case that, you know, it's like a white lie issue. You know, you say, well there's a white lie. Acceptable. I would say, well, the best that you can come up with is acceptable. That that doesn't mean it's. It's optimal though, right? Like all right, I'll give you a foolish example because it's the best that I could do at the moment, but know if you. If you have a loved one who says, does this dress make me look fat? The answer to that question is I don't answer questions like that. That's the answer, right? Because the other answer is the white lie. That would mean at least in this context, and that means that on the one hand you're maintaining the positive contract between you and the person who's asking the question, but then you're still sacrificing the truth within that.

Speaker 4:          02:05:18       So you're, you're, you're maintaining your relationship with the higher order truth but sacrificing a lower order truth and, and that would be better than the reverse, but it's not as good as not sacrificing the truth at all. And I would say that if you're maybe fortunate because sometimes it's a matter because you can be in a situation where all your choices are bad. I've seen people in situations like that. I've probably been in situations like that and maybe that is what's happening in that story is every choice, Abraham is in front of him is bad, but I can't help but think that it's more than that. It means that if you're doing the best you can and it's not perfect, it can still be good enough. That's how it looks to me. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          02:06:06       Hello Dr Peterson, you mentioned earlier there's been a pervasive problem of nihilism and moral relativism, uh, and that, that can kind of be cured with a novice, naive optimism that's grounded in fact, and what can actually be done to improve situations. Is there a way to communicate that message to a younger audience? They teenagers in high school environment, which is nowadays a hotbed for this kind of nihilistic, morally relativist thinking.

Speaker 4:          02:06:33       Great. I'm glad you asked that. So I'm going to tell you, I was thinking about saying this at the beginning, but I decided not to, but now I get to say it because I got this question. So that's so cool. Um, I have plans and so plan number one, I have worked with some people to design a website that will enable high university students to enter their course descriptions, their professor's name, the subdiscipline, and the university and an artificial intelligence agent will tell them if the course is postmodern, neo, Marxist indoctrination. No, not only,

Speaker 4:          02:07:18       and I have made tentative arrangements with someone to finance a advertising campaign for that site. And so the goal is well to inform the consumer, do you want to be educated or do you want to be? And happily you'll build, use the site equally for both purposes, right? Because if you want, if you want to take the, the, the courses that I would regard as indoctrination, then this will give you a way of ensuring that nothing that you get exposed to won't be of that sort. So, and then I'm going to make a video to introduce that to university students and their parents and I'm going to outline what I think the universities are doing wrong. There's about 20 things they're doing wrong and they're seriously wrong things. And I'm going to start by describing the utility of a university education in humanities education because the humanities education makes you into the kind of autonomous individual that can go away from, that can be independent and can communicate and think, and that has immense economic value, right? Not, not just spiritual value and cultural value, but economic value. And so there's, I don't want to tell people not to go to university, I want to tell them to go to university and grow the hell up and learn to communicate and think and I want them to avoid the people who will take the spirit away from them. And so that's what that website is going to do, I hope. And the goal is to drop the enrollment in the indoctrination courses across the English speaking world by 75 percent within five years. That's the goal.

Speaker 4:          02:09:03       And then you ask that, you ask more specifically about high school students. Well, we have this future authoring program that has been used for university students and it produces about a 30 percent improvement in retention. And we've tested several thousand university students. Anyone can use it by the way, it's not for university students, but it was easy for us to test its beneficial impact. Even if people only spend under 90 minutes on it, it still has approximately that effect, especially on young men, especially if they're ethnic minorities, especially if they're not oriented towards a career and didn't do very well in school and so that's really cool because it's really hard to design a psychological intervention that helps the people who are doing the worst, most psychological intervention. So imagine there are people who are doing not so well and people who are doing well and you produce a psychological intervention.

Speaker 4:          02:09:56       What usually happens is the people who are doing well benefit even more. Right, but this seems to work for the disenfranchised. So we're thrilled about that really. And so we produced a version for high school students. Yes. And so, but we don't have them look three to five years out into the future because they can't and they don't know enough. You know, it's hard for full, full, fully mature adults to look that far into the future. High school kids can probably manage three to six months and so we're going to have them concentrated on character development and and what they want for their from their friendships and how they would like orient themselves in school and to start thinking about the sorts of person that they would like to be and that never happens in schools. Weirdly enough. There's a guy named John Gatto who won the teacher of the year award in New York City and then in New York state and then it stopped being a teacher.

Speaker 4:          02:10:48       By the way. He wrote a series of books about the education system that explain why students in pre university education aren't taught to be autonomous individuals. It's very interesting what he's discovered historically, but anyways, we're going to market that probably two parents and two university students themselves rather than to the schools because our experience has been that producing this sort of material directly for individuals works much better. It's much more efficient and so then students will be able to, or their parents will be able to purchase the program and the students will be able to use it to design their own personality in a manner that would make them thrilled to be alive. Let's say that would be the goal, right? Yes. I'm going to get you to turn it to put it down a little more either. Excellent.

Speaker 8:          02:11:56       Perfect. Yes, yes. And I, I think, um, especially the literature in Developmental Psychology, I think bears this out, but I think a huge part of learning is interaction and discourse and that seems very difficult in an online setting, even if it's through text. I don't, I don't quite see it as the same thing. And additionally I think there's a huge motivational factor that's a difficult to. It's difficult to keep motivated when you're isolated and nobody else around us pursuing the same goal. So how would you dress?

Speaker 4:          02:12:38       You're absolutely right on both counts. I would say that the idea of an online humanities university is grandiose and it may not be possible. And the reason for that is that, and as you're alluding to, we actually don't understand what the university is. We think it's lectures and exams, but it's probably not.

Speaker 4:          02:13:02       It's certainly being together with people of your own age. As you start your life, it's moving away from your household. It's establishing yourself as a credible intellect, right? It's, it's picking a new group of peers. It's all of those things and it isn't clear how that can be replicated online. Now. The people that I'm talking to are sophisticated enough to understand Marshall McLuhan's dictum that the medium is the message and so I think it would be a mistake to attempt to duplicate the university online because you can't. But so what we're concentrating on right now is not so much content but infrastructure. The question is we want to set up an egg and a system of education online that will be autonomously self-governing and self improving and the content in some sense, we're not so much interested in the content as we are interested in the process by which people who generate good content might be optimally rewarded.

Speaker 4:          02:14:04       And that's what we want to get, right. And that's probably a discussion that will take a year or two years to flesh out. We started to conceptualize what the system might look like, but, but to your point, it isn't. We're not taking lectures and putting them online, although obviously that's what I'm doing that, that isn't going to make an online humanities university and we know that and I think everything you said is, is, is very accurate and also indicative of the high probability that something like this would fail. So, but you know, we're, we're, we're going to try to be aware of the pitfalls. We're also going to. I read this great book, I would recommend this book. It's, it's a very funny book by a guy named John Gaul. It's called system antics and it's a cult classic system antics. And it's about how systems really work and how they fail.

Speaker 4:          02:14:55       And it's a work of ironic comedy, but it's quite brilliant. And one of the things, one line he, it's, it's made of a bunch of axioms. And here's one axiom I just love. This is the system does not do what it's name says it does, and so I worked in Alberta social services when I was a kid about 18 or so and I worked as a consultant and I I wanted and I got involved in projects that were above my pay grade, I would say, and I learned a lot about how how large bureaucracies functioned and I was asked at one point to update a report that had been made the year before about what percentage of the spending of the social services department actually went to the recipients of welfare and social aid in general. And the answer was the system did not know and could not find out.

Speaker 4:          02:15:44       And they had hired a very expensive consulting firms to answer that question the year before and I was asked to update it, which was quite odd to begin with. But then I did. I went and looked at the consulting report and I went into the data and what I found was that none of it was real, but even more importantly, there was no way of knowing whether it was true or false. Because the system had never been set up to calculate what percentage of its total spending actually went to the recipients of social aid. It just blew me away. And then I thought, and I was reading this book at the same time and I thought, oh, the purpose of the social services department is to employ people in the social services department. And I mean I wasn't being cynical about that. It's like charity. Most charities, you know, it's like 90 percent overhead.

Speaker 4:          02:16:29       So what does the charity do? It runs itself now. You don't want to be cynical about that because big businesses are the same and most like even if they're running at a profit, the profit is like five percent. So the business spends 95 percent of its time maintaining itself, you know? And it makes a bit of product and it makes a bit of profit. But most of what it does is maintain itself. So anyways, one of the axioms in that book that was one of them is the system does not do what it says it does. So that's [inaudible]. Then you can face the system with a clear head. And say, okay, well this thing isn't doing what it says it's doing, but it's probably doing something and the thing is doing might be useful, but we should figure out what that thing is. So that's been really useful to me as a guide to thinking.

Speaker 4:          02:17:10       But the other thing he said was if you want to build a big system that works, start with by building a small system that works and scale it, and we've done that. For example, with the self authoring programs, you know, is built small scale systems that are very robust with the hope that they'll scale. And that's the same. We'll do the same thing here is start with a small amount of content. See if we can reward. See, what I would like to have happened is, you know, there's a lot of people out there who are pretty intensely educated and some of them are really creative and so imagine that there's a timeline. Imagine you could do a humanities. As you imagine there's a timeline say of a thousand years that's scalable. Then imagine that, that there would be lectures associated with the timeline at different levels of resolution, so we might call for a lecture on this.

Speaker 4:          02:17:57       The third century had what happened in the third century. 80. You've got half an hour to explain it. You can explain it any way you want. You can use animation, you can use lecture, you can use text, you can make a movie. We don't care. What you have to do is that's the topic. That's the time span. That's the amount of time and then you can post it and so we could generate content that way and let people experiment and then we can have people review the content as part of their education, generate questions about the content as part of their assignments, rate the questions as part of their assignments and rate the content, and then if we charged people, imagine you had to pay $50 a month to enroll, something like that. Maybe we would allow you when you first enroll, maybe you get to use $5 of it as disposable income.

Speaker 4:          02:18:47       You can award that to any creator you want, but as you progress through the courses, you're right to determine where your money goes would increase as you became more and more educated. Hopefully that way we would get some quality control built into it. So those are some of the ideas that were, that were starting to play around with. So that's the only one I'm considered. Modista motivation. What's that? The motivation issue for individuals? Well, I'm not going to go into that because it would take too long, but, but rest assured that we are thinking about that very hard as well. We're going to build competition into it. We're going to build cooperation into it. We hope to build peer interrelationships into it. I all that's possible but, but complex, right? Because it's. We don't know how to build an online education system really. And, but it would be fun to experiment and see if we can figure out how to do it. So thank you.

Speaker 9:          02:19:46       Hi. Uh, so I, I couldn't really zero in on any particular question. So it's more of a family questions that I have about the nature and cultivation of conscience, which was in a sense of what the story a exemplified about Abraham. What, why do you

Speaker 4:          02:20:02       say that? Why do you think that the story exemplified the development of conscious of conscience specific specifically?

Speaker 9:          02:20:08       Well, going back to the Zig Zag, right? And the star. How you have to keep. Okay. So that's what you were referring to. Orienting yourself completely autonomously on your own terms. Right. A toe.

Speaker 4:          02:20:21       See, okay. So you, you hit on some great there. I think, you know, this is something weirdly enough that I learned most particularly from the Pinocchio Movie, which I spent a lot of time studying is because in the Pinocchio movie, Jimminy Cricket is an Avatar of Christ essentially. But it's very strange because he's a bug. That's the first thing that's kind of weird because Jimminy cricket is southern US slang for Jesus Christ among other things. But these things get aggregated in, in great mythic dramas like that. And that's a great mythic drama. But you know, one of the things that really makes jimminy cricket different from Christ, apart from the fact that Christ wasn't a cricket is that created the cricket learns as he progresses, right? Even though he's the conscience. And so you'd think that he would be the infallible guide. That isn't how the movie makers set it up.

Speaker 4:          02:21:08       And that's so cool is that he's just as muddle headed as Pinocchio at the beginning and he's a bit arrogant, puffed up to. And so it took me a long time to think that through. And then I realized that, well, you have the voice of the voice of culture in you. You have the voice of culture within you, but it's old and dead and out of date and it's not fully articulated. An updated. And then what happens is that if you enter into a dialogue with it and you hammer yourself against the world, then you get hammered into shape and so does your conscience. And so you both become elevated and so well. So anyways, I think that's, that's ridiculously cool because it means that your conscience, you don't have an infallible guide, but you have something within you that you could build into an infallible guide if you cooperated with it and fed it so well. So I think that's very interesting.

Speaker 9:          02:22:03       So that being said, the picture that I have in my mind of the cultivation of virtue in general, it's kind of like taking a, a block of wood and trying to carve out a sphere out of it. It'll never be perfectly round. But the more you carve, right? The rounder and Roderick, that successive approximation. Yeah. Well one of it's also like, um, what do you call compound interest?

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       This is one of the things that's also, and I think this puts you on the to those who more shall be given part of the curve. It's like, you know, you don't have to improve yourself very much each week to really improve yourself on a ridiculous amount in a year. You know, so you could make, you could, you could, you could vow to make your day one 100th of a percent better than the day before, and that would do the trick if you were, if you were constant about that, that would do the trick. So that, that's the success of approximation is you don't want to underestimate the utility of incremental progress. Man, it's really kids deadly powerful. So,

Speaker 9:          02:23:09       so let's say you get to the, you know, the, the higher ends of the curve, right? You're like a pretty virtuous person. Let's say you even become a sage or something of the sort, and I mean one, should you doubt your conscience, like what are the things that we should watch out for even when we got some. Great. Well that's okay just to get out of the way, right? Yeah. I don't know how much this relates. Well, it does relate, but psychopaths, for example, the entire idea that they lack a conscience and that's why, right? That's what psychopathy is. Whether or not you agree with that definition, right? But there's an issue of conscience, again, a play with psychopathy. How can we the first question, doubt ourselves in a way that's warranted, right? Regardless of how virtuous we've become. And can you treat a psychopath? Could they cultivate a conscience?

Speaker 4:          02:24:11       Okay, so let's, we'll start with the first one. Part of the reason that, that I believe that freedom of speech is the canonical, right? That's an obligation, right? More importantly, even obligation is that that's how you figure out if you're wrong,

Speaker 4:          02:24:30       you know, because. So I sit home and I think, and I think, and I think let's say, but I'm like, who am I to think? There's so many things. I don't know that it's just, there's the one I know compared to what I don't know is so minuscule that it's a preposterous act just to say something. Okay. So, so no matter how much I sit at home and think I'm not going to fix that, I'm going to be fun. And then I have biases, but my temperament and I have biases because of my malevolence and I have biases because of my gender, my sex, let's say, since we're not so fond of that word. So Eva, no matter how much I sit home and think I'm still going to be wrong and malevolent, so then whenever I have to do is I have to talk to some other people and I have to say this is what I think, and it's going to be ugly,

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       you know, because what the hell do I know? But then if I listen,

Speaker 4:          02:25:32       people will tell me why I'm wrong and lots of people have been telling me why I'm wrong like a lot and it's hard, you know, it's hard, but it's. But I've learned something from it like I had this

Speaker 4:          02:25:45       revelation, let's say about being yelled at by your father. Now I know that you can be yelled at too much by your father, but it's like you're wrong man. And so someone's yelling at you and maybe they're only 10 percent right? But if you shut the hell up and listen, then you can figure out where you're wrong. And then maybe you can be thankful for that. And then maybe if you shut up and listened, your father would quit yelling at you. You know, because he's wrong too. What the hell does he know? He knows how to yell at you and tell you how you're wrong, and he's throwing things out. You add you that are probably not true, but some of it's true and you know, if someone can tell you why you're wrong, they've given you a great gift because then you don't have to be wrong anymore. And you might think, well who cares if you're wrong, but you know there's a line in the new testament too, is if the blind lead the blind, won't they fall in? Won't they fall into a ditch? And the answer to that question by the way, is yes, they will. And so the reason that you want to think is because thinking is how you.

Speaker 4:          02:26:47       It like when you think you created a fictional world that's, that's an analog of the world. And then you make an Avatar of yourself to act in that world. And then if the Avatar dies, you don't act out those actions. Right? Well, so if you think properly, then you don't have to suffer and die. And so if you can say what you think and people can tell you why you're wrong and you know to say what you think under extreme circumstances means that you're going to say things that no one wants to hear because those are the things you don't know about. Those are the things that are conflictual and difficult it, those are going to be hard conversations, man. And you're going to be wrong about them a lot. If you don't get to stumble forward with your stupidity, then you can't be corrected. And so, so there is no distinction between free speech and thinking and there's no distinction between thinking and thriving. And so those who want to inhibit free speech do not wish for people to thrive. And I believe that.

Speaker 5:          02:27:45       So

Speaker 4:          02:27:48       thinking does not happen inside your head. That's the only the beginnings of thinking. And it's this, that we're doing here that's thinking, you know, so we have to protect that. Psychopaths, I don't, I say this, I hope non naively

Speaker 4:          02:28:07       also having dealt with psychopaths in my clinical practice and I would say now and then in my life, I don't believe in psychopaths. I don't believe that we know enough to say there are people born without, um, I don't think the psychometric measurement of psychopathy is everything that it should be. I've been trying to model it in the big five domain. I think now it's complicated because. So I would say a psychopath, a classic psychopath is likely extroverted, especially assertive, disagreeable and unconscientious and maybe extremely low in neuroticism, so you can't frighten them. But. So that's a rare combination because it's extreme on many traits, right? But that, I don't believe that that means that someone with that personality configuration is doomed from birth to a pathological existence because there's things about psychopathy that, that the, that the classifiers, those who claim like clinically that the psychopath is born in some sense can't explain. It's like, well, what about the cruelty? It seems to be a motive there, you know, with are passionless and they lack, they lack emotion. Well, why are they cruel then for entertainment? Well, but then you have to explain the entertainment motivation. Like there's a failure in some sense with the classic psychopathy theorists to come to grips with the problem of malevolence. It's skirted over and you can't do that if you're talking about psychopathy, it's like malevolence is the bloody issue here, and so

Speaker 4:          02:29:44       the other issue with this psychopath is that he's irredeemable, right? That's the idea.

Speaker 4:          02:29:50       I don't think we know enough to make such claims now and that doesn't. I know the psychopathy literature quite well and I have great respect for their primary research is in the field. I want to make that perfectly clear, but we're talking at a different. We're talking, we're approaching the problem from a different level of analysis here. Something like a spiritual level of analysis and I don't think that there's an easy easy translation from the descriptive psychometric psychiatric approach to the spiritual level. They don't match and I'm more likely to say let's not assume the soul is doomed from birth. Right. And I'm loath to think that there are people born irredeemable. Although I do think there are irredeemable. People knew that the death penalty issues. Interesting in that regard. You know, because I've read a lot about really terrible people and I've also read a lot about what really terrible people said about themselves and many of them wished for the death penalty and so it's absolutely clear that there are things that you can do that deserved the death penalty, but that doesn't mean that the state should have the right to impose it.

Speaker 4:          02:30:58       That's a different question. So yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:31:03       thank you.

Speaker 10:         02:31:09       In the previous lecture, you mentioned the 2008 economic crisis and one of the very interesting themes that's emerged at many levels be at universities or economic policy is this perceived culture war, specifically the idea of Mark's versus mill and you've criticized postmodern and neo Marxist thought very frequently. One interesting critic of, uh, policies of the EU, specifically ECB, ECB, and IMF during the Greek debt crisis was Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister and his criticism of mill was the, was mills alleged contempt for the population and verify has comments on the type of capitalism that results in too big to fail. He described themselves as an erratic Marxist. To me personally is an example of someone whose position on the philosophical moring of policy is interesting to compare and contrast with yours. He's certainly not your typical Marxist, so postmodernist, even though I'm not really sure what that means, but if you look at his work during the Greek debt crisis and his current work with [inaudible], he seems to be well reasoned, well positioned and and articulate. Now I wanted to know if you had an opinion on that type of criticism of mill or is taking of a position as an erratic Marxist.

Speaker 4:          02:32:12       Okay. I would say I would say no to the specifics of the question. I don't think that I have that detailed expertise in order to answer the question at the level of analysis that you were. You formulated it, but I. I have something to say that's more general about the set of phenomena that you described. There is no doubt that distribution is a major problem that capitalism contends with imperfectly at best and the distribution problem is the prieto distribution problem right in, and something that marks commented on, which mostly in the monetary sphere is that money tends to accumulate in the hands of very few people. It's like there's no doubt about that. Now, as we've discussed before, the people in whom hands the money accumulates do turnover more than people think, especially in, in, in countries that are functioning reasonably well. And it's really important that that happens.

Speaker 4:          02:33:12       Yes, yes, yes. But that doesn't, that doesn't solve the problem of the fact that produced goods gravitate towards an extreme minority. Now there are also produced often by extreme minority, which is also a problem. Um, I would say then that the idea that capitalism is more prone to that distribution problem than any other system, I don't believe that to have been demonstrated at all. And I think that capitalism is actually pretty good at self destruction except when that's interfered with. And I think that's particularly the case in the United States were generally the policy has been, if you're an idol with feet of clay, no matter how big you are, you get to fail now. That's been compromised severely in the last 20 years and we're probably going to pay for that. I think they really paid for that in Japan, right? Where there was every attempt to prop out the gods that should have died. So.

Speaker 4:          02:34:23       So fair enough for the critique of capitalism. That's not the issue. The issue is do you have a better idea? And if the idea is well, we could kind of do it, mark suggested, then you don't get to have that position and claim. What should I say? I haven't seen any evidence that systems predicated on that set of axioms have done anything but more harm than good. And when will you be announcing the monthly extension to this? The series? As soon as I find out whether or not I can rent this theater in the fall.

Speaker 2:          02:35:05       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:35:07       thank you. We'll see you next week.
