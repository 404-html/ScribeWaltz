Speaker 1:          00:00:01       On Tuesday, obviously I wasn't here. And so I prepared that combination slideshow, powerpoint thing that took me like 12 hours to make it. But I'm wondering something, I mean I have quite a bit of tape material and I'm going to, obviously I'd be taking this courses and I was wondering, one of the advantages of doing it that way was that I could sink the material, like the slide material with the lecture much more precisely. You know, when you can imagine that if I, once I got good at that, I could put a lot more material into the lectures and I could edit them very carefully. So then I'm wondering like what did you think of that use of technology compared to a spontaneous lecture? What was your attitude towards that?

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       I think that, well we could present more, less responsive and so I prefer the 11 pictures watching the tapes. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       yeah, yeah. No, no, I understand. I mean there is some mute. The thing about lecture is that it's a conversation. If it's a good lecture right there because the lecturers hypothetically paying attention to the audience. And so then it's, it's, it's more dynamic. But you know what if suffers a bit cause it's not as structured. That's the thing. Anybody else? Just we did it. Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:01:21       Pretty good substitute. Like I'll be a say prefer an in person lecture. But given the circumstance I thought it was definitely a good substitute, the information.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       So I was wondering like what would happen, do you think if I prepared like a really tightly edited half hour presentation like that and then followed it up with a looser lecture, do you think that, would that be a reasonable combination of the two things? Because that way I could more, you know, I can be much more certain that I covered a wide range of material, you know, in depth and then hopefully the lecture could be maybe a little looser and a bit more fun. So what do you, do you think that would be a reasonable thing to try? So any, anybody up? Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:02:01       Um, yeah, you've got to be a really good idea, especially because during the lecture section, the chance to sort of ask some more questions, whereas, uh, you know correctly, there's a lot of time.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, I was thinking that maybe that would allow me to increase the degree to which it was interactive, so. Okay. Did anybody particularly object to that mode of presentation? I mean, I know you wouldn't have to be in the lecture hall for it, obviously. That's one thing, right? You could look, you could watch it at home. I think there's some danger in just having the lecture material online. So you're at home because, well, the Internet is full of things you can watch, you know, so there's gotta be some utility bringing people together by anybody else have any other comments?

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       Okay. Okay. All right. So today we're going to talk about conscientiousness and I'm going to stick closer to my notes in some parts because a lot of this stuff I'm going to tell you about is really only stuff that I've learned in the last year or so. And so I've known, I've known, absolutely familiar with it yet. Uh, there's actually been a fair bit of progress, made an understanding conscientiousness and in very surprising ways. Some of the stuff that I'm going to talk to you about today really shocked me when I learned it. Um, you'll see, I mean, I've been in interested in belief systems and new technology for a long time and um, the role that I'd never really understood the role that conscientiousness plays in that. So, so particularly, but it's really starting to come together. So not only we're going to talk about conscientiousness today, we're going to talk about, I think some of the pathologies that are associated with conscientiousness, both at the individual level and at the social level.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       Now it's a, it's a tricky topic because act what we've discussed this before to some degree, you know, that intelligence and conscientiousness are the best predictors of life success, right? At least in managerial administrative, um, professions and in academia and also in professions like the law, you know. Um, so conscientiousness in many ways seems to be a very good trait. I don't think that you can have a civilized society without Wifi, without it, without conscientiousness being at the base of it in some sense because conscientious people do what they say they're going to do. They're industrious, they keep things in order. Um, a lot of that's the basis for the kind of interpersonal trust that's necessary to set up complex trading systems. And so, and as an individual trait, as I said, if you're conscientious, not only do you do better in life, but by the time you're middle aged or so, um, your life quality seems to be much higher.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       So you know, we'll be in conscientious seems to be a good longterm, medium to long term strategy. So that all sounds pretty positive. But then one of the things that multiple multitude of labs have been looking at over the last few years, including mine, is what happens if conscientiousness is taken too far and it kind of looks, this is work that hasn't been published yet, but it's based on some of the new personality models that I'd been looking at that are, that have been derived using a different technique, a semantic analysis technique instead of factor analysis. And what appears to be the case is that any of the traits become pathological if you push them too far. So, so whatever virtue is, it can't be identified with a particular trait. I mean, I don't know what virtue would be from a big five perspective, but it doesn't look like you could localize it specifically.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       Maybe it's something like the appropriate situational balance of the temperaments or one of the things I've been thinking is that maybe as you mature, your, your, your width of temperament increases, you know, that maybe your, your baseline for a conscientiousness is sort of average. But as you mature, your ability to be very conscientious when it's necessary and your ability to not be conscientious when it's necessary are more thoroughly developed, a differentiated so that you can match your behavior more particular to the demands of given situations. Maybe that's something like the development of wisdom. But anyways, it turns out, it turns out that it appears that conscientiousness can take a very vicious turn if it's pushed beyond a certain point. And it also appears that perhaps the point at which conscientiousness is really positively associated with the success of individuals and maybe the success of nations is also relatively close to the point where if you push it any farther, it starts to kick back very badly and things go downhill.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       And so that's the sort of thing that we're going to discuss today. So, um, well put it in its context first. You remember the highest order personality traits or plasticity and stability in plasticity is made up of extraversion and openness. Those are good predictors of longterm creative achievement. And then there's stability and stability is associated with conscientiousness, emotional stability and agreeableness. And we're going to concentrate on conscientiousness today, which is obviously that's industrious in orderliness at the big five aspects scale level. Now, um, when we derived the big five aspect scale sold, broke the big five down to 10, it wasn't clear to begin with what the aspects we're going to be useful for. Because when you do statistical analysis like that, you're just pulling out a semantic structure and there isn't really any necessity that those additional differentiation so that you make are going to have practical utility.

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       But it's turned out that the distinction between Oh, orderliness and industriousness is extremely useful. So one of the things we know for example, is that orderly people tend to be more conservative. So we know that conservative people tend to be more conscientious, but it seems to load specifically an orderliness. Now you might say, well, that's not so surprising to associate the right wing with orderliness. But it is surprising because we didn't know that orderliness was a subset of conscientiousness. And so people have been trying since the end of World War II to slop the idea of the authoritarian personality into standard personality models. And that's been extremely difficult to do. You know? And so, so one hypothesis is being that conservative people because they're more zen, a phobic, and they're more, you know, they're more anti-immigration and there and they're more anti gay rights and that sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:08:27       And one, one primary theories being that that's because they're more afraid, you know, there. But the problem is, is that conservatism isn't associated with neuroticism to any degree at all. And when it is, it seems to be reverse. It seems that the conservatives are less plagued by neuroticism than liberals are say so. You mean you could make the hypothesis that the conservatives are so conservative that they're covering up their fear to such a degree that it actually reverse it. But you know, really you gotta you gotta be Pretty Damn convinced of your theory to hold on to it when the data seemed to indicate that the opposite, the actual opposite is true. And so, oh well here, here's some items you guys can take a look at this. So this is how you would distinguish orderliness from industriousness. Um, I wouldn't worry about the slides. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       Because I'm going to, I'm going to cut them in. Okay. So anyways, so if you're ordering, you don't leave your belongings around. Obviously you like order. While there's a surprise, you keep things tidy, you follow a schedule, so you order your time. Um, that's definitely a good predictor of productivity. You're bothered by this and people and bothered is an interesting word, right? Cause if you're orderly and you're somewhere messy and it bothers you, you might think, well exactly what it is that you're experiencing when you're bothered. You know, I know if I go to a place that's in real disarray, it looks like people have been failing to live up to their responsibility. Say it, it's a visceral sensation. I really don't like it. I'm very strongly compelled to put things in order, you know, and it, it, but, but it's obviously a negative emotion, but it's not the kind of negative emotion that seems to load on neuroticism.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       So it doesn't seem to be fear or anxiety or emotional pain or frustration or disappointment or any of those things. So then you might ask, well, you know, what's left bothered, wants everything to be just right. Um, dislikes, routine, opposite, obviously orderly. People like routine. They see that rules are observed and they want every detail taken care of. While you can see that, in some ways, orderliness is the soul of bureaucracy, right? Because everything in its place and a place for everything is basically the sort of hallmark of an orderly person. Well in my clinical practice, I've certainly observed that people who are really disorderly and really high in neuroticism, they just, they're just never improve. You know, they're because they're their fear and their anxiety sort of paralyze them into an immobility. And the fact that they're low in conscientiousness are low in orderliness means they will never do anything and then disorder grows round and then that exacerbates their anxiety and their theorists like it's a real catastrophe.

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       So, and then on theirs, so that's where the conservatives are different. They're more orderly that liberals are industriousness. Liberals and conservatives seem to be about the same. So industrious person carries out their plans. They don't waste time, they don't find it difficult to get down to work. They don't miss things up. They finish what they start, they put their mind on the task at hand to get things done quickly. So this is an efficiency element to it. Uh, they don't postpone decisions and they aren't easily distracted. And so industrious people tend not to procrastinate. And procrastination actually seems to be something like low industriousness and high neuroticism. So I know it's a very pernicious phenomenon. And procrastination can really drive people. Start branding now it's reversed. Yeah. Yeah. So the ones that don't make sense or every post, so, so now it isn't exactly obvious why orderliness and industriousness are related so tightly or why there's somewhat differentiable, but it turns out that that is the case statistically.

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       Now I thought a lot about why orderliness and industriousness really is a mystery. We started to associate ordering with sensitivity to discussed, and I'm going to elaborate on that quite a bit. Industriousness, we haven't been able to get a handle on at all. And I, I, and so conscientiousness is somewhat of a mystery because up until maybe a year ago or two years ago, even though it was a really good predictor of longterm life success and happiness, um, we didn't have any models for it because it just came out of this statistical analysis of, of the semantic structure language. Right? So it was atheoretical. So there's no theoretical model. What, why are people conscientious? Well, we have no idea. There's no neuropsychological model. We have no idea what part of the brain is, is associated with conscientiousness. And weirdly enough, the sorts of things that are associated with conscientiousness are very close to what theorists have identified as the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex say, which is the part of the brain that's the deals with the highest order of abstractions and the whole prefrontal cortex.

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       People have associated with the ability to plan and the ability to inhibit impulses and the ability to think in the longterm. And that all sounds like conscientiousness, but if you assess people's dorsal lateral prefrontal function with tests, cognitive tests that she, that are characterized by activation, when when people are doing those tests, their prefrontal Cortex is activated in say functional Mri. The correlation between the prefrontal ability assessed cognitively and conscientiousness itself is zero. So it's really weird because this also means to me that most theories of prefrontal function or wrong, so you can think about it this way, is that in order to, the prefrontal cortex does seem to be good at manipulating abstractions. But by definition an abstraction is something that's obstructed from the real world, right? It's no longer connected to the real world. And so when you're thinking about your future, say you've pulled abstract representations of the world up into this space where you're, where you're doing your thinking and it's a disembodied space, obviously you're not acting it out.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       And so you have to be able to dissociate the abstractions from the real world in order to manipulate the abstractions, which is thinking without acting them out. But the thing about conscientious people isn't that they make plants so much, it's that if they make a plan, then they do it. And so that means that there's this ability to take the abstraction, you know, while I promise to do x, okay, well that means you've been able to think up acts. But the next question is, if you promise to do it, will you do it? And the answer to that could easily be no and that it is the answer generally if you're not conscientious. But that doesn't seem to be associated with prefrontal function at all. And you see these weird dissociations in a lot of clinical cases. So borderline people with borderline personality disorder, a good example because they're very unconscientious and very high in neuroticism.

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       And they're often very smart. And so there are these people, you talk to them, you know, and, and they're perfectly capable of identifying what their problems are and even telling you what the causal pathways and even telling you about what they should do in the future. But they absolutely will not do it. So the ability to think and the, and the willingness to put those thoughts into operations seem to be set completely separable phenomenon. And, and we don't know much about the system that motivates people to put their plans into action or to keep a promise or to not procrastinate. We don't know what that's associated with. So there's no psychological model. There's no pharmacological model. We don't know how to increase conscientiousness. You know, you might think that when you give kids with attention deficit disorder, um, Ritalin, for example, that that might make them more conscientious, but, well, first there's no evidence for that because Ritalin is an amphetamine and that would make them more extroverted, generally speaking, because it's a dopaminergic agent.

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       And plus there's no evidence whatsoever that if you follow up people who have adhd who were on Ritalin in the long run, that the Ritalin does them any good whatsoever. In fact, there's the evidence is actually the reverse is that the longterm consequences of Ritalin user negative rather than positive. So now it's worse in our lab, like we've done all sorts of things to try to measure conscientiousness. So one of the things we did for example, because we thought of it as kind of persistence, you know, maybe like conscientious people will persist at boring tasks longer than non conscientious people. Sounds reasonable. Right? Because you know it, it sounds like you're kind of grabbing yourself at saying focus on this and don't be distracted. It has nothing to do with whether you're interested in it. So we had people do things like we made lines and lines of ends and amps and use and we had people count the use, which is pretty boring, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       And it's also difficult because ends and ams and use look a lot the same. And all that we found was that intelligence predicted it smarter people could do it more accurately and faster, right? No correlation whatsoever with conscientiousness. We couldn't get a correlation with any prefrontal tests, no Iq tests. And then we test use tests that were associated with the orbital frontal Cortex, which is sort of lower and a little bit more hooked into the limbic system. And we couldn't find any correlation between conscientiousness and performance on those tests either. We looked at like 200 different performance measures and conscientious did conscientiousness didn't predict any of them. We can't get people who are conscientious to do something better in the lab and people who aren't conscientious. And it's, it's a real puzzle because, you know, because it's such an important predictor of things like longterm life success and performance and political, the political affiliation, you'd think that you'd be able to discriminate between people who are conscientious and people who aren't conscientious the lab. Um, but I know that, that the chair of our department has recently used some attentional tasks to and showed a differentiation between conscientious people and hit unconscientious people. And so I'm hoping that I'm going to follow up with her to find out exactly what that is. But I mean it's been deadly different.

Speaker 2:          00:18:09       Cool. So,

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       so you know, Robert's the references for all this or at the end of the slides by the way, so I'm, I'm not going to go through the complete references, but research a researcher named Roberts has defined conscientiousness is the tendency to be planful organized task and goal oriented, self control and to delay gratification and to follow the norms and rules. So we looked at things too, like future discounting, you know, so future discounting would be, can play a future discounting game. So I'll do that with you very quickly. So I'm going to point at you and ask you a question so you can, it's not a trick by the way, so you don't have to worry about your answers. So I might say, okay, here's the deal. I can give you $10 today or I can give you $15 in a month. What would you take? Okay, good. Okay, so fine. I give you $50 today or $50 in a year. 15 today, 15 today. Okay, I'll give you $5 today or $50 a year. Okay, so now imagine that I played that game with one of you a hundred times, say or 200 times using different amounts, small and big over different timeframes. And what you can calculate is how much people value the present compared to the future. Now you should value the present a bit more than the future, right? Why?

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       That's right. The future is uncertain, so, so you have to discount it. So because you know, there's some probability that it isn't just going to occur, like maybe something will happen or maybe I'll, I won't be here. And then the farther out you go into the future, the more you have to discount it because it becomes really unpredictable. And you know, my experience, and I don't really know of any data to support this, but my experience has been that it's, it's pretty hard to plan in your life. It's pretty hard to plan more than three to five years into the future because, because there's so many variables that start to the effect of the variables that you're not accounting for. Start to, it starts to become exponential as you move out into the future. So you should discount the future because the present is more certain.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       Plus if you have $5 now, you can do something with it right now instead of waiting for two years to get your 50 and so that might be useful. But we thought that maybe conscientious people would discount the future less than unconscientious people. Right. It sounds like they would because it's sort of like delay of gratification. Can you wait for your $50 and we found that there was no correlation whatsoever with conscientiousness. If people were extroverted or if you made them happy, then they just counted the future. And w w the way we interpreted that was that, well if things are going well now you might as well capitalize on, you know, if, if, because if all the signals that are coming towards you say, well this is a good time, why not take the resources now and use them? So anyways, that's, that's just an example of how tricky this is.

Speaker 1:          00:21:07       You, you will notice if you know anything about prefrontal cortical function theories that all of these descriptions, planful, organized, task oriented and so on, have been attributed to the prefrontal cortex butter that, that uh, that research haven't found any evidence for that even though it's the prime theory of prefrontal function. Okay. So what, what is conscientiousness associated with? Well, denise and Heller have showed that if you measure it over any reasonable amount of time, it's associated with life satisfaction and happiness. Now you might want to ask yourself, well, what is life satisfaction or happiness? Which is a really good question, especially if you measured with the questionnaire because we've already established that if you measure with a questionnaire or something like emotion or personality, you get the Big Five. So it's not obvious that you can derive something like a life satisfaction or happiness questionnaire and have it measured something separate from the big five.

Speaker 1:          00:21:59       And so what happens is that most people who report that they're satisfied with life or happy are high in extroversion. They're happy and low in neuroticism. They're not unhappy. So that eats up a big chunk of the various and unsurprisingly, right? And so that sort of puts whether you're happy or satisfied with your life firmly in the domain of temperament, but it does turn out the conscientiousness also influences that, especially over longer spans of time. So hard work pays off. But it's tricky too because you also have to understand that hard work only pays off in a society that's very stable. And so maybe that's part of their, the reason for the association between industriousness and orderliness, right? Because maybe you work really hard to gather up your little pile of, of, uh, what would you call acquisitions and assets, which you need obviously. And then the whole society collapses and you know, the thugs come in and steal it all.

Speaker 1:          00:22:50       It's like, are you stupid? Because you should have just spent all that money before the thugs could steal it. And that's obviously the case in very many human societies. It's dangerous to be industrious because you'll gather up property that's valuable and then that just makes you a target. So it might be that industriousness doesn't pay off without order. Something like that. So, and I've also wondered too, it's like, well, I'll talk to you about that a little bit later. Okay. Now recently a researcher face guard, also working with Roberts, was looking at the emotions that might be associated with conscientiousness. And this is rather a new approach because we kind of thought that we had the emotions tied up already in the big five, right? There were the positive emotions and they loaded on extroversion. That's nice and simple. And there were the negative emotions and they loaded gun neuroticism and that's that. But it turns out that that's not that, that there are emotions that fall outside of the rubric, simply negative neuroticism and simply positive extroversion. And they seem to be what people have often called, like social emotions. And so those would be guilt and shame. Those are two of them because like you feel guilty maybe when you haven't lived up to an obligation. And so an obligation is usually something that occurs because it's, you're embedded in the social context and you feel ashamed.

Speaker 1:          00:24:13       That distinction between guilt and shame is a tricky one. You feel guilt for yourself and shame in front of other people. Something like that. You know, guilt won't necessarily make you turn red, but shame will. And so there's, you know, there's actual behavioral displays that are associated with these emotions. It turns out that conscientiousness is associated with guilt. Proneness but not the experience of guilt. That's a tricky thing. So let's say you're prone to guilt. Well that'll make you conscientious and if you're conscientious and now if you do the things you're supposed to do, then you don't have to feel guilt. So you can see why that would be rather tricky to discover. So guilt seems to be associated with conscientiousness and although this hasn't been assessed yet, we think that it's, it may be particularly associated with industriousness rather than ordering this. And the reason I'm pausing that, and it's not demonstrated yet.

Speaker 1:          00:25:05       The reason I'm positing that is because we know that orderliness is associated with something else. It's associated with sensitivity to discussed and discussed as a whole different emotion than fear or, or pain, let's say. And it's tricky because, you know, think of a horror movie. Okay, so what exactly constitutes horror? Well, there's the, um, what's that movie called? The witches of Blair witch project. Have you seen the Blair witch project? Okay. The Blair witch project is all fear. Nothing ever happens in the movie. It's just this horrible sense that something awful is going to happen at any moment. Pure fear. And so that's a horror movie. But then there's the other kind of horror movies where people get like sought up with chainsaws. And so then you think, well those, those both come under the horror rubric. But the one is almost pure fear. And then the other is what is it exactly?

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       Is it fear and disgust? So it looks like the splatter film, so to speak, capitalize on disgust and horror. And the, the, the sense of horror is partly fear. But also partly discussed. And so does disgust. Sensitivity system looks very old, evolutionarily, although it looks particularly well developed in human beings because it's not that obvious. It's not that obvious that animals show discuss the same way human beings do. I mean, think about dogs, right? Jesus, those things, they're, they're like, everything smells good to a dog, you know, and they'll eat virtually anything too. But humans aren't like that at all. We're very picky. Maybe because we're on numerous, I don't exactly know. We're very picky and you know, there's also specific facial expressions that are associated with disgust. You know, they're like that me, it's partly an expulsion facial expression. You're closing your eyes so you don't have to see it. You're closing your nose so you don't have to smell it. It's like repulsion and re repugnant or associated with disgust sensitivity. So, so here's the things that, yes. Do you have any questions? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:26:58       Um, so people that have eating disorders, do you think that are, because you said orderliness, you don't think that's related to deal with as much as the are high guys. Do you think that they have any sort of, because of sensitivity to discuss where, because of the video where I feel fields?

Speaker 1:          00:27:15       No, I think it's, my experience has been, they're pretty sensitive to discuss. And part of that seems to be, this is this constellation that I want to talk about. So being sensitive to discuss it seems to go along with a lot of other things like black and white moral thinking. It's like things are either good or they're not. And there's no gray area in between him. And I like anorexics are like that too to a great degree. Like it's black or white, there's no gray at all. And um, they're also very judgmental people who are orderly. And I think the black and white thinking goes along with the, with the, with the judgment. It's like while you read they're doing well or you're not, there isn't, there's no mucking about in the middle. And so they're hard on themselves, orderly people, but they're also hard on other people.

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       And one of the things we know for example, is that if you're conscientious, although it predicts workplace success and that sort of thing and general wellbeing, if you're conscientious and you become unemployed, you're in real trouble. Because you know, maybe because you're conservative in your fundamental orientation, you think all those people without jobs, they're just fundamentally useless. You know, if they just tried harder, they would get to where they're going, which of course has some truth to it, but not completely. So then you fall into that category and well then you're kind of, they say hoist with your own Fitara, right? Because now you're among the, the great unwashed and because your disgust sensitive, that's not going to make you very happy. So conscientious people suffer a lot when things happened to them that are bad because they also assume because they seem to be very fond of willpower, they also assume that well, with just enough effort and with just enough willpower, you can get yourself out of out of anything.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       And you know, that's sort of true. If you put a lot of effort into something, the probability that you'll do well increases. But that isn't the same as if you try hard enough, you can get out of anything. Right? You don't, you know what I need and the is they're really matters. So, um, cause there's lots of things that hard work isn't going to get you up and sometimes persisting and per separating if something is actually the wrong thing to do rather than the right thing to do. So it's very tricky. So the orderly types are conservative. To make you conservative, you have to be high in order to be this and low in openness, especially the more creative element of openness say rather than the intellect element. So that's interesting too because of course people tend to think that their political preferences established by the rationality, you know, I'm a liberal because being a liberal is the right way to be.

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       And here's a bunch of reasons why that's the way to be. And you know, I've thought that through and that's why I'm a liberal. It's like turns out that's probably completely wrong or at least mostly wrong. You have your temperament and your temperament makes you intrinsically value certain things. And then because you intrinsically valued them, the arguments about why those things are good or attractive to you. And then you remember those arguments. And so liberals for example, are much more concerned with harm and care than conservatives are. And conservatives are more concerned about things like purity. And so, and those are basic, you know, those are basic, you should be concerned about both of those things. So the purity issue, it's like, well what happens if your living quarters are filthy and, and your hygiene habits are terrible. The answer to that is your house gets full of parasites, rats and mice and bugs and you get sick and then you die.

Speaker 1:          00:30:31       And so, and maybe people around you do too. So you know, the purity issue really matters. You don't want to eat rotten meat. Do you want to make sure it's stored property? You don't want to have the rats eat all your grain, so you're grading. These have to be in really good order in, there can't be any holes in them. And so on. And so like orderliness and food preservation and, and preservation from illnesses and contamination and all those sorts of things. It's like, yeah, yeah, that's really important. You can't, you can't just push that away and say it's irrelevant. It's not irrelevant at all. So, but then again, you can make it to relevant, you know. So one of the things you see with the anorexics is that, you know, they're so sensitive to discuss that they can't stand their own bodies. And that's a weird thing, right?

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       Because like as a body, a good thing or a bad thing. Well here, here's an example. So here's an experiment. So you have, you give someone a sterilized cup and you say, well, you know, put some saliva in the cop and then you let it sit for 10 seconds and then you say, well drake, that right now in La, do you record like this? Right. And that's discussed, said, now you won't do that. But then you might ask, well, why, why wouldn't you do that? I mean, it was in your mouth like 10 seconds ago. So like what's the big problem while people, people won't do it. And you can see a heuristic at work there, right? The heuristic is don't drink saliva. And it's not like moderated by any sort of trivial situational determinants. You're just not going to do it. But I suspect that you do kiss your partner for example, right?

Speaker 1:          00:32:00       And then you think, oh, well that's kind of a weird exception. It's like, oh well my partner turns out not to be disgusting. At least that's what you hope. And then, and so, you know, there's this and that, you know, and, and there's also this weird inhibitory process that goes on between sexual attraction and discuss to, you know, and, and the psychoanalysts, you know, they were, they thought of that as something that was perhaps somewhat pathological, sexual guilt, sexual shame, disgust and all that. But far as I can tell, it's a, it's a, it's a biological moderating factor in part of the reason for that as well. You know, just how many sexually transmitted diseases do you actually want to have, especially that many of them are, you know, syphilis in the 19th century. Man That was, that was deadly. It was transmissible from generation to generation.

Speaker 1:          00:32:47       It acted like every other kind of disease and there wasn't any cure for it. And then of course we had aids in the 1980s we kind of got a handle on that, but it was just bloody lock, you know? And it was a very transmissible and so sexual contamination is a big issue and it always has been for the human race because it turns out that sexual activities really good way of transmitting disease. So you know, the, the borderline between discussed as something that protects you in your life and discussed as something that turns you off of life completely. It's, it's a really tight and, and contradictory set of like mutual inhibiting forces. It's a real problem for people. So, okay, so, so, so what do you, what do you have orderliness? Okay. Orderly people are black and white thinkers. They're judgmental. If you talk, if you show orderly, people imagine that you have them dis, you described to them some kind of crime, like maybe it's living off the fruits of prostitution.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       So maybe you talk to them about a pimp and you know, you give them a little story about the pimp and then you say, how long should this pimp you thrown in jail? It's like the orderly people think you just lock them up, throw away the key. You know, they're, they're, they judged moral transgressions very harshly. And so that's part of the, that's part of the aspect that's judgmental. They're nodding Galitary and either they don't think that everybody should have the same amount all the time. They're pretty, they're pretty interested in hierarchy and structure. And you know, there's some real advantages to hierarchy. Um, people think that they'd be happier in an egalitarian situation. But the problem with the egalitarian situations is people are always arguing, right? Because no one's right in an egalitarian situation. There just, everybody gets to have their opinion and it's like, you know, when are we going to stop with all the opinions and do something.

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       And the thing about a hierarchy is the advantage to a hierarchy is there are things you are responsible for, but there's also things you're not responsible for. And that's a big advantage. And then you also know who is responsible for those things. So it looks like people are more comfortable in hierarchies then they think even if they're liberals. So that's kind of interesting to be. So anyways, all those things seem to chunk together. Now the industrious people also seem to want to climb up the hierarchy, right? Cause you know that industrious people become more successful as they move through life. And so you think, well that's sort of a motivation. But then you might ask, is the investment is person trying to get to the top or is the industrious person trying to get the hell away from the bottom? And my suspicions are that the industrious person is trying like hell to get away from the bottom.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       They don't want to be down there with the, you know, like I said, the unemployed and the great unwashed and now why? Well, here's a bunch of reasons. First of all, we know pretty clearly that if you're in a dominance hierarchy, the closer you are to the bottom of the hierarchy, the more likely you to die. So when that's independent of absolute income, like obviously if you're poor enough that's going to make a difference cause you're just, you're going to starve to death. But assuming you have enough money to take care of your basic needs, then dominance, hierarchy position is a big determinant of mortality even in heart disease and, and, and more if you look at songbirds or any other kind of animal that lives in the dominance hierarchy. And that's pretty much the case for all animals. So imagine you have a garment in Turkey of songbirds in your neighborhood and the high dominant songbirds.

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       So there may be industrious songbirds. They get the best nest and then you think, well what is the best nest mean? Well, it's close to nesting material so they don't have to like exert a lot of energy building the nest and it, it's, it's dry when it rains, so that's a good thing because then their eggs don't get wet and get cold and there aren't a lot of predators look lurking around and it's well hidden and, and it's well ventilated. Like there's a bunch of things that make an optimal nesting site really useful. So there's a bunch of birds and some of them have great nesting sites and some of them have like, you know, slum nesting sites. And then some kind of epidemic comes through. Guess what happens? The birds die from the bottom of the hierarchy upwards. Well, why? Because the ones at the bottom are chronically stressed and stress shuts off your immune system.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       And so it's like poof. Epidemic comes through dead. And so one of the things that may well have been built into human beings as the biological basis of industriousness is the desire to get the hell away from the bottom of a dormant. It's Harkey as fast as possible because you're much more likely to die if you're down there. And you know, we know that your trait preferences have emerged as a consequence of evolutionary pressure. And if the bottom of the dominance hierarchy happens to be the place where diseases, right, which is exactly how it is, then of course you should be motivated to get the hell out of there. And so I think a lot of the class distinctions that people draw and their desire to have markers of status and so on are are a reflection of their high motivation to be associated with the high levels of the, of the economic classes.

Speaker 1:          00:37:43       Here's something interesting. For example, you know that names go down the dominance hierarchy, you know, so what are you gonna name your children? Well the origin nater of names are the people at the top of the dog. It's hard and you know, and then once they established the names then the next group starts to copy them and then the next group copies them. And then by the time the name gets common at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy, the people at the top are no longer using it. They've got some other, Dave's figured out. And so names get not only generated that way but also recycled that way. So, and you never want to underestimate the motivation of people to not be at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy. And so it's kind of the reverse of achievement motivation, right? It's sort of like getting away.

Speaker 1:          00:38:26       But if conscientiousness is mostly associated with these kind of negative emotions, guilt, shame, and disgust, then those are all getting away from emotions. Those are, oh, it's good to go that way. Emotions. But those would be more associated with extroversion and openness. So when conscientious people seem to be dutiful, so they're not doing things because they're interested in them. In fact, they would say, who the hell cares? If you're interested in it, do it anyways. That's what a good citizen does. And of course there's some truth in that, right? You do your damn duty. So, okay, so you kind of get the sense of how conscientiousness is, is structured now that's often be called a behavioral immune system. So the other thing we know about orderly people and conservatives is there, anti-immigration, as I said, and their aunt and their xenophobics or they're much more pro in group and they're quite harshly judgmental in their attitudes towards nonstandard sexual behavior.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       And you can explain that all in terms of contamination fear. And so, and you might think to, you know, like, hey, you know what happened to the native Americans when the European showed out pay because the Europeans, they lived in these like filthy, filthy cities. They're just crammed together and they lived with their animals too. So like they, they were parasite written and they had all sorts of diseases but they got it good, good immune systems functioning as a consequence of that. And over, you know, a period of a long period of time they developed immunity to things that would have otherwise killed them. Like, well chicken pox and measles and that sort of thing. So the Europeans came over to North America and they shook hands with the natives. It was like Poof, 95% of them died in the next 50 years. So it was like, by the time the settlers came to Plymouth Rock, you know, the pilgrims, there are so few native Americans laughed that they were happy to see them cause they couldn't get the damn crops off.

Speaker 1:          00:40:12       There were enough people left. So part of the reason that North America looked empty when the European showed up is because three successive waves of absolutely catastrophic plagues had decimated the entire population of the, of the continent. You know, in the same thing still happens when, when, when the, you know, when in places like Brazil and Peru when they find isolated native groups in the jungle because you know, that still happens now and then it's like, oh look, some natives shake your hand, poof, they're all dead in like a year. So the, the idea that the, the foreign person is a danger has, has been like critically, critically correct for much of human developmental history. And that's a real problem, right? Because obviously in the modern world we better get along with everybody because of course we're all powerful enough to wipe each other out. But you know, the problem is is you might think about things like xenophobia, you know, preference for your own group and out group, uh, prejudice and that kind of thing as like a cognitive issue.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       While you could just sort it out if you thought it properly, but this is all this research indicates it's a lot worse than that. It's some sense because it's grounded in something much deeper and nor reason grounded in something much deeper. It seems to be grounded in something that's necessary, right? If you're not disgust sensitive, well then your hygiene habits aren't very good. Well then you get sick more. Plus you don't work as hard, then your life isn't as good, you know? So it's, it's another one of those examples where where the virtue is and where the vices is very, very difficult thing to tell. So, so I'm going to read this. This is from a paper that I wrote with, with one of my students named Jacob Hersch. We haven't published this paper yet. I want to read it to you because like I said, I don't have this information at hand point as well as I would like to.

Speaker 1:          00:41:57       So this way I can get the information to better. Disgust is considered to be one of the basic human emotions defined by a strong revulsion and desire to withdraw from enlisting stimulus or event. Darwin noted this fact that 1872 so he was the first person to note that discussed was a basic emotion, physically disgust. It's accompanied by a distinct facial expression involving constriction of the oral and nasal cavities. You know, and that's a really good way to insult someone. You know, all you have to do to really insult someone's making discussed face at the Mar. It's something they said. They really do not like that because basically what you're saying is you're kind of like a parasite or an infectious disease. Evolutionary models of discuss propose that this emotion involved to help us avoid contaminated or harmful foods or other potential sources of diseases such as sexual content in addition to its role in directly helping to expel harmful foods from the body discussed also forms an important component of the behavioral immune system.

Speaker 1:          00:42:52       The suite of psychological mechanisms that aid in the detection and avoidance of potential contaminants before they can make contact with the body means obsessive compulsive disorder. You know, people will touch something that they regard as contaminated, then rush off to wash their hands and wash and wash and wash. If some of them are washed, delete the soaps, gone. They'll have showers until they run out of hot water. Like they just can't stop. That's part of obsessive compulsive disorder. It looks like it's a disorder of disgust, even though it's classified with the anxiety disorders, harsh inducing disgust responses, whether via a foul order, a disgusting work environment, or we calling it disgusting experience leads individuals to assign harsher punishments to others who had committed moral transgressions. Ha. Here's something else. So if your judges, if your judge is easily disgusted, then you've done something relatively disgusting.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       Or maybe if the court room doesn't smell so good that day, well then you're going to end up in jail longer. It also, here's the worst situation. You go into cart and you're applying for parole. Okay? And it's just before lunch and the court room doesn't smell good. It's like you're not gonna get parole because Hungary judges are much more likely to deny you parole. And then of course judges who are sensitive to discuss are going to regard your moral transgression as harsher and you can prime that. And so you, I think the data showed that judges after lunch or like 70% more likely to grant parole. It's like it's whether or not the judge is hungry is more, it's a bigger determinant of whether or not you get parole than what you've done. It's really quite, it's really quite funny. You know, unless you're up for parole, harsher moral judgments can even be induced following the consumption of a bitter drink because people are often disgusted by bitterness and addition the same disgust related facial expressions or observed in response to unpleasant tastes, disgusting photographs and receiving unfair treatment in an economic game.

Speaker 1:          00:44:47       So our sense of justice, that's a weird thing. Our sense of justice seems to be, who would guess that day that it's, that it's, that it's centered in our, you know, from a biological perspective in the systems that mediate discussed. So I've seen this, you know, among people who've, who've received an injustice, you know, so, so some things being done to them that's not good and they're often unable to let it go, partly because they're disgusted with themselves for not responding to it properly. It's like, you know, if someone throws a dark at you and then it's like you have a moral obligation to respond to that, right? And you can think about it as anger or something like that. But part of it also seems to be that you're ashamed if you don't respond. And you can see that sort of thing happening in cultures of honor, you know, where if, if purity is violated, you see these in these situations where, you know, a father maybe kills his daughter, which happens reasonably often because she's violating some sort of social norm.

Speaker 1:          00:45:43       Part of the idea is that, well, you know, if you don't respond harshly to something that's associated with disgust, then you bring dishonor on your entire family and maybe your own, your entire community. And you know, we don't like that sort of thinking in the west, but, well, but the reasons that we don't approve of that sort of thinking, we think it's because we're liberal. But I think the evidence suggests that the reason that we don't approve of those sorts of behaviors is because we live in a very clean environment and we have plumbing. And so there's all sorts of things that we do that reduced the probability that we're going to be contaminated by parasites or infectious diseases. And so that means that we don't feel that it's necessary to respond as harshly to moral transgressions. And you know, you might think, well I doubt it, but let me show you the evidence because it's, it's unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          00:46:33       Concerns about cleanliness and feelings of disgust have likewise been related to political attitudes, situational reminders of the importance of physical cleanliness, such as asking participants to wipe their hands with antiseptic wipes tends to increase self reported political conservatism. Such a finding is consistent with the notion that purity tends to be valued more by conservatives than by liberals. Individuals who report being disgusted more easily also tend to hold more conservative political views on topics including abortion, gay marriage, tax cuts, and affirmative action. In addition to the effects that have emerged when using self report disgust, sensitivity, more conservative political views have also been associated with stronger physiological reactivity to disgusting images. We've found that conservatives are not only more aroused by disgusting stimulant, they're more aroused by any stimuli. Happiness, hunger, fear, you name it, it affects the conservative than the liberal. And then we've also found that if you put, you take undergraduates and you expose them to videos, but induced various physiological states, happiness, sadness, fear, disgust.

Speaker 1:          00:47:42       And then we also asked people how long it was since the last eight. Well, if you put people in one of those emotional or motivational states and then you show them political speeches, the more emotional they are or the hungrier, the more they like conservative speeches. So that was actually very interesting. So a large literature is converged on the notion that there are two core dimensions of conservative political ideology, resistance to change and tolerance of inequality. Okay. Resistance to change reflects the extent to which people wish to maintain the status quo. While tolerance of inequality reflects the acceptance of an unequal distribution of resources and opportunities within society. You don't want to, so there's the sort of the idea that the bash rise to the top and the best is moral judgment and the top is the right place for the best people to be.

Speaker 1:          00:48:33       And then you might ask, well, why is the top the best? I mean, why did we assume that the, the, the, the top of a dominance hierarchy is the right place to be? Well, part of it is of course, that the closer you are to the top of the dominance hierarchy, especially if you're a male, the more likely it is that you're going to, you know, um, be attractive to people of the opposite sex. So there's, that's partly it, but then this other thing seems to be, well, it's actually a bit, it is a better place to be at the top because it's, it's cleaner and safer and there are more resources there. And so that accounts, at least in part for the judgment of the people who were at the bottom of the hierarchy. So these two dimensions of you're roughly aligned with social and economic conservatism as expressed in the constructs of right wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation respectable, which you, which you could measure hypothetically with questionnaires. So these core facets of conservatism are also closely related to to higher order value dimensions described in moral foundations theory, which reflect preferences for order and tradition on the one hand and preferences for egalitarianism on the other.

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       Okay, so we'll, we'll leave that part. Political conservatives conservatism confess be thought of as a social immune system reflecting the extension of pathogen avoidance mechanisms to the integrity of the social system. Just as the behavioral immune system has been conceptualized as helping to maintain the purity and integrity of an individual body. So to May the same pathogen avoidance system help to maintain the abstract integrity of the social order. In particular, the social immune system would help to maintain order by suppressing any actions or individuals to deviate from a group's accepted social traditions. So it has been reported, for instance, that regions with higher levels of disease preference prevalence tend to be associated higher levels of social conformity and autocratic rule. Individuals who feel more vulnerable to disease likewise report higher levels of ethnocentrism, xenophobia. Such basic concerns about pathogen avoidance be does contribute to the desire for order and tradition among conservatives along with the harsh moral judgements associated with violations of the social order.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       In particular, severe moral judgements may be a key mechanism by which the social immune system instantiated in conservative practices and policies aims to eliminate exposure to deviate social elements that may increase the risk pathogen exposure. Okay, now we wrote that about two years ago now. There was a paper published about three months ago in plause one which you can look up online. I've got the reference for it here. Now. This paper is absolutely mind boggling, so I told you guys what effect sizes are big, right? Like 0.2 that's pretty good 0.3 that's larger than about two thirds of social science studies published 0.5 it's like, well, you're dancing on moon because you just don't get a correlation. To a 0.5 between two things. Unless you're extraordinarily lucky. It's like 95th percentile effect size. Okay, so this paper was published about three months ago. Now I'm going to read you the abstract.

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       Okay, and then I'm going to show you briefly show you the data. According to the parasite stress hypothesis, authoritarian governments are more likely to emerge in regions characterized by high prevalence of disease causing pathogens. Recent cross national evidence is consistent with this hypothesis, but there are inferential limitations associated with the evidence because salad, you don't know what direction that direction relationship is. We report to studies that address some of those limitations and provide further tests of the hypothesis. Study one revealed that parasite prevalence, and so that's parasites or infectious diseases predicted strongly predicted cross national differences on measures assessing individual's authoritarian personalities and this effect statistically mediated the relationship between parasite prevalence and authoritarian governance. So what does that mean? More infectious diseases in the area. The more likely the individuals in that area are to have authoritarian political beliefs and it's the authoritarian, authoritarian political beliefs of the people, the individuals in the area that produces the authoritarian government.

Speaker 1:          00:52:44       So it isn't pathogen prevalence, authoritarian government, authoritarianism. It's not a top down thing. It's a bottom up thing and it's driven by individuals and that seems to be driven by just how likely they are to catch something that's nasty and infectious. So then you think, well in the west, well what's the probability you're going to catch something nasty and infectious? It's like, well, very low. So you're liberal. Now. Wouldn't that be something if that was actually the case, you know, is that the west is liberal because it has plumbing or could easily be, I mean plumbing is no trivial thing, right? That mean you think of all the things you don't want to do without. It's like in Canada, plumbing would be number one and then maybe he would be number two more. Maybe you would reverse those, but it's way the hell up their study to have tested the parasite stress hypothesis on a sample of traditional small scale studies, results revealed that parasite prevalence predicted measures of authoritarian governance and did so even when statistically controlling for other threats to human welfare.

Speaker 1:          00:53:43       So it was, it was pathogen prevalence, particularly one additional threat famine also uniquely predicted authoritarianism. Okay, so it's famine and disease. Together these results further substantiate the parasite stress hypothesis of authoritarianism and suggested societal differences in the authoritarian governance result in part from cultural differences in individual's authoritarian personalities. There's the data. Now you look, this is just, it's just unbelievable. So look at this. So one is authoritarian governance, right? There's the correlation with pathogen prevalence 0.42. So there's another, um, failure that I didn't show here that chosen either, this is from study to study one. The correlation was 0.65. It's like, Huh, isn't that interesting? Maybe the reason that there are authoritarian countries in the world is because there's too many infectious diseases. And so the waiting to get rid of authoritarianism is to get rid of infectious diseases. So God, who would have ever guessed that, you know, and look at the it warfare was negative 0.11, right?

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       Do you think that might be associated with authoritarian? Melik? Malnutrition wasn't even very big predictor. You know, famine, actually men hit the hit the hit the equation. So Feminine, the probability of disease. So now let's look at this from a sociocultural perspective. So I spend a lot of time studying Hitler because I'm interested in the ideological possession. You know, tinder is a great example of that because, well, because his ideology was so harsh, but it was also so attractive to people, it was so unbelievably attractive. You know, when you're going to ask how the hell you account for something like that. So, um, I'm going to dim the lights a little bit here because you guys have to be able to see this. So, all right, so you look on the right theory. That's the Nuremberg parade ground. So I hope you can see this a little bit, that the left, and that's all people, right?

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       So the Nazis built this parade ground and Nuremberg that was like the biggest parade ground ever built on the planet. And they'd have hundreds of thousands of people at these rallies, right? And so you look at the order, if there's a line down the middle there where the leaders walk, and that's at Nuremberg, and then it's just surrounded by these masses and masses and masses of people in lines and all these orderly displays of power. And then there's Hitler there like this. And one of the things Hitler was really proud of was the fact that he could stand like that for like eight hours. And that was willpower as far as he was concerned. And he was a worshiper of willpower and he bathed four times a day. So he's also somebody who was very much obsessed with cleanliness, cleanliness, and willpower and order. So that's Hitler.

Speaker 1:          00:56:28       So now we'll look at that. That's something that's Nurburg again, so this is called the cathedral of lights. And so that, that's the parade ground Darragh at the bottom that I just showed you, that was full of people. So you get some idea of how big that is. Now all those lights around that which they called the cathedral of likes was the Luftwaffe, gave the Nazis all their antiaircraft lights and then they arranged them around the parade grounds. So the whole thing was enclosed by this perfectly orderly cathedral of lights. And that was part of the spectacle that went along with the Nazi with the Nazi [inaudible] Nazi party rallies at Nuremberg.

Speaker 1:          00:57:06       And then so you know, you look at the top left when they are, those are, those are soldiers, those are, I can't remember at the Nuremberg rallies, they had all sorts of people there. They had like the shovel brigade and they were all standing there with their shovels ready to go. Shovel for Germany and and athletes and all sorts of people arrayed. So that you know, there, there's this massive display of order in power. So you look at the top left hand corner, you see all those people are lined up, it's absolutely perfect. And then you see the same thing when the right here. And Look, you look at the organization of that, everything's square and perfect and everybody's in line and you know, they're all in uniforms and they're all going like this the same way. And then when they, when they marched the soldiers, they were in perfect lines, perfect squares, and they're all going like this.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       You know, it's, it's absolutely rigid, orderly perfection. And so the Germans, what Germans tend to be conscientious, you know, which is part of the reason why they have excellent engineers and part of the reason why their economies so damn powerful. But one of the downsides of conscientiousness is orderliness, right? And so well, you know, people think the Nazis were uncivilized, but the new evidence seems to suggest that they weren't down civilized at all. They were really, really, really civilized. And that if you get too civilized to orderly, to conscientious, then things go to hell in a handbasket very, very rapidly. So now this, some of this stuff is awful, but I'm going to read it to you anyways because you need to know how this sort of things work now. No Hitler emerged into power in the 1930s when, when Germany was in a real state of chaos, right?

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       Cause it was after the second world war or the first world war. You have to remember what happened at the end of the first world war, the Spanish flu, the Spanish flu epidemic, which was generated in the trenches because you can generate really intense, intentionally deadly, um, illnesses if the owners can be transmitted from one person to another very quickly, right? Because the, it's okay for the organism to kill you as long as you last long enough to get the eldest to the next person. And so if you're all crammed together, it filthy conditions. The illness can just hop from person to person. And so it can breed particularly deadly forms. That's what happened with Spanish flu. And then the Spanish flu went all around the world and it killed more people than World War One did. Okay. So that was world war one. Then there was the Spanish flu, then the Germany economy fell completely apart and there was hyper inflation.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       And so there was complete chaos. And then the Germans were worried that the communists were going to take over and it was like, it was like a little bit of hell on earth and so long came Hitler. Now Hector was one of these orderly types. And so here's the kind of language he used. This is from a pamphlet from 1936 the Jew as world parasite, the people in the world will recognize the Jew as world parasite and there will be a time when there will be one united front of all people against the Jewish world parasite. And it depends with vans and humanity will be freed from the most severe illness for much it's suffered through thousands of years. Now you can think about this as metaphor and of course it is metaphor, but it's a weird because it's not precisely conscious metaphor. What seems to be happening is because Hitler's one of these people who's hypersensitive to discussed an extremely orderly, it's, it's natural for his mind to conceive of categories in this way.

Speaker 1:          01:00:21       Hidden there was always talking about the area and people as like pure and perfect, but also as a body. So the area in race was a body. And the problem that the area in Ray's faced was that there was all these parasites that were attacking it and it was the moral obligation of the Germans to push back against those parasitical forces. So, so here's what happened in Germany. So Hitler, when he came to power, some of the things that happened to Germany, he's first started a public health campaign. And so he had these vans that had doctors in the Max ray machines and so on. And they went all over Germany screening people for tuberculosis, which you know, was infectious disease and also a particularly terrible one. They actually knocked down the rates of tuberculosis in Germany quite a lot. So it was like, well, let's, let's embark on a public health and cleanliness campaigns.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       Like, well, okay, you can get rid of tuberculosis that way. So then, then the next thing that he did, or one of the next things that he did was he was kind of irritated about how messy and ugly the German factories were. So, you know, cause they're kind of dirty and they've got rats in them and mice and bugs and so on. And so the next thing that they decided to do was to clean up the factory. So they had people, you know, a sweeping them all up and fixing the grounds in front and planting flowers and that kind of thing. And they were fumigating them to get rid of the parasites. And the fumigation agent they used, was it insecticide called Zyklon B and [inaudible] was the gas that was eventually used in the concentration camps. And so, so you can see the connection there, right?

Speaker 1:          01:01:47       It's like a logical progression of ideas. So the next thing that happened was that, uh, they decided their clean up the mental asylums, right? Because well, you know, do you really want those sorted defective people being parasites on everyone else and should they really be allowed to reproduce? If Navy, it'd be just better to, you know, euthanize them because they are useless and they're suffering anyways. And so that seemed to go pretty well. And then, well then you know, what happened next, you know, then the, the extension, the next extension was well to anything that was foreign, like a foreign body. And then this showed up in all sorts of weird ways. So, um, not see as the most who grew to some degree out of like nature worship. I don't know how else to describe it. There were kind of nature cults in Germany in the 1930s and they went way back and one of the things the nature coats were concerned about in Germany with the presence of invasive species in the German, uh, you know, in, in the German ecological system.

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       You know, when we complained about that now too, because, you know, you get plants coming over from China and places like that, that, you know, spread through ecosystems and hypothetically disrupt them. But you know, and that seems like a reasonable thing to be concerned about. But, but the reason I'm pointing out the connection is because you never know where these systems of ideas are going to lead. Right? It's like, oh, contamination. Okay, fair enough. You know what contaminations real well, who's responsible for the contamination? Hot. That's where things start to get tricky. You know, when the Nazis just kept pushing them, pushing the limit. And so I'll show you some of the things that come from Hitler speeches or right, it's, this is from my end comp. So since the state did not possess the power to master the disease, the menacing decay of the right was manifest.

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       It's, that's all disgust, sensitivity, contamination. The masses feel that the mere fact of the Jews existence is as bad as the plague. Politicians tinkering around on the German national body saw it. Most of the forms of our general disease, but blindly ignored the virus at the time of the unification. The inner decay was already in full swing and the general situation was deteriorating from year to year. So it's all, you know, decay and disgust and contamination metaphor. The symptoms of decay of the prewar period can be reduced to racial causes. The Nation did not grow inwardly healthier, but obviously language more and more. Anyone who wants to cure this era, which is inwardly sick and rotten, must first of all summon up the courage to make clear the causes of the disease. Um, they think that they must demonstrate that they are ready for appeasement so as to stay the deadly cancerous ulcer through a policy of moderation.

Speaker 1:          01:04:29       The Jew must take care that the plague does not die. If this battle should not come, Germany would decay and at best would sync to ruin like a rotting corpse. You can see in the right today an example of mortal decay. The 1st of May can only be the liberation of the nation spirit from the infection of internationalism, the restoration to health of peoples against the infection of materialism against the Jewish pestilence, we must hold a loft, a flaming ideal. Now that's interesting because hidden, they're reading light. The use of fire. Fire was a really primary element. Fire and light. We're real primary elements in the Nuremberg rallies and you know, fire has this purification element, right? That's partly why they used to burn heretics at the state. It was like that's how you, you purify things with fire. And of course you do purify things with fire.

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       Part of the reason that we cook things is because if you cook them, then the pathogens die and then that's purification. So it's not illogical. I gave orders to burn out, burn out, down to the raw flesh, the ulcers of this poisoning of the wealth. Really unbelievably harsh, harsh language. The only permanent way to cure disease conditions is to disclose their causes. Uh, let's see. This is the battle against a veritable world sickness which threatens to infect the peoples of plague, which devastates whole peoples and international pestilence. The international carrier of the bacillus must be fought if within this community, one state is infected, that infection is decisive for all alike. And then so, and he doesn't know, he also doesn't just address this sort of language towards the sorts of people that he ended up eradicating or trying to eradicate in the camps. He also used that with regards to communists.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       So we have very real interest in seeing to it that this bullshit is plague shall not spread over Europe. National Socialism has made our people and therefore the right immune from a Bolshevik infection. Um, it's Saturday. You get the point and here's some more language from this metaphor from a book. And I'll tell you the book in a minute. This is the man who wrote this book, analyzed Hitler's writings and his speeches looking for metaphorical foundations. Um, the spider was slowly beginning to suck the blood out of the people's pores. Um, here are we face, we'll have the list eating like poisonous abscesses into the nation. It's all this like you can hardly read these things without being disgusted by them. You know, it's all language that's associated with disgust at not with fear. And so that seemed to be very, very appealing to the Germans have the time. Horrible language. I'm going to show you a bit of a film now. Um, no, we don't have a lot of time for it unfortunately, but I'll, I'll show you a little bit of it anyways. Um, don't we use this? It kind kinda shows you how this, how this, how these ideas were portrayed in, in like call propaganda and effective propaganda means might affect the prompt. Again,

Speaker 2:          01:08:18       [inaudible] the political route shovel.

Speaker 1:          01:11:45       So you get the picture. I mean, you could hardly get a more compelling representation of perfect orders and that, you know, how many thousands of people do you think there are? They're all nicely arranged into perfect squares, all moving at exactly the same way. It's like war against pestilence. It's a very strange way of looking at the Second World War, but the evidence is increasingly strong that that's the right way to look at. All right, so we'll see you guys on Tuesday.
