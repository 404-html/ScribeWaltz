Speaker 1:          00:00          Today I'm talking to Jonathan Passagio who I think is touched with more than a little bit of genius and he's a Quebecois artists and a carver, a sculptor, and I'd like to start by letting Jonathan tell us who he is and what he does.

Speaker 2:          00:15          Okay. So yeah, I'm a, I'm an icon carver, which means that I make, I make carving for churches and for people of traditional images. So I get commissions and I, and I work within a traditional language of, of, of Christian art. I've been doing that for about five years now, full time. And before that I actually lived in Africa for seven years working with artisans. They're trying to help them, uh, in their business practices and their, their design skills. So I have a very kind of strange and varied background. I studied fine arts at Concordia University here in Montreal. In the. Yeah, in the late nineties. So yeah, full time icon carvers. Do you suppose there are in Canada and in Canada there the. I'm the only one we're about actually in the, in the entire world where we're very few. I actually know most of them. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:05          it doesn't sound like a very easy thing to monetize. So how did, how in the world did you go from being a, an art student trained at Concordia to being a carver of icons?

Speaker 2:          01:15          I studied painting and drawing at Concordia on the surface. I was doing really well. I actually finished first in my, in my class, but there was a malaise the whole time I was working there because I'm a Christian. I grew up, I grew up a Christian and I was trying to figure out how that would connect to my art practice. Uh, and so I was, I was looking, trying to figure out symbolic languages and in painting and trying to find ways to talk about bigger, bigger questions, metaphysical ideas in my paintings, but I didn't have the language so I was really just groping around almost blind and uh, yeah, it. And at the end of my time at Concordia, the professor who was supervising me, she, she basically said on the very last day she said, what are you doing here? This is not, this is not the place for you. After that I, it kind of left me dangling, you know, and, and a questioning a lot of things. So what sort of education did you get a concordia? All the fine arts programs now in, in I think pretty much almost 100 percent are based on contemporary art practices and so very few universities, very few programs teach a technical skills or teach you how to draw in a, in a classical way so they actually not really teaching anything. It's hard to know exactly what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          02:29          I guess it was ever since the 19 sixties through speeding this idea in the art world that technical skills and ability just aren't that important and that the important thing is to find your, I would say your political voice, but it's very strange to me that this has occurred because it seems to me that before your voice is anything but a, an off color Croak, you have to become a disciple of a discipline and an apprenticeship and learn the tools and trades of craft and learn how to be an artist because there's a technical end to that.

Speaker 2:          03:03          I mean, this is really almost an image of the world as it stands now. The, the, the purpose or the stated purpose of, of, of modern efficient, postmodern art was to free the artist, right to break, to break away all the things that were holding the artist back in terms of rules and in terms of, of, uh, just the way things were presented. But when ended up happening is that there were no more legitimate legitimizing objective or you know, strong legitimizing structures around the art. The only thing left was politics and relationships and status basically. So our funders,

Speaker 1:          03:37          there's a big literature on creativity and it's strongly, which I know very well. My lab designed the creative achievement questionnaire which is used. It's been used in hundreds of studies now to assess lifetime creativity. And so I've spent a lot of time looking at the measurement of creativity and also trying to understand creativity. And the literature strongly suggest that when you impose restrictions on people, it actually makes them more creative rather than less. Because part of what creativity is the overcoming of obstacles. You know, imagine someone who writes poetry and the Haiku format, well, it's, it's very, very restrictive and obviously arbitrarily sold, but the fact of the restriction is partly what makes the poetic form possible. The same thing is true. If you think about playing a game, there's a, there's far more things that you can't do when you play chess than there are things that you can do, but there's still an infinite number of variations of chess games. So this idea that there's a dichotomy between structure and rules and creativity is, is pernicious Lee false and contradicted by the evidence

Speaker 2:          04:43          when you, when you start to explore the art world and the way it works is there's an irony there that it purports to not have boundaries on creativity and structures on Tina, but they're actually extremely strict and they're hidden. They're, they're kind of this pernicious thing underneath where we're actually you, you have to present things in a very, very precise way for it to be able to, to enter into the legitimizing structure of the, of the gallery, the, the. It's like the message that I was trying to work on. And the, um, the, the, the structure of contemporary artists didn't fit together. And so at some point I gave up on art. I, I had to work, you know, I had a studio and I closed it down. I just destroyed all my paintings. It was, it was actually a moment of, of kind of spiritual crisis for me.

Speaker 2:          05:26          And it's in that, in that moment that I discovered many medieval art, I discovered traditional Christian art. And when I discovered traditional Christian art, it was exactly what you were saying before, the forms of Christian artwork kind of developed as a community would say as a, the Christian community develop these forms that were actually extremely powerful and, and, and created like a, a cosmic map basically. And so you could use, you could use these images as a type of Algebra to create a sacred, a sacred language. And so discovering that, yeah, I just felt like, yeah, it gave me so much possibility. Well, you're going back

Speaker 1:          06:04          like 800 years, 900 years into the history, maybe even farther than that, back into the history of traditional art. So you say you discovered Christian iconography and I also know that you're, you're, you're an Orthodox Christian, which is a strange thing for a quebecois. So I don't know, you're a pretty rare bird, so maybe you could, you could say a few words about the discovery of the iconography, how that came about and also how it is that you converted to Orthodox Christianity.

Speaker 2:          06:32          Well, I mean those two things are very intricately related. I think during, during university, just like a lot of people, I, I kind of got into an intellectual and spiritual crisis. I was reading data and, and all the postmodern theorists trying to wrap my head around this, like what does this mean for me and what is it? What is going on? Um, and, and it's in that kind of crazy time that I started reading the church fathers and, and reading more traditional breeding, more traditional authors, people who talk about traditions in different, different cultures and realizing that this was really the solution for, for me at least, it was a solution to kind of get out, get out of the chaos that, that, that the modern world that kind of fallen into. And so it, when it came with the art, so looking at the art and seeing the patterns emerge and seeing that those patterns in the art were the same as you find in scripture and the same that you find in liturgy in the same that you find in the stories that are around us, even stories that aren't actually Christian to see those patterns emerge is what really caught my attention.

Speaker 2:          07:40          And, and, and so I was looking at first, I wasn't necessarily going to be Orthodox. I could see the patterns coming through and I was trying, you know, trying to figure out and I couldn't find them in my own meat, which is which I grew up evangelical. Uh, and so I, I was looking for it, I couldn't find it, I looked at Catholicism, but finally I, I felt that I am looking at Orthodox. I felt like Orthodoxy was the type of Christianity that had preserved the most of that ancient worldview and was still living at today. So it's a, it's a living tradition. It, you know, when you say you went back 800 years in a way that's true, but it's not true for the Orthodox because they continue to perpetuate those, those forums until today. I mean, not that they didn't go through rocky times, obviously it's been crazy for orthodoxy as well, but for some reason they've been able to constantly revive their forums, you know, and today it's a thriving, a thriving part of Christianity.

Speaker 1:          08:34          Well, you know, this idea of, of this, of this return, um, and, and the continual revivification of traditional forms reminds me of two things. It reminds me of the old Egyptian stories about horace and Noah, Cyrus and Horus, the Egyptian God of vision and attention. So he's Egyptian, I,

Speaker 3:          08:55          and the, and the Falcon. And after horace defeats Seth, who's sort of Egyptian precursor to Satan and reclaims his throne, he goes down into the underworld to rescue his father. Oh Cyrus, who, who seth had chopped up into pieces. And um, when he's down in the underworld, he gives, oh, cyrus one of his eyes, which seth has torn out. He gives him one of his eyes and then brings them back up to the surface and they rule Egypt together and the Union of Osiris and Horus was like the Pharaoh's soul. So there's, there's this ancient idea and it's expressed in more places than in Egyptian mythology that it's the duty, it's the sacred obligation of someone who's awake to journey to the underworld and revivified the corpse of his father. And that not unites the individual with a living culture and also makes the culture alive because of course, culture in some sense because it's the product of the dad is a dead, is a dead entity.

Speaker 3:          09:55          It has to be continually revivified by the living. And then you see that echoed in more modern form, oddly enough, in a Disney animated movie. And Pinocchio, and Pinocchio is the story of the struggle of a puppet, a Marionette, whose strings are being pulled by forces that he does not understand. It's the story of his struggle towards individuality and, and rebirth. And a number of things happen to Pinocchio. He has to learn not to lie. He asked to learn not to be a neurotic victim because that's actually one of the temptations. It's that it's, it's his agreement that he's in neurotic victim, that, that places him on pleasure island, where he virtually, where he's in danger of becoming a jackass and a slave to totalitarians. Interestingly enough, after he leaves pleasure island, he goes to find his father, but he can't find him. And a note from the Holy Ghost essentially tells them that his father is at the bottom of the ocean, in the belly of a giant whale.

Speaker 3:          10:53          And the whale is also a dragon. And so then Pinocchio has to go down to the bottom of the ocean in his half jackass form and rescue his father from the belly of the whale. And he does that by mastering fire. And interestingly enough, in the, uh, in the Pinocchio Video, he's assimilated to the Christian symbol of the fish in the belly of the, in the belly of the whale, Japan, no couches, a bunch of fish, uh, he thinks to eat them in any couches, Pinocchio and confuses them with a fish. Doesn't realize that having caught Pinocchio, he's caught his own salvation. Then they work together to get out of the whale's belly. But there's this very old idea that especially in chaotic times when everyone's turned into a jackass and a tool of totalitarians that the way forward is to journey to the deepest possible recesses of, of reality and revivify the farther something everyone needs to know. And there's something, I mean, we'll see as our conversation continues, you'll see how, how, how for me at least this goes, is that for

Speaker 2:          11:54          me, going back into the, the Christian tradition and, and, and reconnecting with the Christian tradition has actually opened my eyes also to the world around me. And so those patterns that I find in my own tradition, the patterns that are kind of feeding my life once they're integrated. Now when you look around you, you see them, they appear everywhere. The world is actually made of those patterns and you can recognize, you can recognize those patterns in contemporary culture and you watch a movie and you can see that these, these are the same patterns, but it's the best way is like the, the danger is to, is to do it in an, in a, in a simply in an intellectual way. I mean, that's kind of all our danger. It's connecting to a traditional, you know, becoming Orthodox and, and living it through liturgy, liturgy. Um, when you go to church and you participate in the liturgy, you're physically engaging in, in the sacred patterns. And so it's, it's a way to make it almost a bodily experience. Right?

Speaker 3:          12:53          Well, it's interesting, you know, the, the, the, the Christian emphasis on the resurrection of the body, which is of course something that, that modern people have very difficult time with. I mean, people can perhaps swallowed the notion that the soul is immortal, but the idea of the resurrection of the body is something that just seems beyond the Pale. But there's, there's a logic to that insistence and the insistence is that there's something sacred and necessary about the body and that it can't be forgotten, um, when, when discussing both spiritual say on sacred matters. So it's definitely the loss of the body that's part of what, what constitutes part of the rootless nihilism that characterizes the modern modern age, you know, learned that partly by reading Carl Rogers because one of the things that Roger talked about was the necessity. Young talked about this a lot as well.

Speaker 3:          13:46          The necessity of bringing the body into alignment with, with Rogers, it was more with the voice and he, he claimed, for example, that you could feel with your body essentially whether or not your words were aligned properly with your being. And certainly I've certainly learned that that's true and that you can learn to determine when your voice is making you stronger physically and when it's making you weaker physically. A very, very useful thing to pay attention to. One of the iconic figures that you've carved and that you're interested in is St George. And I've been very interested in the figure of St George. Um, I think the, the, the, the story that's encapsulated in St George is certainly one of the oldest stories known to mankind. It might be at the core of the oldest story because basically what it does is present human being the individual in a, in a, in a battle where the individual society and the individual are being threatened by the reemergence emergence of are carnivorous, Reptilian, carnivorous Predator.

Speaker 3:          14:55          And I think the roots of the Saint George story go all the way back to the time when the distant ancestors of human beings. We're living in trees and being and being preyed upon by predatory snakes. And that's about $60 million years ago. Back when there were dinosaurs. By the way, an anthropologist named Lynn is bail at the, at Ucla, has done a series of studies showing that the reason that human beings have such amazing vision because we can see better than any other animal except for birds of prey, is because our vision evolved to help us detect predatory snakes in particular as they crept up on us through the underbrush. And she established that by noting that there was a powerful correlation between the prevalence of predatory snake predation in primate populations across the world and the acuity of primate vision. And it's also the case that our vision evolved just as the story in genesis suggests, because of fruit, because we see colors because we can detect to detect ripe fruit.

Speaker 3:          16:00          And so genesis insists that human beings got their vision because of snakes and fruit. And that seems exactly right from an evolutionary perspective, but you can imagine the idea in St George, there's, there's a, there's a dragon that reemerge is from, it's, it's a layer underground and it's a, it's an eternal dragon. Immortal Dragon. And it threatens the community. And St George goes out to to fight the dragon in single combat. And as a consequence, he, he frees a virgin from, from the snakes grasp, just like Harry Potter does in the Second Harry Potter volume when he goes down underneath hogwarts to free Jenny, who's the Virgin Virginia from the grips of the basket lisc. And the basket risk is the thing that turns you to stone with a single glance. And Harry Potter is revivified by the way, by the Phoenix. His tears and the Phoenix produces a rebirth, right?

Speaker 3:          16:55          Because this phoenix is a symbol of death and rebirth. And so there's St George story is, is embedded right in the depths of of, of the Harry Potter Story. But I think it's predicated on the idea that human beings, men in particular forever have been fighting off the predations of the natural and the social world, and the, the idea that you free the virgin from the grasp of the serpent is that women have preferentially chosen to ally themselves with and mate with men who are capable of facing the Reptilian Predator. And so it's the basic evolutionary story of mankind that human beings learn to fight back against predators maybe to even find them in their layer instead of waiting for them to attack. And that women in their gratitude for that in their gratitude for the protection of infants. Like there's often images of Mary raising Christ

Speaker 4:          17:57          up

Speaker 3:          17:58          out of the way from a predatory reptile. Right? And that's in reference to the genesis comment that this, that Mary will bruise the head of the serpent with her heel. It's an extraordinarily extraordinarily deep story. It goes deeper than just the idea of the serpent too, because the ultimate serpent in some sense, isn't the one that lives in the external world. The ultimate serpent might be the one that's in the heart of your enemies. Or if you make a metaphysical transformation in your thinking, even beyond that, the ultimate serpent isn't even the one that lives in the heart of your enemies. So it's not the natural snake or, or the crocodile or, or a Predator like that. It's not the vicious barbarian that's come to the gates of your castle to steal your belongings and make off with your women. It's the snake that lives in your heart. And that's why Christianity insists on the association between the snake in the garden of Eden and Satan.

Speaker 2:          18:55          Yeah, I mean, I think that if you, if you, if you think of of the world in terms of, of, of, uh, of macrocosm and microcosm, the idea that, that the, that certain structures repeat themselves at different levels of reality, that's like music, right? Then you, you, you, you can think of this idea of a world as having in the middle, you know, a tree or a cross or you know, something like an access in the center and as you move away from that access, you know, from the access which defines the space basically like a flag or something like a post. As you move away from that center, you're moving further and further from what it defines and you're approaching a chaos. Basically, you're, you're, you're approaching chaos, which is in the negative sense. It's chaos, right? In the positive sense. It's also potential.

Speaker 2:          19:48          It's the potential from which that world will, will grow. So it on one side it threatens the insight, if you will. And on the other side, it is the potential by which that, that, that thing will grow. And so the dragon in the Virgin in, in St George's story there, there are actually several versions of the of the dragon in some virgins and the most known virgins sent a St George will kill the dragon, but there are lesser known versions of the story where he actually tames the dragon and the dragon into his pet, you know, and there's versions where he tames it then killed it. Like there's different versions of the story, but it's to show this idea of, of as you move out, sometimes there's something on the edge that that appears on the edge and you can't define it. It's this chaotic thing. It's the dragon in traditional way of represent representing it isn't just a reptile.

Speaker 2:          20:40          It's actually a hybrid creature. It, it usually has a mix of, of, of Lizard and it has hairy feet and wings. And so it is, it's this monster. It's a monster. It's an amalgamation of things to be frightened by, but also treasure because the dragon doesn't only guard virgins that guards treasure, it's in the. It's in contact with what you fear and despise that the treasure is to be found. Yeah, you know in your your notion about the center point, say with the flag or the cross reminded me, reminded me of the way that children react with their mother and their home and so what a child will do when he or she is exploring the world is make contact with the mother and that and that's in the center of the household so you can think about it as the mother embedded in society.

Speaker 2:          21:27          The child will will comfort himself with contact with the mother and then go out into the world until the point where his fear overcomes his exploratory tendency and then on the on that edge he'll play and further his psychological development and his mastery of the world and then when he wears out and maybe goes beyond his limit, he runs back to the center point for comfort and then the next time he goes out he can go out a little bit farther and so that. That structure basically. That is basically the structure of everything. I mean, yeah, it's structure of the society. It's a structure of a family and like you said, it's also the structure of an individual, uh, were on the, on the edges of our person. We have these desires that exist on the edge of our person and those desires are very dangerous because they, they, they can lead us into a lot of the mess, but they're also, uh, by the, the, the tool by which we further ourselves.

Speaker 2:          22:25          That's very similar again, to young's idea of the incorporation of the shadow and also you need, she's idea of beyond good and evil. I mean niche you meant by that at least in part beyond the conceptions of good and evil that are basically thrown up by nothing but cowardice, right? So you try to make yourself into this little restricted thing that's basically the union persona and you define yourself as good if you never go outside that little box. But to be truly good, you have to go way outside that box. So if you think, take this as a, as a worldview, I mean basically that, that has become my own worldview. It helps you to identify what's happening around you. So on the, on the periphery of the world, there are these marginal things that exists kind of in the buffer between, you know, order and an absolute chaos and those things, they, they all, you know, they rear their heads up and sometimes, and so we have to have a trend.

Speaker 2:          23:21          We, we transact with them in different ways, sometimes tame them. Sometimes you have to, you know, you know, like a dragon, you have to kill it. Sometimes you have to just ignore it too. Like monsters just have to be left alone basically. Like they're too big to, to, to deal with. Yet you just leave them alone. And to me, this is really related to what you're going through right now. It seems like this is where we are right now in our society. Our obsession with liminal things right now in the world seems to be a sign of something. You know, the word monster actually comes from the Latin word, which means to show, right as a portent. We in French, we actually still have the verb motivate, which means to show them. Demonstrate in. Yeah, yeah. There you go. Demonstrate. Exactly. So the word a monster is, is a portent of something.

Speaker 2:          24:15          It is. It's like a harbinger of change or harbinger. That's something you need to pay attention because something is happening. And so right now to demonstrate to demonstrate is to de mon straight. Yes. Right. It's to, it's to take the monster apart and make it into something that's you can deal with. Yes. That you can master Marduk in the old Mesopotamian myth because mark who's the Mesopotamian a hero, God confronts tire mount who's a monster and cuts her into pieces and makes the world. And actually one of the names of that the Mesopotamians had was he who makes interesting and useful things from the combat with tire mount. Yup, Yup. Yeah. I mean so, so right now we can you look around the, if you think of a, of the social manifestations that are going on, like just take zombies for example, like that's the greatest example because the Zombie is an inbetween figure.

Speaker 2:          25:11          It's something that is neither dead nor alive. It's, it stands in between two categories. And so, so the, in the case of the Zombie, the Zombie, because it is in between the categories is act as a parasite. It starts to eat the interior. The brain actually. Exactly. Yes. It's looking for, for, for meaning. It's so he wants to eat the thing that's inside, it's trying to devour it. So the culture, like the story of, of, uh, of Oedipus and the Sphinx is the perfect kind of image of this. So the Sphinx appears as this undefined monster, right? It's a mix of a woman and a lion and a bird or whatever. It's this thing that appears. And so, and what it is, it's a question. It's saying like, what am I? Well, monster, that is a question or it's an enigma. The person coming forward is faced with this enigma and the danger.

Speaker 2:          26:05          So one possibility is that you name the monster and you're able to integrate it. The other possibility is that you're eaten by the monster. Those two things are a real reality right on the edge, on the edge of things. So when you come to the edge of something, you know, you have this, this, this, this image, and traditional stories of the bridge. You come to the end of something and there's the bridge and on the bridge there's a, there's a monster, and so you have to face this monster because when, when you're on the bridge, you're in a dangerous place. Your inbetween inbetween categories, right? You're in no man's land, you're in no man's land. And so the monster comes and wants to devour you. So it can be either this idea of the, the, the monster asking question, asking an enigma for you to be able to cross the bridge. Um, and so this is what's happening right now. Right? And so there, there are some elements that come from the margins of society which are standard.

Speaker 1:          27:01          The ones that I've been dealing with or has been the people who don't fit into the gender categories.

Speaker 2:          27:06          Yes, yes. And so that we're, we're in a situation where we were those, that manifestation of, of hybridity, right? Because because if you look at the categories that are used, they are, they are trying to be the category of multiplicity itself. I think they're trying to be the category.

Speaker 1:          27:24          That's why the categories are multiplying beyond name. They started with just nonbinary and now it's up to 70 on online.

Speaker 2:          27:31          Yeah, it'd be what it is. It's a decomposition like it's. It's a decomposition of a category. You come to the end of something and it starts to decompose. I know in your talks you talk about the role of the serpent eating its own tail. Well, this is my vision of it, is that when you first see that serpent youth, it actually looks like it's the tail that eating the head and then after a certain transition, then it becomes the head eating the tail. So imagine the fruit falls on the ground, the ground starts to eat it, it starts to decompose, and once it's fully decomposed, then something happens. There's a flip, and now the seed starts to use the earth and eat the earth to, to become a tree. And so there's that moment at the end of something where there's a flip that happens, like an inversion and then an inversion of an inversion that happens. It's a very chaotic time. And, and that's the moment where we, we, we are in right now. And what you're going through, like the, the, the finger that you've, you've put your finger on something very, very critical and that's why there's so much noise about it is because you're, you're, you're standing right in that spot and you're pointing, your telling everybody, pay attention to this monster. It's right there in front of us.

Speaker 1:          28:47          You talked before with me about two to biblical stories that shed some light on this. And you were talking about Abraham and the stranger. And so maybe you could walk through that because I thought that was an extremely interesting analysis.

Speaker 2:          29:01          Okay. So, so I mean, the way that in the Bible and in most traditional societies, the way that you would deal with the strange. Okay? The thing that comes from the margins, you know, it's the stranger in, in, in, in a, in a global way. It's this strange thing, the way we deal with that is through hospitality, right? The first way we deal with it, right? The first way we deal with something coming from the outside and that doesn't fit into our world is through hospitality. So the hospitality, hospitality means that you receive this thing as a, as a stranger, and there's these implicit rules of how you interact with them so that there isn't a mutual destruction basically. Okay? And so in the Bible we see those, those, uh, version of, of good hospitality and bad hospitality play themselves out. So in the story of Abraham, Abraham receives a three strangers and he received them into his tent and he feeds them and he gives them, he received them properly and the strangers are also acting properly in his tent.

Speaker 2:          30:07          You know, they're eating his food, but they're being respectful of the house. They're not stealing things, they're not trying to seduce his wife are doing the things that you're not supposed to do implicitly when you're in someone else's house. Um, and, and because of that, the, the, the three strangers announced to Abraham that he's going to have a child. So Abraham is in his nineties, you know, you'd never thought they're angels. They're secretly, but they're secretly angels. That's what's important is that in the strange, the strange, because the strange is an ambiguous, a category. It can contain both extremes. It can contain both the angel and the devil, right? These three angels come to come to him and they announce that he's going to have a child. And so what they do is that the strange now access this potential that we talked about, right?

Speaker 2:          30:58          So it's a fruit defying agent in this, the case that an orderly structure has to allow an element of chaos, an element of the strange into it in order to become something new and even to maintain its own survival because things have to become something new as they move forward through time, right? And so in this, in that case, the stranger becomes the, the, the, the means by which Abraham's marriage is, is, is fucked up. So he grows, his family, grows through this bright interaction with a stranger, so now these same three strangers, then they go to a visit, Abraham's brother lot who's in Sodom and Gomorrah, and then although lot receives the strangers appropriately, the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, they wanted to rape these strangers. They, they want to sexually assault the strangers at end rape them and angels blind the people around them and they're able to escape and because of the wrong interaction and the sexual, the sexual interaction with the, with the, between the stranger and the people of the city.

Speaker 2:          32:07          If the city is destroyed by fire and then it leads even further it, it leads to having an incestuous relationship with his daughters. And so it's like the whole world just kind of, it collapses because there isn't a proper approach to, to, to hospitality and. But it, you know, and in that story, you see how it's actually. So there's an intimation in there too, is that if the, if the, if the interaction with a stranger is handled properly, then everything becomes more fruitful. And if the interaction with a stranger upsets things, say as basic, as basic as, as sexual interactions between people than the entire society can become destroyed. Exactly. And, and that ended, and I'm using those two stories, but, but those two, those two stories repeat themselves in all, all of this. I mean, there's so many stories where you see that often it's not just sex, it's often food.

Speaker 2:          33:00          There's sex and food. Those are the two things that the two major ways in which we integrate the world. So for example, like the story of Hansel and Gretel for example, is a, is a, is a, is a perfect example of where the, the desire to eat the people that to eat your, your, your guests, right? Or for example, the mother in the Hansel and Gretel story because she's too good to be true. And then she's all compassion. The witch and the Hansel and Gretel story. And you can tell that because she has a ginger, she's, she has a gingerbread house. It's made of candy. Yeah. And like a house made of candy is too good to be true. That's the social justice warrior overemphasis on compassion and inside she's just fattening the kids up, constantly taking care of them, but her fundamental wishes to devour them.

Speaker 2:          33:49          Yeah, so like an example, and then one more thing, they've been abandoned. Those kids who have been abandoned to the predations of the evil mothers because the family broke down like they're. It's the stepmother who tells the farther, if I remember correctly, to abandoned the children in the forest. Yeah. So it's the breakdown of the family that leads to the children being threatened by the eatable mother who's too good to be true. She's compassion that's gone completely beyond. It's, it's, it's, it's tolerable limit cautionary tale, that's for sure. You see that, you see that there's a story there. There's so many stories of how the, the, the relationship between the host and a stranger goes, goes wrong. Like there's an effort and sometimes the push comes from the host and sometimes the push can come from the guests. Like there's a, there's an Ethiopian tradition where it's almost an inversion of Abraham's story were able where a man receives three guests into his home and the three guests serve him food, which, uh, which ends up being a human being.

Speaker 2:          34:52          So he, so he, they, they kind of trick the host into becoming a cannibal. And then the host becomes like an out of Control Cannibal. And you know, eating people all over the place. So you can see how the story can go both ways, like the, the, the, the, the relationship with the strange can. There can be a push from the inside, from the right hand. Let's say the order hand, that can be a push towards, uh, that, that, that caused the cows. But it can also come from the guests can also come from the stranger which can push from his side or from their side. And then create the chaos.
