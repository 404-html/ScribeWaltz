Speaker 1:          00:02          The good news is that there was some overlap. So I think that despite all the cue cards on here, we will be able to, um, answer quite the cross section a. So in some cases they've been split up between Dr Pearson and Dr Doidge. Uh, in other cases it's just a generally speaking. So Dr Peterson, I think, nice way to conclude your remarks. Um, why are the postmodernists doing this and to what end?

Speaker 2:          00:43          Well, I think you should distinguish between the postmodernists and postmodernism and in some sense, because you don't want to be thinking that, you know, each radical person on the left, let's say for the time being is a full fledged Avatar of postmodernism because they're not, they're like, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:04          60 percent reasonable human being and 40 percent puppet mouthpiece of a toxic etiology, you know, and so it's fragmented across people and that makes it, of course much more complicated because you get to know someone like that and you think, well, they've got some good intentions. Not nearly as many as they think they have, but they have some good intentions and you know, they have a history of really things not so good that happened to them. It's no wonder they feel kind of angry about it, so like, but then that's why you got to get to the bottom of things. It's like, and the bottom is very far down. It's like this is where things get crazy. It's like,

Speaker 2:          01:46          well, there's a battle between two ways of being in life, you know, and I've taken that apart to some degree in my lectures on Cain and Abel and one way of life is to make the sacrifices that you have to and to try to aim towards the good and hope that the sacrifices that you make please the Lord, so to speak. It's how you bargain with the future, right? You make sacrifices in the present toward something you hope will be good in the future and you hope that pleases the reality and it's smiles on, you know, and then, and then the other way of being is that you noticed that your hard work is often ignored and that you don't get what you want. Well less deserving. People do and it turns you against life itself. Like it turns you against more. Worse than that.

Speaker 2:          02:30          It turns you against being. I don't know how else to put it. I mean because I've studied, you know, like why do you go into Connecticut into a classroom and shoot a bunch of elementary school kids and Ben Yourself? I think he shot himself, but it doesn't matter because usually that's what happens. It's like what stared of state of mind do you have to be in to do that? Well, I knew what sort of state of mind you have to be in to do that, but the only way to describe it, it's sold down there that, you know, it gets fundamentally. It's like, well that's the pathway of cane. It's like being as something that should not be despise every bit of it. I'm going to take my revenge on it. I'm going to find the most innocent people I possibly can and make them suffer and then I'm going to do away with myself.

Speaker 2:          03:16          And that shows you exactly what I think and you know, people are like that man. That's why that's the oldest story, but it's basically the oldest story we have about human beings, Cain and Abel. It's like a paragraph long that story and it's just a punch man. That's why I remembered it for God only knows 10,000 years maybe. So why are they doing it? Well, they aren't doing it. It's like we're doing it. That's the thing. It's not them. It just happens to be that there are sort of more doing it now than you know, maybe the radical right is, you know, but it could easily be flipped around and well that brings me back to the same issue. It's like, well, what do you do about it? It's like,

Speaker 2:          04:02          join the group, engage in group conflict, give up all your beliefs so that you don't believe anything so that you don't engage in group conflict. Well then you're nihilistic and hopeless. It's like, so what do you do? Those are your choices. Well, no, they're not. The other choice is get yourself together and every way like you want to fight this, whatever this is, you want to fight it. Well, you got to be strong because you're going to have to make the right decisions at a moment's notice when, when the tiny little bits of this manifest itself in your own life, it's like you're going to stand up at work when they want to retool your unconscious biases. Well, probably not because people don't. Well, why not? Well, it's no bloody wonder, you know? I mean, look what happens, you know? I said, no, I'm not using those words. It's like, you know, when I didn't do it blindly all the way, certainly never predicted what was going, who the hell could have predicted what was going to happen? Like certainly not me, but it's no wonder that people shut up and you know, hide like why not? It's the smart thing to do in the short term. Well you know how you feel when you hide, you know you feel like a pathetic, scared rabbit and that's what you are. So you gotta be more than a pathetic, scared rabbit and you do that by

Speaker 2:          05:31          you do that by facing the chaos that exists in your own life and turning it into order not stopped. That's how it goes. So it isn't them, you know, that's the problem. It would be so easy. You could just get rid of them. It's like that's just doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Dr Doidge have our young people have been forced to overdevelop their left brains or have their right side of the been underdeveloped.

Speaker 3:          05:58          If so, how do we avoid this?

Speaker 4:          06:08          No.

Speaker 3:          06:14          Is this better? I'm going to defer to or bring you back to Ian mcgilchrist book, and so yeah, the brain is plastic and arguably, you know, if you start using a suite of cognitive skills over and over and they were more left brain, you could develop more left brained. I'm a balance that was more left brained or right brained. And in the course of civilization, according to Mcgilchrist, there were certain times where they hit the sweet spot and he goes, he has a whole historical account in his book of which times and civilization, you know, actually Athens, 500 BC, all those incredible playwrights, Euripidean, [inaudible], these plays like Medea and east Gillis and sophocles. It go deep, deep into emotion in the unconscious. That's, that's being hit. And that then you have aristotle describing logic really for the first time. And then there are moments in the renaissance where there's a nice balance, but mcgilchrist himself is very concerned as am I.

Speaker 3:          07:26          That education has really taken a huge turn to left brain function. Um, and I think part of that has to do with, uh, well, part of it has to do with a philosophical problem and that is modern science is I think in general a very good thing. It's not a perfect thing and it has a number of very materialist assumptions and many, many people misunderstand the following thing. I see this in medicine all the time. They say, well, what are your statistics for that? You know, statistics are a means to an end. We're trying to find out what works for a particular illness or something. If you can measure it in the current mindset of modern science, it is real. But there are things of course, that we were not good at measuring now with computers and technology, what's Ha and bureaucracy, what we're seeing in society is certain things are easier to measure and those are the things that are taught that are privileged.

Speaker 3:          08:23          Your job is often judged and you know, for many, many people buy these silly little things that are easy to quantify. And that pushes things more towards a kind of left brain approach if combined with some of the materialist underpinnings of modern science and certain aspects of philosophy. Um, now there's always a kind of a rebellion against that and a lot of the interest in aspects of the east or meditation and, and, and certain aspects of literature are in, you know, in some ways, often more right brained things. And because if you live a totally left brained approach, and I realize I'm speaking with a vast generalization here, but it doesn't really become toxic and it feels like your soul, your psyche, whatever you want to call it, it's very much left out of it. So, to answer the question now with that background, uh, I think that education is moving very, very left brained.

Speaker 3:          09:21          Um, and I mean, I think it's a real problem. I think that the skills that we're working on are very, very left brained. And so the reason you want to have a liberal education, for instance, uh, we talked about mill and the role of free people have to learn how to govern themselves. But you know, there are western books that really do hit that balance very beautifully and those are the things that are being dismissed from the curriculum, uh, so often. And it comes both from the left and from the right. I mean, you know, over and over, you know, people go after things like music for instance. That's one of the first things to be taken out of the curriculum because what does it deliver that's an immediately helpful and so on or reading poetry and things like that. Those things get cut back. So yeah, I, I have, um, I think that there, there is, the balance is not right now

Speaker 2:          10:22          I have a bit of a comment on that 1 million units and keeping with Norman's reference to John Piaget mean one of the things piaget pointed out was that the precursor to moral behavior is the ability to play with others, to play. Like technically, I mean children set up a little fantasy world and then they take their roles in it and they play and they do that voluntarily unless one of the kids doesn't know how to play. Right. And so the kid that doesn't know how to play says, you better play my game or I will play with you in any sensible kid, just runs off and finds another play partner. But you know, we don't let this is such a cliche. We don't let her children play, you know, and that's a big problem because they just learn how to play in a structured environment that's not play because it's a play is when you have to invent your own game and invent your own rules and negotiate the rules and know.

Speaker 2:          11:19          And so all these kids is that, I think they're hyper protected because they're born to older mothers and you know, there's hardly any of them. And so the mother's heart over protective than the sword, the fathers for that matter, but they're old and they're not going to have another kid. So they hyper value the child and there's only one of them. And so they don't have siblings and like, and then they structure everything. So the kid has the best of everything, which they do, except they don't have any freedom to be idiot children and to, you know, eat dirt and fall on their head and all that sort of thing that you have to do. And you know, it's no wonder of the reason it's a demographic issue, you know, it's no wonder it's happening. But a lot of these kids that are screaming and squawking about you better play my game or else they just don't know how to play. They, they really don't. And so it's no wonder. And that's death to morality because it's predicated on free play know. So that's a problem. And so that's not something I knew what to do about, don't, you know, you know, don't, don't, don't

Speaker 2:          12:25          you try to encourage your kids. Sorry, you try to encourage your kids, you make them courageous, you don't protect them. That's different, right? You make them courageous, you don't protect them. So that's, you just make them weak then.

Speaker 4:          12:40          Sure.

Speaker 1:          12:43          A lot of questions about, uh, human rights tribunals and human rights councils. So just to kind of summarize a bunch of them into one. Um, is there ever a legitimate use for human rights tribunal or counsel, and if you could comment also, I'm going forward in the fight over gender expression, gender identity, um, how do people combat or, or, or, or win that fight in front of human rights courts and tribunals and um, yeah,

Speaker 2:          13:13          we'll leave it at that. Oh no, there is no excuse for them. That's why they're called social justice tribunals in Ontario like that. That's what they're called. And so look it up yourself and that's what they are. So we had a court system that works perfectly well, which doesn't mean it worked very well, but it means it works better than any alternative. And if anyone has ever be able to think up and a human rights tribunal can suspend nor normal jurisprudential standards. They use preponderance of evidence. They don't assume individual innocence and they can change the rules as they see fit. And so those bloody things are pathological to the core and their, their mouthpieces of the postmodernist neo Marxists as far as I'm concerned. And they're setting up a parallel law system and they're also doing that.

Speaker 2:          14:03          They're also, and this is, this is the wind government, they're also forcing the universities to adopt particular deficiencies of sexual harassment that make every, uh, let's call it complicated interchange between human beings into a act of violence. Not that I'm trying to justify stupidity or oppression, but we're all stupid and we're all oppressors and so the probability that we'll make some sort of dopey sexual errors, 100 percent and now that's become grounds for, you know, accusations of rape and where they're forcing the universities and the colleges to become parallel legal systems as well. And that's already well advanced. It's already being adopted at the UFT. It's as a consequence of direct legislation and you better look out because even if the people who are running those right now are reasonable, which they're not, they will absolutely be replaced by people who exactly want that kind of power and will absolutely use it. So no, those things should be abolished. We have a legal system.

Speaker 4:          15:09          No,

Speaker 2:          15:10          the law society now, I may not have this exactly right, but I've got it mostly right. The law society in Ontario has already decided that lawyers are racist, they're going to force them to undergo on unconscious bias training and they've come to, and they're agreeing by the way, um, they've already come to the conclusion that because the legal profession does not have the precise representation that you would expect if you did a demographic analysis of the population according to the terms defined by the social justice warriors, that it's racist and that they're racist and that they need to be trained unconscious first. It's like, so go ahead. Lawyers like line up, man, admit your guilt. You're done and you deserve that too. So, Yep.

Speaker 1:          15:55          Starting to become afraid of the answers to these questions, um, can left and right wing people ever meaningfully communicate with each other. And I'm wondering if you can comment a little about temper mentality and the differences there in

Speaker 2:          16:08          that's what they do in a democracy. Look, the lefties, they're high in openness and low in conscientiousness and that means they don't like responsibility that much, but they're pretty damn creative and they're not very orderly, especially they're not very orderly. And that's part of conscientiousness by the way, and so they're good at being artists and they're good at being entrepreneurs, but they're terrible at running things. But then the conservatives on the other side, there are low in openness, which is the treat creativity. That doesn't mean they're stupid by the way. It just means they're, they're, they're, they're thinking isn't as free form, let's put it that way. And so it's more constrained and they're high in conscientiousness, especially orderliness. So they're damn good at running things that already work. So you need the liberals. There wouldn't be high openness, low conscientiousness if there wasn't a niche for it.

Speaker 2:          16:54          And you need the conservatives and sometimes the liberals are right, the border should be more open because that's their fundamental claim. And sometimes the conservatives are right. The borders between things should be more closed and, and because they're both right some of the time. And because the environment keeps snaking around, you have to have dialogue between the two sources constantly, constantly so that the, the Paula de can orient itself as the snake of the environment moves. And that's why you need free speech. And so the left and the right get along perfectly well together, as long as they can talk to each other, but as soon as they can't talk to each other, then the alternative, there's only one alternate to alternatives to negotiation. Simple as that one is slavery, the other risk tyranny. So those you cannot negotiate with will either become your slaves or your tyrants. So you wipe outs free speech, then that's what you're left with. And that's why free speech isn't just another right, for Christ's sake, it's not another right? How dumb can you be to think that you don't know anything if you think that it's the mechanism by which people have different opinions

Speaker 2:          17:58          talk instead of strangling each other. So and, uh, but if you want them to strangle each other, which you might then really, you might then take away the right to express their opinion and watched the whole thing go up in flames and go like this because maybe that's what a big part of you wants. So do you see any connection between antisemitism and postmodernism specifically on university campuses?

Speaker 3:          18:28          I had an insight the other day, um, and it actually came through some psychoanalytic reading. Um, I googled anti Semitic images

Speaker 3:          18:43          and I invite you to all do that. And three quarters of those images came up as an old man with the big nose and he was doing really one of three things. He was counting his money. He was torturing a child or in an Israeli guys. He was stealing territory and it just, it was amazing. And I thought of a picture of what Jews look like and there's men and women and they're all ages and there's lots of children. And that was interesting. There was one picture of a woman who was like a bad Jew. She was witch. And there are some psychoanalytic concepts that I'll share with you now that I think relate both to postmodernism and anti antisemitism. And it's this, you know, analytically, if things go well when we're in her mother's womb, you know, there's a sense we, we think of a kind of a paradise that human beings beginning.

Speaker 3:          19:53          And of course there are many stories about the expulsion from paradise. But if our childhoods go well and we're the apple of our parents die and they hold us and they sued us and we imagined we want milk and milk arises. There's this early period where there's this kind of narcissistic, it's not in a negative way, just wonderful thing where everything works out where we're totally egocentric, but it's appropriate and we're in a kind of a paradise. And of course in the course of life, we move in and out of that now then reality hits and reality hits in terms of discomforts. And so it's, it's a kind of natural biological thing that happens. But as we get older, we learned that to go into society, there are limits on us and there are rules and if can't deal with that, we develop an image in our minds of that he or it's usually a, he for mythological reasons. Rules are often tied into, um, the masculine and nature is often tied into the feminine. And in many cross cultural mist,

Speaker 3:          21:08          the, the representative or the symbol of the rule giver that I don't like, that I don't detest is often a male. A father and old, and one of the things about Judaism, everybody who studied it knows is there's a lot of laws and there's a lot of rules and the picture of God in Judaism is often depicted as a man who can be angry or a times punitive and so on. So I think one of the things that has happened is that's caused antisemitism, is that the the Jew, a pot onto the Jew is projected, are discontent with the fact that in life one of the things we have to do is face limit and rules and even the French psychoanalyst talked about the no of the father and saw the superego is a negative male image and one of the things about

Speaker 3:          22:05          having had a very protective upbringing or overprotected upbringing that Jordan was describing and I was describing earlier is as I put it earlier, I said, if you've, if you've had a denatured existence and then you come up against limits and adult life, it feels that all the problems are caused by human beings and rules. I'm, I'm sorry for the long answer, but it's, it's, it's a serious, serious question. You know, I talked a lot about some of the very good things in classical liberalism and classical liberalism can be shared by modern conservatives and modern liberals. There are liberal liberals and liberal conservatives. There are also a liberal conservatives and liberals and I don't see anything better than the classical liberal arguments to keep us talking to each other, but that's not to say that liberalism is perfect. I'm liberalism to some degree because it doesn't take a position on things and stays open on things in ways that certain traditional approaches don't.

Speaker 3:          23:10          They, they will take a position on things does slip easily into relativism and relativism basically says a and relativism is embraced by postmodernism when they're not trying to change the world in a particular way. So it's, it's on and off again. Kind of relationship. Relativism says that there is no solid philosophical underpinning for thought thoughts about right and wrong or good and evil or how we should act, and that creates a massive amount of anxiety and when ever any of us in our lives come up against the limit or border or some kind of essential. If we've been raised relativistically, as many young people have today to think, well, you know, you're not really entitled to take your point of view too seriously at all because nothing's really right or wrong. It's just a value judgment. Um, then you can start to resent or be angry about rules or limits.

Speaker 3:          24:13          So part of the postmodern attack is on anything, uh, uh, certain things in biological which seem akin to laws. I'm not saying that there are laws of nature of the way. There are laws of human beings, but there are these regularities or patterns in nature that we see and we often as a short form, call them laws and postmodernism often attacks those and says no. They're just socially constructed, which means imagined to in some way or other appease or please a social, a social group. So this is a long roundabout answer, but I think that many of us carry within us a deep resentment in our narcissistic parts of ourselves that in this life we have to adapt to limit and law. And that can come up as depicting an image of an older man who represents someone who's hidebound by law, um, and doesn't have a spirit and is fundamentally greedy and trying to take something away from you. And,

Speaker 5:          25:24          uh,

Speaker 3:          25:25          that shows up in postmodernism. And by the way, you know, the idea, for instance, that the Jew is greedy. I haven't completely figured that out, but I've got an answer for that. Okay. Well, but I just want to say a few things. It's very interesting. The old man is often abusing a child in those antisemitic images. And of course there were stories about Jews kidnapping, gentel children and sucking their blood and eating their blood and so on and so forth is Passover. I think that's a hint that this is the child's view of a terrifying father image that is trying to take something away from you. And of course it's about patriarchy, isn't it? I mean, the idea is this man represents the tribe or some kind of control and, and postmodernism is very much against that. So again, today I spoke a lot about rational things, but Jordan has spoken about mythology and you know, they're very, very deep archetypal and mythological things that are driving a lot of this and that's why it's worth, you know, Google antisemitic images and you'll see what I mean. We're also, you know, one thing to consider is if, if you're a minority, you should at least have the decency be unsuccessful,

Speaker 2:          26:53          right? You know, what, if you regard the system is corrupt, then you're going to regard the people who are successful say disproportionately even as ultimately corrupt. And that's kind of convenient if you're angry about the fact that you're not successful. And so, you know, that's not the only driving force, but that's, that's a good part of it, man.

Speaker 4:          27:11          So, you know,

Speaker 2:          27:14          there's nothing better than being punished for your virtues.

Speaker 4:          27:19          So,

Speaker 1:          27:23          but you touched on this briefly, but there were quite a few questions about it. So I think it's worth rehashing and perhaps expanding, uh, on, uh, what do you make of this strange bedfellows ship between the politically correct, left and Islamic activities? Is there an element of cognitive dissidence? And I'm wondering if you could also touch on bill 59 in Quebec right now. This is kind of the Sharia compliance bill that's going on over there. Basically thought crimes against the prophet. Um, we'll, we'll see you legally reprimanded.

Speaker 2:          27:57          Oh, I'll start. Start. So the first part.

Speaker 2:          28:01          Good. Just tell him. Just tell me the first part of that question again if you would tell us. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing contradictory about that except you know, arguments have layers, very many layers and something can be contradictory at one level and, and, and non contradictory of another. It means you're thinking is disorganized in some profound way, but it happens all the time because you're thinking is a disorganized in some profound way. But when push comes to shove, you find out what the basic motivation is. And that's why I said already the enemy of your enemy, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And so if your fundamental goal is to enhance women's freedom, let's say, well then it's going to be pretty rough to be crop climb into bed with, let's say the Saudis, as I already mentioned.

Speaker 2:          28:47          But if your fundamental goal is to recap havoc with Western civilization, it's like, well, hey, that's not a problem. There's still cognitive dissonance there. That's you can sacrifice the whole rights thing. It's like, it's not like you were ready for that to any great degree anyways at the bottom of your nasty little soul. So there no cognitive dissonance there. It's just another tactic as far as I can tell. And you know the fact that it also allows for broad scale attacks on what you might consider this. Maybe as putting it a bit too bluntly. The only country in the Middle East that has any resemblance of of success, then so much the better because they're just representations of patriarchal oppression. Because how could they be anything else since there's no such thing as competence properly defined within the patriarchy. So forget about cognitive dissonance. You just watch what people do when they're, when they face a

Speaker 1:          29:41          paradox. And then you'll understand their deeper motivations, just

Speaker 4:          29:47          so

Speaker 1:          29:52          I've just been told that they're actually going to be closing the auditorium momentarily. So I worried that's going to be the very last, uh, question. Uh, however I will say that on behalf of the entire audience, thank you so very much to both of you gentlemen and scholars for, for, for, um, bringing together both nature and nurture with all of your backgrounds and forming our own opinions, beliefs, and hopefully acting as role models and how we should combat political correctness in our own lives. So thank you.

Speaker 4:          30:21          Thank you.
