Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Psychoanalytic thought today. Depth psychology. That's a better way to think about psychoanalysis. Freud. Freud is not the only contributor to the Corpus of psychoanalytic ideas. Adler who we won't talk much about was certainly that there was smart and he's a, he's under, he's underrated. Today, wasn't as charismatic as Freud and you know, so, and he didn't have the same flare for writing I suppose. But he, his ideas foreshadow the development of leaders, cybernetic ideas, which we'll talk about by a good margin. So add, they're really had some, some smart things to say. Um, Yoni is the first one we're going to talk about day and next time I'm going to talk about him in some ways indirectly because the best way to understand healing is to show you what you do with his ideas rather than really presenting the ideas themselves. But I can give you a bit of an overview.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       So one of the things that differentiates the depths psychologists from say behavior therapists and even from cognitive scientists, is that you might say in one way they're more mystical, which means more from the romantic tradition. Then the cognitive scientists in the behaviorists. So there's a temperamental split their aid, because people who are high in openness and both Freud and young were very, very high in trade. Openness are very interested in the domain of the imagination and the domain of fantasy because they have very active imaginations and they have very active fantasy lights and they're good visualizers. And so, um, one of the things I've noticed in my clinical practice, there's always been a joke about depth psychologists that if you go see a Friday and you have Freud and dreams, and if you go see a union, you have union dreams. And I suppose that means if you go to a behavioral therapist that you don't have any dreams at all.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       But I actually think there's some truth in that because the more pragmatic people that more practical people are not going to be attractive to therapists who deal with issues that have to do say with the imagination and fantasy. And so there's a natural parsing. And one of the things I've noticed in my clinical practice is that imagine that that people, so those would be open and creative people, um, have a dream life. That big cries out to be interpreted in architectural terms. Like I've had clients number of them now, I have one right now. I mean it's, it's his dream life is, is it's so remote. It's so rich. It's remarkable. And he's, if he's a genius dreamer, every time he comes in and it's like he has two dreams or three dreams, they're coherent, they're complex sleep plotted, they're interesting and, and they chart what's going on in his life and they tell him what he should do.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       It's like it's, it's great. It's, but everyone is like that. I also have clients who never dreamed at all. And then I've also seen when I've lectured to people, I see this most particularly in medical students cause I've lectured a bit to medical students is like, so maybe I'll do a seminar for the, for the medical students and tell them a little bit about the symbols of transformation really because they're involved in, first of all transforming because their medical students and so you have to transform it into a doctor. And also of course they're helping people through transformations all the time, often negative but not always soft, sometimes positive because sometimes you get better. And so it's useful possibly for them to understand those processes or deeply. Generally with the medical school students I do half lecture that's more on like trade psychology, the more behavioral and half of it on the more symbolic stuff, which is kind of like this class is.

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       Um, and there's always about half the medical students on whom the more symbolic stuff just falls flat. It just, they just don't, it's like talking about color that people who are coming are blind. And I, I've, I've thought about this a lot and I really do think it's face to temperamental differences. So you don't, if you have an active fantasy life and you have Mac and imagination and you're a good visualizer and you dream a lot, then that's the sort of person you are. And if you, and if you're on the other end of the scale, which would be that you're very conscientious, let's say, and very low in openness, which also tends to make you more conservative in your political presuppositions. By the way, then dream analysis is probably not for you, partly because you're just not going to come up with that many dreams.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       And even if they, even if you do, they won't necessarily be informative. So you know, there's been a very long battle in some ways in the psychological and psychiatric community between people who take different perspectives on how you might address psychological problems. But I don't know if the, the issue of tight has been thought about seriously enough in that regard because we're really only just starting to understand the dimensions, the actual dimensions of personality property, and to figure out what it means to be on one end of say, openness and versus the other way. Especially if you're intelligent, you can be intelligent, not open. Those are complicated people. They got very analytical minds to make good lawyers. Like lawyers are often, and this is something you might think about if you're planning to become a lawyer. Um, if you're high in openness, it's a bad job for you.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       You will not be happy. You need to be really conscientious, like off the scale. And it helps to be disagreeable to so because if you're too agreeable, well you're supposed to weigh in if you're a lawyer. And I supposed to like nicely let the other person, when you know you're supposed to fight to win. And so you have to be kind of fighting to do that. And if you're high in agreeableness than it's a job that's kind of grates against your temperament. So anyways, so young you work you, and I think the best way to think about yoga is that he was a student of two people. He was a student of Friedrich Nietzsche and who was a student of Freud. And although the Friday ends, when they write the history of psychoanalytic thought, they pretty much portray young is up as like a derivative thinker of Freud.

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       Um, it's not the right way to think about is positioning historically because in some ways what, what young was trying to do was to answer the question that needs opposed at the end of the 19th century because, and the reason that no one was trying to answer it was because he believed it was the most important question that had been posed at the end of the 19th century. And that was, you know, there's a famous quote by nature, right? Done. I'm sure you've all heard it and that's the boat that God is dead. So, but needs just said essentially was God is dead and we have killed him. That's a different idea and we'll never find enough water to wash away the blood. And so it wasn't like a triumphal state, but on each as part, even though when you hear it quoted, you always hear it quoted that way.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       It's like it's a sort of victory daughter, her dad, you know, or something to celebrate. It's not what nature thought at all. In fact, he thought all hell was going to break loose because of it. And he predicted as much like in the, in the, in the 1870 [inaudible]. I mean he predicted what was going to happen in the 20th century with re it's ridiculous accuracy, like uncanny. And that's part of it because you know, nature was one of these people like young who are very grounded in their deep, deep, deep imaginations and so they get wind of the currents that are moving through society long before normal people do. So in some sense, you know, you can imagine that in any given population, even within you guys, there's some of you guys who were living in like 50 years ago and there's some of you living now and there's somebody that you live in 50 years in the future.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       It depends on how intelligent, imaginative versus how conservative you are. Cause it's not like everyone develops at exactly the same historical rate. And you get people like Nicha for example, or dusty Yefsky, they're like a hundred years ahead of everyone else. And so you know, people don't even know what to do with them. But stendhal was like that too though. The writer, he wrote the 1830s and he was convinced that he was a hundred years ahead of his time. And stylistically that was probably about right. So, and the people who are profits regarded as profits in isn't say old testament tradition. They were the same sort of people. It's like they had their ear to the ground in a sense and they could tell what was going on underneath everybody's facade. It echoed in them. And often as the stories go, and I'm sure they have, they have a mythological accuracy to them.

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       The people who are picking up the underground currency indicating often catastrophe felt absolutely compelled even at the risk of their own skin to warn people. So, so navy, so young was definitely one of these people. And now this question, God is dead and we have killed him. Led me to pose another question, which was, well, what are we going to do to replace him? Because need to believe. And I think it, I think he was absolutely right about this. I can't see how it could be otherwise. He believed that the morality that it's structured, Western society was predicated on the fundamental axiom of divinity. And so like the, as far as nature was concerned, the whole Corpus of morality was dependent on there on that, that axiom being true or at least being accepted as true. And when that accident was knocked out by saying that conflict between science and religion, because in some sense that's what did it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       Then the whole system no longer had anything to stand on and could become entirely questionable. And so Nicha pointed that out. And then Dostoyevsky who was writing basically at the same time said, well, if there's no god than anything is permitted. And what he meant by that was really, in some sense, what he meant by that was morality turns into what what you can get away with because there's nothing final about it. There's nothing transcendent about it. And like we've played these problem own intellectually. You guys are still right in the middle of this battle, whether you know it or not. I mean, so what happened in the 20th century was that one of the consequences of that loss of an UN fundamental underpinning led Europe to swing radically to political extremes. You know, the Nazis were to think of that, to think of the Nazis without thinking of that as it religious transformation is that's just not right.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       It was religious transformation and it wasn't a good one. So like it was a regression in some sense too, to a morality that was way pre Christian. Like you said, it wasn't not good. And then you know, you had the same, it was like the rise of the state as an alternative to God. Well we s we saw what that produced. It produced hundreds of millions of painful deaths and it just about destroyed the world. So it was a, it was a bad problem. And you know, when we sort of skirted our way through that miraculously, you know, that all, I don't really think World War II came to an end until 1980 1989 you know, because there was the whole cold war period after, after the Germans and the Japanese had surrendered. But I mean we just went from one war to another. We just went to another one that everyone was too afraid to fight.

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       It was still a war, you know? And that didn't end until 1989 first by some miracle, God only knows why, you know, it never degenerated into a thermonuclear exchange and then it was close, man, we just barely squeaked through that. There is, there were two times during that period, one in 1964 during the Cuban missile crisis where they had those buddy icbm is primed. And so the way they work with in the control panel, which kind of looked like a star trek, you know the old star Trek sets, there'd be like a panel here and there was a little place you can put a key and about 20 feet over there and there'd be another guy with a key. And if he turned his key and held it for 10 seconds at the same time, he turned his key and held it for 10 seconds.

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       Then the missile launched and an intercontinental ballistic missile is a bullet and I mean that technically it's not a guided missile. Once you launch it like you, you shoot a bullet, it's gone and you don't get to tell the bullet to come back. Once it's gone, you can turn around like a cruise missile, an intercontinental ballistic missile. It goes where you aimed it and you don't get to bring it back. And so during the Cuban missile crisis, the keys were in the locks. So we were 10 seconds away, man, I tell you that, that was a tight keyhole. We've barely squeaked through that wall and looks like by about 1989 then that collective consciousness or human would say the collective unconscious of the human race had decided that, well maybe having it all end in like apocalyptic annihilation and wasn't necessarily for the best.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       It's interesting because writers like girth f he wrote Faust and faust as this tale of a man who makes a bet with the devil so that he can acquire infinite knowledge essentially. And the devil in faust is named Mephistopheles and dirt that was trying to explain what human evil, evil per se, what it's motive was. And he did a lovely job. It's so smart what he said and he said, the devil is basic hypothesis and of course spirit, the expresses this and poetry is that life is so unbearably cruel and random and tragic that it would be better if it had never existed at all. And you know, you believe me, there'll be times in your life where you think that you know where something has just knocked you off your feet completely on, on just manner, you know, and that thought it will rise up.

Speaker 1:          00:13:46       And like it's a compelling thought. And I think that's the thought that he would means we're wrestling with, well we've been wrestling with it forever, but we didn't really vote on it until 1989 you know, and life barely one. And you know, life isn't troublesome businesses. It's a tragedy. And you know, everyone asks himself now and then is if their consciousness is worth the pain while the answer that is, it depends on how you live. That is the answer to that. But you know, that's a complicated answer. And just because you know that answer, it doesn't mean that you know how to live anyways. What's happened since 1989 as far as I'm concerned, is that intellectuals who were often possessed by the worst sorts of demons because they actually think that their intelligence can guide the property in, in, in like the complex moral landscape.

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       It's not the case. You see most intellectuals, and this is certainly a case of most intellectuals in the universities in the, especially in the late 20th century, they were committed marxists like way past wouldn't intuitively, you know, George Orwell, by 1955 he was a left winger, brilliant guy. He'd already figured out that whatever was going on in the Soviet Union was not good. So, you know, like if you had your eyes open, you were done with that by you know, 10 years after World War II. But people like Sean Paul Sartre were members of the Communist Party way longer than they had any ethical right whatsoever to be. You know, it's, was it absolutely murderous philosophy and, but, but intellectuals toyed with that, they still toy with it. And the universities, you know, except it's turned into postmodernism, which has Marxism under a new guys, you know, and a lot of the postmodern thought is not only left wing disguised, but it's also nihilistic.

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       And that's actually the other problem that the death of God produces. One is, okay, I, I don't have a religious foundation. I don't have any foundation under my feet to buttress my moral claims or even to sort of help me determine what life is worth in the face of tragedy. So I need something to replace that. And then Poof, that's the state, which is a really bad replacement cause if you think God's bad, like you just try stellan on for try it on for size for a while. And Mao as well, you know, and Hitler as well. It's not like this was a phenomena that was only linked to one say culture of people. Everybody became susceptible to it. And the same murderous thing happened every time people try that. So it was China, Cambodia, Vietnam, like wherever the communists got into power man pit people died by the hundreds of thousands.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       So Paul Paul, the guy who emptied the Cambodian cities had killed 7 million. Sorry, I think it was 3 million people. He got his, he got his graduate degree at the Sorbonne in France and he said what he was going to do when he went back to Cambodia. You know, he didn't outline the whole murderousness element, but he certainly had all the theory laid down in his fine French academy. So, you know, we missed with ideas in the universities and if we don't do it properly, like people die. It's important to get your ideas right. So one answer to the death of God is worshiped, worship the state, the other is doership nothing. It's, it's nihilism. There's no distinction between anything and everything is pointless. And there, there's a massive strain of that sort of underground theorizing in postmodernism and a psychoanalyst, especially a union, would look at the postmodern response, which is nihilistic and the fascist response, which is sort of recourse to the state as motivated by something even deeper than that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       And that's the sort of process that Nisha was describing now for young is he wrote a book called Ion, for example. And if you want to have nightmares for the rest of your life, that's a really good book to read. I mean it's, it's that book just terrified me because young, what he did in that book basically was investigate the fantasy that he believed that all of Western civilization had been predicated on for the last 4,000 years now because you really believed that what drove human beings, and it's a Piagetian perspective, it's some weird ways was the revelation of the success of unconscious revelation of fantasies were at the forefront of our movement into unknown territory. So it's like there's unknown territory and then there is known territory, but there's this weird intermediaries space between them and that intermediary space where you kind of know but kind of don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       That's where your imagination place. And of course that's the case, right? Because when you encounter something and you don't really don't know much about it, you imagine what it might be. And so it takes on the structures of your imagination. And so in some sense what you're dealing with as you move through history, you expand your domain of knowledge into the unknown is you encounter your own front of the seat anyways, if you want to do about that, you could read like volume nine and nine, nine one and nine, two of you once called archetypes of the collective unconscious and the other's called ion. But like it'll take you a while to crack that. We have to beat your head against those folks quite a bit because what, what young is outlining in some sense, so shocking. It's almost impossible to grasp once you get the picture.

Speaker 1:          00:18:56       All of a sudden things flipped around because you understand what he's talking about. But before then, man, it's, it's, it's tough going. It's funny because you who has been, um, there was a guy named Richard Nole who wrote a biography of yoga. He was a jealous guy. I think he was crooked too, because his book was called the area in Christ and he used like Nazi imagery on the cover and it was his publisher that talked him into doing that because he thought the book would sell more. It's like, you don't do that well, or if you do, that indicates really what you're up to, right? Because of the, because of what you're willing to allow to happen to your work. So anybody who would have thought about that wouldn't have used Nazi imagery to gain economic utility out of writing a criticism of young, because it's, it's, it's a crooked maneuver.

Speaker 1:          00:19:48       So then you have to think, okay, what's, what's he up to? Why is he doing this now? Youngest being sold, he accused you in, for example, of basically starting a cult. And I can understand that. But what I found so amusing about Noah's book is that what Yoga was actually up to was so much more, so much more terrifying than a mere cult. And it was sort of like accusing a, uh, like a serial killer of stealing a loaf of bread. It's like, yeah, well maybe he stole a loaf of bread, but compared to what he was actually up to, it's, it's really not relevant. So I mean, Ewan was trying to bring the primordial imagination back into the world and to make people conscious of it, just like, whew, that's something that really, that's really something. So that reading, I read everything you wrote except the books that were published after his collected works.

Speaker 1:          00:20:45       I read some of those. It took me a long time and it just tore me into bed. Like I didn't know what the hell, which way was up. Halfway through those books, I mean, niche is bad enough because Nietzsche will set out to destroy your presuppositions. In fact, I have a client right now who's being left late, depressed for five years because he wasn't particularly educated and he, you know, he started reading nature and he had been a Christian and he thought, well, I'm a Christian. I can take on each end. It's like, no, you can't. No, you can't like leach. Who was so smart that it's just, it's mind boggling. He, he came up with the best narcissistic statement, I think that's ever been written. And this is when he was like, cause he, he was very sick man and he could only great for very short periods of time. So we try to cram everything he could into a single sentence. And so each sentence is like little bomb. One of his now. And then he'd write something self referential. So one phrase of his is, I write more in this, I write in a sentence what other people write in a book. That's pretty good. That's a good bread. But then he talked it right away after he said what other people can't even write in a book. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       Narcissism. And then like he just punched through that. But it's true. Like that's the thing. It's true. So it wasn't narcissism, I mean for anyone else, what does it mean for him? It was just true. So yeah. Yeah. So back to human nature, sort of hypothesize that in order for people to overcome the psychological consequences of the destruction of their religious underpinnings, they would have to transform themselves into virtually into the thing that they had killed. So natures, and this was, believe me for nature, this was like a revelatory solution. He came up with this in a book called bus fakes there too. Stroke. Now everybody who reads nature starts to read. Thus there's is there a booster because it's got such a cool title, you know, but you shouldn't read that book, at least not until you've read, say beyond good and evil and other books that he wrote because thus fakes there a booster is a weird book.

Speaker 1:          00:22:57       It's like the old testament revelation and it really is, it's like it's a fantasy. This man comes down from the mountain and he starts to spout off like poetic revelations and niches. The rest of each punks are like very, very clear and cutting thought, where's this one is like a, it's like a Shakespearean drama almost. You know? And the reason for that is because nature was reaching beyond the grip of his intellect to try to formulate answers to questions that he could not, he could not grasp because what he was trying to figure out is, well, as human beings have developed cognitively, in some sense, we've escaped from our culture and our instincts and when we're embedded in our culture and our instincts were invented unconsciously within a religious framework. It's the framework of presuppositions from which we emerged. Like people didn't think up, religions, what he has is there some little weird little, what we call it, conspiracy going on for 3000 years.

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       It's like, no, it's not about power. Even though it can be twisted to be about power, everything can be or twist it to be about economics. It's about fantasy. You know that all that you look inside here at the cathedral, all you see is fantasy. It's in, it's in brilliant lights portrayed everywhere. It's trying to say something to you, well, what's it trying to say? Well, it turned out when people ask themselves that instead of just acting it out, they hadn't got a clue. And it said, I had no idea what it said any more than you guys know why you have Christmas trees. So how many of you have Christmas trees? Yeah, why? Well, I dunno. I never noticed we had Christmas trees, you know? No, but my point is, my point is that in a culture you can follow, you follow the customs because that's what you do.

Speaker 1:          00:24:44       And, but then when you wake up a bit and just think, well, you're just like the Ph Jedi and child who is taken out of the game and forced to look at it, it's like, well, why are you playing that game and what are the rules? Well, I'd never thought about it before. Well, as soon as people started to think about the games they were playing, it was often because they encountered other people who thought apparently thought differently, you know? So if you're like a Rottie Christian and you'd go into the east and all of a sudden you've come up with a Buddhist, he's smart. It's like you to have big problems, right? Cause you're smart and he's smart and you don't think the same way. At least apparently you don't think the same way at all. So even if you say, well who was Buddhist? You know, we should just wipe them out.

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       It doesn't matter because their thoughts are already there and they've been working on them for like a couple of thousand years and whether you like it or not, they're going to make you think. And once you start thinking about your religion, you're in trouble. And so that's the situation we're in right now. So young took this problem that needs you to had posed seriously. Cause young was caught up quite dramatically in the events of, of, of Nazi Germany. Now you know, when we think about Nazi Germany, we think of course that it was perfectly obvious that the Nazis were the, were the perpetrators and that, you know, everyone else was the victim. And that if we were there we would have clearly seen that and we wouldn't have be Nazis. And it's like that's not true. That isn't how it worked because these things happen slowly. They sorta happened piece by piece.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       You know, we started seeing a similar thing happened I think after the, after the twin towers fell in New York, you know, it's like people gave up five, 10% of their civil liberties in like a month, you know, and, and, and it was okay. It was like wasn't okay. It wasn't okay. And it just shows you how easy that sort of thing can, can start. You know, the Germans were under tremendous stress in the 1930s their whole economy blew out. They had to like take, we'll book barrels full of billions of marks to buy a piece of bread. The currency fell to zero. Unemployment was staggeringly high. They were paying off debts like mad because of the first world war. And there was a real threat that the communists were going to start a revolution. It's like you don't have problems like that. So the Germans had no idea what to do, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:26:59       And, and Hitler was a canny canny person with a brilliant, brilliant sense of drama. I mean, he was a real, he was a master of dark fire, that guy. And I think his, his unconscious fantasy was, let's see how much we could destroy before we die in the, in the what? Purifying flames. That was Hitler. So, and he was, he, he was a compelling person and the fantasy that he added the back of his mind, I'll tell you how that developed at one point, it was a very hard thing to escape from and that's why the Germans became Nazis. It wasn't like this was like magic that had emerged and it was black magic. So young was very interested in this because he was in the Germanic speaking areas of the world when this happened and he fell, felt himself pulled very strongly by what the Nazis were doing, especially in the early stages of the development of the political platform because things did stabilize, you know, and then they stabilize before they went completely out of control.

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       And of course looking in retrospect, you can see the seeds of what eventually transpired to become such a catastrophe. But at the time it was by no means self evident. It's such a thing was going to occur, especially given all the other horrible things that were likely to occur. So you only had a, at a vision at one point in on the train, I think it was in Switzerland that Europe had become so covered with blood, but the blood was starting to flow over the mountains into Switzerland because of course Switzerland is neutral and he said it was one of the most horrifying nightmares of his life. And this was in I think 1930 it was late late 1930s anyway, so it was a premonition of war and he spent a lot of time trying to understand well if you going to become a fascist and worship the state and you weren't going to become a nihilist and worship nothing, what in the world where you going to do exactly the Orient Yourself and how would you protect yourself against the attractions of blind state identification, for example, or the attractions of nihilism, you know, you might say, well nihilism has no traction at all because it says to you everything is irrelevant.

Speaker 1:          00:29:09       Nothing you do has any importance cause that's nihilistic basically. Well, what's the, what's the, the psychoanalyst would say, what's the secondary gain from that? Like, yeah, I do say that's what you believe. And maybe you even knocked it out. And you also say, well, you've come to that conclusion through, you know, a rational process of deliberation at the psychoanalyst would say it's kind of convenient that that also alleviates you of all responsibility, isn't it? And it kind of sheds a little dampness on your plane to pristine cognition as the driving force between, you know, behind your adoption of that theory. You know, it's like, it's like the Patriot who claims that, you know, the reason that he's kicking someone in the head is because he's patriotic. It's like, no, no, no, you're patriotic so that you can kick someone in the head and still look at yourself in the mirror in the morning, has nothing to do with rational deliberation.

Speaker 1:          00:29:59       And so the psychoanalysts and human was like this in particular, you know, they're always extremely skeptical about people's rational claims about their commitments to ideology. And rightly so. One of the things you said lawfully. He said some things that were so brilliant was that people didn't have ideas. Ideas have people. And when you think that, I see, it's like, it's like, I think this is so funny. It's like Dawkins idea of the meme, you know, some of you, how many of you read Dawkins? He's, you know, yeah. Okay. So dawkins has this idea of mean so funny to read, darkens cause it's like 20% of the way to being a union without even knowing it. And so he's produced this idea called meme, which is these I, their ideas, I mean is an idea that sort of has an independent existence in a sense because it can affect different minds are moved from mine to mine and he kind of thinks of it more like a fab.

Speaker 1:          00:30:51       While the archetypes are means except there no fats, they're memes that have lasted for like 20,000 years or maybe 20 million years. We have no idea how old they are. And young got where Dawkins was going, like, you know, 50 years before and 200 stories deeper. So it's so funny to read Dawkins because what he is searching for, it has already been figured out by young, but he's so prejudiced against any kind of religious thinking that there's no way he'll ever find it. So one of the things you did was he, he's deeply, deeply study the substructures of thought. So for you, like you know, when we talked about piaget a bit and we said for piaget, you kind of built your brain from your body upward. Brilliant idea. It's so smart, but you'll, you'll has a lot of piaget in him it's, it's more implicit.

Speaker 1:          00:31:45       But for young, not only was your sub structures of your thought, biological and so therefore based in your body, but your body was also cultural and historical and also partly because you're, you're an evolved creature. So God only knows what's in there. 3.5 billion years worth of weirdness that you can draw on or that can, that can move you where it wants to move you. But I'll also, you're being shaped by cultural dynamics all the time. And human beings in particular, like we're just watching each other like mad all the time to see what we're up to, what people think of us, how we should behaving. Are we being boring? Are People attracted to us? It's like we're social right to the core and that's another way that you can understand an archetype. It's like part of the archetype is that we are social to the core, so we're interested in other people and more if you're extroverted and less if you're introverted, but it doesn't matter by the standards of say, solitary animals.

Speaker 1:          00:32:44       We're so social, it's just unbelievable. And so that's built in. It's built in. What's built in is that you find that interesting. That's the archetype. The archetype is whatever it is that makes you find that interesting. It's beyond your control. Like if you're extroverted, you're interested in people. You didn't decide that it decided it for you. The question is, what is it? Well, it's your brain, your brain, your limbic system. One of the hell back means like we don't know what that means. You know? Oh, we have no idea how your brain produces consciousness. Like I am, I'm dead serious. We haven't got a clue. And what that indicates to me, since we've been hacking away at it for say 400 years, is that the way we think about consciousness is wrong because we're not getting anywhere. Like we'd go a long ways with lots of things.

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       We're not getting anywhere with consciousness. Okay. So back to the archetypes. So I, cause I can tell you how these things arise to some degree. So you're interested in other people say and so you're interested in them because they're unbelievably useful resources, right? Because they don't think they have resources that you want. Plus he won even subtle things from them. You want their attention, you want to play with them, you know, you, there's all sorts of things that you need and want from other people. So the social interactions are incredibly valuable and informative. But the information is interesting because part of what every single person is constantly broadcasting every other's person is how to behave. So now if you meet someone and, and let's say you find them interesting, well I can tell you that the more ideal they are assuming you're not to work, the more ideal they are, the more you've got to be interested in them because that actually is what defines ideal.

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       Like as you become my heel, you can say that it's also the same as becoming high status. As you become ideal, then you're interesting to people. So that's interesting because that what that means is that you can read off people's interest to find out when you're deviating from the ideal and they don't even know what the ideal is. The ideal is that to which their attention is an EXEC inexhaustibly drawn and they're always telling you when you should fall short of the ideal always. It's being broadcast at you all the time. And then your imagination back there is to try and figure out just what is this ideal, you know? Because your imagination is watching you and a phd had sense, noticing what you do and then trying to figure out what that is. So you'll have fantasies about the ideal that that often happens in a romantic relationship, especially at the beginning of it, cause you know you, you project your idealization onto the person that you're romantically attracted to.

Speaker 1:          00:35:29       That's the projection of an archetype. So young would say the woman will project an animus onto the man. The animus is her conceptualization of the ideal man is it's unconscious because it's rooted in fantasy and the man will be in concordance with that projection in some areas that's, those are the areas where she likes him by the way. And we'll be discordant in other areas. And that's the areas where she constantly did disappoints him as the relationship develops. So their projection is there in part to help the person to understand who it is that they're dealing with. Because when you meet someone, you have to pee, you have to assume something about them. It's the same as projection. You have to assume something about the men. If you find that fascinating, which is what happens if you fall in love, maybe it's because they smell good or they're symmetrical or something, you immediately assume that, well, those things really mattered.

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       You immediately assume that they embody the ideal. It's an oversimplification, but oversimplification has a basis and the basis is, if it's interesting to me, it must be close to the ideal. Well, yeah, except the person that you're going out with the to is warped and Benton flawed, twisted, and you know, 300 ways and you'll find that out soon enough just as they will about you. And that often just blows the relationship into fits because the person will say, well, she wasn't who I thought she was like, well, who said whoever sends she was who you thought she was. It's like, where did you get the misapprehension that she was going to be who you thought she was? God, why don't you know? You know, here's let alone your lending referred by your sense of smell and your ability to detect symmetry. It's like, yeah, that's not very sophisticated.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       So those are, those are, so the adamant ananymous are two primary human archetypes and they're very complex. But that kind of gets at the surface the ideal that I was describing. So people are broadcasting information to each other, which is the ideal bid will be ideal and it's like be my ideal obviously. But let's say, let's say if if I took a thousand ideals and then average them or extracted out the common ideal, the ideal of what was common to all of them, that would be a savior figures. That's what a savior figure is. And then now, now and then someone comes along who acts quite a bit like that at booth you've got yourself a religion. So don't be thinking that these images that people fall around like, like you know like what blood hounds on the trail do. You don't have to be thinking that those things are like conscious cognitive constructs.

Speaker 1:          00:38:02       It's like conscious cognitive constructs like Marxism. They last like 50 years and they kill 100 million people and then that's the end of that. A good religious system, man, that'll keep the culture going for like 3000 years. And even at the end of it, it doesn't disappear. We know that the story of horace and no serious, for example, drove Egypt, like Catholicism drove Europe for like 3000 years. That's a long time. And then it turned into Christianity. So it sounds like it disappeared actually. It's sort of transmuted into Judaism and then turned into Christianity. So it's not like the idea is disappear. They can disappear at all. And believe me, you're just as possessed by them as any ancient Egyptian. It's just that you're more of a fragmented and conflict because what your unconscious assumes and what your conscious mind assumes aren't the same thing. And so you're like, you're all at war with yourself, not as part of what makes you attracted to like more on etiologies.

Speaker 1:          00:38:59       By which I mean any of the Ology, because they're all, they're all false idols and false gods and there's shallow, they're shallow and deadly and they ruin your life. They destroy your soul. So that's just a catastrophic response and that's why it's so terrible to have that discordance between your instinctual being, your deep instinctual b and your little fragile, you know, halfway that conscious mind that sort of thinks it's in control. It's like you're not in control of anything. Leave me best you can do is follow what's right. That's the best you can do. Wait, I mean, we even know this neurologically to some degree. Like if you look at the hypothalamus, it's a little part of the brain we'll talk about quite a bit. It's sort of where the Freud Freud and resides to the degree that it resides anywhere. It's this collection of nuclei that do things like make you hungry or make you thirsty or make you, you know, sexually desirous or um, make you defensively impressive or make you terrified of an intruder who, who, who threatens your dominant status.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       It's this little tiny part of your brain. It's hardly even there at all as massive projections coming up into the CORTEX. And then there's little tendrils going down to regulate it. And so basically as long as everything is pretty much perfect, your conscious mind is in control. But as soon as things deviate from the path to any degree whatsoever, the really smart parts of your brain take over and then you do what they tell you to do or you suffer the consequences. So you see this with people who've been geed for example, or sometimes people develop a condition called Polydypsia, which is often a consequence of hypothalamic damage attended on a stroke and they'll drink water until they die. You cannot stop because they, they're ragingly thirsty. Like someone who is starving and like you can say, well you've had enough water. It's like, no, that is not going to cut it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:57       It's not, you're not getting anywhere with that. And you see the same thing with people who have like obsessive compulsive disorders, something like that. When they're not in the grip of the disorder, they're perfectly normal. You get those people to touch something. They don't want to talk just like they're not the same person. The second they do that and whatever they thought of themselves, you know the themselves that was supposed to be in control. That bloody thing is like, it's like a wagon with a child and it being towed behind an elephant. There's just, it's got no control at all. So you have, one of the things that's terrifying about yoga is that there, there's no escaping the realization of the nature of the forces that are behind the puppets that we are, you know, in Pinocchio. That's why Pinocchio was a puppet, right? Something's pulling his strings.

Speaker 1:          00:41:45       He's a marionette and the things that are pulling the strings, while they might have his best interest in mind, but they might not too. And so that's what Pinocchio was about actually. And it's also about how not to be a mannequin. It turns out that you have to go to the bottom of the ocean and find your father in a whale and then drown. That's how you start from being a puppet. It's like, and you think, well you don't believe that. And I would say, well, yes you do. You went and watched the movie and you enjoyed it. Not only that you understood it, even though you don't have any idea what it's about. And also on the face of it, it's absolutely absurd. It's like it's not a pocket first, it's a drawing of a puppet. So that's weird that like, that's two levels of weird.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       And then like what the hell is been the cricket where he comes from, you know, and what's, what's his role and why is he the conscience and why does he get like activated by a ferry? And why is the Pfarius starts like you're in there, you know, like cletus the slack joy, you'll pull watching the screen captivated by it and you know, you walk out and you don't even notice that you're so peculiar that it, it's just beyond belief. You don't even notice that. That's so peculiar. It's like, what the hell are you doing in that theater watching this marionette follow a bug route to an eight to a whale. It's like you walk out, oh, that was so touching.

Speaker 1:          00:43:05       Really. Like, really? People are really crazy and weird. Like, we're like rhinoceroses the report platypuses or ostriches or penguins were, we're right to the core. And when you start to, the weirdness is so deep, it's so ancient that even starting to touch consciousness of that just it's just rocks your boat. So, but, but one thing or another will rock your boat. So sometimes it's nice to choose what, what thing it is and prepares you for things too. So I'll tell you part of what an Lto needs and Nokia, Mary Nett, anybody can pull the strings. I mean, he's got a good heart, but what's not worth nothing? Virtually nothing because he's naive. You know, you can, it's the Fox and the, what is it? That stupid cat that manipulate him, right? And basically behind them you'll see the devil because that devil pops out quite quickly and Pinocchio.

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       And he's the thing that's behind all the local manifestations of evil that are trying to pope UN occhio strings and he gets blown off the right path, pretty badly. Almost turns into a unconsciously brain donkey who ends up working in the slave minds, which is exactly what happens. By the way, you know, to, that's what happened to devout communist who found themselves swallowed up by Stalins nightmare in the 1940s in the 1950s slow. Well we were so good. We did everything you wanted. It's like, yeah, well it turned out what we wanted is for you to die painfully. So you know, congratulations. So you know, in that brilliantly laid out in an oak hill, which in fact was written in the 1930s brilliantly laid out. It's it's way, it's way more intelligent analysis of the 1930s than anything you'll ever find that was written. So Pinocchio, you know, he's trying to cue the proper path and he learns that he shouldn't lie.

Speaker 1:          00:44:54       That's an, that's a, what do you call archetypal idea, telling you why that is later. And it turns out that in order to get out of the horrible mess that he's put himself in, partly by being un UN Unsung, a slavish adherence, adherence to like momentary pleasure and nihilism, you know, he ends up half a jackass who can't speak properly without breaking. So that makes him an idiot log. And the only way that he can get out of that is to go down to the bottom of the ocean as deep as he could possibly go deeper than anything is willing to go to find his father. What's his father? His father is the culture that he lost touch with. You know, and to the degree that you guys are lost, like all human beings are lost. The reason you're lost, it's because you've never rescued your father from the bottom of the ocean.

Speaker 1:          00:45:41       You haven't gone deep enough. You won't, you won't even know when it was necessary. It's necessary. You're a social historical cultural creature right down to where you become a biological creature. And if that isn't part of you, and if that part isn't functioning properly, then your, you can just be blown off course by the wind. There's nothing to you. You're not grounded in anything. That's partly why the shoreham and when they go down, communicate with their ancestors, that's what they're trying to do. And they're trying to pull up the cultural understructure of their, of their societies up into consciousness to make use of it. And you constantly have to have a dialogue with that because you know, say, say your background just for the sake of argument has Jewish, a lot of the lines of have, you know, the culture that you're embedded in was written down by people several thousand years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:46:32       It's like, it's not easy to figure out what the hell those people were talking about or why it's relevant to you. So there has to be a dialogue continually going on between the present and the past so that you can bring the wisdom forward without losing what's in it. Because if you lose what's in it, it's like you're just nowhere. You know, I see this all the time and you might in my practice, you know, often that happens to people who get divorced or who are living together and not married, which you think, well, you're free. It's like you don't want her to be that free. You know, you want to argue with your partner about every single thing for the rest of your life. Well, that's what you have to do. If you don't let your culture guide you, it's like there's no rules.

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       Go ahead. Make up all the rules. See how easy that is, Christ, that'll kill the average person in 10 years. It's just such a weight and you only have one life. You know? You might as well let some tradition guide you so you have some pieces some of the time, or you'll end up divorced and with children's, ew, ew. That's cancer for lots of people. They get divorced, they have children, they get locked into a custody battle and they're done. That's the end of the ride. They're ruined by it. So you step outside of the guidelines of your culture at your own peril and modern people because they're so coddled. They, oh yeah, well we can handle it. It's like, sure you can. You wait until you get there. You'll find out that you can't handle it and it'll be too late. What will has, what will have happened is that you know the way all that you were supposed to go confront and rescue your father from has risen out of the water and taking you down and you're done.

Speaker 1:          00:48:10       That's chaos. So these are serious issues. Like Yo, I would say it was the most serious thinker of the 20th century. I think he was. So, he was so serious that the pseudo serious people who read them just bounce off them. They don't even know what the hell he's up to. So in young was one of those thinkers who was addressing questions that most people don't know exist, like at the bottom of reality, and who was also answering them. So he's a twofold blow to the intellect. First he tells you that you're so stupid, you don't even know what's wrong. You can't even ask the right questions. And then he answers them. It's like, Whoa, boy. Yeah, that'll, that'll, uh, doing your intellectual pretentions. So, and the contrast between darkens I think in young is exactly the right contrast. It's the contrast between the intelligent modern Dawkins in the sort of historically centered. Why is math? And it's sort of painful for me to watch because I've kind of watched golf. You know, he's, he's not a happy man and he's got a tremendous resentment against the church. I'm sure it's something terrible. Must have happened to him when he was a child, but

Speaker 2:          00:49:26       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       Anyways, let me show you some of this stuff because it's such fun. It's such fuck, did it sound fun? Not really. Okay, so I'm going to show you the opening in the lion king.

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       Yup. Yeah, yeah. Good, good, good idea. Good idea. Thanks.

Speaker 1:          00:50:12       Like why not use a media player? That works.

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:54       Okay, so what I'm going to play for you is the opening scene, the opening scene. It's very nicely designed. So the music I find a little bit manipulative. It's a little poppy and, and it's manipulated. Like it's an interesting example of how art can go wrong because it's sort of art design for a purpose and art cannot be designed for a purpose. The purpose of art is art purpose, not your purpose. And so if you're trying to bend the arc to your purpose, it's like you're, you're like you're painting a picture of a stick man on a stained glass window. Like you just don't have, you just haven't got the right orientation. Art is an exploratory process and it's supposed to take you beyond what you know. If you take art and try to force it into your precut pre conceptions, then you're, you're a propagandist and an Nydia log and it's like you're, you're bending the greater to the lesser so in that makes it feel cheap and, and, and, and it doesn't fit well. And like the Latin kings a pretty good movie. And I mean from a, from a psychological perspective, it devolves into propaganda from time to time. That happens isn't salts, but you know, it's, it's, it's still a work. It's a work of genius, which is why you will know it. This is where you get your religion.

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       Okay. So that's an archetypal image they open with it, right? So it's the dawn of consciousness, so it's the new day, but it's also the dawn of consciousness, dawn of consciousness because you're a visual creature and it's also the dawn of consciousness because you wake up in the morning, so it's like sun rise, light dawn of consciousness, and then the music is a celebration of that and you can feel it in grips you right away. I mean that, that part of the music is really, really nice. I think that's the gospel singers from South Africa. I think it is the guys that played with Paul Simon. I think so. They're great. Okay. So what are all the animals doing all of a sudden and you're waking up and they're paying attention to a call, right? And call his musical. So then the question is, well, what's music? Well, music is a representation of like the dynamic patterns of things. And so you get all of this complex information that's going on right off the bat. Consciousness dawns. And now there's a call and everything that San Diego is to pay attention to the call. That's pretty good for like five seconds of film.

Speaker 2:          00:54:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       So now there's, you feel makers hit you with a whole succession of very beautiful images and you know, they do that with a very beautiful music that's underneath. And that's to put you like in a state of harmony with, well normally with nature, but with your own conceptions of the beetroot and your sense of aesthetics. It works quite nicely. Put pops into a dream very quickly.

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       Yeah. On staffing. See then can have a pc small. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:21       So there's a lot going on there. So the lyrics are quite interesting because the lyrics are making representation to the, to that state of being that I talked to you about that William James had experienced stay with is nitrous oxide visions. But then also the piaget and the constructivist sort of think about as the ground of being. So you know the, the, the lyricist made the case that what surrounds you is informative to a degree that you will never be able to comprehend it. And the implication under that is that you know, that at least one of the ways of construing the ground of experiential being is as an information rich matrix and the music is pushing you in that direction too. Because the music is, the music is a representation of what that information rich matrix is like because if it's patterned and complex but understandable, but it, and it also evokes emotion. So that's reality. And there's a lot of paradise imagery in here. Two ways because it's sort of like all these animals are, they're all doing the same thing in them, sort of existing in harmony, like elephants covered with birds. And so in a way it's a childish view of the world because you know those elephants are covered with the text and you know, the lions are half starved because it's been a drought. You know, it's, it's, it's not so good out there on the African plains because it's not all, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:56:50       that'll teach me,

Speaker 1:          00:56:54       okay, so, but, but they're getting you in the mood. Now the, the, the, the lyricist also made reference to the fact that there's this, there's a, there's a paradise. There is an element of genesis in that systems because she talks about our arrival on the earth, so to speak, and then are the dawning of consciousness, which is this step into the sun. And so that's an archetype of multim were placed on earth while here we are after all. And poof, we woke up. And that, the reason that's an archetypal ideas, cause that's what happens to everybody. Great. Poof, you're placed on the earth bag. One day you wake up. It's like the internal experience of human beings and there's something that's deeply real about it.

Speaker 2:          00:57:41       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       that was cool.

Speaker 2:          00:57:43       So we're going to force them to watch that again.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       So that's a revelation, right? And so that's a very sneaky bit at the camera work. So you know, first of all, your, your vision is obscured, but then it's, it's directed by the motion to this like place. What's that? Well, that's a good question. It's what, and just what exactly is in pride Bra.

Speaker 2:          00:58:10       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:58:16       that's right. The Rock is where the king is. That's the top of the pyramid. And we remember those, remember those trees I showed you from the showman? It's so cool. I just figured this out the other day. Inside that tree there was a mountain and the mountain was surrounded by a snake. You remember that? There's a circle with the sneaker on it. That's exactly the structure of this lion king set up. You remember that? So you've got the mountain in the middle there. What's on the outside? Hyenas. That's right. The chaos is out there where the light won't touch. Right? It's a perfect representation of the Scandinavian world tree. So cool. So okay, now obviously you and other animals are supposed to lift up your eyes, which is what the film maker made you do. And focus on this thing. It's a raw, what does the Rock, what does a rock stand for?

Speaker 2:          00:59:10       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       Yes, exactly. Why balance structure? Why? Why is it rock a good metaphor for that? That's great rocks there. They're strong. Even in an earthquake, if you're lucky, they won't liquefy. So you can, you want to stand on a rock, right? The question is what kind of rock do you want to stand on? And that's exactly, is it a physical rock that's one way of looking at it or is there a metaphysical rock that's even a better rock? Well, that's partly what this is film investigates, but at the moment there was a rock and it's been there forever and the king has been there forever and the king is the thing. You have to talk with the dominance hierarchy, which is why you lift up your eyes to it. And the king here is a lion. Why does that make sense? Lions aren't kings after all, but maybe sense why they're up there at the top of the food chain. Okay. So that's a good one. Any other possible reasons?

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       Yes. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, definitely. And the, and the animators capitalized on that all the time and they're kind of noble looking, you know, cause they're muscular and, and, and plus they could eat you. Right. So that sort of indicates that there are certain circumstances under which you are at the bottom of the hierarchy and the lion is it in fact at the tall. So cause a lion is also an on spiring beast. Like, you know, the shepherds in the old testament around that time, you know, a shepherd, you think, well shepherd, he's dressed this little frilly hat and you know, he's, he's not much of a powerhouse at all, but those guys used to fight off lions. It's like, that's, that's, you gotta be really tough to fight off a lion with a steak, you know? So, yeah. So anyways, okay, so there's the rock and the sun is shining on it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       And what are the animals doing gathering around the rock. Now we accept that as a narrative possibility, right? You don't sit in their thinking and the theater, what the hell are those animals doing? Gathering around the Rock and the fact that you're not sitting there thinking that is an indication that you're following the archetypical trail of the story. It makes sense to you that a diverse bunch of drawings of animals would, you know, come together around a rock. That makes sense. Why? Well, it had something to do with our, our dawn higher proclivity and the fact that we can recognize a, an authority and an authority structure and we know how to interact with them. And so these aren't animals after all, they're here. There are people, while they're not cause their drawings, but they're certainly not animals. They're not acting like him. So, or they're acting like half human, half animals.

Speaker 2:          01:01:58       Great. Right

Speaker 1:          01:01:59       now. Who's that little guy? Okay. What? What's he good for? Information. Yes. Why? Why is he did frequent aging and so, so what, why is that relevant? You can get up there way the hell up there with the king. Can't even see and he can see everything. It's horses. Argh. That's exactly right. That's the, that's the Egyptian I that says pay attention. And so the birdies, the divert his attention fundamentally. So, and the king by the same for the bird, he's a little ratty. Burton, he's kind of funny. I think he's, he's not English comedian so he's a bit of a comical character but the king, the king will listen to him. And so that shows that this king is properly humble king because it's just a stupid bird and you could like fight it and half in one bite, which is kind of what scar trump threatens to do cause scarred is want to pay attention cause then he'd figured out who he was.

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       So but the king he'll pay attention to even, you know this is also why in fairy tales it's often the youngest son, the oldest son is usually the one who everyone likes and admires. You know, he's like the football, you'd like to football quarterback, you know, of the fairytale. And the younger son is like, well he's kind of little weaselly useless guide and the older son always fails. And then usually the second son fails to, and it's usually because they're arrogant. And then the third son, he's so clueless, he doesn't know what to do, but they kicked them out because they just assume get rid of him and, and you know, why not let them go and you don't want them around anyways. And so he wanted out in the bush and you know, he comes across out of nome or something that, you know, it's like you just ignore it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       The other brothers did, but he doesn't know what the hell he's doing. So the talks to many thanks while our plans, we'll talk to this known, you know, then the gnome tells them what to do and, and then then the youngest son wins. And that's an archetypal story too. It's like if you don't know what you're doing, don't be so sure that you know who to ignore. Now, that's our very, very useful piece of advice. But then you might ask yourself, how do you know when you don't know what you're doing? So do you have any thoughts on that? How is it that you would know if you didn't know what you were doing?

Speaker 1:          01:04:13       Yes, but there's one that's very good, that's very good. But there's one more thing that goes along with that all and I'll just add it. Cause it's lets you know a bit of a trek and substance and it's bothering you, right? So there's, there's failure plus suffering. Now one of the inferences that you can draw from failure plus suffering is that nature is your enemy and you're a victim of the great father. He's like very standard presupposition, especially of young people because of course you're failing here young. It's like what the hell? You know, you know when you go to a whole bunch of things to learn yet before you can be successful. But you know, but it's an art that's an architectural situation in large part. Okay, so

Speaker 2:          01:05:06       great, great.

Speaker 1:          01:05:07       So now we see the cake. So what do we notice about the cake? It's kind of a tough looking guy. He's not one of these defeated lobster types of lion kings. He's like an upstanding of,

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:05:22       you saw he was also in the sun, right? So if the sun shines on the king, and that's because the king is awake and the sun also illuminates it. You may not know this, but you have, you've seen coins, of course silver coin, that's the mood. The head of the Queen was the head of the queen on the mood and gold coins with the sun. And so we're hanging clothes. And the idea is that the thing that's at the top, it's like the sun. And why is it like the sun? Because the sun is consciousness. And why is this unconsciousness? Because you're awake during the day. Now there's a bunch of other reasons as well. The Sun is also the thing that defeats darkness and that's what the king should be. And that's right in their coins. And they're simple. They're symbols of value.

Speaker 2:          01:06:05       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       so they're all on the wind is blowing on it, but just not bothering you by the way. But that's a, that's a divine wind. That's PNEUMA. PNEUMA that's spirit because spirit is often win as an inspiration and respiration. That's all spirit. So spirit came here, comes to the bird. It's not lunch. It's his friend.

Speaker 2:          01:06:34       [inaudible] [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:06:47       Now who in the world is that? That's Carl Young. Who's that? The Virgin Mary and Christ. That's the virgin and the sun. It's a way older idea. Then the Christian idea. It's been around forever. Why? Because any culture that doesn't worship the mother and child dies obviously. So it's an archetypal image of value. Clearly. Obviously you don't have to think about that much.

Speaker 2:          01:07:32       So, oh,

Speaker 1:          01:07:44       oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:47       I love that.

Speaker 1:          01:07:49       There's, there's two things always happen when I showed this always, because it evokes archetypal emotions. So you were all going nick invoice from that cute noises, right? What kind of noises are those babies? Like that noise. That's why you're making that noise. It's like the baby like that though. I still smile at you and then you'll take that the navy likes you even though it's just a survival mechanism.

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       It

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       is, but the baby. So what? Why is that cute? First of all, it's not real. You might notice that. Yeah. Why is that cute? What means of cute? They guys. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, that's, that's part of it. Aliens have big eyes too though. What else? It's kindly. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a Mammalian, that's how small the lizard, you know, so that's helpful. It's got first so you can pet it sort of invites be petted and it moves like this. It was like, that's so cute. You know, that little polar bear. I did watch a little bit of that, like, that's like pathologically acute, that thing. And it's, you know, part of it is, it's sort of wobbling around and it's like the poor thing. It's trying to walk. It's having a rough time and everybody thinks, oh, that's so cute. That was happening to you.

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       You wouldn't think it was cute. But you know, animals, animals, first range of mammalian species, no cute. You know, and they tend to respond to like big guide, symmetrical small nose, flat faced, uh, helpless movement cuddly and not eat it. Right. It's, it's, so, it's an inhibitory, it's a set of inhibitory perceptual mechanisms in large part. But since we're also mammals, you better think that thing is cute because you're going to be taken care of it for a long time. So you know there has to be a deep, deep, deep biological connection. It's forged almost immediately. And of course that's mediated in women in particular by Oxytocin, which is released in tremendous quantities after birth and during breastfeeding. So, and it's necessary, you know, it turns on new circuits and there are circuits you need cause like one day you're not a mother and then the next day you are, that's not, you are not the same creature at that point and you don't want to even be the same creature. You're pretty happy about the whole issue. Hopefully.

Speaker 1:          01:10:19       So that's very interesting image j because first of all he was playing with the little lion king with those balls and they're, so there's sort of globe thing that's attracting them. So it was like representations of the sun and you might think, well you're just reading that into it. But then of course this happens. It's like this is, this is like he's breaking open the sun to release the essence of the sun onto the little lion king. And he is because the sun represents gold. Gold is pure gold, won't mix with any other metals. So that's partly why it's a symbol of value. It's a noble metal. The Sun is made out of gold so to speak, except it's like medical from a symbolic perspective because it's like the gold of higher consciousness and it feed dumped on the middle lion king because for the tribe sake and then maybe even for the sake of the whole ecosystem around the tribe, that king better be awake. So that's what this Carl Young baboons here is trying to get. Get going. Okay, so now you notice two things. Lovely. This is lovely. Very well put together seeing third bottle. So the animal is started to lift up your head so you can get the sense of heightened interest in the music is starting to rise a little bit in speed up in camp a better, you know what? Something's going to happen here at pinnacle of the, of the, of the rock there.

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       Brilliant. This little thing was now represents what will become the guiding consciousness of the land is revealed and the automatic response of all the animals, it's first to file. So they're in awe as they should be. And then to celebrate and then that's, you know, well that's pretty good. It's pretty impressive. But then God himself gets in the act because just at the opportune time, the sun breaks and shines on the little lion at the same time. They moved the music up like they changed the key of the music. And so if it causes an up swelling of emotion and that's, y'all would call that if, if, and when that happened, that's what he would call a synchronous event. So that's a demonstration of a synchronous event. It's where they're very rare. These things there from a union perspective, they're there. They occur in very emotionally intense situations where they context, the external context of the occurrence seems to match the meaning of the occurrence. So anyways, whether or not you believe such things are possible, that is exactly what this little film clip is trying to demonstrate.

Speaker 1:          01:13:58       Yup. Pretty decent or right. So you go up the animals, you've got the stone hierarchy, that's a pyramid. You've got the thing that's at the top of it, just like the little pyramid on the back of the American dollar bill with the eye on talk. Exactly the same. And part of the idea is that the thing that's at the very top of the pyramid isn't part of the fear of it. So it's not stolen. A little lion king, he isn't stone. He's the thing that produces stone as he moves through time, right? Because he's the culture producing force. And so this is setup to demonstrate visually that at the center of being is culture at the top of culture is the culture producing process or force. And that's the illuminated savior. And that's what all the animals worship instinctively. It's like, yes, that's right. That's how it goes. We'll see you on Tuesday. Okay.
