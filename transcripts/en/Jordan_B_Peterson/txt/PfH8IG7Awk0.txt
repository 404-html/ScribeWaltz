Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hello everybody, my name is Angelo and I am your Mc for the evening and uh, on behalf of the UBC free speech club, we would like to welcome you and thank you for attending our third Dr Jordan b Peterson event.

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       Thanks. Now.

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       I know you were all very excited to hear the man, so I'm going to keep these opening remarks very short. The UBC free speech club is devoted to the sanctity of liberty in our society and the necessity to keep liberty safe from those who want to destroy it within just the York club has grown to over a thousand members and is now in the process of incorporation so that we may continue to bring speakers and host events such as this one. None of that would be possible without Dr. Peterson who has inspired countless students all over North America to start speaking up on their campus. And in fact this club's sprung up around the same time when Dr Peterson publicly came out against bill. See 16 now is just over a year ago. And since then, his philosophy of cleaning your room and sorting yourself out has a better than influenced the lives of countless people. He's an accomplished psychologist, professor and author. His book maps of meaning is an analytical window into the myths and cultures of humankind. And now he's written a new book, it's called 12 rules for life and had to go to chaos. And it's available for preorder on Amazon with the release date of January 23rd 2018. And on that note, uh, on behalf of the UBC free speech club, we would like to introduce you all to Dr Jordan b Peterson.

Speaker 3:          00:01:55       Well, thank you very much for that. That's, that's quite something.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       Alright,

Speaker 3:          00:02:09       there's a house, Mike, Right? I don't need this one.

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       Perfect.

Speaker 3:          00:02:12       Okay. Well then let's just move it out of the way, right? So I'm going to talk to you tonight about the ideological nexus of postmodernism and Marxism and I want to get into it fairly deeply so you can have a thoughtful, thoughtful, a talk and then discussion afterwards. So it's a confusing topic because it's not obvious by any stretch of the imagination. Why postmodernism. And and neo Marxism, Marxism proper would be aligned because postmodernism is an anti grand narrative philosophical movement and Marxism is a grand narrative and so the fact that those two things seem to coexist in the same space needs definitely needs some explanation and it's a very tricky thing to get to the bottom of so we won't get to the bottom of it, but we'll get farther to the bottom of it. Then I've got before and hopefully farther than many of you have got before.

Speaker 3:          00:03:09       So let's see what we can figure out here. So I'm going to start with some. Some definitions all returned to them as we continue. You know, with philosophical movements, there are often not named by the major thinkers in the movement. They're sort of named afterwards. The name covers a very large range of ideas and actions and perceptions. Like it's not that easy. People talk about existentialism, for example. It's not that easy to come up with a one paragraph summary of what constitutes existentialism. My sense for the existentialists is that it's a. it's, it's fundamentally a movement. It's predicated on the idea, at least in, in the psychological sense that, um, you know, Freud tended to attribute human suffering and mental disorder to childhood trauma. Um, it's more complex than that, but that'll do for, for a quick overview, but the existentialists thought that there was enough suffering intrinsic in life so that it wasn't insanity.

Speaker 3:          00:04:10       That was the question. It was sanity. It was how it was possible for people to be saying and, and, and, and let's say normal, for lack of a better word, given that there was brutality and malevolence intrinsic in life, and the fact that you had to rise up as an individual and, and stand in relation to that relationship to that is part and parcel of what constitutes existentialism. And there's all sorts of different people who were thinkers who were existentialist. Some of them atheistic, some of them deeply religious like Dostoevsky, but so it's not. I'm using that as an example to show you how difficult it is to bring a set of thinkers under one umbrella. You're bound to over simplify, but we'll go ahead and oversimplify postmodernism. You can think about it as an attitude of skepticism, irony towards and rejection of grand narratives, ideologies and universalism, including the idea of the objective, notions of reason.

Speaker 3:          00:05:10       That's a big one. Human Nature. That's a big one. Social Progress, absolute truth in objective reality. All those things being questioned. Um, I kinda think of the head joker at the top of the postmodern hierarchy as Derrida. Foucault is often mentioned as are a number of other people. Um, here's some other attributes of postmodern thinking. There's a recognition of the existence of hierarchy, that's for sure. And there's an echo of that idea, the recognition of hierarchy in the term patriarchy because of course patriarchy is a recognition of hierarchy. Now it's a very particular kind of recognition, but the postmodernists also tend to define hierarchy as a consequence of power differential. And so the world day envisioned, as far as I can tell, it's something like a, it's a sociologically hobbsy in nightmare. So hobbes thought of the philosopher Thomas Hobbes, thought of the natural state of human beings as every individual in some sense, at the throat of every other individual so that the basic state of man, mankind, unlike the Rousseau's state of say virgin innocence and the Primitive Garden of paradise was an all out war of everyone against everyone else and that, that required the imposition of the social order to keep peace essentially.

Speaker 3:          00:06:36       So it's a, it's a fairly dark view of, of humankind. Russo on the other hand, we think of people as intrinsically good and the social order as intrinsically tyrannical, you can actually think about hobbes and Rousseau in some sense of, as, as, as opposites that need to be paired together in order to get a relatively comprehensive view of human nature. Well, the postmodern view is like the hobbs and view in some sense, except you want to replace the individual with, with, with pyramids of, of social organization. So hierarchies of social organization that are based on group identity, um, and that the landscape in which those pyramids exists is one of unbroken enmity and inability to communicate. So it's a very dark view as far as I'm concerned and I. I think it's fundamentally wrong in many ways. I mean it, it's right in that there are groups of people and there is some difficulty in communication between them and that power is an element in the formation of hierarchies, but you can't reduce hierarchy or group relationship to those premises.

Speaker 3:          00:07:47       It's too simplified because people also cooperate. We're also not groups. Men, we, many of us belong to many groups, so it's to the actual situation is far too complex to reduce it to that degree, to reduce it to that degree. Even though you can come up with a good explanatory story if you do so, it doesn't capture the nuances and they're not just nuances. It doesn't capture the essence. Now, the thing is is that when you make the presupposition that the reason that hierarchies exist is because of power, then essentially what you do is turn every hierarchy into a tyranny. And so if you, if there is a hierarchy, then you assume it's a tyranny. Well, that's really the patriarchy. The Patriarchy is hierarchy assumed as tyranny, and that's also just not true except in pathological hierarchies. So for example, we know from the psychological literature that the best predictors of longterm life success, our intelligence and conscientiousness in in western countries at least.

Speaker 3:          00:08:45       Well, that's what you'd hope for, right? More or less, if you, if you wanted even just set up a society, even if you weren't particularly smart or hard working, you might want to set up a society where intelligence and hard work, we are good predictors of success because then the people who were smart and hardworking would produce a bunch of things that you could have if you could trade for them. And of course that is actually the situation that most of us are in. So, and of course, the other thing about people who believed that hierarchies in the West are only composed of power and tyranny, is that their own actions belie that because whenever they make a decision to interact with that hierarchy, they attempt or to make a purchase or, or to make a trade, let's say, or to obtain a service, a service of any importance.

Speaker 3:          00:09:33       Let's say a medical service, they are going to definitely act as if there are less and more competent people within that hierarchy and seek out the ones that are more competent obviously, but you don't do if the, if the hierarchy is only composed of tyranny and power, there's no point looking for competence. But anyways, in the west and in functioning societies, hierarchies are basically predicated on competence and not power. And, and you might say, well that's pretty naive. It's like, no, actually it's not very naive. Um, I'm not saying at all that inappropriate powerplays don't play a role in corrupting hierarchies of competence that happens. But generally what happens is if the hierarchies of competence get corrupted enough by power, then they crumble because they can no longer function. So the, you know, the evidence that are hierarchies of competence. Work is everywhere because everything around us works all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:10:25       Ion. Here's the elite tells to two interesting stories in her book, infidel, which is a great book by the way. Um, she came from Africa and from a country that wasn't very functional. And when she came to Holland, she said there were two things that really amazed her, um, and this really struck me because, you know, now, and then you get lucky and you can see the world you live in from an outsider's perspective, right? You get to see through someone else's eyes. Um, she said the first thing that knocked her off her feet was waiting for a bus in, in Amsterdam, and on the, you know, she's standing at the bus stop and there's a pole there and there's digital sign on the pole and the digital science says when the next bus is going to come and counts down. And then when it hits zero, the bus appears and she, she just, she just, she absolutely could not believe that that would happen.

Speaker 3:          00:11:13       That there could be a sign that told you when the bus would come and that it would change and the bus would actually appear. And you think, well, yeah, no, that's a miracle man. That's an absolute miracle. It is. It is. You got to think that through, you know, the amount of timing and organization and and and and reliability, mechanical reliability and sociological or social organization and dedication on the part of the bus drivers in the entire company and the organization if the whole city and the state to make that possible is absolutely beyond belief, especially when it's time to, well perhaps not the second but to 10 seconds or something like that. That is absolutely beyond belief and her inability to comprehend. That was the correct response. And then the other things she was amazed by was that you could go talk to policemen and they would help you.

Speaker 3:          00:12:03       That was just, that was just a no go for her because for her, her experience was policemen were there to shake you down and hurt you. And so you think, well, you know, well, I won't. I won't dwell on that point any longer. The point is, is that it's absolutely ridiculous blind to make the assumption that the hierarchies in functioning Western democracies are fundamentally predicated on power and tyranny. And then, you know, I can use a biological example too, which would place me outside of the postmodern realm of argument because the postmodernists don't believe in biology, but, but they act like they do because they all die.

Speaker 2:          00:12:48       So,

Speaker 3:          00:12:56       so, uh, this primatologist named. Well, I'll tell you two stories. Okay. Because these are, these are really useful. So the ones about rats, and I got this story from Jaak Panksepp who is a great neuroscientists. He wrote a book called affective neuroscience, which by the way is on my reading list that's on my website. It's a really good book affect of neuroscience. He's a great scientist. He was one of the people who he learned that he learned that rats laugh. They laugh out ultrasonically like bat. So if you're gonna you take a look with a pencil eraser, they laugh, but you have to record it and then slow it down and then you can hear them and you might think, well, rats laugh, like, who wants to eat? Get a grant for that. What kind of idiocy is that? It's like, no, no, no. Just don't, don't, don't get ahead of yourself here, you know, he was showing that, that that capacity for social interaction, for social interaction that was mediated by physiological touch activated the same, excuse me, activated the same circuits in rats, that it doesn't people and that those are actual biological circuits, and we share them even with rats.

Speaker 3:          00:14:02       Now, rats are quite similar to human beings. As it turns out, I could say especially postmodernists, but I won't.

Speaker 3:          00:14:11       And uh, and, and so the fact that, that, you know, the little rats giggle when you tickle them is actually extraordinarily important. He also identified surprising. I've been talking too much lately. He also identified the primary place circuit and mammals. And that's a big deal too from a scientific perspective. That's like discovering a new continent, like discovering a whole brain system that people really didn't know existed. That's a big deal. So here's a little story about rats. Young rats like to engage in rough and tumble play, especially juvenile males. It's also the case for puppies. If you've ever had a puppy, dogs are like that. They liked to wrestle and it's one of the things that male human beings tend to do with their offspring and it's a really, really good thing like rough and tumble play with children really helps socialize them because it helps them figure out the difference between touch and even rough touch and pain because one of the things you're doing when you're rough and tumble playing with the little kid is you know, you throw them up in the air and you're wrestling around.

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       I built my. I had two couches when my kids were little that were sort of face to face, so we built this little wrestling ring and I used to go in there and pound them half to death every night. You know, so they love that. I mean they get so excited about that. They love that so much. It's just crazy. But the reason for that is like you're stretching out their bodies and you're showing them that they can't put their thumb in your eye and you're teaching them to be graceful and, and, and you're teaching them the difference between something new that's happening to the body and something painful. You're really teaching them to dance and it's this really complicated physiological dance that, that is indicative of a socialized being. That's partly why women like men who can dance by the way, um, because it shows that you can pay attention to someone else first of all, that you're coordinated, but even more importantly that you can take the fact of your coordination and coordinate that with someone else's coordination.

Speaker 3:          00:16:08       So, and that's very primal and physiological. It's built right into your body and rough and tumble play helps without a lot. Anyways. Rats also like too rough and tumble play for much the same reasons and sort of sort of pretty much all social mammals. So you can tell that rats like it. See how do you know if a rat likes something? Well, he'll work for it. And one of the ways you can figure out if a rat wants to work for something is that, you know, you get them in a state where maybe he's desperate for whatever he's working for and you can put a little spring on them and figure out how hardy poles to go somewhere. He knows where he's going to get that and then you can measure the force that he's willing to apply and that gives you a rough estimate of his motivation or maybe ask the bar press like a, you know, like a cocaine addicted rats to, to receive the reward and you can count rate of bar pressing and you can get an estimate of how excited the route is to go do whatever it is the rats going to do.

Speaker 3:          00:16:59       And so panksepp used to put rats in, pair them one riot against the other in kind of a play arena, not a very big thing and uh, and the juvenile males and they would work to do that. Okay. So they liked it. And then maybe one rat was 10 percent bigger than the other. And then when you paired them, the big rat would beat the little rat because 10 percent weight advantage was enough to make the bigger rep dominant. Okay. So then they established basically dominance and submission. You might think about that as a power relationship. And to some degree it is, but it's more complicated than that. And this is very important. So, so the rats play together once and the a big route pins the little rat really very much like wrestling, like rats wrestle, just like people wrestle 'em.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       And if you pair them together, then the big rat campaign, the little rat, okay. So now you got dominant rats, subordinate rat, roughly speaking. And, but then you see if you stop the experiment there you'd think, well the rats play to establish dominance and submission. But the thing is is that rats don't just play once, they played many, many, many times. And that's also the case with human beings is that you don't just play once, you play many, many times and there is a difference between the rules of a game and the rules of a set of games. And that's so unbelievably important. So you keep that in mind because we'll return to that. So anyways, the next time the two rats get together, the little rat house to ask the big route to play because the rule basically is subordinate entity asks dominant entity to play.

Speaker 3:          00:18:36       And so the little rat does what mammals do to play, you know, they kind of put their paws down and put the rear end up, bit up in the air. You see dogs do that. And unless you're completely clueless, you know that, that doesn't mean he's going for your throat, means he wants you to whack them on the side of the head so he can sort of pretend to bite you. You know, it's, it's pretty obvious if you've played with dogs and children. So, um, yeah. And I make that comparison because dogs and children understand each other, right? They're pack animals, they followed the same basic rules. They know how to play. They can become friends, otherwise you wouldn't have them as pets. I mean the dogs, not the children. Um, so anyways, the little rat asks the big role to play in big rep thing.

Speaker 3:          00:19:18       So yeah. Yeah. Okay. Are they will play, they wrestle and you pair them multiple times. Well, if you compare them multiple times, what you find is the less the big rat lets the little rat win, 30 percent of the time the little rat won't ask the big rat to play anymore and that you think, well, who cares what? Like why is that important? It's like, it's really important. That's a really important discovery because it shows you that the, that even rats have a set set a sense of fair play that emerges across iterated games. It's, it's, it's inevitable. It's evidence for the biological instantiation of a social morality. It's a big deal, man. That's a big discovery. And, and it shows you that even at the level of rats, they're very social animals by the way. Um, the interactions between rats are, are mediated by something like a sense of fairness or justice.

Speaker 3:          00:20:06       And so that's extremely cool because, you know, we tend to think of animals as having dominance hierarchies and that's predicated on power. And that idea, even though the bloody postmodernists don't believe in biology, they extend that analogy up to human beings. It's just not true. Okay? Well, at the same time, turns out to be true with chimpanzees. So Frans de Waal, who's a, a Dutch primatologist, a very smart one too. He's been interested in the biological basis of morality as well. Um, and he really, he's written a lot of good books on, on, on primate behavior. Chimps in particular. Chimps are brutal creatures, man. Like they go to war a. and so if you have a chimp territory out in the jungle, then the juveniles will, the males in particular, the band together in groups of four or five. There's often but not always a female or two with them.

Speaker 3:          00:20:53       And if they come across chimps from another troupe that aren't within their hierarchy, let's say they will, if they're, if they outnumber them because they, they can't really count, but they can estimate magnitude visually. It's not the same as counting. Um, but if they outnumber them, they will tear them to pieces. And chimps serve at least twice as strong as a really well developed human male. And so they can tear you up pretty good. And chimps are perfectly capable. They hunt, they're carnivorous like human beings. And they hunt, they hunt colobus monkeys, often they weigh about 40 pounds and they'll basically eat them alive at the monkey screaming away like mad because you know it's in pain because it's being eaten and that doesn't slow the chimps down a bit. There's no cross species empathy stopping them from having their snack. And so chimps are very brutal creatures and it isn't obvious they have a lot of internal inhibition of the regression at all.

Speaker 3:          00:21:49       Most of the inhibition is sociological. It's out in the hierarchy. And so the reason chimps aren't always aggressive with one another is because they know who can pound them and and who will gang up on them and who won't be established their hierarchy anyways. You know, you think about a champ hierarchy and you're talking about a fairly strong and aggressive creature. You might think it's biggest, ugliest, meanest, most vicious, irritable, unpleasant chimp that rises to the top. But all that's kind of the postmodernist view of human society. But that's not the case. It happens sometimes. But what happens in has documented this quite nicely, is that tyron chimps lead unstable regimes. Now, you know, that might sound familiar because the same thing of course is true human beings and why is that? Well, it's because you know, people don't like tyrants and chimps don't like them that much either and chimps are actually quite reciprocal and their social interaction, so they don't just dominate each other.

Speaker 3:          00:22:47       They groom each other, they have friendships, they can track social relationships over very long periods of time now and they do that and so they engage in reciprocal interactions, let's say prosocial reciprocal interactions and you might think, well what's the, what's the weak point of the biggest, ugliest, toughest chimp in the troop? And that is he doesn't have any friends. And so, you know, maybe as a bad day he's a little hung over or whatever for meeting fermented bananas or whatever is partying with and to have the slightly less ugly, slightly less mean. Chimps decide, well this is a good time to take them out and they tear them to pieces. And so one of the things do all his pointed out quite nicely is that if you want to have a stable chimp dominance hierarchy, let's call it a regime, the stable ones aren't ruled by the tyrants tyrants get taken out by, by paired up friendship dyad, something like that. So that's really worth thinking about too, you know, because

Speaker 3:          00:23:54       because it indicates that even in creatures that have less complex sociological orders and they do because one of the things that predicts how complex your social order is, how big your brain is compared to your body, it's encephalization essentially. And the more encephalitis creature, the larger the social groups that contract. And of course human beings are very highly encephalitis. So we have quite complicated group, um, we have quite complicated group organizations, but even in simpler group organizations like the chimps, it isn't the tyrant who rule stable. And that turns out to be also incredibly important. Okay. So, so, so much for the idea that power is the only game in town. Then you got to ask. The question is, well, this is actually a postmodern question. So you know, one of the things Derek just said that the main postmodern joker is that by categorizing you, you, you privilege one concept and you, you force other concepts out to the margins.

Speaker 3:          00:24:55       And so he believed that when you constructed a hierarchy of power, that the hierarchy of power, privilege, certain people and marginalized others, and you know, that's really not that brilliant observation as far as I'm concerned. It's rather commonplace. All it means is that when you categorize something that there are things that are in the category and whole bunch of things that aren't. And so you actually can't categorize anything, which means you can't perceive anything, which means you can't think or live without making some things in the middle. And everything else on the outside. It's part of categorization itself. And so maybe the postmodernist would go far enough to question the utility of categorization itself. And I think to some degree they do do that. But, um, the point here is that if you,

Speaker 3:          00:25:50       you have to ask why it is that you would, if you were a postmodernist yourself, why it is that you would privilege the idea of power above all else. It's exactly what is it that you're pushing to the margin. And so that's something that we're going to talk about. Now, here's one thing you might push to the margin. Let's say that you believe that hierarchies are a consequence of power. Well then you push competence to the margin and then applying the postmodern mark modernist logic, you might say, well, the reason you're privileging power is so that you can produce so that you can push competence to the margin. And so you want to keep that in mind too, because that's going to become important as we discussed the relationship between postmodernism and Marxism. Maybe you're after the destruction of the idea of competence itself.

Speaker 3:          00:26:39       All right, so postmoderns, and we talked about it a little bit. We'll return to it. Now we're going to talk a little bit about Marxism. I've got a quote here from mark's. The proletarians have nothing to lose, but they're changed. Uh, well. That was pretty good for like 18, 80 or 80, 90 or whenever it was. He wrote it. Somewhere around that period of time it turned out the proletarians had a lot more to lose the interchange they had their lives and their families to lose. That was demonstrated amply as a consequence of the, what would you call it, the sociological movements that were put into place when the Marxist presuppositions began to govern societies like the Soviet Union. So, all right, so let's take the same postmodernist approach. So here's some basic tenants of Marxism. It's Berge Lousy against proletariat. The bridge was the year, the capitalists, the property owners, those sorts of people, the proletariat, the working class, for all intents and purposes.

Speaker 3:          00:27:39       The basic idea is that history itself is nothing but the, what would you call it? The documentation of the struggle of one class against the other. Okay. No, that's wrong, but it's okay because it's too simple, obviously. It's obviously too simple. There's all sorts of motivations that people have. Some of them are economic, some of them are associated with power, but that's okay. We will leave that. Let's let's give the devil his due and say, well, yeah, fair enough. There is still a fair bit of tension between the haves and the haves and have nots and maybe that was even more intense in previous societies than it is now. And it's no, there's no doubt that economics plays a role in, in virtually everything that human beings do in a fairly significant role. So let, let's, let's accept that as a potential theory. It's, it's simple, but maybe it's practically useful.

Speaker 3:          00:28:31       And then there's kind of an offshoot of that theory, which is that, well, if you're a Marxist, that means you have sympathy for the working class. Right? Because that's what you're saying all the time. It's like, well, the poor working class, they're all oppressed. The poor, poor proletariat, you know. And then you're also saying, well, we're the good guys because we're standing on the side of the oppressed. And so then you might also ask what you're marginalizing when you claim that you're the good guys, because one of the things that you would be marginalizing is all of the ways in which you're not the good guys, but we can leave that aside for a moment too. So, but there's the claims is that, you know, there's the working class against the ruling class. Another claim is the ruling class is the ruined class because they exploit the working class basically stealing their excess labor from them.

Speaker 3:          00:29:16       Um, another very, very, uh, what, uh, surfacely attractive claim that lacks any reasonable justification, you know, because it's predicated on the idea of the world as a zero sum game. And clearly the world is not a zero sum game. So when someone creates wealth, when someone is wealthy, it can be at least at times because they created it, not because they swiped it from someone else. I think, you know, you can think of someone like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs is a good example of that. Um, you know, they're, they're what they produced pad to value that far exceeded what they garnered. As a consequence of their production, even though what they garnered was fairly substantial. So anyways, but we'll get, like you said, we're going to give the devil his due. Okay. It's the bourgeoisie against the proletariat will accept that it's class warfare is the primary historical mover.

Speaker 3:          00:30:11       No problem now, but here's what I'm not willing to give away so easily. Uh, we have sympathy for the working class primarily and we're good because of that. Now I'm not gonna. Just give that away. So simply. So let's investigate that a little bit. Let's see if we can actually figure it out. If that's true. We'll say a use a pragmatic approach because I'm a pragmatist in that William James, Sansa, um, uh, or maybe you can think about even more deeply in anciently. Uh, there's a statement in the New Testament, I think it's by their fruits, you shall know the fine. So we're going to walk down that road before we do that. So now that's another thing you have to keep in mind. Before we do that, I want to make one more detour. Okay? So I like making detours and then tangling the oil back together, so I want to give you a bit of a history of theories of suffering and I'm going to compare the Marxist theory of suffering to the Judeo Christian theory of suffering and the Judeo Christian would be.

Speaker 3:          00:31:14       And the reason I'm doing that is because I think the Judeo Christian theory of suffering is actually one of the foundation stones of our entire culture. And so it actually matters why you think they're suffering. And so the story that describes the entry of suffering into the world, that mythological story is the story in Genesis, the story of Adam and eve and basically what happens in the story of Adam and Eve as Adam and Eve are unconscious to begin with and they're sort of in this paradise will state there's no death or at least there's no knowledge of death. There's also no knowledge of self. And then eats the apple that the serpent gives her and the scales fall from her eyes and she gives the apple to Adam and he eats it as well. So she makes him self conscious. They both wake up, the first thing that happens is they realize that they're naked and they cover themselves up, and the second thing that happens as a consequence of that realization is that they come to know the difference between good and evil and I mean that's an insanely complicated story that's dealing with a re absolutely in comprehensible number of complex phenomena simultaneously, but it basically goes something like this is that to be aware that you're naked is to be aware of your fragility and your mortality when when you have a nightmare about being naked in front of a crowd, it means that you're exposed to the crowd.

Speaker 3:          00:32:36       All your flaws, all your mortal vulnerability is exposed to the crowd, for for for them to see, for you to be ashamed of, for them to judge. That's partly why we're all close. That's partly why human being a human white clothing is a human universal. There's many human universals, by the way, clothing is one of them, although it's used for many different purposes, so Adam and eve cover themselves up and so because they've realized that they're, that they're vulnerable, they're naked and vulnerable. That self consciousness, human beings are self conscious animals. We're really the only self conscious animals. Other animals have the glimmerings of self consciousness. Some of them can identify themselves in a mirror, for example, but we have whole theories of ourselves. We have whole articulated verbal and philosophical theories of what a human being is and what we each are as individual.

Speaker 3:          00:33:26       So really those aren't in the same conceptual universe. It's a whole different. It's a qualitatively different issue. In the case of human beings were self conscious, selfconsciousness loads on trait, neuroticism, technically speaking, which means that self consciousness is primarily something that manifests itself in the form of negative emotion and we all know that you're onstage. You get self conscious. Is that a good thing? No. You can give. So self conscious that your tongue tied, right? It's not good. You don't want to be self conscious onstage or maybe ever you get self conscious in the in the face of someone you're trying to impress. He turned all red. You Stammer. It's like self consciousness is a rough business and it's no wonder because you know yourself for the for the fragile fool that you are and it's even worse than that because see, it took me a long time to figure out why it was that when Adam and eve woke up, they also develop the knowledge of good and evil.

Speaker 3:          00:34:17       I just couldn't figure that out because it didn't make sense to me. Why? How selfconsciousness knowledge of vulnerability and the knowledge of good and evil we're tangled together or even really what the knowledge of good and evil meant, but I figured it out. Eventually I thought, oh, I get it. I get it. It was like a real revelation to me. As soon as you know you're vulnerable, you know the difference between good and evil, because as soon as you know you're vulnerable, then you know everyone else is. And as soon as you know that everyone else is vulnerable, you know how to hurt them. And so that means you consciously know how to bring suffering into being and that's the knowledge of good and evil. And you know that because let's say that you're really good at torturing people, hadn't, there's no doubt a number of people in the audience who are actually quite good at that and maybe you all have a bit of an affinity for it. Um, if you're married, I'm sure your partner would testify to that.

Speaker 3:          00:35:11       So if you're going to hurt someone, what do you think essentially is, okay, what would really hurt me? Then you think, well, I'll just do that to them. And it's like, that's, that's, that's a, that's a good theory. It's a very sophisticated. So anyways, so, okay, so what happens? Adam and eve, wake up, they weren't supposed to do this. God told them that they are going to be sorry if they did that, but they did it anyways because that's what people are like and because we learn things that knock us out of our present paradises we're curious and we won't leave things alone and maybe things are not so bad and then you, you know, ask some questions that maybe you're not so happy about asking. Once you find the answer and you fall out of your little paradise into history and you gotta work to set things right again. Anyways, God gets wind of this and, and he chases Adam and eve out of the garden of Eden,

Speaker 3:          00:36:07       but he said some interesting things when he chases them out, he says, all right, now you know, what's the consequences of that? And he says, Dad, if you're going to have to work. Oh, that's cool. That's really cool. Well, he is God after all. It also, he, he's. He knows what he's talking about. He says, you're going to have to work. So why would you have to work now that you knew you were vulnerable? Well, the answer to that is, well, if you know you're vulnerable, that stretches out into the future, you know you're going to die, you know that you're fragile. It's like maybe all your problems are solved right now. You're all sitting here, you're safe, you're not hungry, you don't want anything to drink, etc. But what about tomorrow? What about next week or next month or 10 years from now? It's like, just because you got all your problems solved for this second doesn't mean you've got them solved for the rest of your iterations through time.

Speaker 3:          00:36:58       So you got to work and the work is the sacrifice of the president for the future. And so that's exactly right. You have to work now you see? See what's interesting aBout that, and this is the theory that I was, oh, and then of course god tells that eve, well, you've really, you know, screwed things up to, you're going to have these big brain babies and, and that's a big problem. You're going to suffer in childbirth and then they're going to be dependent on you forever. And because of that, you're going to be dependent on this. man that you just woke up and that's not going to be very pleasant for either of you, but tough luck and so that's it. That's the curse in some sense and it's exactly right, but the thing is, there's a theory in there. There's an interesting theory of suffering that's implicit in that story and the theory of suffering is that suffering is built into the structure of self conscious being. It's built right into the structure, so if you're a self conscious being, that's your lot. It isn't someone else's fault. It isn't a consequence of sociological oppression. It isn't the consequences of the fact that our society isn't organized properly.

Speaker 3:          00:38:04       It's just part of being.

Speaker 3:          00:38:08       All right, so that's a big deal because that's a. That's an important theory because one of the questions is, well, what we know why is there suffering, but what are you going to do about it? And it's a big. It's a lot different if it's just the Way it is for you and if it's actually your fault that he's suffering, those are, or maybe it's the group's fault that you're suffering. Those are major. Those theories are really, really different and then in the second story in cain and abel, cane make sacrifices to try to get it in good with god enabled, make sacrifices and sacrifices are kind of archaic from our perspective. They're burnt offerings so the smoke goes up where god can detect it because he's up there somewhere up there where the stars are and uh, god rejects cane sacrifices and we don't really know why, but it kind of looks like cain is a second grader and then god king goes and complains to god and says like, what kind of stupid universe did you make here?

Speaker 3:          00:39:04       I'm breaking myself and half trying to get things together, making the proper sacrifices and nothing's going well for me and abel. Well, you know, he's everything he touches turns to gold. Everyone loves him. He's even a really good guy. It's like so annoying. What's up with this place you built? And god tells kane don't become an and telling me that the entire fabric of reality is wrong because it isn't working out for you. Says sin crouches at your door. Like a, like a sexually aroused predatory cat. That's basically the metaphor that, that god uses and he says, and you let it in and had it and let it have its way with you, and that's really an interesting way of putting it because what god says to cain is that, you know, you're all bitter and resentful and really it's no wonder because you know, things aren't going well for you and then you've got able who's over shining you in every way and uh, but it's your fault,

Speaker 3:          00:40:05       this terrible thing waited at the door and you let it in and then you entered into a creative union with it and you produced something as a consequence and that's this tormented spirit that you have now and it's polluting your relationship with reality. And that's why things aren't working out very well for you. So go put yourself together before you come and tell me just exactly what's wrong with the structure of reality. And cain isn't very happy about that because really is that really what you want to hear, right? Like you have more misery than is necessary because you really didn't put your act together and you know it and you've done it creatively and so kayden goes and kills abel.

Speaker 3:          00:40:51       That's the story of how resentment enters the world and it's the first story in the judeo christian canon, let's say about actual human beings because adam and eve were made by god so they don't really count. Cain and abel were born and so that's something so there's a reaction to suffering, right? The necessIty of sacrifice and the consequence of the necessity of sacrifices that some sacrifices work and others don't, and then if your sacrifices aren't met with the, with the good will of god, let's say, well then that makes you angry. Well, of course it does. You can take god out of this story if you want. If you're not happy with that kind of mythological or narrative statement, but it doesn't really matter because the whole point is is that if you make sacrifices, especially if they're second rate, things aren't going to go very well for you and you're going to get bitter and resentful and murderous and maybe genocidal and it's really interesting, you know, because cane has descendants and if you bug, if you transgress against them, they don't just kill you. They killed seven of you and then his later descendants kill 49 of you. There's this exponential growth of murderousness as a consequence of canes,

Speaker 3:          00:42:00       primary, primal fratricide, and then the next story is the flood. And that's not an accident. There's nothing in those stories is an accident. Okay, so now you've got two different theories about the nature of suffering. You've got the one I just laid out, it's called the foundational story of suffering and malevolence, and you have the marxists story, which is while there's an oppressed people and the reason they're oppressed and suffering is because of the oppressors are oppressing them. Those are not the same theories. Right? And there's a utopianism that's implicit in marxism, which is if you could just get the damn old pressers to stop oppressing the oppressed, then the utopia would arrive. And so not only are the oppressors responsible for the suffering of the poor, they're also responsible for the fact that the utopia isn't here for everyone. And so how reprehensible can you get? Well then that certainly justifies that degree of malevolence justifies pretty much anything you'd like to do to them. So anyways, so let's take this apart in a little more detail. Don't do the marxists. Have sympathy for the working class. George orwell was interested in this question and so he wrote this book called wiggins road to wigan pier, which I would highly recommend it. So on a reading list I've made, it's on my website. You can check that out. Those are books that have been particularly influential to me. And so orwell was a socialist. he wrote the book for the left book club, which published a kind of a socialist book once a month or. Well, by the time he wrote this book, he was already awake.

Speaker 3:          00:43:47       No buy in the 19 twenties after the russian revolution. No one really knew what to make of what was happening in what would become the soviet union, right be. It was after world war. One planet was in ashes, pro intents and purposes. The old aristocratic order was crumbling.

Speaker 4:          00:44:07       Um,

Speaker 3:          00:44:08       it was a horror show and these revolutionaries came out with these new ideas and tried to give the in principle, give the working class a break and everybody watched to see what would happen then,

Speaker 4:          00:44:21       um,

Speaker 3:          00:44:22       the honest people and the intellectuals watched and I separate them for a reason. Um, but by 1920, 21, 22, something like that, it was obvious already that something was rotten in the state of Denmark. Malcolm muggeridge went over to the soviet union to check out how the collectivization of the farms was going and he found out it was actually pretty murderous, right? Because what the, what the communists did was roundup all the successful farmers and rape them and kill them and steal everything they had and send them off to siberia, which turned out actually to be a pretty bad idea. Now you think you think about it, those people were serfs not very long before a couple of generations at most, they were so not much more than slaves and some of them had risen up to the point where the media had a nice brick house and a couple of cows and maybe a person working for them or too, and there was a small proportion of the agriculturalists in the soviet union that we're producing most of the food and that's just how it goes because that's a prieto distribution issue in any field where there's human productivity, a small proportion of the people produce almost all of the output.

Speaker 3:          00:45:29       It's actually the square root of the number of people in the field produce half the output. So if you have 100 farmers, ted of them produce half the food, but if you have 10,000 to 100 of them produce half the food. Okay? So what happens when you kill all the good farmers? You starve 6 million ukrainians to death in the 19 thirties. And you know, that's not something that's all that widely known, but if you want to provide some additional fodder for your nightmares, you could go online and read about what happened to the ukrainians in the 19 thirties. So underneath the, under the collectivization principles. So let's say you're a mother and you were starving to death and so are your children and you know, the communists had come in and forcibly collectivized you and then they took all the grain that your collective farm and producing, they shipped it all to the city say.

Speaker 3:          00:46:18       And so that's all done. And you think, okay, you know, the city's got eight. So then you go out in the field to pick up the grains that the harvesters missed so that you can, you know, the ones that they'd be lying there, they're not so good. There's not that many of them. you go out and glean, you pick up the seeds that weren't picked up a so you can feed your kids so they don't die. And so what's the punishment for that death? Because you were obliged under the collectivization orders to turn in any additional grains that you happen to pick off the ground to the authorities so that they can be, well, who knows, but at least so you. So they could be shipped to the cities, I suppose, which is of course absurd because of course that would never happen, but it was mostly so that you could just actually die. So. Okay. Anyways, back to the road to wigan pier. Now

Speaker 3:          00:47:14       I'm going to read you a little bit about about from the book. So orwell went out to this mining town in the northern uk and coal miners had sympathy for the working class. He really worked on that hiS whole life because he was a middle class, upper middle class, snobby type englishman, and he knew it and he tried really hard to overcome that. He, he, he, he served in the spanish civil war. He wandered around as a tramp. He worked in, in low end restaurant. He worked as a low end worker in restaurants in paris and in london. He has a very good book, I think it's called down and out in paris and london that describes that he was seriously committed dude and really a smart guy. And so he's going up to these terrible towns in the northern uk where the coal miners worked and have their families and you know, they had hard lives.

Speaker 3:          00:48:09       They had hard lives and that's just say it, nothing, you know, the coal miners that he met, they didn't have any teeth by the time they were 30. He said the women he talked to you said teeth or just a misery. It's better to get rid of them as soon as you can. Um, and, and, and they went and the man went and mined coal and that was rough. You know, they all have black lung by the time they were 40 and they were, they were done fundamentally. But here's a, just a bit, a bit of a story about how hard their lives were. So they had to go in the mines during the day so that they never saw the day. So that's one thing. They had to go to the mines and then they ended like not coal off the walls. That's hard with hammers and picks and all of that and they had to move it, but that was.

Speaker 3:          00:48:55       That was their job, but there was the commute, so here is the commute. So imagine that the typical tunnel was about that high, something like that, and the typical coal miner was about that high. Lots of problem maybe because you've got to walk through those tunnels to get to work so you have to walk like this. Then the question might be, well, how far do you have to walk to work? And that answer is three and a half miles and that's how far you have to walk back from work after you put your eight hour shift in the coal mine and the you don't get paid for the commute. And so orwell said that was more or less like climbing a small mountain in the morning before you went to work and then climbing another one at night before you went home. And so that was just.

Speaker 3:          00:49:37       I mean, believe me, I'm telling you very little about how tough their lives were, but that gives you a little flavor. I said one day like that for a modern person, you're just your dad or you wish you were dead anyways, and so orwell talks about going up there to stay in terrible places he lived in while he was up there and the terrible food he ate and and the miserable and wretched scenes that he saw. And here's one of the miserable richard scenes. He's on a train through the neighborhoods. He says, the train bore me away for the monster scenery of slag. Heaps, chimneys piled scrap iron fall canals, paths of singery mud, criss cross by the prince of clogs. This was march, but the weather had been horribly cold and everywhere there were mounds of black and snow. As we move slowly through the outskirts of the town, we passed row after of little gray slum houses running at right angles to the embankment at the back of one of the houses.

Speaker 3:          00:50:34       The young woman was kneeling on the stones poking a stick up the lead and waste pipe which ran from the sink inside him, which I suppose was blocked. I had time to see everything about her. Her sack apron, her clumsy clogs her arms, reddened by the cold. She looked up as the train passed, and I was almost near enough to catch her eye. She had around pale face, usual exhausted face of the slum girl who's 25 and looks 40 thanks, two miscarriages and drudgery and at war for the second in which I sought the most desolate, hopeless expression I've ever seen. It struck me. Then we meaning the middle class at that time, our mistake, and when we saY that it isn't the same for them as it would be for us, and then people bread in the slums can imagine nothing but the slums for what I saw on her face was by no means the ignorant suffering of an animal. She knew well enough what was happening to her, understood as well as I did, how dreadful of destiny it was to be kneeling there in the bitter cold. On the slimy stones of a slum backyard poking a stick up, a follow drain pipe.

Speaker 3:          00:51:42       All right, so orwell rates the first part of the book and it details the lives of these people and then he makes an argument he says was like, how can you read about this? How can you know about this without having some sympathy for redistribution schemes and social and socialist ideas. And so he's actually asking himself this question. It's not just a rhetorical question. He's, I mean, he's a serious guy, right? He went, he goeS up there and he tells you a story that you have to have a heart of stone if you, if you don't, if you read that you don't think, man, something should be done about this. It's really awful. So he set up this situation where your sympathies are completely with the people that he's describing, but socialism wasn't all that popular in britain at that time. And, and so, and socialists weren't all that popular with orwell. He didn't really like them that much and he was trying to figure out why that was. So this is what he wrote in the second part of the book. Now this card have been a lot of trouble. they didn't want to publish this damn book after he wrote the second part.

Speaker 4:          00:52:54       Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:52:56       but he fought with him and he got it published and it's a classic and, and people still read it and you should read it because it's a great book and orwell's great writer and orwell is another one of those people and intellectuals who woke up pretty early. You know, orwell wrote animal farm and 1984. He wrote 1984 and 1940 eIght wrote animal farm approximately around the same time. He knew what was happening under stalin and he wasn't afraid to say it, but it was a that in some sense fell on deaf ears, especially among the intelligentsia. And there's complicated reasons for that. But. But it wasn't like the facts weren't there for people to see them if they wanted to. And has already said muggeridge. Malcolm muggeridge had made it pretty clear in the 19 twenties and that was widely publicized by the way, throughout the uk. What was happening during d kula, the kulaks being the farmers that I talked about earlier, who, who had committed the unspeakable sin of crawling out of their surf status over a couple of Generations to the point where they weren't mirror property and half starved, so this is what oracle had to say about socialists.

Speaker 3:          00:54:11       It might be sad, however, that Even if the theoretical oriented book train socialist is not a working man himself, at least he has actually by a love of the working class. He's endeavoring to shed his joie status and fight on the side of the proletariat. Obviously that must be his motive. What is it? Sometimes I look at the socialist, the intellectual tract writing type of socialist with his pullover is fuzzy hair and his marxist quotation and wonder what the devil is. Motive really is. It's really difficult to believe that it's a love of anybody, especially if the working class from whom he is of all people, the furthest removed. The truth is that too many people calling them socialists revolution does not mean a movement of the masses with which they hope to associate themselves. It means instead of set of reforms which we, the clever ones are going to impose on them the lower orders. On the other hand, it would be a mistake to regard the book train socialist as a bloodless creature, entirely incapable of emotion, though seldom giving much evidence of affection for the exploited is perfectly capable of displaying hatred, sort of queer theoretical in vacuum. Oh, hatred against the explorers. Hence the grand old social sport of denouncing the bourgeoisie. It is strange how easily almost any socialist writer can lash himself into frenzies of rage against the class too, which by birth or by adoption, he himself almost invariably belongs.

Speaker 3:          00:55:51       No, I worked for the ndp when I was a kid and I had privileged access to the leadership for provincially and federally for reasons that I won't go into. And I thought that many of them were honorable people who were really striving to give the working class of voice. And I believe that the working class needs a voice, a political voice for obvious reasons. Um, I think the democrats in the United States have made it absolutely dreadful abysmal mistake replacing their working class, political ethos with identity politics. We're going to talk about that and, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:56:37       and I don't think the situation has changed that much. I think one of the things that's happened in the United States is that world stability and peace in some ways has been purchased at the expense of north american working class wellbeing now because the chinese have gotten rich compared to 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago, the, the indians have gotten rich again, same comparison basis. There's more middle class people in India now than there are on the United States. Um, the trade arrangements that have been in north America allowed for the rise of middle classes globally. At the same time, they opened up the working class in north America to competition from those low wage sources. And maybe that's a good deal. It's hard to say, right, because it's not such a bad thing that the chinese aren't starving and it's not such a bad thing that the indians aren't starving and that those societies are transforming themselves. actually into communities that are quite wealthy, it's like hooray for that. It's an absolutely miraculous transformation. It's the most rapid growth of human wealth in the history of humanity, so we should be pretty happy about that, but we should also remember at least to some degree who's paid the price for it and so as far as I'm concerned, the working class needs a voice

Speaker 5:          00:57:59       and

Speaker 3:          00:58:01       it isn't obvious that they have one at the moment. Having said that, however, it isn't obvious to me at all

Speaker 3:          00:58:12       that the people who purport to stand for the working class actually do so or that if they do so that the reason they do so is because they're all compassionate and sympathetic and loving and kind and st. Like I'm more convinced by orwell's argument. So back to the mdp, the people I met at the leadership level, a lot of them I had a fair bit of admiration for, but as I worked with the party over about a five year period, there's this contradiction that kept emerging for me and that was that I didn't really like the low level party functionary activist types. Like they just weren't personally appealing to me. They seem peevish and resentful and then at the same time I was going to college, I was about 17. I got elected to the senate on the college board of governors and at that time alberta was conservative politically, right.

Speaker 3:          00:59:07       It still is of course, but they. It was part of the progressive conservative empire because they ruled alberta forever and all the board of governor members were basically nominees, right. TheY were conservative nominees. So these were conservative people and I was an ndp member and I thought I'd worked for small businessman to who weren't mdp. They were, they were conservative. It can never figure that out. I'll tell you about that in a minute. But I had a bad case of cognitive dissonance because they actually turned out that I admired the people on the board of governors and they were mostly. It was in grand prairie. It's not a very big place and it's not very old. And so if you were reasonably successful in grand prairie, the probability that you would inherited your money from the aristocrat aristocracy was like zero. Cause there wasn't one, right, it's the whole damn town was 50 years old, so if you had any influencer or wealth, you are a small businessman, small to middle sized businessmen and you'd.

Speaker 5:          01:00:07       You knew what you were doing.

Speaker 3:          01:00:09       And I actually admired these people. I thought, well that's not very good. I mire them and I don't share their political views. And then there's these other people with whom I hypothetically share political views and I don't admire them at all. What's going on? And then I read road to wigan pier and I thought, oh, that's it. They don't like the poor. They just hate the rich. It's not the same thing. It's not the same set of motivations. And so let's say that you're a postmodernist and you privileged compassion for the oppressed. Think, well, what are you pushed to the margins? Well, what are you doing with all your hatred and your resentment and your evil? It's like you don't have any of that. That's a bad theory. That's a really bad theory.

Speaker 3:          01:01:00       Okay, so fine. So you can say, well yeah, you can say that, but I don't buy it. I still think that the people who stand to speak for the oppressed are in fact motivated by empathy and sympathy. Their hearts are in the right place. See, I don't really buy that either because I don't really think generally speaking, that it's a credible claim for someone to make that their heart is in the right place. Now you can ask that of yourself and if you think your heart is in the right place, well more power to you. You know, I, I, I can't see the halo from here. However, and so given that you're just as malevolent as your neighbor or maybe even more so and that that's actually pretty malevolent given the intrinsic nature of human beings. I cAn't help but wonder what you're doing with all those traits that you're not admitting to,

Speaker 5:          01:01:58       but you can.

Speaker 3:          01:02:00       You could even object. Well, you know, that's a pretty pessimistic view of humankind. It's not by the way, it's just not naive, but anyways, you could object that and you can say no. Actually, the weight of moral authority is in fact on the left, even the radical left with those who identify the oppressed and who are working to better their conditions. Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:02:27       fair enough. So then let's say, well, let's give those people some power and if they're actually motivated by compassion and empathy and desire for the working class, if you give them power and you give the ideas power, then as those ideas unfold in real time, you're going to find out like, did things get better for the working class, let's say? Or did they get worse? Because we could. We could consider that like an experiment. We could consider the outcome proof. I don't know what else you would do. I don't know how else you would. You would come to your decision because it's just theory until you see it happen. Now, nature said back in the 18, late 18 hundreds that

Speaker 3:          01:03:13       after he said that god was dead, and I suppose that would also Mean the theory that of suffering that I outlined at the beginning. That is that the basis of judeo christian civilization, that god was dead in, that people had killed him, and that we'd never find enough water to wash away the blood. It's a paraphrase, but I got the basic message right, and he also said there'll be two consequences of that nihilism because there's no transcendent meaning and a move to totalitarianism because people can't tolerate nihilism. He said the most likely pathway to totalitarianism would be communism. Essentially. He didn't quite use those words, but he meant that he, the words are close enough. He said socialism, but I'm going to use communism to distinguishing it, distinguish it from democratic socialism, and he said that probably tens of tens of millions of people would die in the 20th century as we played out that experiment and then he said, but it might be worth it if we learned something from it.

Speaker 3:          01:04:18       Rough man. I mean, and and unbelievable like I cannot figure out how in the world he knew that that was going to happen. Especially so far in advance, but dostoevsky knew the same thing. He wrote this book called the devil's are the possessed. You could read that, that's a great book. It takes about 150 pages to get going, but once it like everything, everything snaps together after that, you know, and then it moves and it's basically his prophecy about it's an examination of the kind of person who had arisen in the aftermath of the death of god in Russia who would lead the communist revolution. That's essentially it. It's brilliant. It's, it's, it's terrifying and it's a great intro to solzhenitsyn's gulag archipelago, which describes what did happen when those sort of people took over the revolution. So let's look at what happened after the revolution and we might say, well, this, how about we replicate the experiment a few times because you know how it is. If you're running this scientific experiment, you want to find out what something does. If you allow it to behave, you don't want to just run it once because while maybe there was something specific about those conditions that lead to the outcome. You want to generalize it across multiple circumstances. So we might say, well, let's take this set of ideas and let's,

Speaker 3:          01:05:39       let's run it on large scale over very long period of time in a variety of exceptionally diverse cultures and languages.

Speaker 3:          01:05:49       So let's do that. Okay, well we could first start with the, with the soviet people even now because it's like the 100 anniversary of the russian revolution are celebrating lennon. it's like, that's not good. that's like celebrating hitler. okay, I'm dead serious about that. It's not good. And the fact that people can dare to think that that's okay means that there's something wrong with the way that we look at history. Landon was a monster and if you want to know about that, you can read solzhenitsyn's writings about lending because they communist apologist say, well, it wasn't landing. Len was a good guy. He was all motivated by love of the working class. It's like, well, his henchmen was stolen and if you're hansman is stolen, you're not a good guy. And and lenin was around during the early collectivization and if you read what he wrote, you'll find out that he is perfectly willing to have any number of people die as long as his ideological system could be brought into big. So there's no celebrating lennon. There's no. We're cool young marxist hip revolutionaries and he's our idol. It's like there's none of that. Not if you know anything, not if you're decent,

Speaker 3:          01:07:10       whether it's death of the kulaks I told you about that there was a ukrainian famine that's 6 million. Go there. There was the rise of the gulag state because it turned out that Russia, the soviet union couldn't run on the principles that it had, that it had a laid down as sacrosanct. It just didn't work. So you had to enslave everybody and run your economy as a slave state essentially. And try not to kill the people into gulags so fast that you can't suck some productive labor out of them is the death of tens of millions of people. We don't even know. The estimates range from 15 to $60 million and like we won't get too picky even about the numbers because after the first 10 million you kinda made your point and the fact that we don't know between 15 and 60 is actually an indication of the horror

Speaker 4:          01:08:02       of it

Speaker 3:          01:08:04       because our count is off by tens of millions and that's only within the last century and then there was the 1956 crackdown on Hungary and the 19 eight invasion of czechoslovakia. Then there was the whole like thermo nuclear holocaust thing that was going on at the same time and the fact that in 1962 and in 1984, we were seconds away from complete annihilation, right. During the cuban missile crisis, the keys were in the intercontinental ballistic missile release systems and castro, as he admitted to jimmy carter case, any of you are castro fans, which you shouldn't be. That he was perfectly willing to have Cuba annihilated if it would've meant the defeat of the United States. And then in 1984 approximately, I may have the date exactly wrong. The russians received

Speaker 5:          01:08:59       an indication

Speaker 3:          01:08:59       from their early warning systems that the americans had launched five thermal and nuclear missiles and one russian decided that it was a mistake and refused to launch the retaliation and he just died about two weeks ago. So, you know, that was pretty close. And uh, so that was experiment number one. Let's say that that wasn't good, that experiment, let's put it that way. IT wasn't good. It was exactly the antithesis of good. It was precisely the antithesis of good, but that wasn't all. I mean, there's the people's republic of China has a different country, like seriously, a different country, right? Different tradition, different language.

Speaker 3:          01:09:47       How many people died in China under mao? No one knows. Same issue with the soviet union. Although myra was a bigger monster than stalin. And that's, that's impressive. You know, because there's hitler, there's stalin and mao and of the three mile was probably the worst. He's still revered in China. Maybe that accounts for their affinity for North Korea, which could still destroy us. All the remnants of that horrible state. Maybe 100 million people died in China during the great leap forward. That's a hell of a leap forward. Well, maybe it wasn't a 100 million, you know, maybe it was only $40 million, but as I said before, when you're counting in the tens of millions, your points already made. And then there was Cambodia and the killing fields and Bulgaria at east Germany and Romania and the democratic people's republic of Korea. That's North Korea and Vietnam and Ethiopia, Hungary, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. There was never a successful communist state. Cuba I suppose came closest, but it was radically,

Speaker 5:          01:10:57       um,

Speaker 3:          01:10:59       the soviets poured money into Cuba. So that doesn't really count. So then the first question was, well, are these marxists motivated by love or hatred? Well, is it love or hatred that produces $100, million dead people?

Speaker 5:          01:11:20       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:11:22       Is that enough evidence or not? And if it's not enough evidence, if you think to yourself, well that's not enough evidence, it was never really given its proper, a proper try. it's like, well, what would have been a proper try? See, I always think when I hear someone say that I know what you think, you think in your delusional arrogance, did you understand the marxist doctrines better than anyone else ever has, and that if you were the one implementing those doctrines, you would have ushered in the utopia. That's what you mean when you say that, and no, they're say, and there's an idea in the new testament that there's a sin. It's a sin against the holy ghost. If you commit that sand, no one really knows what it is that you can't be forgiven, and I would say, well, if you want a candidate for the sin against the holy ghost and the 21st century, the statement communism, real communism was never tried with the underlying idea that if you had been the person implementing it, it would have worked. I think that's a pretty good contender for something for which you should never be forgiven.

Speaker 5:          01:12:45       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:12:46       Alright, so that's marxism. So let's go on to postmodernism. We talked a little bit about it. Now, hypothetically, it's an attitude of skepticism, irony towards rejection of grand narratives, ideologies and universalism. CriT criticizes objective notions of reason, human nature, social progress, absolute truth in objective reality. It's predicated on the idea that the reason that you categorize especially the reason that you categorize is to marginalize you. Categorize, to marginalized, to obtain power. Power is pretty much all there is. There's other elements of postmodernism. One of them is that human nature is merely a social construct. See the reason for that as far as I'm concerned, and this is a postmodern critique as well, I'm going to move the center to the margin and the margin to the centers. Why would you think that human nature is only a social construct? Well, here's why. It's because that means you could construct it any way you want to.

Speaker 3:          01:13:56       That was a very common idea among this, among the communists. You know they. That's why michael wanted to wipe out chinese history. That's why the red guard went around in China and tried to destroy everything, every element of china's history prior to approximately 1960 at that great culture. Thousands and thousands of years old as well. So you could bring in the new man, but what does the new man. Well it was whatever slave mile happened to fantasize about, or it was the utopian person. You take your pick. But like I said, if you take a look at the corpses, you can pretty much figure out which of those two it was. So what's up with these people? These deconstructionists postmodernists. What are they up to exactly? Well, here's the first thing

Speaker 3:          01:14:48       they came about pretty much when marxism was no longer credible, no longer tenable as an intellectual set of intellectual propositions. Now, if you were a french intellectual, you had to have a lot of corpses piled at your feet before you were willing to think that you were wrong. So here's an example, I don't remember his name. He was the architect of the killing fields in Cambodia, wasn't pol pot. It was one of his advisors. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name. He took his phd at the bomb and he developed the thesis in the sorbonne what marxists thesis that the cities were parasites on, on the land. You know, it's an extension of the whole bourgeoisie proletarian thing. The cities were full of bourgeois types, educated and educated parasites essentially who were doing nothing but stealing what was rightly the farmers, so when he came back to Cambodia, he put that into action and emptied out the cities and put all the intellectuals and the city dwellers either to death or to work, which generally resulted in death and killed about one six to one quarter of the population, but he got his phd from the bomb and that's a good story because that's exactly how complicit the western leftist intellectuals were in facilitating the horrors of the 20th century and it's not like we've learned anything since then.

Speaker 3:          01:16:20       Quite the contrary, but just gone underground and that's what I see. That's what I see when I see postmodernism. So what happened was

Speaker 3:          01:16:34       despite the affinity of western intellectuals for marxism, maybe because they weren't paid as much as bankers, let's say if we're being cynical about it, because I've often thought that if you paid sociologists as much as investment bankers, they'd be capitalist very rapidly. Which is also to say that you may underpay intellectuals at your peril and you know that's actually dangerous because one of the things that's happening is that as the universities have become corporatized and corrupted in a variety of ways, more and more of the professors or adjuncts, right? I think it's up to 30, 40, 50 percent, something like that. Now they've got no tenure, they've got no job security and they're paid like $24,000 a year. It's not a good idea to radicalize the people that are teaching your children. But anyways,

Speaker 5:          01:17:26       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:17:29       by the end of the sixties, so much data on the catastrophic failures of communism had accrued that even the most intransigent of french intellectuals had to admit that the jig was up. but that's a problem because that's the whole ideology, right? That's the whole raison d'etre. He says in his terrible alberta french, you're going to just give that up. What are you goIng to do after that? Well, what happened was postmodernism was invented and so it's a slight of hand as far as I can tell. So and, and with postmodernism identity politics, and so the postmodern transformation is, well, we're a little wrong with the working class thing. Turns out that communists killed them all and capitalists make them all rich and that's actually exactly the opposite of what we predicted, but maybe there's still a way this could be salvaged. How about if we, we don't say working class capitalists, we say oppressor or oppressed. We'll just. Well just trends transformed the terminology a bit and we'll start thinking about all the other ways that people plural pressed and then and all the other ways that people are oppressors and then we can play the same damn game under a new guys

Speaker 3:          01:19:03       and now lord the postmodernists were marxists. So let's make no mistake about that. Darren himself said that postmodernism was a transformation of marxism. I'm not making this up. The question is why? Well, because you could say what? Postmodernism is a valid philosophical school and we'll get into that for a minute and they make some valid claims. One of them, for example, this is a central postmodernist claim, is that there's an infinite number of ways of interpreting the world and that actually turns out to be technically correct. Part of the reason that we've had a very difficult time building robots, ai robots that can operate in the real world, is because perceiving the real world turns out to be so difficult that we really can't figure out how human beings do it because it is susceptible to an infinite number of interpretations. So that's actually correct. Now I'm not going to give the postmodernists a tremendous amount of credit for discovering that because it was discovered simultaneously in about five disciplines at pretty much the same time, but you give the devil his due, so. So what's the logic? Something like, well, there's

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       an infinite number of interpretations of the world.

Speaker 3:          01:20:12       You can't tell which of those are canonically, correct? Correct. The basic narrative of human struggle as oppressor versus oppressed, we use category structures can constrain that infinite number of interpretations because the basic narrative is an oppressor versus oppressed. We choose those narratIves that serve our function as old pressers,

Speaker 4:          01:20:36       so it's

Speaker 3:          01:20:39       deeply cynical but credible, you know, and you can say if you're not naive that people are motivated by power and that our interpretations of the world can be self serving. I mean we do want to serve ourselves after all because otherwise we die and so and we are centered in one place and so we can't see everything and we're biased so, so there is the probability that the way that we look at the world will be tainted by narrow self interest and maybe even tainted by ingroup interests beyond narrow individual self interest. And we know thIs is true, but it's also not all bad. You know, like we, a good person takes care of his or her family. What does that mean? It means you prefer your family. The outsiders are going to get rid of that. It's a form of prejudice. Like it really is like your choice of sexual partners.

Speaker 3:          01:21:37       A form of prejudice, right? I mean maybe it should be distributed in an egalitarianism manner. Hey, that would be a lot funnier if it isn't a possibility like in, in, in, in, in huxley's brave new world. That was the rule you, you shared yourself with whoever asked because it was rude not to and you know what it is actually rude not to. It's seriously rude. Now, is that something you want to take away from people? You want that to be distributed in an egalitarianism fashion. How prejudiced are you when you choose someone to sleep with you choose that person and not everyone else. It's the ultimate in prejudice. If you say, well, that's not prejudicial. Oh yes, it is. Usually go for the most attractive partner you can find. Usually go for the healthiest partner you go for the best person you can find who could tolerate you prejudicial in every possible way so well, so okay, so your self serving and you construct a view of the world that serves those selfserving causes and some of that has to do with power. Fair enough. That doesn't mean it all has to do with power

Speaker 4:          01:22:56       though.

Speaker 3:          01:22:57       It means that some of it has to do with power. It's like racism, people are kind of racist or maybe people prefer their ingroup. It's not that easy or maybe people prefer the familiar to the novel. You know that I eat that the social psychologists have come up with implicit association test that measures unconscious bias. We don't know what the hell that measures the people who invented that bloody thing. They know we don't know what it measures. They know it's not reliable. They know it's not valid enough to be used as an individual diagnostic instrument. That's technically the case. They also know that you can't train people out of their unconscious biases because there is not much difference between the unconscious bias and instantaneous perception, but they don't really care. I've I've written to mazda and banerji. He's one of the inventors of the iet several times saying, how about you come out in public and say what you already know? Which is that people are misusing your damn test. Silence. Well, that's partly because her discipline, social psychology is a corrupt discipline as the social psychologists have discovered over the last four years and be turning themselves inside out trying to rectify which they haven't

Speaker 4:          01:24:12       anyways,

Speaker 3:          01:24:13       we're giving the devil his due. There's an infinite number of interpretations of the world and it's highly probable that you'll lay a self serving one on top of it. Yes, and also that will serve the interests of your group. However you define that, yes, but it only accounts for a fraction of your behavior. There's all sorts of other things that work as well and you don't get to reduce all human motivations to one motivation power, and then you might also ask, well, why would you want to reduce all human motivations to power? It's so you can use power. That's why you can justify the use of power that's force. You don't have to engage in civilized debate. You don't have to give a damn about the facts, especially if you're not a postmodernist because you don't believe in facts anyways, and you might ask, well, why don't you? Hey, I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. Postmodernists don't believe in facts. They believe that the idea of fact is part of the power game that's place played by the white dominated male patriarchy to impose the theoretical structure of the patriarchy on the oppressors. It's like I'm not making this stuff up. It's embedded, right? In theory, all you have to do is read it and you find this out so they don't believe in facts. While facts would constrain the use of power, at least that's how it looks to me.

Speaker 3:          01:25:32       Okay, so fine. We gave the devil his due. There's an infinite number of interpretations and you're likely to use bias compression algorithms on the world and they're likely to be biased in your favor. True,

Speaker 4:          01:25:47       but

Speaker 3:          01:25:50       only partly true.

Speaker 3:          01:25:53       And the difference between an idea log and the thinker is that a thinker knows the difference between things that are only partly true and things that are completely true. Things are complicated. Like I like to think everything is as complicated as a military helicopter. You have to like, I think it's eight hours of maintenance to keep those things in the air for one hour because they don't fly there rocks. They plummet. It's really hard to keep them in the air and they're full of parts and if you don't know all those parts, you don't go in there and monkey about with them because just wreck it. And that's just a helicopter. Like everything is way more complicated than the helicopter, so you don't just go muck about in there hoping you're going to make it better. That isn't how it works. You need to be

Speaker 4:          01:26:37       competent. Alright, so look,

Speaker 3:          01:26:40       here's where the postmodernists sarong I think there's three places and they're serious errors. The first is that there is an infinite number of interpretations, but there is not an infinite number of viable interpretation. So there's a very finite number of viable interpretations and I don't think that this is theory. I think that game theorists have already demonstrated this to some degree and it's going to be built into ai systems very rapidly. Okay, so what are the constraints? Okay. First of all, you can't have an interpretation that leads to immediately to your death or your dad. Now, if you want to be dead, that's fine, but if you don't want to be, then you got a lot of limited options, right? You don't get to run naked across an eight lane freeway at night blindfolded because probably you'll be dead. That's a bad interpretation. Okay, so you might say because you're fragile and vulnerable and mortal, that there's a limited number of ways that you can look at the world that don't result in, let's say death or serious damage or agony. That's a bad thing. Agony is a bad thing. Most people agreed on that. So you're constrained by pain and anxiety. At least your interpretations are constrained by pain and anxiety and you know you can make pain worse or better by thinking about it to some degree, but only to some degree. When push comes to shove, pain is your master.

Speaker 3:          01:28:03       Okay? So that's a big constraint. That's a big, big constraint. Well, but the constraints are worse than that because not only do you not

Speaker 3:          01:28:13       get to have an interpretation of the world that produces anxiety and suffering right now, but you don't get to have an interpretation of the world that if you iterated across time produces pain and suffering. And so that's, that's a big problem because there's lots of. You could go out tonight and get yourself blind drunk on cocaine and sleep with hookers and you know, maybe that, maybe that'd be a good night. You know, you might not think about it being so good tomorrow, but then maybe your dad of aids in a year or maybe you're addicted to cocaine or maybe you're a street alcoholic or whatever. It's like as an iterable game, that's a downhill. And the thing is you play iterated games. You don't play one, you play iterated games. And so your interpretation of the world has to be one that will sustain multiple iterations across time because you have to worry about 40 year old you and 60 year old you.

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       And that's a big problem. That's a lot of use stretched over a long period of time. And it's worse than that because it's not just you, it's like you and your family, right? And not only so, not only do you have to take care of yourself now in a manner that allows you to take care of yourself when you're 40, you have to take care of yourself now in a manner that takes care of you when you're 40 so that other people are happy to have you around now and continually so that they'll cooperate and compete with you in a positive way. And so that's getting ridiculously complicated. It's not just you now when you in the future, it's you surrounded by other people doing the same thing now and in the future and there's a lot of other people. It can even just be you and your family, you know, like, like the psychopathic burglar mob that's just not going to go so well, right?

Speaker 3:          01:29:53       Other people are going to object and the world's going to object and so fine. There's an infinite number of interpretations, but it doesn't mean there's an infinite number of viable interpretations. In fact, there are hardly any. There are hardly any playable games. Now piaget, piaget, the developmental psychologist who's a very smart guy, he pointed out something very interesting. He said, now imagine you ran a set of iterated games as a competition and in one iterated game the rule was you bloody well do what I tell you to, and the other one is, well, we'll all get together and decide how we're going to do this. Okay, now we run the competition. Uh, piaget's claim is you do what I tell you fails. And the reason for that is I have to impose force in order to keep you cooperating. And the imposition of forest is a cost.

Speaker 3:          01:30:41       It's an efficiency cost. And across time that efficiency cost is going to multiply. And the equilibrated state solution, which is the one where we all agree it winds. Now that's worth thinking about. You can think about that locally. So you've got, you're trying to organize your family, you have a little family conference about who's doing what in the household and what do you. If you want peace and harmony and an iterated game, you get everybody to say, well, here's the tasks and we they have to be done. People have to agree on that, and then you say, well, which task would you do? You have to some how about you and you know which task would you do and everybody agrees and then you say, well, unless you can come up with a better solution, that's the one we're going to go with, and then people can be a little resentful and angry about the conditions of existence where they have to work, but they can't really blame that on anyone else and maybe that's the best solution you could come up with.

Speaker 3:          01:31:32       And that was pIaget's idea of the equilibrium state. It was like it's a voluntary agreement that can be iterated across time. That works at multiple levels of social organization. Man, that's a serious, serious, serious set of constraints. And piaget, by the way, was looking for a way to reconcile science and religion. He was looking for biological origin to morality and he thought he found it in the idea of the state and it's even deeper than that. So imagine this equilibrium state ideas. Actually there's something to it that if you set the the state up property, it will iterate across time so long that it becomes a permanent part of the environment. Hierarchy is exactly. That's exactly what the hierarchy is. Hierarchies are 350 million years old. They're not the patriarchal invention of white european christian males in the last 300 years. There are 350 million years old.

Speaker 3:          01:32:29       They're stable, they're stable solutions to this iterated game problem and they've been around so long that we're actually adapted to the and that's part of the reason we have archetypal representations of the social structure. So and then we also have archetypal representations of the relationship of the individual to the social structure. Your job as an individual in relationship to the social structure is to embody the social structure, but also to serve as as its eyes and its mouth so that can update itself when necessarily so you take on the mantle of your father, let's say, but he's dead. He's the path he can't see. You can see, so you take the structure that's already there and you modify it where it's necessary and that modification process is necessary or the state becomes too static and collapses and that's why the state has to be subordinate to the individual and that's what western culture has discovered and we can't just let it go. That's the idea. The logos, that's a big idea and you'd want to live somewhere where you want to live somewhere where the individual is subordinate to the state. It's like, hey, go right ahead. There's lots of places like that, man, emigrate go there. Ninety percent of the world's countries are like that. If you want to live like that, man, go find out what it's like. You don't see immigration going there. That's for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:33:54       Okay, so that's a big mistake that the postmodernist made. It's not trivial. That's a big mistake, but it's not the only one. Well, here's another one. They don't like inequality. Well, who does?

Speaker 3:          01:34:08       I'm against poverty. You know, that's like classic protest sign. It's like, really? It's like I'm against torture. It's like it's so obvious. You don't get any brownie points for being against poverty. No one in their right mind is for poverty. You, you ever watch the simpsons? You ever see the republican party in the simpsons, they all meet in an old haunted castle at night with like lightening bolts going off and there's a vampire and a crazy texts and then even the simpson republicans don't sit around in the haunted tower at midnight saying, hey, we need more poverty. Here's an interesting thing. So one of the postmodernist claims is that diversity is necessary and they make it racial and they make it sexual. They may get ethnIc and all of that. That's actually technically incorrect by the way, because

Speaker 3:          01:35:10       I study individual differences. So those are the differences between people. I know the literature. So you know about James Morris memo right from google. He wrote that partly because he was watching my videos, which is why he wanted me to interview him and I'm a believer that there are biological differences in temperament between men and women apart from the other obvious differences and that they're actually not trivial and that they maximizing the societies that have the most have moved farthest to producing egalitarian states, the scandinavian countries, and that. The reason for that is that there's two reasons why men and women, different temperament. One is biological and the other is environmental and if you remove the environmental variation, which you do, if you make the state egalitarian, you maximize the genetic variation and that's been demonstrated in the scientific literature over about four decades and no one wanted it or hope for it and they weren't biased and looking for it because that was exactly the opposite of what social scientists wanted to find. BecAuse social scientists lean heavily to the left and what they wanted to find was you flatten out the state so that everyone has equal opportunity and the differences between people disappear. That is not what happened. The opposite happened that wasn't wrong and no one was happy about it and no one's happy about it. Now you can actually tell when you've discovered something in a social science because you're not happy about it, but

Speaker 3:          01:36:42       if you take, let's say there's a big difference between men and women in terms of trait, agreeableness, compassion and politeness. On average, women are more agreeable than men and the difference is approximately this. If you take random pairs of men and women out of the population, let's say you had to make a bet on who was more agreeable. if you bet that it was the woman, you'd be right 60 percent of the time, well that's not that much means you'd be wrong. Forty percent of the time. That's almost 50 percent of the time. So this is a big difference by social science standards, but that's the magnitude of the difference. There are some differences that are bigger, like the difference between men and women's interest in people versus things is actually bigger than that. that's the biggest difference we know, but it's a big difference. Let's say the agreeableness difference, but still they the shared attributes of men and women far outweigh the attributes that differentiate them because you could ask are there more differences with any groups or between them? Now the postmodern answer to that is between them. That's why you need diversity by group, right? That's why you need different races. That's why you need different ethnicities and sexual preferences and all of that. Well, that's wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:37:58       There's more differences within the groups than there is between them. You don't get diversity by crossing the groups. You get diversity by group, by selecting across individuals. In fact, the idea that there is more differences between groups and there is between individuals is actually the fundamental racist idea. It's the fundamental racist idea which is, well, let's say you're asian oriental to use the old word to discriminate the one type of asian say from the other. You're so different from me that there's no overlap between our groups and you're also so different and there's so little difference within your group that now that I know that you're not me, you're not one of mine. I actually know what you're like, no, technically that's incorrect. That's wrong. That isn't how you get diversity. Now, diversity is actually necessary because people differ in intelligence and a different temperament and the different skills and so you actually need diversity because otherwise you can't take advantage of all those differences,

Speaker 3:          01:39:04       so you need diversity, but you need genuine diversity and like what would genuine diversity mean? If you're trying to put together a work team, you want enough, you want people have sufficient diversity so that they more or less so that you gathered together the appropriate talent to produce the implement that's necessary to work properly in the world. That's a competence marker because otherwise your business is going to fail and so the proper diversity with regards to employment is the diversity that meets the requirements of the business essentially. obviously that's why you try to hire people carefully and not randomly. Let's say

Speaker 3:          01:39:49       third error, first errors. There's only a finite number of valid interpretation. Second error is that there are real differences between groups of people, but there's more difference within the groups. Then between them. Third difference is social status and payment. Especially in a free democratic capitalist society is based more on competence than on power. In fact, we would say that when a person in a hierarchy starts to act like their position entitles them to power, then that hierarchy has become corrupt. Harvey weinstein is a good example of that. I'm serious. It's like he acts, acted like a tyrant. What happened to him? It's not good. Not good for him. What he did was not good, but it's an indication. It's revealed. It's an indication that that misuse, so he's competent, fine. He gets to have position because we need people who are competent, but that doesn't mean you get to turn into a tyrant.

Speaker 3:          01:40:56       If you turn it into a tyrant, then that overshadows your competence and you go as the definition of a functioning state and our state essentially functions. It's not perfect. That's for sure, but compared to what? That's the issue compared to your hypothetical marxist utopia. Well, compared to your hypothetical marxist utopia, I mean we're living in auschwitz, but you're what? Your actual marxist utopia is indistinguishable from auschwitz, so we're not listening to that comparison. We're going to take a look at what we have and we're going to compare it to other places that actually existed in time and geographically and by those criteria. It's like, is there another time you'd rather live?

Speaker 3:          01:41:44       there's another place you'd rather live. I mean the real place and real time. I mean you want to live back in 18, 95. Even in the western world where the average person lived on less than a dollar a day. In today's money, you want to live like those coal miners like the answer to. That's no. If you have any sense, you should have some gratitude. That's another problem with the postmodern neo marxists like zero, zero, zero gratitude. It's all, oh my god, I'm more pressed. Of course you're oppressed, but you're not oppressed by the patriarchy for god's sake,

Speaker 3:          01:42:23       so you have status in the hierarchy. You might say, well, that's like a reward to your. You're a high status person. It's a reward. The reward should be shared equally. It's like a badge of merit that you get. It's a privilege. It's not the reason that in a capitalist society, filthy selfish capitalists put you in a position so they can extract maximum productivity from you, and that's exactly why you're there. You get paid, you get paid, so you keep working. Why do we want you to work? BecAuse your work is actually valuable to us and so we're going to pay you so you don't quit. It's not a reward because you're a good guy. it's not a privilege. That's not what It is. You don't hand those things out like merit badges. That's not how it works. The society is setup on selfish principles. We pay people who are competent so they won't stop striving because we want what they can produce.

Speaker 3:          01:43:15       So you don't just distribute that like like it's a gift. It's not a gift. It's not a gift at all. So that's another place where they're wrong. Social status and payment is the consequence of the selfish desire of individuals and the group to extract resources of intellect, creativity, and industriousness from those who possess them in excess. Now, of course, it's not 100 percent like that. There's the incompetent people who rise to the top, you can fool people and you can manipulate them and you can act like a tyrant and you know, we might say maybe the system is like 30 percent warped, something like that. It's not much more than that because we can account for people's success across life by looking at their individual differences, intelligence, con, conscientiousness, emotional stability, creativity. We can do a pretty good job of predicting their trajectory. So there's error, some of its health, right, because sometimes you've got what you need but you get cut off at the knees or your family members do or you know, some tragic thing befalls you. There's a randomness in the system that accounts for a fair bit of it and then there's a certain amount of corruption. Fair enough.

Speaker 3:          01:44:25       But not so much that the lights go off.

Speaker 5:          01:44:29       Okay. What time is it?

Speaker 3:          01:44:36       Eight. 15. And I started when. Sorry, it's been 6:30. I should stop them.

Speaker 5:          01:44:51       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          01:45:00       I'm going to go for five more minutes and then I'll wrap this up. I want to talk about intersectionality and, and white privilege a bit. So. So I first said, well, we analyzed marxism, we analyzed postmodernism. I suggested that postmodernism was a way for the marxist to keep going under a new guys. I suggested that marxism was fundamentally based on hatred rather than sympathy and an empathy. I suggested that the corpses were the the evidence for that. I told you why I think postmodernism is fundamentally wrong.

Speaker 5:          01:45:43       Oh,

Speaker 3:          01:45:45       now I want to talk to you a little bit about white privilege.

Speaker 5:          01:45:50       So

Speaker 3:          01:45:52       the first thing that I, and I haven't got this quite figured out yet, I can't quite figure out why the postmodernists made the canonical distinctions. They've made race, ethnicity, sexual proclivity, sexual, gender identity. Let's say those are four dimensions along which people vary, but there's a very large number of dimensions along which people vary, right? In fact, given that there's an infinite number of ways of interpreting the world, you could immediately pointed out if there's an infinite number of dimensions along which people vary. And so then the postmodern question is why would you privilege some of those dimensions over the other? And I would say, well, because it sustains your bloody marxist interpretation. That's why. But you're not going to say that because it marginalizes, right? You've marginalized that so you can ignore it. So that's one of the fun things about organism. You can. You can. I have a very vulgar image in my mind, but I won't share that with you, but you can infer it. Here's some ways people differ. Intelligence, temperament, geography, historical time. You live now in 100 years ago. Attractiveness. That's a big. That's a big one. That's a big one. Would you imagine? You could.

Speaker 5:          01:47:09       You won't.

Speaker 3:          01:47:10       We won't go there either. Youth eat it's advantageous to be young. You've got potential. It's advantageous to be old. You've got wealth. Health, that's a good one. Sex women have advantages. Men have advantages. Maybe one has more than the other. It's not self evident. Women live about eight years longer there. Multiorgasmic, athleticism, well, family structure, friendship, education.

Speaker 3:          01:47:38       Well then there's the classic, you know, postmodern once, race, ethnicity, et cetera. Why not those other dimensions of variation. There's no evidence that they're less important. In fact, there's quite a bit of evidence that they're are more important. so like why not consider them? Then you get intersectionality. This is one of the things that's really comical, I think because the postmodernists identity politics types actually realized this. They thought, well, okay, race and gender. Fair enough. What if you're. What if you're a black woman? Well, that's a problem because, well now you've got two dimensions of differentiation. What the hell are we going to do about that and what if you're, what if you're gay and black and female? Well then what if you're not very bright and gay and black and female, and then what if you're ugly and not very bright and gay and black and female and like you can keep playing that game.

Speaker 3:          01:48:30       You can keep playing that game and the infinite number of ways because there's an infinite number of ways to categorize things. As The postmodernist sorority pointed out, and so the intersectionality theorists came along to plug the hole, but they don't know where they're going. They don't understand that the logical conclusion of intersectionality is individuality because there's so many different ways of categorizing people's advantages and disadvantages. If you take that all the way out to the end, you say, well, the individuals, the ultimate minority, and that's exactly right, and that's exactly what the west discovered and you know the intersection list, so get there if they don't kill everyone first, so onto white privilege.

Speaker 3:          01:49:14       So it's really interesting to find out where these ideas come from because it's usually the scholarship is so awful, you just cannot possibly believe it. It's just absolutely. It wouldn't end at the university of toronto in the psychology department, the original paper on white privilege wouldn't have received a passing grade for the hypothesis part of a undergraduate honors thesis. We're noT even close. There's no methodology at all. The person who wrote it, it was called white privilege and male privilege, a personal account of coming to see correspondences through work in women's studies. Well, first of all, personal account. It's like, sorry. No.

Speaker 3:          01:50:00       So she, she listed a bunch of ways that she thought she says these are personal personal examples of her unearned privilege or unearned privilege that she saw as she experienced in the 19 seventies, 19 eighties. So this part of the way, so this idea is the opinion of one person who wrote one paper that has absolutely no empirical backing whatsoever, which is a set of hypotheses which had never been subject to any statistical analysis. Like if I asked you a bunch of questions, it's not obvious how many questions I'm asking you because I could say, how tall are you? Or I could say, if you're laying on the ground, how extended would you be? It's like that two questions. It's like, no, it's one question. It's just asked two ways and the way you figure out if you ask someone a bunch of questions, how many questions you're asking them is by doing something called a factor analysis, which is kind of an elementary form now of social science investigation.

Speaker 3:          01:50:52       If you make a questionnaire, you have to subject it to a factor analysis beCause you've got to find out how many questions you're asking because you might think it's 60, but it's probably not. It's probably five. That's the big five, by the way anyways. Who cares about that? There's no such thing as methodology. Anyways, that's all part of the oppressive white male european patriarchy, so we can just not bother with that and we can pin a few notes about how we think the world is constructed and then we can screw up the entire political system two decades later. Okay, so here's your white privilege list. Some of it, there's like 50 things I can if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race, most of the time, if I should need to move, I can be pretty sure of renting or purchasing housing in an area which I can afford and in which I would want to live.

Speaker 3:          01:51:39       That's actually a wealth thing by the way. I can be pretty sure that my neighbors and such a location will be neutral or pleasant to me. I can go shopping alone most of the time, pretty well assured that I will not be followed or harassed. I can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my waist race widely represented. When I'm talking about our national heritage or about civilization, I am shown that people of my color made it what it is. There's 50 of those, I think, something like that. Okay. Is that white privilege? Is that majority privilege?

Speaker 3:          01:52:14       It's the same tree. You go to China, you're chinese. Is the same? True. If you're chinese, does the majority privilege benefits? Majority privileges. Like isn't that just part of living within your culture? So let's say you live in your culture, you're privileged as a member of that culture, while obviously that's what the culture is for. That's what it's for. Why would you bother building the damn thing if it didn't accrue benefits to you? Now you might say, well, one of the consequences that it accrues fewer benefits to those who aren't in the culture. Yeah, but you can immediately associate that with race. You can't just do that. Say it's white privileGed does many things. It could be certainly could be well and the intersection of people have already figured out that there's many things that could be so like what the hell? Seriously. Well, what's going on while we let these pseudo disciplines into the university because we're stupid and guilty seriously and they have no methodological requirements and plenty of power and plenty of time to produce nonsensical research and produce like resentful activists and now we're bearing the fruits of that.

Speaker 3:          01:53:21       It's not pretty so white privilege. Well, the other thing you might notice is that to attribute to the individuals of a community, the attributes of that community on the basis of their racial identity is called racism. That's what racism is. There's no other way of defining it. It's attributing to the individual the characteristics of the group as if the group was homogenous. Now the intersection people have already decided that's not a fair game because there's so many differences between people, but the postmodernist don't care about logical coherence because they regard logical coherence. Here it comes again as a creation of the white, european male patriarchal structure that's designed to oppress the oppressed, and that's technically the case. So logical, incoherence, it doesn't matter, and you could say, well, if you act out your logically incoherent ideas in the world, you're going to run face first into a brick wall, and the postmodern answer to that is there's actually no real world. it's all interpretation. So there's no, there's no having that discussion, but the postmodernists don't care because they don't believe that discussion between people of different power groups as possible. Anyways. So here we are. Well, so I made a case tonight, you know, I'll go over it. What's the case?

Speaker 3:          01:54:43       The postmodernists are wrong. They're philosophically naive, they're right about an infinite number of interpretations and wrong about a finite number of viable interpretations and that's like that's, that's death. That's the end of postmodernist theory and that's not the only way in which they're wrong. They're wrong in a bunch of other ways, but they're more subsidiary. The marxists.

Speaker 3:          01:55:08       They're not just wrong, they're wrong and murderous or wrong, murderous and genocidal. Unless you think murderous and genocidal doesn't mean wrong and you, you can think that there's lots of would be revolutionaries who would be happy to have blood running in the street if they had their chance for revenge and the opportunity to move up the hierarchy of charity so you can. You don't have to think that murder and genocide is wrong, especially if the right people are murdered in genocide. Right? That's actually part of the part of the whole equation, but if you're willing to think that murder and genocide on a mass scale across many cultures over decades is wrong, then marxism is wrong and the postmodernist don't get to just come along and a dark marxism as a matter of sleight of hand because there are marches. Theory didn't work out and they figured out a rationalization. They don't get to get away with that because it's too dangerous. It's too dangerous to the rest of us and we don't, and it isn't necessary for us who are trying with the small part of our hearts that might be oriented towards the good to allow people who are manipulating us with historical ignorance and philosophical sleight of hand to render so god damn guilty about what our ancestors may or may not have done so that we allow our shame and our guilt to be, to be used as tools to manipulate us into accepting a future that we do not want to have.

Speaker 3:          01:56:38       Then. That's.

Speaker 2:          01:56:40       Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:57:07       Okay, so we're just gonna do the uh, we're gonna. Move on onto the q and a now. but before we do the venue wants to do a little announcement.

Speaker 6:          01:57:20       Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry. My name's cameron mcneil. I'm the managing director here at the chan center. As you are all leaving tonight, please be where something has come to light tonight. Outside the building, there is an individual impersonating a ubc security guard. It is not in the building. It was in the rose garden. There was no damage done. Nobody was hurt, but there is an impersonator out there, so just please be aware of that. Thank you very much.

Speaker 1:          01:57:48       So for those of you in the first two rows, you can either line up here or at the mic over there and, uh, ask your questions and also try to keep it short because we don't have that much time.

Speaker 1:          01:58:21       Hello, Jordan B. Peterson. I'm a huge fan. I'm in your lectures. Use the term postmodernism interchangeably with cultural marxism, nihilism and moral relativism. I wonder if you've considered or heard alternative beliefs that the term postmodernism is not necessary, is necessarily always congruent on a one to one scale of these other terms. And some limited circumstances is positive. Specifically the idea that when you use the term postmodernism to vilify as by some others referred to as pseudo modernism, whereas as some would call what you endorsed to not be modernism, but in fact metta modernism, post millennialism or post postmodernism, which unfortunately has a terrible name. And then I have a brief, uh, definitions of those words if you need me to.

Speaker 7:          01:59:08       No, as I said tonight, you have to give the devil his due and so we'll do that. So yes, there is a very large number of ways of interpreting the world. There's no doubt about that. Yes. People use biased interpretive lenses to as means of interpreting the world to put their own priorities forward without necessarily knowing that they're doing so and that, that can corrupt them and society. The psychoanalysts figured that out way before the postmodernist so they don't get any credit for that, like really not.

Speaker 4:          01:59:49       Um,

Speaker 7:          01:59:51       so it's useful to keep those things in mind. It's when they're put, but when they're put forward is absolute truth that disturbs me. It's like, yes, people are probably racist. They miGht even be implicitly racist, although we don't know what that means and we don't know how it's related to their explicit behavior and we can't separate from ingroup preference or necessarily from reaction to novelty. So it's a tricky business, you know, and we don't know how to separate stereotypical racial perceptions from perceptual heuristics. We don't know how to do that because you're always oversimplifying the world because you're not smart enough to live in the world as it is. You have to oversimplify it. So yes, there are times with postmodernism is useful. Are used it quite usefully tonight to deconstruct postmodernism. In fact, so but but way it's when it's turned into an absolute, especially a moral absolute that it and winded allies itself with marxism, it's like, sorry guys. No, you don't like grand narratives. You don't get to go there. while that's where you. that isn't where you went, that's where you came from. You've never, you've never left there. So that's, that's basically what I have to say about that. Thanks.

Speaker 8:          02:01:07       Hello, Dr. Peterson. Thank you very much. Now my question is regarding adhd, which is something I haven't heard you speak a whole lot about, maybe a little bit now. It seems to me that we are at least maybe just me, do not quite understand adhd to what could be at full capacity maybe, and because there's many, many voices sayinG that it's an overdiagnosed overblown, small mental variants that's prevalent in boys or it's just young boys being young boys and then there are some that would fight and advocate for a very different treatment in the academic world and I was wondering what you, what your thoughts are on adhd itself and on the, whether you think it's overdiagnosed and maybe advice for me as someone who has been diagnosed with adhd on how to overcome it without maybe becoming completely reliant on prescribed medication.

Speaker 7:          02:02:08       Okay, so first of all, it's definitely overdiagnosed. Second, it's very unreliable. Psychiatric diagnosis. Many psychiatric diagnosis are unreliable and that's because psychiatric diagnosis aren't precisely scientific categories. They're weird hybrids, right? First of all, psychiatrists aren't scientists. They're engineers. Engineers are trying to do something rather than to describe the objective world and psychiatrists are trying to make people healthy. Whatever that means. It's actually partly ethical. It's very complicated. We don't know how to distinguish it from temperamental variation, so for example, if you're high in openness and high in extroversion and low in conscientiousness, low in agreeableness, conscientiousness, and and high in neuroticism, you're likely to manifest symptoms of adhd. It's because your exploratory, you don't like to sit down. You're full of ideas. Your attention scatters across a wide variety of topics and you're not very stable. Temperamental variation is also much more common among boys.

Speaker 7:          02:03:21       Panksepp showed same guy with rats that if you deprive young routes of rough and tumble play, which is what the young boys are deprived of in school, let's say that they get hyperactive and then their prefrontal cortex is don't develop very well because they're not having the right kind of experienCes and that you can treat that quite effectively with psychomotor stimulants like ritalin. so that's kind of an interesting bit of scientific information that no one pays any attention to. There is also absolutely no evidence whatsoever. That longterm use of psychomotor stimulants produces increases in cognitive gain, zero, and there's plenty of evidence that it's harmful. So then the second part of that was what about.

Speaker 5:          02:04:12       Yeah,

Speaker 7:          02:04:13       adjustments for in the academic world, say that disability adjustments. It's like that's such a rat's nest that I don't want to even discuss it. I mean it it, I'll discuss it for like 15 seconds. There is a never endinG multiplication of disability. That's what's happening right now. The disability offices in the universities are like, I know some people have it rough, like believe me, I know that I, I, I seriously know that I've dealt with extraordinarily damaged people in my life.

Speaker 7:          02:04:50       It, you, you're, you're bloody hard pressed to find someone who doesn't have a serious problem or who doesn't have a serious problem in a close family member. It's like, where do you draw the line with regards to disability where you can't, you can't. They multiply just like lgbt identities. Multiply. Just knows. She really technically just like that. Just like intersectionality cateGories of oppression multiply. It's, it's, it's inevitable the way that you deal with it. As you have objective standards, you apply them to everyone. Not because that's fair. It's not fair. If you, if your criteria for fairness is that everyone has the same outcome, it's not fair at all. it's not even close to fair. It's just less piratical radical than the alternatives. Now we don't know that yet because we haven't seen the full range of the tyranny of the alternatives manifest itself. Not in our culture, but it certainly did in other cultures. I think it's a bad idea now. I don't want to be absolute about that. Like it's tricky, you know, because if you have a disability

Speaker 5:          02:06:04       that

Speaker 7:          02:06:04       would allow you to do the work in the university and in the workplace with a modification, then perhaps the modification could be made, but I think that was done a lot better when I was in the hands of the professors and not in the hands of these crazy bureaucratic structures that have risen up around the disability issue. Like they're one of the 10 things that are going to kill the universities or maybe have already killed them possibly because they may their walking corpses. As far as I can tell zombies so and that might be wrong, but it's what it looks like to me versus I want to say thank you so much. Those an amazing talk and I was wondering if you could elaborate. What I noticed a lot, I go here to ubc is that a lot of students and young people, they're often desensitized to, for example, the atrocities that communism or ideologies that forced terrorism and maybe it's some sort of stockholm syndrome that I'm seeing where it's like people are just there, they're trapped and they can't.

Speaker 7:          02:07:03       They feel in a way they can't do anything about it and then they start to like, like, like communism or they start to see more socialists or adopt socialist policy that in the end we'll get them killed. We'll get them hurt. As long as you kind of elaborate on what you think can be done about that or even if something can be done in that respect. Well, I think something can be done. I mean I've been trying to educate people about the horrors of the nazi regime and the soviet in particular. I've concentrated mostly on those two because that's good enough and trying to let people know that it was through the fault of people, much like them, that those systems are rows and, and that there are steps you can take to limit the probability that you would participate in such a thing and that those steps are associated with trying to be truthful in your speech and actions because the stability of those systems depends on the willingness of individuals to lie and, and also on your willingness to take responsibility for the malevolence in your own heart that manifests itself in those social movements.

Speaker 7:          02:08:19       And so that when I don't, when I do my lectures, when I do talks like this, when I put them on youtube, what I'm trying to do is exactly that because that was the best pathway forward through such things that I could think up over 20 years of thinking about it. Um, you know, one is so habituated to suffering that they can read the gulag archipelago, which is actually quite hard to read without having an effect them like your psychopathic. If that book doesn't affect you, it should. If you read it properly, it affects you deeply and it's not the only example of that kind of literature. So the people who are habituated aren't. They've just been shown low resolution representations of things they don't understand that looked vaguely bad. You don't know a damn thing about them, and our education system has done a tremendously appalling job of educating young people about the absolute catastrophe of radical left isn't now.

Speaker 7:          02:09:28       It's not much better with regards to say the actions of the nazis, although I would say on average people are more aware of that, but they don't. But it's shallow, shallow knowledge. So you make the knowledge deep and deep knowledge changes people and wakes them up. You know? I mean, the only reason that I ever got convinced that they're that good and evil, we're real more real than anything else. It wasn't because I learned that good was real. That's hard. That's hard. It's hard to learn that. You have to find examples of transcendent good. You know, they're rare, evil. All you have to do is look, read history a bit and read it like it's about you and there's no way that you can do that without a transformation, but people won't do it. It's like you want. Imagine yourself as an auschwitz guard. That's a rough thing you see because you have to figure out.

Speaker 7:          02:10:25       See young said, if you confronted the shadow, which is the dark side of people, the aggressive side, that malevolent side, that it. It really reaches all the down to hell and dante sort of was trying to put forward the same thing when he wrote the inferno, right? With the levels of evil, right? Because it was a voyage through the levels of evil, right to the bottom. He thought the bottom was betrayal. it's pretty good. The, the most, the, the center of malevolence is be trail. I liked that because to be trained someone, you have to get them to trust you, and trust is a moral virtue, right? especially if it's courageous trust, because it it, it puts you in alignment with other people and allows you to move forward into life and if you'd be trained that you really, it's like a knife in the. It's like knife in the heart through the back, especially if it's someone who loves, loves you, betrays you, and especially if they be you for your virtues. That's a really nice twist.

Speaker 5:          02:11:16       So

Speaker 7:          02:11:18       I believe because I think that people are capable of good, that if they know enough about evil that that will straighten them out. So, but who wants that? No, this is one of the things I really like about young. He's often regarded as a new age thinker. That's wrong. He's no new age thinker. He knew that the, the pathway to enlightenment was barred by the necessity of a passage through hell and that no one was going to do that. That's why there isn't a world full of enlightened people, you might say. I think it was just a matter of doing nice things following your bliss, let's say however you might put it. Then why wouldn't everyone walk up the stairway to heaven? That isn't how it works. That's not how it works at all. I don't think you can be convinced of the necessity for moral action until you understand exactly how dark and terrible things can get and that it's your fault that they're getting that way. Who wants to think that? So you can think it though, but not, not without it burning you.

Speaker 5:          02:12:29       So thanks so much,

Speaker 1:          02:12:33       lou. Dr. Peterson a thank you for coming. We appreciate it a lot. Uh, I wanted to get your opinion on censorship that we're seeing on the web. Uh, it's accelerating. You were a very notable example. You were locked out of your g male indian trump account. Pardon me? Yeah. Trump's got a deleted by an in person, you know, now they're saying that perhaps this was just a contractor and you know, maybe someone from twitter who's gone in a very far left direction. A youtube has gone very far left direction. I'm just wondering, I've started an alternative to youtube called youtube. Uh, what kind of, um, what do you see for possible solutions and just your thoughts in generAl. Here's a crazy thought, but I'm going to tell it to you anyways. So I Was just reading one of ray kurzweil's books, I think it was called how to make a mind. I really liked it actually.

Speaker 7:          02:13:32       It helped me understand how the brain compresses information because the world is really complicated so you have to make a low resolution representations of it to live in it. And he actually explained to me in a way that I hadn't really understood how the brain might do that neurologically. So that was cool. But you know, kurtzweil is this guy who thinks that he's a smart guy, very smart guy, and he's invented a fair bit of high end technical technological software and hardware and he's the guy that thinks that we're heading towards the singularity. And so the singularity is, you know, how processing speed doubles every 18 months and hard disk capacity every year. And there's a bunch of doublings going on, a huge number of them and they accelerate exponentially. And so it's probably, we're probably three years away, maybe even less then from building a computer that has the capacity to make as many calculations as reasonable estimates of the calculating capacity of the human brain are currently set up, 18 months away, two years away, something like that.

Speaker 7:          02:14:41       And then we're 18 months away from having one that's twice that fast and then 18 months away from having one that's twice as fast as that. So that's like say six years and we've got something that's eight times as smart as a human being. But there's a twist on that. And this is kurtzweil twist, which is as soon as you make a machine's smart enough to make the next machine that's smarter than it, which is sort of what we're doing because computers are so fast that that will scale up to near infinite computing power computing power almost instantaneously. Now, let me think. No, probably not. And Alan Gates partner has written critiques of kurtzweil and you know, you might think if something's impossible then it won't happen. Even if you don't know why. And there's reasons to, to not think that that will happen. But kurzweil's traced to back the doubling of computing power way before the existence of the transistor and it's been ridiculously stable, crazily stable, so god only knows what we're coming up with here.

Speaker 7:          02:15:43       You know, and you don't know what something have infinite computing power might be like, like you seriously don't know. And there are serious people who are very, very, very worried about that. They're very worried, for example, that companies like facebook and google will manage that first. And you know, tHose companies are already making censorship, ai bots and that's not that smart. It's sorta like making really fast robots that can shoot people. It's not that smart. And we're doing that to very rapidly. And you know, I know some guys who work in advanced ai, you know how you look, you watch the term terminator movies and you see the robots that miss when they shoot at you, like they're not very bright because the bright ones not only shoot at where you are, but they estimate where you're going to be when you make your escape moves and they shoot their simultaneously and their death rate is 100 percent. And so there's no war against the robots. I mean, when those things get going, they're going to be so much faster than us that will look like we're moving through molasses to them. So you know, so maybe what we're deciding now with all of our individual decisions about censorship and the way that we're going to construct the world and all that is exactly what kind of super intelligence we're going to bring into being.

Speaker 7:          02:16:57       And I would suggest that we try to bring one in that's good and moral rather than one that's evil and demonic. Right? So what can we do about that?

Speaker 7:          02:17:13       The. There's only one answer to that. As far as I know that that works is gay rock together. You're going to be the person who is working in ai, right? I know some of these people, it better be good people because they're going to build whatever they're like into their machines. They better have their heads screwed on straight because they're going to get amplified like mad. And I don't like What's happening with google and facebook and youtube. They're building censorship bots predicated on a certain kind of ideology. The kind of videology that we outlined today, it's a very bad idea. hopefully good people will stop that. So then that, what that means is that your moral obligation is to be good and the way you do that is first by stopping being bad and everyone can do that a little bit. So I hope that's what everyone does because the consequences of not doing it are not going to be pleasant. They never are.

Speaker 2:          02:18:16       Thank you.

Speaker 7:          02:18:18       Hi, this question is about your biblical lecture series.

Speaker 2:          02:18:22       Um,

Speaker 7:          02:18:23       I liked that one because it's about genesis, which is usually ignored as being where this post enlightenment society, you don't need these ancient creation myths. And also I thought revelations kind of gets the same treatment has been dismissed because it's the crazy hallucinogenic trip, some isolated madman in the middle of the mediterranean. So I was wondering if after you're done with genesis, if you were thinking about doing revelations, not without traversing the, the geo geography in between. Okay. Yeah. I want to walk through the whole thing if I can do that before they expire. So I mean, I've read it and thought about it and like it's such a strange book, a because it's really big among the evangelical republican types and you'd think really, really that's the book, but you're relying, have you read it? It's, it's, it's, it's, it's A crazy hallucinogenic trip. That's what revelation is now.

Speaker 7:          02:19:22       That's not to play it down because God only knows about crazy hallucinogenic trips, that's for sure. I mean there's, there's accruing evidence. I would say that a tremendous amount of the religious orientation of human beings, you Know, that deep mythological, symbolic orientation is in no small part a consequence of humanities experimentation with psychedelics substances. I think that's, that the evidence for that I think has become virtually an overwhelming. So anyways, I will get there. Maybe probably not because at the rate I'm going through the first stories, it'll take me forever to get there, but that's okay. So. Right. Thank you. Yep.

Speaker 9:          02:20:08       Dr. Peterson. Thank you. First of all, it's great. Pleasure being here. It's awesome to see you live. Um, I basically got into your work's just earlier this year and I had an original question, but your talk today kind of made me decide to change my mind and I was going to ask, um, do you feel as though would you agree with me in the sentiment that the left has pushed so hard for total control of our society over the last however many years? It's almost to a point where st 2013 was a different time. Would you say that because they pushed so hard, they've created this backlash and the backlash created caused them to backlash back again. So they doubled down with their ideology and then they get, they lose another argument, they lose another ideological war, they lose, lose another me more and they double down and then doubled down again and again.

Speaker 9:          02:21:02       And they can't seem to mean. They can't seem to argue. They can't see, they can't, they don't want to have an intellectual discussion. And as an interpretation of what you were saying, there is no, there doesn't seem to be any, any, any care of what's right with them. They just want power. They just want, they just want to win. Um, do you, would you agree with the sentiment that they're burning themselves out and creating the mass red pilling of the conservative movement that we see going on? Would you possibly think that maybe they've committed suicide and, and talks like this, people like yourself, ben shapiro and others who talk to people like what? The subjects that we do the taboo of nowadays, um, possibly that this, this is the answer to defeat the, the leftist stranglehold. It's society. I

Speaker 7:          02:21:55       will untangle some of that. Okay. So first of all, well first of all, the first observation is a really interesting one because you know that things can go out of hand very, very rapidly and the reason they do that is because of positive feedback loops. Now, the thing that kurzweil talks about is a positive feedback loop and intelligent machine makes another intelligent machine that makes another intelligent machine and that's a positive feedback loop and now can spiral upwards out of control very rapidly. And that's when polarization is, it's like, I, you, you tap me, I slapped you, you punched me well up. It goes well, I think that's partly why in the new testament, for example, there's an injunction that says, turn the other cheek, resist not evil. Why? Because otherwise you get into a positive feedback loop and then you better look the hell out and things can tilt very, very rapidly.

Speaker 7:          02:22:49       I mean, all you have to do, look at what happened in world war one. No one expected that. It waS like one, one relatively minor member I think of the aristocracy, if I remember correctly, waS assassinated in one minor little Country. It's like bang, everything fell apart and that's positive feedback loops. Right? And so that's what we're in right now and we've got to be. That's a really chaotic time and so I would say maintain self control and don't aim to win. Amen. Peace. Because winning, that's, that's not peace. It's better to aim for pace. You know, I've got this tart coming up in November 11th. I'm quite worried about it because I know there's going to be protesters there and that they've been emboldened by the fact that they shut the torque down before and I want to make a video. I'Ll probably do it tomorrow telling everyone that comes to that meeting to like watch their bloody step and stay out of the gutter because you just, we're at, we're at.

Speaker 7:          02:23:52       We're at a point now where under the wrong circumstances, if the wrong person does the wrong thing, that the consequences will be very great. Now we can't predict which action is going to precipitate that and or even if that will happen, but it's chaotic enough so that it could happen. So you know, so govern yourselves accordingly. Now the problem is that there are people who would be happy if there was blood running in the street. They the same sort of people that shoot up high schools or kill innocent, you know, elementary school kids just to show what they're made of and what they believe. And that's a big problem. But for the rest of us, like hopefully calmer heads can prevail. And so it really is important not to win. It's like fighting with your wife. You don't when you can't because you have to live with her.

Speaker 7:          02:24:44       I just can't win, but maybe you can solve the problem and bring about peace and so you've got to practice doing that practice restraint now and remember too that these people that you're talking about who had radical leftist is most of the time, they're not like they're 95 percent like you and if you pull them out of the mob, they're just like your neighbors. Nineteen year old kid who's kind of clueless and rebellious. Right. And who you might even like you put them in the mall, but it's a whole different thing. And so you got to remember that too. Oh, the fear of social isolation kind of. You're saying no, it's just that they're possessed by these ideas, but, but only partially, you know, you hardly find it full blooded. Absolutely committed radical leftist activist, you know, like there are some but not very many. Most of it is just fragmentary behavior and you have to remember that like when the students come out to protest me was a case, particularly at mcmaster.

Speaker 7:          02:25:45       I have to remember these kids, they're not much different than my kids. They are when they're in a stupid mob behind a hammer and sickle flag, you know, but, but, but you don't want to make a low resolution, homogenous representation of them and so and so you. That's why, again, I think instead of winning, you turn to your own development, you turn to your own development, you do what you can to stop doing the things that you're doing that aren't good because you're not going to hurt anybody if you do that. All you're going to do is help and otherwise you'll participate in this polarization and that's unless you want that. And you know, there's a dark part of people that it's part of the part that voted for trump would like to burn things to the ground. It's like to help. I know how people felt when they went into the voting booth.

Speaker 7:          02:26:37       It was like hillary hillary to hell with it. Trump, you know, and that's, that's a hell of a thing to say to hell with it. You know. Although I could, I could certainly understand that sentiment. So we have to be careful and all of you people who are here who are advocates of free speech and who are theoretically happy to come hear me speak, it's like I really do believe it are truly believed this and this is something I learned in part from social units and then part from you all missed that. The way that you set the world straight is by constraining the malevolence in your own heart. And that's no joke, man. That's no easy thing and that's a good voyage for people to go on if they want something difficult and worthwhile to do. So. Thank you very much.

Speaker 10:         02:27:23       Okay, just a quick thing. We're not going to have time for pictures, so you're. Unless you're yours is the last question. Okay. So sorry to everybody else, but you're the last one. Okay.

Speaker 11:         02:27:39       Hi Dr. Peterson. Thanks for coming. Uh, my question is a little bit off topic from everything else tonight, but I really wanted to hear what you had to say about it. Um, I work in residence life here at ubc and in the community where I am, we were recently effected by a suicide of someone who lived in our community and that I was upset about it, not just because obviously it's a horrible thing to have happen, but also because rez life in the university, like they talk all this talk about self care and your mental health is so important to us. But then things like this still happened. So I wanted to know, like if you think like, what do you think the university should be doing? Keep stuff

Speaker 7:          02:28:22       like this from happening in the future?

Speaker 5:          02:28:27       Well,

Speaker 7:          02:28:30       it's not self evident that it's the university's responsibility and the reason for that. I'm not saying it isn't. Okay, I'm, I'm saying it's not self evident that it is because different institutions can only do so many things, you know, and we were already requiring that the university is to educate and to act as substitute parents increasingly and to take on the role of judge, jury and executioner as there are more. What should be criminal cases are being handled within the university. Say,

Speaker 5:          02:29:08       um.

Speaker 7:          02:29:12       Having said that, you could ask the broader question is, well, what do you do to help people be sufficiently in love with life so that they don't wish to end it now? And I've tried to puzzle through that for a long time and that's partly why I've written the things that I've written. It's partly why I've produced the online programs that I've produced, you know, and so we know that if you do, if you have students do the future authoring program, for example, they're much less likely to drop out of university about 30 percent less likely and their grades go up. And That's especially true if they're male and marginalized. It has a bigger impact on those communities. And so, you know, I've tried to get university's interests now the data's there, but they're not. And it's very difficult to get a big bureaucracy to move.

Speaker 7:          02:29:58       A big, big is immobile. So I'm not sure there's anything they can really do about it. It's certainly possible that the things that they're trying to do about it or making it worse, you know, that's another thing that you learn if you're a good social scientists. Just like there was evidence, and I don't know if this is still the case, but there was good evidence. I looked into this about 15 years ago. Say you want to prevent suicides, produce suicide hotline in your town and you advertise it. What happens? Suicide rate goes up because you're advertising suicide, right? And lots of lots of interventions are like that. It's really, really hard to make thinGs better and it's really, really easy to make them worse. And so that's another problem. You get these big bureaucracies, let's say, and there hypothetically motivated by positive intentions and I would say hypothetically, again, because it takes an awful lot of work to help someone straightened out. It's no joke, especially if they're in real trouble and they put in place these structures that are designed to help but they don't ever evaluate them and they could easily be making it worse. So.

Speaker 7:          02:31:09       So I don't have a straightforward answer to that question.

Speaker 5:          02:31:12       Um, I think that.
