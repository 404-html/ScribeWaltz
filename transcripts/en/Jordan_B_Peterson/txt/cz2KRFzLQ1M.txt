Speaker 1:          00:00          I want to tell you a story now and it has these characters in it and so this is a very important story and it gets, it's called the Enuma elish and it's the Mesopotamian creation myth and it's important for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it's the oldest written story we know of, but it's also a Middle Eastern story and the whole. All the Abrahamic religions emerged out of the Middle East and so it's a foundational story. It's a story that sits at the bottom of our culture now. It has. It has similarities to the creation story in genesis, whether the creation story in genesis was derived from it or whether there was a whole variety of similar stories floating around in the Middle East and at the same time that we're very. It's a theme we don't really know,

Speaker 1:          01:01          but it doesn't really. I don't think it really matters. We don't know how old the story is. We know how old it is in its written form. It's, it's, it's thousands of years old and it's written for them. Maybe it's 10,000 years old. It's written for him, but probably not. It's probably more like 5,000 years old, but the thing is is that a 5,000 year old story is a lot that's written is way older than 5,000 years. Like we're used to being in an environment where there's a million stories, you know, because we have books and movies and all of these things, but you know, in, in slower moving and more archaic cultures, especially ones that are just just have an oral tradition. It's not like there's a million stories. There's like 20 canonical stories and God only knows how old they are. There was evidence, linguistic evidence. I just saw a study on this last week. Someone sent it to me showing that some of the fairytales that the grimm brothers gathered might be 10,000 years old. And that doesn't surprise me because the, the kind of depth that's in a good fairy tale is so the depth is so the profundity is so deep that there's no way that someone could just contract it out. You know, 100 years ago, there's layers and layers and layers of meaning and they're basically archetipal and religious in significance. And a Hansel and Gretel story is a good example of that. Um, and sleeping beauty is a good example of that too. A lot of the canonical fairytales are, they're very, very powerful. They pack a lot of meaning into a very short

Speaker 1:          02:37          and do a very limited amount of time. So. So it was great that this was an arrest and it was only on earth in the late 18 hundreds. So we haven't known about this story for a long, long time. And so it's, it was a tremendously exciting discovery on the part of the people who, who dug it up. So I'm going to tell you the story. So

Speaker 2:          03:04          okay.

Speaker 1:          03:04          The primary character in this story is a, like a dragon mother named ty mapped and tire map. You can think about her as half the dragon of chaos and half the destructive creative feminine. So she, you could think about her as what sort of on the border between what's a known known in an unknown and unknown. And she is construed as the mother of all things. Now, the mother of all things is like what was revealed when the towers came down is this tremendously complex background, multilevel system of operations that's always going on that that identifiable singular things emerged from now. The mesopotamians wouldn't have said that because what they said was this story, because that's the form in which their knowledge had. It had developed to the point where they could tell a story about instead of maybe acting it out or dreaming about it in some sense, you know, but they couldn't articulate it.

Speaker 1:          04:07          We can barely articulate it now. So there's time out. She's viewed as the mother of all things and she has a husband named absolute who's her concert. Very little is said about absolut in this particular story, and I think the reason for that, although I'm not sure if this is that the Mesopotamian civilization was new enough as a technological state, let's say, because they made cities as a technological state that the myth that myths of humanity hadn't figured out how to encapsulate the nature of the, of our technological dominance hierarchy. There was a sense that it existed, but there wasn't a sense of it as a carer, differentiated character that was capable of doing all sorts of different things. I think that didn't emerge until Egypt, although I'm not certain about that, but that's how it looks to me. So absolute is her husband. Now, the way the Mesopotamian started with the world, and this is the same way that the people who wrote genesis started the world.

Speaker 1:          05:07          They thought that the world was a desk. You know what, what the world is like when you go outside and you stand in a field. It's a flat field. You look at the world, it's pretty obvious what it is. It's a big disk of earth and then there's a dome on top of it and in the dome or the Sun and the moon and the stars, and then you might ask, well, what's underneath the earth? And that the answer for the Mesopotamians was fresh water first and then sold water. And how did you know that? Well, if you drilled down then up, the fresh water would come. So obviously it was fresh water down there and then if you went to the edge of your territory, it's like, well there's the salt water. So the earth was, you know, the, the, the earth, roughly speaking, was it disk of matter, resting on a disk of fresh water, resting on a disk of soap, water and absolute time that were the fresh and salt water respected.

Speaker 1:          05:56          Okay, and now the Mesopotamians thought that the way that the, that absolutely time that gave birth to everything was that they joined together in sexual union. It's like the Yin and the Yang and it's very much like that in fact, and that it was out of their union that the, the elemental God's emerged and I think you can think of the elemental gods as there are forces of nature and they're viewed through. They're not personified because to personify something means that you see it as an objective phenomena and then attribute human characteristics to it. That isn't how people work. What happens is we perceive human characteristics and then only with trip terrible effort do we extract out the objective reality from that. So we depersonalize things when we become scientific, but we just naturally see them as characters and you can see this when you read books to kids, you know, like everything's a person that train is a person in a car as a person that moon is a person and the sun is a person and, and you know, you read stories to children that have that as a presupposition, doesn't bother you at all, you know, you, you can just fall right into it with no problem, you know, and in the automations you see the sun in the sky smiling and bouncing along and it doesn't bother you, you know, it's, it's no problem to, to look at the world that way and there's some utility in looking at the world in that way as, as we'll discover.

Speaker 1:          07:23          So anyways, and I think part of the reason that we view things that way. Oh yeah. That was the other thing I wanted to tell you about our perceptual systems is that we. We do have a social cognitive platform, intellectual platform, which means that our primary categories, the primary categories of our mind do seem to be social. So you could say that the reason our mind evolved or or. No, you could say that the fundamental selecting pressures on our, on our mind ensured that the, the primary substructure of our cognitive ability was modules that could understand social behavior. Man Can understand, women, women could understand men, men and women could understand children, children, men and women could understand the social world. And that's. And that's, that's what we're specialized for. And then it was only after those systems develop hyper developed probably under the, under the force of sexual selection that they became able to separate themselves to some degree from that underlying social cognitive structure and start to see the world in ways that weren't personified.

Speaker 1:          08:33          So, but what that means is that our natural categories are still an anthropomorphic and dramatic and it actually turns out that they work. So absolute timeout, nature and culture is a perfectly reasonable way of thinking about them. Now they would say, well, it's the interplay between nature and culture that gives rise to the primordial forces of nature. Now those forces of nature would be to some degree external like a storm or like fire. But they would be so to some degree internal to like, like the fire of passion, right? And the and the storm of sorrow. Because those are natural forces as well. And one of the things that the ancients knew was that man was created to serve the gods. And of course modern people think of that as a superstition, but that's because they don't really understand how archaic people thought. Archaic. People thought.

Speaker 1:          09:26          Like Freud thought it was like, yeah, yeah, you have an ego fine. You know, and as long as you're in a box within a bunch of other blocks is the eagle runs things. But as soon as we put you somewhere where those boxes are gone, it's the underlying forces of nature that run you hunger, thirst, you know, aggression, sexuality and all those things that are impersonal. Because of course you have them and you have them, and so does everyone else, so they're impersonal and transcendent and they're also eternal, and so when the art or arcade people said, and they usually said this with sorrow, that man was destined to serve the gods. That's what they meant. They meant that we were the play. Things have these unbelievably powerful primordial forces that manifested themselves within our lives and determined our destinies in, in, in, in, in fact, the Mesopotamian said that specifically about the elder gods.

Speaker 1:          10:21          They said they were. They were part of that which determined human destiny. They monitor who will talk about in a while was given the tablet of destinies because when he was, when he asked to become top God, he said, well, if I'm going to be taught God, I get to determine the destinies and well, we'll get to that. So you kinda got to know what these, what these archaic, God's work. And they were personalities. You know, when you could say, well, yeah, yeah, maybe it's a mistake to attribute the qualities of personality to a storm. Although it depends on what you think a storm is, like a modern person would think of a storm as an objective event that you have subjective reactions to, and our keg person would more likely think of the storm as the subjective consequences of the storm, plus the storm all at once.

Speaker 1:          11:11          They would make that separation, so it's a lot easier to personify something under those conditions or to not to personify it, but to. But to stay within the realm of conceptualization that makes it a persona. Find Force. So the storm God is something that you know, that can instill terror into your heart. It's like, well, you know, yeah, fair enough. You know? All right, so anyways, absolutely tie. They give rise to these primordial gods and I'm going to think about them as forces of nature and I think that's a reasonable representation for a variety of reasons. They're like the titans.

Speaker 1:          11:54          All right, so the giving rise to these gods and the gods are their children and they run about making all sorts of racket. They were making rockets and they're doing this and they're doing that and they're building things in there, messing about with things in their, their noisily engaged in their interactions with one another and they're having children and they're fighting about sex and they're just making racket like mad and then they do something stupid and so they're annoying time that as they make all this racket, she's sorta slumbering down there in the depths leaving them be, but they make all this racket that may annoy her. It's like it's the environmentalist myth by the way. It's exactly the same idea. So you know, human beings, we're kind of dopey. We're running around gratifying our fundamental needs and making racket and destroying things, and if we're not careful, mother nature will come flooding back and wipe us out.

Speaker 1:          12:44          It's like, yeah, that's happened in the past. It could happen, but it's an archetypal. It's an archetypal idea. It's a mythological idea. So fine. They're making racket and timeouts, leaving the beach, but then they get arrogant, I would say, or careless and they, they kill app suit and they make their dwelling place on his corpse. Now that's a that is a brilliant, brilliant symbolic idea because what it means, it means a bunch of things, but one of the things that means is that in so far as the gods are because they're masculine, you're part of the representation of the dominance hierarchy and the human interactions within it, that the idea that that, that that's all existing on the corpse of absolute is something like the idea that all of the natural forces that are embodied within human beings and driving them are resting on a substructure of dead culture and everyone knows that because everyone says, especially modern people, they look back at their culture and they think, oh, that thing's dead. You know, and we can rest comfortably on its debt surface. Well, that's not right because if it's dead,

Speaker 1:          13:52          well, if it's dead, logically speaking, it's not alive, and if it's not alive, it can't adapt. And if it doesn't adapt and it falls behind and gets full of errors and it gets corrupt and starts to fall apart, and if it gets corrupted full of errors and falls apart enough, then chaos comes back. That's exactly what happens in the Mesopotamian myth. So they kill app soon. They keep making racket and time at wakes up one day and she thinks, oh, they're noisy, I don't like them that much and now they've gone and done in my husband, which is order, so I'm going to wait them out. So the guards get wind of this and they're not very happy about it, you know, because after all they're gone. But she is the god goddess slash drag that gave them all life and the probability that they'll prevail in a battle against that which gave them form is very, very low.

Speaker 1:          14:43          So they're pretty damn terrified. So meanwhile time at is generating her army and she generates quite an army and that Mesopotamians list out what she does. She, she first of all picks for her concert, a new character named king and king who is like the king of the demons monsters. So her old husband was app. So when maybe he was ordered and her new husband is like, he's not someone that you want to have around at all. And so he's basically put at the hand of this flanks of terrible monsters and she generates like Scorpion monsters and crocodile monsters and all sorts of things in our army so that she can go wipe out these, these gods. And so while this is happening, the gods gathered themselves together and they decide that they will elect a champion from within their ranks to go out and fight with tire map.

Speaker 1:          15:33          And so they do that and they send one God out and he comes back with his tail between his legs, roughly speaking. All right, don't lie, encounter with chaos. And then they send another God out. The same thing happens and they send another God out at the same thing happens. And it's getting pretty damn hopeless because they're sending out their best men against chaos and the, and the mother of all things. And they're getting scoble all the time while this was happening. They continue to produce new generations of Gods. And at one point this new God emerges as, as a young person, I presume. Um, but he's, he's, there's some things that are different than about him than any other thing that's being produced so far. And one of the things that's different is he's, he's quite tall and powerful, so, you know, that's not necessarily so radical, but he has eyes all the way around his head and when he speaks he can speak darkness into being an, he can speak light into being.

Speaker 1:          16:24          So, so things obey the commands of his words. So He's a master of language. He can see everywhere and he's a master of language. Okay. And so the garlands and checking them out and they think, wow, you know, he's, he's quite something, maybe we can get him to go after time, Matt. So they all go to him in this, in this little group and they say, look, Marduk, because that's his name. Um, you know, we've been checking you out and you're looking pretty impressive. And so we've got a proposition for you. I, how about if you go fight time map and Marta, who's not only all seeing and, and very capable with languages, no fool. And he says, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get what you want, but here's the deal. You get everybody together first and I'll go fight your monster, but you're going to have a congress and add that Congress.

Speaker 1:          17:13          You're going to elect me king of the gods, and then I'll go fight time map. And so of course the other gods aren't very happy about this, but they go off and they have a congress and they invite mark to it and they talk about it and they realize they don't really have any other choice. So they decided that they're going to elect Marduk to the top of the hierarchy of gods. Now that's such a smart idea. So if you think, for example, you can think of a hero and then you could take, if you took 10 heroes and average them out of that, you get a a God, right? So it'd be 10 heroes. You get Annetta here out of that, and that would be a. and then maybe you do that to 10 sets of 10 heroes and you get 10 mega heroes.

Speaker 1:          17:54          And then you take all those mega heroes and you figure out what's the same about them and you abstract that out and then you get the hero of heroes of heroes. And that's the archetype. That's the archetype. It's a process of distillation. It's like who is the most interesting possible, the most interesting and capable possible person will that would be this person. This is the most memorable possible person. Well, we don't know who that is, but this is how we figured out how I could say, well, I admire something about you and I admire something about you. I can notice that as a phenomenal logical fact. You seem very capable in a certain way and you know you have this attribute. And then I might say, well, if I was going to sort out an ideal for myself to follow, then I take the good parts of all of you.

Speaker 1:          18:39          And I put that into one thing and then I would make that my ideal. Well, that's the origin of the idea of the savior of the Messiah is it's an emergent idea emerges when people notice that the hero is that the hero is part of the forest that makes order out of chaos. Or sometimes the reverse. When when order has become too rigid, it can also decompose order bringing a little necessary chaos into it, rejuvenate the whole structure. So anyways, so Marta, he gets elected king. Now you might think about how would this happen historically speaking? Well, here's an interesting way of thinking about it. So imagine a landscape that consists of tribes, okay? And then on top of them, imagine a landscape of the imagination. Okay, so each member of each tribal group lives in their imagined world and that imagined world is full of diabetes and natural forces of various kinds that they're following.

Speaker 1:          19:39          But then you can imagine that as the tribes battle it out and organize themselves, the fingers of the imagination do exactly the same thing. So as the people are battling, the Gods in heaven are battling, which is also a very common mythology, and as the human beings a beat themselves into a functional group, their world conceptions do the same thing. And so over time you move from polytheism, roughly speaking to monotheism as the the, as all of these tribes communicate with one another in, in language and in and in combat, and sort out just exactly what should be sovereign, what should it be? Powerful, what should it be? Dominant, right? It's a major. It's a major issue and it's partly practical. It's partly conceptual. So if this is reflected in the Mesopotamian creation myth, the gods assemble themselves and they look among them and they think, okay, well some one here is, has the characteristics that should, should be the central element of the top daddy, which is like the ultimate value.

Speaker 1:          20:46          Okay, well the Mesopotamians chose wisely vision and language. Those are your most, the most potent weapons you have against chaos because you, if you pay attention, you can see chaos when it first emerges. And then if you are a master of language, you can encapsulate it, then articulate it very rapidly, and you can communicate that to other people's. It's like now this easy. You just cannot overestimate how radical an idea that is. It's a staggeringly radical idea that that's the set of attributes that should be at the top. The mesopotamians were trying to figure out what should be sovereign, what should be above everything else. Well, you might say a person, it's like, yeah, yeah, no, the person embodies sovereignty. Sovereignty itself is something else. So when Frans de Waal, for example, he was watching chimpanzees hash it out for dominance in, in the, in the zoo.

Speaker 1:          21:41          I think it's in the R and M, I think. Anyways, it's a zoo that has a lot of chimpanzees and he spent a lot of time watching them. And you know, one idea about the dominant chimp is that he's just the biggest meanness, like most tyrannical chimp. It's sort of the strong man theory of chimp leadership. But what do all observed was that, well that was sort of true in that the strongest, meanest chimpanzee could obtain dominance. But the problem with him is if he was really like selfish and cruel, was that he didn't have any friends. Now chimps have friends and they spent a lot of time with them and they groom each other and they protect each other and fights and like, you can be the ugliest, meanest chimp around. But if there's two chimps that are three quarters your strength coming at you, it's like you, you lose now.

Speaker 1:          22:30          So that means two chimps that are capable of enough civilization to find themselves in to a dyad that is, that has mutual obligations across time, is way stronger than one ship who doesn't. And so what that means is that strength and viciousness, you know, there'll be times when that can emerge as the dominant power, but it's very, very unstable. And, and everyone's motivated to bring it down as fast as possible. And the best way to bring it down is with the coalition. And so partly what that indicates is that it's actually the chimp who's the best at making coalitions that's most likely to become sovereign. So that, and that's actually what happens with the chimps is that, uh, the dictator chimp is very unstable. And in the one story I read it of Arnhem Zoo, he rose to the top, the, the, the, you know, bad, bad guy, the gangster guy and a two chimps went after him and to pieces.

Speaker 1:          23:23          They tore off his testicles. Yeah. And you know, it agitated the hell out of the rest of the truth. And it was like a bloody revolution, you know, it was really, really stressful for the troop. But, but what it indicates, and it's so interesting, is that the idea that in a, in a dominance hierarchy, what's most dominant is power. That there's no evidence whatsoever that that's true. And in fact, I was talking to when I have a partner in a business that I have, who was a student of mine at Harvard, he's a very, very smart person and I was talking to him about dominance hierarchies and he said something very that I found very upsetting on a variety of levels. He said it's not a dominance hierarchy if you can't put a dog collar on the person one level below you, which is pretty bloody blunt statement, but when he's he, he's prone to that sort of thing, but what he meant is that it's possible that the idea that the term dominance hierarchy is not the right term to be applying to these sorts of social structures because what it implies is that what keeps the structure in place is power.

Speaker 1:          24:28          You know, and that's the sort of claim that people like food, coal make. It's all about power. It's like the thing is, it's not all about power. It's not all about power. It's not all about power among animals. So with power, with chimps, if that's all you've got is power, you're going to get wiped out. You have to. So what I found was that the chimps who were able to establish stable patterns of leadership were quite congenial. They had a lot of allies, so they engaged in mutual grooming and a lot of social interaction and they were very positively predisposed to the females in the truth. So that's pretty interesting, you know, because we don't know what constitutes valid sovereignty, but even in animals it doesn't seem to be power. So, and then you know, you look at wolf packs and that sort of thing and you know, if two wolves go at it for, for dominance, one wolf of back off and roll over and show his throat and you know, like Stalin, Wolf would just tear out his throat.

Speaker 1:          25:27          But you know, Churchill Wolf let say would say, well yeah, you're kind of useless, but we might need you around later. So why don't you get up and you know, we'll let bygones be bygones and that's what wolves do, you know, and unsurprisingly, because what are you going to do? Kill everyone in your troop? Well that doesn't seem like a very effective strategy either for meeting or for survival. So the Mesopotamians were trying to work out practically who's going to be sovereign and at the same time conceptually what is the proper basis for sovereignty, which is really the ultimate question in some sense. So anyways, so they elect Marduk and the markets go to all these eyes and he can speak. And so he thinks, all right, he says, if I win, I'm going to get the tablet, have destinies, and then I'm taught God. And they say, yeah, yeah, whatever, if you win, no problem.

Speaker 1:          26:17          So he goes out to fight time and he takes a sword and he and he takes a net and they meet on the battlefield and he encapsulates timeout in a net, which I think is a brilliant, brilliant metaphor again, because chaos is a morphous and unformed, right? And if you want to conquer it, you have to encapsulate it within a net, a net. You have to, you have to make it into something rather than something amorphous. You know, when. So look, maybe a client comes to me and they say, Oh, I've been having these terrible symptoms on my heart races and I, I, my, my breath, I can't catch my breath and I think I'm going to die. And um, I think maybe I'm having a heart attack and I'm always at the hospital and they tell me that there's nothing wrong with me, but I have like, I'm, I'm afraid all the time and I'm starting not to go out. And I say, Oh, you have agoraphobic. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          27:11          lots of people have that. You're not the only person like that in the world. Not only that it has a name, we know what to do about it, and there's a treatment course and they'd go. And the reason for that is that the unknown unknown has just been turned into a known unknown and that's a massive improvement. And so the person who conceptualizes the anomalous situations fastest is in fact the leader. That's the definition of leadership. It's like we don't know what's going on. This is what's going on and what. And when you say, this is what's going on, you also simultaneously say, here's a million other things that could have been going on that aren't. So it's a process of radical simplification and it lowers the stress levels immediately. Anyway, so time that goes in or articles, he gets her in a nap and then he splits in half and he makes heaven out of one half and the earth out of the other for the human beings and uh, and he goes back to any defeats, Keto and all the monsters. And then he goes back to tell the other gods and they're pretty happy about this. And he knew had the tablet, the destinies, but Martin took that from him and now he has it. So he gets to determine destiny and he makes human beings out of king whose blood, which is quite an interesting little twist to the story and he makes them to serve the gods. And so, so that's that. So,

Speaker 1:          28:33          so the idea is that the, the hero who can see and can communicate is also the hero who separates out the elements of existence so that it becomes a habitable place and that humans should serve that serve. Margo. Well, you have to serve something. Well, you're going to serve a natural force of some sort of you gonna be all anger. You can be all last, are going to be all love, we can be all hunger, or are you going to represent some integrated, ah, some some balanced and integrated

Speaker 1:          29:03          emergent property of that. It's also socially constructed and also that you're a balance of natural forces and you're a civilized person. That's some sort of essence and that's what you're going to strive for. Well, that's Marta, so you're supposed to be a good murder. Now, Margaret is immortal now. The only person who was identified with Martech in the Mesopotamian realm was the emperor. Now they lived in a walled city, and so what the emperor, the reason the emperor was sovereign was because he was supposed to be the embodiment of Marico and earth, which meant that his job was to transform chaos into order whenever chaos threatened. He was supposed to transform it back into order. So this is what Mesopotamians did at the New Year's celebration when the year is rejuvenated, right? The old year dies. Of course we know that because we still do it, and the new year is this new baby.

Speaker 1:          29:49          It's a time of new beginnings. So the Mesopotamians would take the emperor out of the city and they'd strip him of all his emperor close, and then they'd make them recite all the ways during the last year that he'd been a bad Marduk, like he hadn't kept, he hadn't been encountering chaos properly and hadn't been keeping order property, so and confess all of his inadequacies. Then the priest would whack them with a glove as a, you know, as a ritual punishment, and then they take all the statues out of the old gods out of the city, and then they really represent the battle between Martech and tire mount, and then the emperor was mark and he would win and then he would have sex with a ritual prostitute, which was that. This is a much tougher concept, but it's a way of symbolizing the fact that if the creative force encounters the positive element of the feminine, it's like the prince and sleeping beauty, getting sleeping beauty from the grasp of the evil queen who turns into the Dragon.

Speaker 1:          30:54          It's exact because it's weird, right? You've seen that and you understand it. Right? Sleeping. Beauty's all in the tower. She's covered by, she's hemmed in by a huge fields of thorns. The Evil Queen is trying to stop the prints from getting to her. She turns into a dragon which makes absolutely no sense, but everyone follows it and then he has to fight his way through that to get to the, to the main. It's the same idea in a different context and then order productive order being reestablished. Everybody goes back into the kingdom and it's renewed for the next year and that's the idea behind Mesopotamian sovereignty and it's bloody brilliant because it's an abs. It's, it's, it's, it's the beginnings of, of law. In some sense. It's, it's the idea that to be, to be proper, even if you're a desperate, even if you're the king, there's a sacred pattern of behavior that you must adhere to, which is the consequence of a congress, of the gods deciding what the most effective mode of being is.

Speaker 1:          31:54          It's staggeringly brilliant and, and it took that story. We just have no idea how long that story took. Do we merge? I would say it's, it's the consequence of the full course of human evolutionary history. Like the, there are elements in it that are as old as mammals and maybe older than that, you know, if you think about those patterns being embedded in behavior long before they were abstracted out into representations, it's unbelievably archaic and ancient and so you have time at the great mother. You have absolutely the great father, you have Marduk the archetypal son, you have king who's the negative element of Marta, right? And you have the drama of all those characters interacting across time and that's, that's the mythological, mythological representation of reality. And tying that to tie it into the neuropsychology that we talked about, you know, we talked about anomaly, right?

Speaker 1:          32:50          And how normally you have a, a, a, a box that you're in that is your world, but that box doesn't contain everything in the world. There's a lot of things that are good at and sometimes they poked their head in like a snake and then that's disruptive. And what do you do? Well, you have to, you have to voluntarily encounter the snake then either defeated or make something valuable out of it. You know, you could cower and hide, but all that generally means the state grows and grows until there's hardly any you in the box and there's all snake and that's actually the Mesopotamian stories. It's like if the elder gods weren't so careless and had been paying attention and hadn't killed absolute time, that would've stayed asleep the whole time. So. Well. So that's the, that's the level of isomorphism. So what's, what's fascinating, but I think inevitable is that the mythology reflects the physiology, but how could it not? The physiology produced the mythology, like, of course that's going to be the case. It shouldn't be a surprise. It should be, it should be, it should be. The reverse should be a surprise. It's like there's no relationship between these, these old stories and the way that human beings are structured. It's like, well, no, no, that's a dumb idea. So,

Speaker 2:          34:15          well,

Speaker 1:          34:16          that's the Mesopotamian creation myths and it's, it's a killer. It's, it's a, it's a staggering story. And you know, it still sits. Whether we know it or not, it sits at the very base of our culture. It's absolute that story. And if we kill it, which we will or have been, then then look out, you know, we know the story from so long ago, if you let your culture die and act carelessly towards it, all hell will break loose and it's no joke. So, so here we are trying to revive a fight. It's pretty weird that these things happened to be real. But then if you think about it, well, how could it be otherwise? You know, I mean, you think all these people who lived before us for the tens of millions of years that we've had are vaguely human. Pre predessessors were stupid. They weren't and they weren't ignorant and they weren't superstitious or any of those things. They were, they were, they were tough enough so that we're here.
