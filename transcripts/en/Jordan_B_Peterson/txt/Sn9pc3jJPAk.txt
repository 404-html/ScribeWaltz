Speaker 1:          00:00          It's on me. There we go. All right. We're live. We're live. Holy Cow. Hello, Youtube. We are live in Phoenix. We're at Comerica theater. I've got this Jordan Peterson guy. I'm Simon. I'm somehow hosting on his channel, but that doesn't see right. We're about to do what are maybe 13th, 14th, 15th. They're all starting to blend. Yeah. In a good way for this one. You really stepped up in the wardrobe department. I feel very sharp. Sharp. This thing has been unbelievable. Huh? It's pretty remarkable. And this theater in Phoenix is one of the most interesting ones yet. It's very big. It's about eight stories. High side. Yeah. So about about 4,000 people waiting in there. It's about 105 and Phoenix today. They're actually only here to purchase the arch and pretty much I, I literally went to the gym twice today to sweat indoors because it was so hot outdoors.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Um, but we've been bouncing around. We just did three stops and tenses that night. Everything has been great. Like, and what I say to you every night, I say it before we started and then at the end it's like, man, everything that they say about this man, about this tour, about everything going on here, it's completely the reverse of the truth. Yeah, it's pretty interesting. Yeah. Well, I spent a fair bit of time after the lectures talking to people. It's usually about 150 people that I get to say hello to and, and everybody has 15 seconds or so to tell me a story, but they don't really low. Audio is low. All right, we're going to talk louder. Okay. All right. We're going to talk louder. Let's see if we can pick it up. So yeah. Energy, peanuts in men. So I talked to about 150 people afterwards and um, they, they all have a story to tell me, but most of the stories are variants on a theme, which is that they're happy to listen to the lectures because it's helping them clarify their thinking or providing them with words that they haven't had before.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Describe things they know to be true or they tell me that they're doing better as a couple or the father and son they're or or father and the daughter or mother and the daughter and they're getting along better or it's a couple of just decided to get engaged and their relationship is better. Or a father who's he was doing better with his kids are, but none of it's political. It's political. It's maybe it's maybe 10 percent political and I'll. I'll talk to the camera for a second for this because everyday when they tell you that Jordan's got angry white men, right? That's first off, I would guess it's about 60 slash 40, usually a male to female. There are gay people. There are black people, white people, Asian people. There were Muslims last night and Jews. I mean the whole thing. All of that diversity. That actually doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          02:55          It's all there and they just. They just consistently lie about it. I think that it seems to me that the, let's say the mainstream media types that have been pillaring me in various ways don't have a lexicon for dealing with a phenomena that's primarily psychological. They have to make this fundamentally political, the political aspects of it, you know, and so far as I'm not a fan of the radical leftists for example. And, but by the way, you had been slamming the radical right to. I mean your whole thing. I mean this is the irony of the situation is you talk about the identity politics, right? And the danger of that as much almost onstage. I don't like collecting this. Yeah, I think it's a bad route. I think it takes us down a path and I think that in destiny of a tribal path is bloodshed and I don't care whether it's the west wing or the right.

Speaker 1:          03:50          I'm more perturbed about the left lane because of their dominance in the universities in particular and that's why, you know, the lots were lower this came from, but it, it's the collectivist issue that's the, that's. It has an almost everything that we've been talking about that I'm talking about with the audience is about the western tradition of individual responsibility essentially also not individual rights, although they're part of the discussion. It's funny to be, but I would also say that in the collectivist lexical and there's no such thing as free speech and there's really no such thing as individual responsibility and so in so far as I'm able to make a case for that, that makes me an enemy, but even more importantly, it takes the dialogue outside of their. The way they frame the world. They don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to handle it, so they invent an enemy essentially.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Right. They don't really do the work intellectually to counter the arguments, so they just do the same old thing we were saying right before we started how, what a year and a half ago. We didn't even know each other. You. The first time we ever did anything together was, I think it was November, second of 2016, which was a day or two before the American election. It feels like a lifetime ago when we did, I just moved into my house, I didn't know my studio yet and we did a little google hangout thing and the audio was terrible and the video is bad and you were telling me that the Pinocchio Story, which now most of your audience knows about and you were getting teary eyed and it and it ended and I thought, I truly, I mean I've said this to you, I was like, I don't know exactly what to make of this guy.

Speaker 1:          05:20          And then subsequently you came on my show many times and we've done a couple of hours together and we did the sit down with Shapiro and it's like every month or two months this thing just levels up, levels up and it feels more real. It feels more concrete. And uh, and we're all kind of growing together. But I gotta tell you man, we crossed 600,000 youtube subscribers. I think on the same day you got to like one point two. Right now I'm, I'm almost at $800. So it stopped me a good sense. I like competition. I do like competition, we do like that, but it's just so cool watching this whole thing growing. Luckily as as hundreds of millions of people come online, we're not gonna run out of audience because there's another 2 billion people to join, to join the electronic web with enough bandwidth to start streaming videos.

Speaker 1:          06:09          So it looks to me like this whole online video and audio and podcasts world is just getting its legs underneath it. God only knows where it's gonna go. Alright. Well since we're a behind the scenes in the green room here, let's just do a couple of behind the scenes things here. First off, just how you feel while doing this whole thing on my health is improving very much. I'm much, much better than I was a month ago and in comparatively better than I was a year ago. So yeah. So that's really working out well. I'm having a very nice time with the audiences. They're unbelievably, isn't it incredible. I mean, meeting these people like just literally every. We haven't had one protest or no, uh, just everywhere they're planning something in Portland. Yeah. Well, we'll see about port credit or if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen in Portland, but being really, you know, every night after the show, uh, you meet a certain amount of people afterwards and I usually go out into the crowd.

Speaker 1:          06:59          Yeah, there's hundreds, sometimes thousands of people wait. And it's like, man, they just want to hug you. And a lot of hugs. It's pretty vicious people. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing. You're not a Germaphobe. Yeah. Yeah. Well the other thing too is if, if I'm protested enrichment or, or Portland to any degree, I'm going to videotape the lecture elite and put it, put it online and then people can see what's being protested. Yeah, I think so. I think that's the plan when we do these, they've pretty much been different every single night. I mean we've done about 15 shows and I mix it up a little bit every night, you know, and then a couple of jokes in there that are the mainstays, some lobsters stuff and the rest. But you can dispatch the logs have to be in there, but. But you pretty much, I mean the hour and a half that you do and then especially when we do the q and a after, which is totally off the cuff, you're kind of just going in and out and sometimes you do three rules, sometimes you do eight rules, sometimes you know rules.

Speaker 1:          07:53          It's kind of amazing. Yeah, well I'm trying to develop a very large corpus of stories around each of the chapters and then I can mix and match them and I'm also trying to push the ideas that I've been developing in the book farther ahead with each talk. And so I spent a lot of time talking about the relationship between hierarchies and goals and and and difference in status. That's been a, that's been a main theme and the relationship between Truth and quality of existence. That's another one that there's a very powerful positive relationship. They're necessary and so on. All of those themes, you know, there's no end to the amount you can develop them. And each venue gives me an opportunity to push it a little bit farther and clarify what I'm thinking and get the story a little bit tighter and see how the audience see how the individuals in the audience are reacting.

Speaker 1:          08:47          And so I liked the fact that you opened with some with a humorous intro and then the q and a has an element of lightness and comedy in it because one of the things I learned a long time ago was that even if you're dealing with something that's extremely serious, if you can't do it with a comedic touch, then you haven't got the balance right. Even if it's deadly serious stuff. They love it when you make them laugh sometimes accidentally. Then like they're like, they love that. They really love it. Yeah. That's pretty cool. Well, you got to show today. I do. I guess I got to show to do. To show you. All right guys. That's Jordan Peterson. I'm Deborah. Would you tell these people to subscribe to my channel? Subscribe to Dave's damn channel. Needs the subscribers falling far behind it. Not The bottom lobster. Don't. Don't make me the bottom line guys. I guess he's the top lobster, but can we look at second level lobster or something? All right, well it's good. It's going to be fun tonight and we look forward to seeing you guys were doing this through through July and then you're continuing into August. Maybe September going to jump back in and September. I'll job. Good. Good. All right. Awesome. Great. You Bet. Thanks Johnny.
