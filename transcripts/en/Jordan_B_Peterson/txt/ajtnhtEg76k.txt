Speaker 1:          00:03          I talked a little bit last time about what we were going to cover, but I didn't get quite through it, so I'm going to finish that. For those of you who weren't here last time, you can watch the lecture because it's online. So, um, we, we stopped at the depth psychologist. Really those are the psychoanalysts. Psychoanalysts are people who are concerned with,

Speaker 1:          00:24          well, for a psychoanalyst, roughly speaking, you're a collection of loosely integrated spirits. That's one way of thinking about it or subpersonalities you're not a unity and no subpersonalities have their basis in while and all sorts of things. They might have their basis in past, especially traumatic experience or in patterns of socialization that characterized your family, but they might also have their basis in fundamental biological motivational systems. So for example, a psychoanalyst would conceptualize it, anger or, or perhaps sexual attraction as a subpersonality. And the reason for that is that, well, you know what it's like when you get angry, you get angry at someone you love. And you know, first of all, you know at some level you're wishing harm. Now that might only be that you want to win the argument and you want them to be nicely crushed while you do it, but so, so there's a desire that comes along with the anger, but, but there's a lot of other things that happened to.

Speaker 1:          01:23          So for example, if someone's annoying you, even if you love them, the probability that at that moment you're going to be able to easily access all the memories you have about how annoying they are and have difficult time accessing the memories about how wonderful they mean to you is quite high. You know, and you know that because sometimes you get angry with someone, you have an argument with them and you sort of clue in later you snap out of you're more or less possessed state and you think, yeah, well, you know, I really wasn't taking the context into mind and I was kind of harsh. So. Well, so and so. Then you think, well who's in control? And that's the question the psychoanalysts are really interested in. And their answer is it's not generally you. And so it's very terrifying reading in some sense because you know, people like to think of themselves as masters of their own house so to speak, and it's just, it's only vaguely true. And you know, people, you know that too because you make

Speaker 1:          02:20          maybe New Year's Eve, what do you call those resolutions, how you're going to be a better person. I think one of the most common ones is mad and you're going to hit the gym three times a week. It's like, no, you're not actually. And so very few people do. And that's partly because, well it's hard and so you don't want to do hard things. And the reason for that is because they're hard. So it doesn't take much explanation, but it's also because you can't just tell yourself what to do. And that's annoying too because life would be a lot easier if you could just say, okay, well you don't sit down study for two hours, don't watch cats on youtube or whatever it is that you're watching. And No, no, no, that isn't what happens. You sit there and you study for a while and then you know, you're thinking about cats and next thing you know you're watching haunted mansions in London or some damn thing, you know, so, so, and it's a scary idea in some sense because if you think, well, if you're not reading master of your own house, you know, if you don't have yourself under full voluntary control and you certainly don't, then what does.

Speaker 1:          03:18          And you know, Freud is interesting in that regard because he really talked about the motive power of fundamental motivational systems. Mostly for Freud it was aggression in sexuality, you know, and those are, those are big motivators. Let's make no mistake about it. And so he thought of you as, as the conscious part of your personality may be as the. It's like the captain of a ship with a very unruly crew. It's a nice metaphor because of course the ships on the ocean and the ocean can be very stormy. And so you can only sort of plot your course and you have to work with what's thrown at you. And then the unruly crew is, well, it's all your drives. That drives is a wrong way of thinking about it. That I liked the psychoanalytic notion of subpersonality because the subpersonality has a viewpoint. There's things it wants and it plants.

Speaker 1:          04:07          So it's, it's, uh, it's, it's an, it's a living entity. It's not some dead cognitive system. No. So Freud was interested in some sense more about, I would say, the biological underpinnings of the subpersonalities, you know, because he was, he was, he was quite biologically oriented in and he realized that sexuality and aggression, we're very fundamental subpersonalities. And then there's young and young is much more terrifying than Freud, which is really saying a lot because Freud's quite terrifying, but you, he, he's just terrifying the unbelief. And you know, for you, the sub personalities that make you up are thousands and thousands of years old. They're cultural constructions that are thousands and thousands of years old and they have you in their grip. So for union, for example, one of the things he said, and I don't remember where it was, I love this phrase, it's so true. And you can think about this for like five years and, and you can still think about it after that.

Speaker 1:          05:02          One of the things you said was that people don't have ideas, ideas have people. And that's really something to think about because you know, just think about your own situation, so no doubt you have political views and you think I have political views. It's like, well no you don't because you share them with a lot of other people, so they're certainly not yours. And not only that, they've had a very lengthy historical development far before you ever showed up, you know, so they're rooted rooted, right at the depths of your culture. But then of course they've been elaborated by one philosopher or another extensively over the last two or 300 years. And there's this whole system of thought and Poof, it inhabits your brain and then you think, well, I've got political views. It's like, no, the political views have you. And that's a very salutary thought because it's one of the ways to stop yourself from being possessed because people get possessed all the time by ideas.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Right? That's what happened in Nazi Germany. That's what happened in the Soviet Union. It happens everywhere all the time and you might think, well possessed is a little strong, but. But no, it's not actually. It's a very nice. It's a metaphor obviously, but it's the right kind of metaphor because a body of ideas like political ideas, there are living thing, you know they're not. They're not some dead dusty words on a bookshelf somewhere. They're an integral part of a dynamic society and and the motive force, those ideas have motivates you. You're in their grip and so you can tell when you're talking to someone who's completely possessed by it, by an idea system or in India logical system because they'll just bore you to death unless you happen to believe exactly the same thing. So they'll spout out a few of their fundamental belief axioms and then you can identify which system they're part of and then they just speak in cliches from that point onward and you can predict everything you're going to say if you know the axioms of the system.

Speaker 1:          07:02          So it's very. It's very non authentic speech and that would be a way that say someone like Rogers or or, or Abraham maslow who were humanists of the 19 sixties might talk about it because the person isn't speaking from the depths of their own experience or from even their embodied knowledge, you know, they're just mouthpieces for abstract ideas and so it's very frightening to realize the extent to which you can be the mouthpiece for abstract ideas, you know, and it's actually one of the dangers of becoming educated, especially in the mass system like the university system because a lot of what happens to you when you come to university is that you're fed a set of pre digested ideas. I suppose that's one way of thinking about it. You know, and it's very easy for you to think, well that those are now your ideas.

Speaker 1:          07:51          They're not. There are not lots of ideas you have to earn and if it's a great idea, then you really have to earn it. Because why should you be able to come along and like pluck up a great idea. That's not how things work. You have to earn things that are valuable. So anyways, the depth psychologist man, they're so good at that. It's lovely to read them. And the problem too is with a lot of the people we're going to talk about, it's very difficult to summarize their work, you know, because often the devil's in the details. So you know, you might look at someone like piaget is a good example, the constructivist that we talked about briefly, man, the guy wrote dozens of books. You can't just summarize those suckers. It's not one coherent theory that you can boil down to 10 axioms and then you can read it while you're flying from Toronto to Montreal and Poof, Europe yet.

Speaker 1:          08:38          And psychologists like it doesn't work like that. The people who make who formulated these theories were extremely intelligent and, and, and they're often great writers and so a lot of the knowledge is actually in the writing itself and nodding what you can extract out from the just, you know, and most of the theorists, Freud Young, it's harder, but freud, rogers, people like that. You can extract out the gist of their theories and then you can, uh, what would you say? You can, you can stereotype it or you can correct your it and then you can point out how your caricatures observed and then you can feel like you're even smarter than Freud, you know, you're not. So it's not a good idea. And so these people should also be approached with respect because man, they have so much to tell you. It's so useful. Okay. So we talked about the depth psychologist.

Speaker 1:          09:29          We talked about the constructivists. We didn't talk about the humanists, the existentialists or phenomenologists a mouthful of words, you know. So let's put a little bit of foundation under those. So if you're a humanist, to be a humanist means really to be a creature of the enlightenment. And a human is thought in some sense, at least this is what the humanists thing. They think of it as post religious, you know, and they, they think of a humanistic thought as putting the value of the human being at the center of the cosmos in some sense, valuing the person as they are. And then also valuing the person that they could be and, and promoting the pathways of development that would allow people to become what they could be as creatures that are valuable in their own right. So a humanist, for example, would be very skeptical of claims.

Speaker 1:          10:25          So let's say standard Christian claims, and I use that example because the realm of ideas that these thinkers emerged out of was almost always Judeo Christian and so you know, their, the roots of their thinking are in those systems and you can't understand their thinking without understanding that. And so part of humanism was a rebellion against the idea that life on earth, so to speak, was of limited value because everything of any importance was going to happen in the afterlife after you die. So it's like, no, it's here and now it's right now that matters. And you know, life in the present is what's important and you don't need some kind of afterlife or some kind of belief in a transcendent reality in order to find value right here and now. So, you know, fine, there's a lot of good things about that idea. And the whole idea that you can improve yourself in some sense is a humanistic idea and most of you have been, how many of you believe that you can improve yourself?

Speaker 1:          11:22          So is there anybody who doesn't believe that it's, that's willing to admit it. So usually people only don't believe that if they're very depressed or hopeless, but it's not self evident, you know, I mean, and in, in many cultures you could think of medieval culture, for example, in Europe where you know, you were sort of stuck in your position. There is no real idea of self improvement. You could try not to sin, but you aren't going to get like radically better in some way. You are just who you were. And that was that. But not, that's not the case for the, the existentialists were kind of a different kettle of fish. So you know, when Freud talks about psychopathology, because a lot of personality is about pathology, right? How personal this can go wrong. Freud kind of thinks of the normal person roughly speaking as healthy in their normality, but perhaps transformed into a pathological version of themselves by some sort of past trauma and that might often be an abusive childhood, you know, or or maybe a sexually abusive childhood because you know Freud talked a lot about that.

Speaker 1:          12:25          It happens fairly frequently, so for Freud, all things considered. If you weren't healthy, there was a reason for it. You know, something terrible that happened to you and you needed to come to terms with that terrible thing. However you might do that and put yourself back together and then you could wander along. Being a healthy person, but the existentialists, that's not how they think at all. They think the standard human being is pathological and the reason they think that is because they think that self conscious existence, so life, the life of a creature that knows it's bounded in time and space, right? Knows it's vulnerable to disease and illness and death and the loss of things that they love and the disintegration of all things in some sense is that's enough of a problem to give you problems. Without having to have been abused by it, and so the existentialists view life itself as a problem of sufficient magnitude that it can destabilize you mentally merely by being aware of it.

Speaker 1:          13:29          And so they also believe that often what people do as a consequence of that is flee from their own awareness, you know, so how do you deal with the fact that life is suffering but you don't think about it? Well, for an existentialist that's not a very good answer. And I would also say generally speaking, for clinical psychologists, that's also not a very good answer because the literature suggests pretty damn strongly that the harder you run from something you're afraid of, the larger it becomes and the faster it chases you. So avoidance of avoidance is generally a very bad strategy. Now it's not always the case because sometimes if you can't do anything about something really you can't. Well there's not a lot of sense spending a lot of time planning and struggling against it. You know, sometimes people are in generally genuinely hopeless situations, but, but often did not.

Speaker 1:          14:21          So I really liked the existentialist man. I think they're. Well, I have all the people that we're going to talk about, their thinking is extraordinarily valuable. It helps situate you in your own life. It helps clarify the nature of your relationship to other people in the world. It helps you lay out what your future could be if you were the creatures that you could be really wonderful phenomenologists. They're tricky bunch. I'm the fundamental phenomenologists was Martin Heidegger, who was also somewhat also somewhat tangled up with the Nazis. Um, you know, which was clearly not a good thing. And you know, people debate about whether or not you can separate out his philosophy from what tangled them up with the Nazis and I think you can, you know. So anyways, heidegger, heidegger learned to take a fresh look at the nature of reality. And so heidegger, his idea was that we, we made a fundamental philosophical era way back when, when we were Greek, ancient Greek, roughly speaking, and that we started concentrating on the wrong elements of.

Speaker 1:          15:32          He didn't read. He doesn't really call it reality being. So a phenomenologist as someone who's concerned with being and you, you might think, well, what's the difference between being in reality? And the answer to that is it. It depends on how you define being and it depends on how you define reality. So heidegger's observation was that for, for for modern people, roughly speaking, reality is sort of a d animated material, objective substrata. It's, it's dead in its essence, roughly speaking, and the things that are most real are precisely those things you can think about that it's all objective reality for all intents and purposes, but when what heidegger tried to point out is there's a choice in some sense because of your knowledge is finite because you're fundamentally ignorant about all things. You have to decide that certain things are true and then act from that point and you know, heidegger's point was there's a lot of things that you can decide about at the very fundamental level of, of axiom and so one of the things you can decide for example, is whether or not the objective world is what's more real or whether or not your lived experience is what's more real now you might think, well what's the distinction there?

Speaker 1:          16:46          And I would say the distinction is probably something like watching someone in pain on a video and being in pain yourself. You know, so pain is a good example of, of an element of being. Because it's obviously it's obviously you experience it within your own.

Speaker 1:          17:08          It's hard to talk about this because he uses different terminology. Pain is an element of your being and it's, it's not something, it's the pain itself is not something that you can even conceptualize in objective terms. Like you can measure it, you know, maybe your heart rate goes up when you're in pain or something like that or your facial expressions change, you know, so you can index it. But the indexes are not the phenomena that's hence phenomenology, right? And so the phenomenologists have built up an entire system of thinking, predicated on the initial axiom that the best way to approach life is to assume that being is the fundamental reality rather than the objective as the fundamental level. And then you might think, well why do people are with that sort of thing? And part of it is one of the. This is an existentialist plate.

Speaker 1:          17:58          One of the consequences of developing the objective theory of existence was obviously all of the amazing technology we have around us and you know, great thank going for that. Otherwise we'd be sitting outside freezing. But one of the consequences of that is once people established objective reality and then defined it as ultimately real terrible questions of the meaning of life or ropes, you know, like if the world, the universe is made out of nothing but dead matter, it's eternally existing. We're nothing but a candle flashing the wind. The idea creeps into your mind that perhaps all of the damn suffering isn't worth it or, or could put it another way. You know, does your life really have any, any real meaning or is that just an illusion? Well, heidegger would say the reason that you have that problem is because you're approaching the entire problem wrong.

Speaker 1:          18:47          Clearly things have meaning. They just don't. If you make the hypothesis, that's what's our objective is ultimately real and everything else is merely a secondary consequence of that. So anyways, it's complicated. It takes a while to get your head around it. I'm the humanists and the existentialists and to some degree the phenomenologists, they all came out of, there was, there was a variety of sources for their thoughts and I would say one of them is the clash between religion and science or between, between value and objective truth. They're trying to, to rectify the division. And Piaget himself was trying to do some of that as well. So it was young I guess. Um, and the other thing is a lot of the existentialist and humanist work was post World War Two. And so, you know, after World War Two happened with its immense catastrophes, of course people who were thinking about human nature, we're very interested in why such a thing could happen and existentialism at least as a psychological school arose in part as a reaction to the horrors of World War Two.

Speaker 1:          19:49          It's a very serious, it's very serious branch of psychology and it was mostly characterized thinking in the 19 fifties before the hippies came along and made everything sweetness and light. So which is more where Roger's and a maslow fit. So we're going to talk about them a fair bit that the three different categories. So it's kind of a strange approach in some sense that this class takes. Because I talked to you about some psychologists in that in that period, but the other people I talked to you mostly about aren't set. They're not technically psychologists. Depends on what you mean by psychologist. After all, I talk a lot about Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and then also a lot about our Russian literary figure. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who wrote a book called the Gulag archipelago, which was one of the. There was a few cataclysmic events that brought the totalitarian system of the Soviet Union to a halt and you can argue about what they were, but one of them for sure, what social needs and published publication of the Gulag Archipelago, which is a 2,700 word book, 2,700 page book.

Speaker 1:          20:55          Can I get that right? That describes what it was like to be there and how many people died and it's a. it's a searing book you want to know about prize and he deserved it. I mean, Solzhenitsyn, a remarkable person. He's like the Dostoevsky of the 20th century and that's really saying something and Dostoevsky is another person I use a lot in that section and both Dostoevsky and niche and regard themselves as psychologists fundamentally. And you know, it's funny because when you think about scientists, you know, usually think about people who are conducting experiments, right? But then one of the things, and you'll notice this, if you think about it, a lot of you have taken a fair number of science courses are of one form or another. And you know, a lot of what you're taught when you're taught how to do science is how to generate, you know, how to lay out an experiment property, how to get the methodology right, how to do the analysis properly, maybe how to structure the, the revealing of your findings and proper scientific format, you know, and how to test a hypothesis.

Speaker 1:          21:58          But one of the things that you never really told about is, well, how the hell do you generate the hypotheses to begin with because you know, really that's at least half the problem and it's probably a lot more than half the problem. And so part of being a scientist is the ability to be a hypothesis generator, not just the hypothesis test or maybe you need to be both to be a true scientist, but, but maybe not. Maybe you can just generate extraordinary hypothesis. And it's certainly the case that people like Dostoevsky Nietzsche were unbelievably good hypotheses. Generators. And so, you know, they're thinking in many ways underlies the entire development of thought. This sort of thought that you guys are going to encounter in university anyways. They're thinking underlies the entire development of the edifice of, I would say both scientific and nonscientific thought across the entire entire 20th century, and so it's quite entertaining to go down there and wander around the roots of these sorts of things because you find out how things are linked together and why they're linked together, how they develop and what that means and also what it means for you to have those ideas and why you have them and what role they play in your life.

Speaker 1:          23:09          So. Okay, so after that, that's pretty much in some sense you might think that's where the clinical and philosophical part of the course ends. Now I'm a clinical psychologist and most of the people who are great personality theorists were clinical psychologists and that explains to some degree wind. The first part of the course is philosophical because the thing about clinical psychologists and psychiatrists and medical doctors for that matter is that they're not exactly scientists. They're more like engineers. So what an engineer to do. They might engineer, might use scientific knowledge and you know, good for them. They should, but really what they want to do is make something changed. They want to build something. They want to transform something. They want to act on the world in a, in a beneficial, generally in a beneficial way. While the same thing as the case with the health domains.

Speaker 1:          24:04          So like someone comes to you with a psychological problem. What you want to do is you want to make it better and better is not a scientific category. So to the degree that you're a practice, like you can say, well, it's scientific because worst means abnormal. It's like that's not right. You can make that case, but it's shallow because there's lots of times when you don't consider normal healthy, you know, you can send her exceptional, healthy, right, or, or maybe you consider exceptional, desirable and desirable. It might even be better than healthy, right? So you can't get out of the value domain when you're trying to interact with people and sort out their lives because partly what you're, what you're always asking is what's wrong? What's the matter? Why are you dissatisfied? Why are you suffering? Why are you productive? Why do you fight with everyone you know, why can't you sleep at night?

Speaker 1:          24:56          Why do you wake up screaming, you know, why can't you pursue anything that's two year old benefit? Why do you hurt everyone that you know, you know, those are moral questions. And then the next problem is, okay, well what are we gonna do about it? What do you want? How would you like your life to look if it could look the way you wanted it to? And then how are we going to get from where you are to that? And those are all their engineering questions in a sense, but above all their ethical questions because they deal with how to act. So you know, I don't want to just slide over that big because that's generally what happens because physicians and clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, even though their physicians, they like to think that what they're doing is science and that's not right. It's informed by science, but that's not the same thing.

Speaker 1:          25:42          It's particularly true with doctors because they're not even trained to be scientists. So. Alright, so that's that. So then the next part of the course, the last half, it's pretty, it concentrates on two elements of personality theory, more modern elements I would say, although not more valuable necessarily because of that I'm partly very neurobiological because we made a lot of strides in the last 5,000 years, let's say, in understanding the, the, the structure and the function of the brain. Like the things we don't know about the brain, man, it's, there are lots of things we don't understand about the brain. We have no idea, for example, what its relationship is to consciousness except that more or less it seems necessary, you know, so all, even even that you can dispute to some degree because they're great case histories of people who were born with hydrocephalus. And so that means that your skull basically fills with water.

Speaker 1:          26:45          And the most famous case of that was a French guy who, uh, went for an Mri for God only knows what reason. It had nothing to do with with what was eventually discovered, but he only had five percent of his cortical tissue is whole brain has all head was full of cerebral spinal fluid and the brain was just a little skin around the side that was like a balloon and as far as they could tell, there was nothing wrong with them. It's like, well, isn't that interesting? What the hell is all the riff that brain for you know? And then you get the other issue. Like, I don't know if you've ever heard of a. can't remember her name. I think it's peppered. She had a famous parent, an African gray. You can look it up talking African gray parrot and that damn parent, man, that thing could talk like a four year old kid.

Speaker 1:          27:31          Way better than any chimpanzee full sentences. It seemed to know what it was doing. It's like it's apparent, right? It's brain is this big. So how is that even possible? So, okay. So there's lots of things we don't know about the brain really. And it's unbelievably complicated. So. But we have learned a lot of things that are interesting. We kind of understand the existence and the location of the fundamental reward and pain and anxiety circuits. That's a big deal. Those are, those are like discovering major continents, you know, we understand to some degree how people learn and under what conditions they learn and we understand, I would say to some degree what the fundamental motivations and emotions are now. Those are not scientific categories, motivations and emotions, their linguistic categories. So what we're stuck with so, but we, we know a fair bit about their underlying neurobiological basis and I want to take you through that in some detail because for a bunch of reasons, partly because it provides a nice scientific underpinning to a lot of the hypotheses and presuppositions of the cycle analysis.

Speaker 1:          28:38          You know, so for example, Freud hypothesized the existence of the end. Now there is no way I didn't your brain, but it doesn't really matter because the ID, the idea of the ID is a functional category. It's like a tool. But there are lots of end like structures in your brain, you know, and one of them in particular is the hypothalamus and that thing like human beings like to think that they're really impressive. Critical cap is the thing that's, you know, in charge of things. But your hypothalamus, which is this little tiny thing that sits at the top of your spinal cord man, that's what's running you and let you know as long as you're not hungry or not angry or not chasing after sexual excitement and not gambling and not addicted. So as long as you're completely well fed and warm and comfortable, then you can think and you're more or less in control.

Speaker 1:          29:27          But as soon as any of those things go as straight it's subcortical all the way you know. And you can see this, for example, in conditions like Anorexia, you know, because the Anorexia, you can think of Anorexia as a war between the cortex and the hypothalamus. And I'll tell you then the only time the cortex winds is when the anorexic dies. Because other than that, it's the hypothalamus that wins all the time. Which is why anorexics cannot stop themselves from bingeing, you know, so they'll, they'll cut their body weight down to say 75 percent of what it should be and that's hard. Like you really, it's not easy to starve yourself like that, but they'll still binge like mad, you know, we need a whole gallon of ice cream and two bags of bread and they can't stop themselves. And that's because your hypothalamus flint would rather you didn't starve to death.

Speaker 1:          30:13          And if you're not paying attention, if you're not on top of the game or maybe if you've been hurt recently and so your resources or your, your, what would you say? You're the negative emotion that's been interfering with your cognitive capacity. The hypothalamus will come up and grab you and say, man, you're hungry and it's off to the fridge with you. You know, so two in the morning, you're going to be eating everything in there in a kind of a daze. And you'll snap out of that and think, wow, what the hell was that? It was like, well that's the end folks. And it's no trivial thing and it's a good thing too because if it didn't tell you what to do all the time, like think about how foolish you are. If you had to breathe voluntarily, how, how many days do you think you'd go through?

Speaker 1:          30:53          And it's like you wake up one day and an hour later you'd forget to breathe and then you'd be dead. So like your, your, your brain doesn't let you do anything important. It takes care of all that in the background, you know, because you're just not that smart. I mean you don't know how to digest things. For example, you actually don't know how you walk even though you can do it. So there are very fundamental subsystem. Some of them that aren't even conscious, weirdly enough, even though they're neurological, they're doing all the heavy lifting and like your cortex is as long they're all along for the ride in some sense. And that sort of things. It's in control. But yeah, no, not really. Okay. So we're going to talk a fair bit about fundamental brain structures and the function of those structures. Because I like functional neuroanatomy.

Speaker 1:          31:39          I like, I don't want to know just what the brain is made out of, but I want to know what all the parts are doing, and so there's difficult papers in there. Swanson, that's a hard paper and the grit paper by gray, those are papers that were written by I think genius level neuropsychologists and you know, they put their whole life's work into a paper and so you know, you shouldn't pick it up. You're going to think, wow, this is hard. It's like, yeah, some genius spent 30 years writing it. It's going to be hard, but they're so informative. They're worth the struggle if, if that's the sort of thing you want to struggle with. So that's the biological end. And then there's the psychometric ended site, psychometrics, very unpopular field of psychology even amongst psychologists. And the reason for that is that psychometric nutrition's I guess have actually discovered things and people hate what they've discovered.

Speaker 1:          32:30          So and no wonder. So for example, it was people who do psychometrics, engineers actually who in, who entered psychology, who discovered intelligence, technical psychometric intelligence, Iq. And people will tell you there's lots of kinds of intelligence. It's like, no, there aren't. That's wrong, and it's wrong in this way. The statistics that psychologists use were invented by the people who discovered Iq, and that means every single thing that a psychologist has ever claimed that's been verified in some way using some statistical process has been verified, verified the same way that I knew was verified. And so you don't get to say, well, the ICU stuffs in valid without saying all of psychology and a lot of other fields is invalid too because it's the same methods of proof. And it's even worse than that because like the relationship between Iq and life success is way stronger than the relationship between almost any other psychological phenomena and almost anything else.

Speaker 1:          33:28          So for example, for you guys even know, you know, you're, you're all far above average in intelligence because otherwise you wouldn't be here like at least 80, fifth percentile. And that's something to think about because a lot of that is determined by biological factors. You know. So a huge chunk of the reason that you're here is because you know, you won the genetic lottery, so like hooray for you and no one's screwed it up too badly as you were growing up, you know, but even among you guys, that correlation between your intelligence and your and your grade point average is quite high even though it's a truncated sample, right? Because you're all pretty bright and even though there's a lot of error in the grade measurement system because it doesn't only index intelligence, it's still very powerful. And so the one, the peep, if you, if you controlled for conscientious ness and other elements of personality, which you can do statistically in 20 years, that the 10 percent of the people in this room who have the highest Iq is, will have the highest income virtually.

Speaker 1:          34:25          Certainly, you know, unless some terrible thing happens to them, you can overcome it to some degree if you're really hardworking because then that's conscientiousness, you know, and that. But that's also a trait which seems to have quite a heavy biological loading so well. So that's the sort of thing that people hate about psychometricians because they come up with these facts and there are facts that are really dismal and I can give you an example. So, so you guys all have an Iq of over 150, roughly speaking. 100 makes you about as smart as the typical high school reading 115. That's kind of the low end for, for managing the rigors of a, a fairly high end university. You know, 1:15, you're still going to have a lot of trouble, you're going to have to work like mad. So, but okay, so 150. Now that's one standard deviation above the mean.

Speaker 1:          35:19          One standard deviation below the mean is an Iq of 85. Now there's just as many people out there in the world who have an Iq of 85 as there are people who are able to go to college. Okay? So then you think, what can you do if you have an Iq of 85 and. Well, here's one answer. So the US army has been doing psychometric testing for 100 and some years. Um, for a whole bunch of reasons, but they've done a lot in the basic science, you know, and uh, one thing about the u s army is they like to have recruits and you can understand why because do you really want to go off somewhere and get shot? And the answer to that is generally no. So it's not like there were people lining up to get into the army even in peace time.

Speaker 1:          36:01          It's hard to get people. And also the Americans have used the US army as a, you know, imagine you have a, an underclass of people who aren't doing very well, which is the case in every society and you want to boost some of them up, you know, into something resembling the middle class. You can do that fairly effectively by inducting the young men in particular into the army because they get some training, you know, they get some discipline and maybe they can kind clamber up into the middle class. And so there's a lot of policy reasons. A why the American army or enforces want people and be, you know, just to be in the army. But also for social reasons, positive social reasons, so they're not likely not to let you in the the consequences of 100 years of Iq testing was the PR was the establishment of a law in the United States.

Speaker 1:          36:49          You cannot induct anyone into the army, cannot accept them into the army. If they have an Iq of less than 82, that's 10 percent of the population. So you think about that. That means one person in 10 cannot do anything that is a positive value in an organization. It's rather complex, but not more complex than other organizations. That's desperate for people. Nothing they can offer has positive value. It's worse to have them in the army than not to have them there at all. Really. Now you know that that's a terrible way of putting it, but it's not. It's a horrible. It's a horrible statistic because it also means, you know, if you think about the army as roughly equivalent to the world in some sense, in terms of its complexity, it means that there's 10 percent of the population who just cannot really exist. Well in a complex cognitive society.

Speaker 1:          37:43          So you might say, well, you know, something should be done about that. It's like good luck. People had been trying to do something about that for a very long time. There's been billions, if not trillions of dollars poured into attempts to do cognitive remediation in the United States. Not to mention that we actually have an education system and the cool is actually make people smarter. So we're going to talk a lot about psychometrics. And the thing about the psychometricians is they're basically brute force statisticians in some ways they're atheoretical, you know, and they use computer power roughly speaking and advanced statistical techniques to look at large data sets and extract out patterns. And you know, I was, I hated the big five when I first came on it. I thought, Oh God, this is boring. It's like there's no theory behind it. It's not prescriptive, it's not interested in any literary manner.

Speaker 1:          38:33          Like it doesn't have a good story. Um, it came out of, it's so dry, but you know, it works. And, and that's, that's how it is. So we're going to spend a lot of time on psychometrics and you know, my lab two has done a fair bit of work over the last 10 years elaborating out the big five models. So one of the things we'll talk about is the big 10 model and what it does roughly speaking, is break each of the five into two, we call them aspects and they're pretty interesting like they predict political belief for example, quite nicely. So conservatives tend to be more orderly, which is part of conscientiousness and less creative, less open and liberals tend to be more open and less conscientious, which a cynic would say. That's why they're so into income redistribution because they actually don't work.

Speaker 1:          39:23          So you know, the conservatives work like mad and the liberals say, hey, how about some of that money, you know, the system is unfair. And the Conservatives say, well no, we worked hard and we're not giving you any. Well, you know, they both have flaws in their theories. But liberals by the way, make very good entrepreneurs like. No, let me rephrase that. Most entrepreneurs are liberal in their political outlook and that's because they're high in openness. So the way it really seems to work is that liberal minded people start businesses and conservatives run the. So they're necessary for one another. Yeah. Well, because the liberals being open, they're often the next idea, you know, and they don't want to attend to the damn details. They get bored by that. They're not particularly orderly, you know, but once you've established a process and it works, you need someone to watch to make sure the process keeps working well, that's not very interesting if you're a creative person. So. Okay, so that's basically that. That's the course. So now what are we doing time here?

Speaker 1:          40:30          So I think what I'll do now is I'm going to tell you a story and you're going to think it has absolutely nothing to do with what we've been talking about, but it. But that's okay. That's okay. So I picked this weird picture. It's the picture of Jonah Biblical character, so 2,500 year old story. So that's a pretty old story. And generally if a story is 2,500 years old, it's a lot older than that, you know, it's just happened to be written down 2,500 years ago. But no, that long ago it wasn't like there were novels and books and that you could find 50 different stories, you know, at your fingertips. There were a few stories and everyone knew them and God only knows how long they been around, but it was a very, very, very, very long time. So this was written down 2,500 years ago.

Speaker 1:          41:22          But we don't really have any idea how old it is. And in some sense it's, it's almost infinitely old at least on any human scale. Now you see this picture and what you see is this thing that, what would you call it? Well, it's a medieval idea of a whale is what it is. You know, when you might think, well that isn't really what a whale looks like and that's kind of right. But a medieval Wale wasn't the whale that we have. Like whale in medieval times meant large, terrifying underwater thing, you know? And so maybe that was maybe a giant squid was a whale and the whale was a whale in the shark was a whale, you know, the categories not to save. So that kind of accounts for the. That in pure ignorance is what accounts for the kind of strange mythologized representation. But it's still a representation of something. It's just a little generalized. Now what he's doing is vomiting Jonah up onto dry land. So. And you think that's pretty damn weird. How many of you have Seen Pinocchio? That's a lot. Hey, how many of you haven't really. You Haven't Seen Pinocchio? What kind of parents did you have? Anything?

Speaker 1:          42:35          Okay, Well Are you Remembering Pinocchio? Pinocchio. Father stuck in, away away. And then Pinocchio asked to go down there and rescue them. And one of the things you didn't notice when you were watching Pinocchio is just how daft that is. There you are sitting there, you're watching a puppet go down into the ocean to rescue his father from a whale. And you think that makes sense. It's like, well, so that's interesting. Right? That's interesting. Why does that make sense? Why does that make sense? Because it doesn't make any sense, but, but, but see, that's a, that's a good example of the grip of an archetypal idea because in archetipal ideas a very deep and old idea that makes sense to you even though if someone points out to you that you believe it, which more or less do while you're watching the movie you think, Oh yeah, it's really weird that I believe that's like kill and that isn't a puppet going down into the ocean to rescue his father from a whale either.

Speaker 1:          43:33          Just so you know it. It's a drawing of a puppet going down into the ocean to rescue is far from a whale. So it's like divorced from reality, my life in all sorts of ways. But what's so interesting is you go into the theater and watch something like that there. If someone taps you on the shoulder and say, Hey, do you know what you're doing? You say, why don't you shut up and let me watch the movie. Right? You don't notice. Oh yes. I'm very peculiar. Very peculiar thing sitting here watching this and not noticing how strange I am, you know, and so, well, that's partly why I'm going to tell you this story because. Because it's true even though it isn't, you know, and that's, that's a funny thing. I had a very, very strange professor at the University of Alberta. He died a few years ago. He got on a bus, I think it was in Winnipeg and he never got off the bus and no one ever saw him again.

Speaker 1:          44:25          So he had, he'd been a prison psychologist. He worked in the maximum security prison in University of Alberta. So who maybe he met one of his old clients, you know, it's possible, but it's very strange. Very strange ending. Anyways, one time we were talking about fiction, you know, and he said, uh, he said fiction is a lie that can tell you the truth. That's a very interesting way of thinking about it, you know, because you read fiction and you know it's true, but it's not obviously because it's not really about a thing that actually happened, but it's more than that some ways because if it's good fixture it's about a whole bunch of things that happened sort of like that. Right? It's a distillation. It's like someone tells you a long story and then you know, you, you, you talked to your partner and they asked you what was that all about and then you tell them in two sentences what it was about.

Speaker 1:          45:18          You boil it down to the just, right. Well a really good story is the gist of something and some of the really old stories, the really weird ones like Jonah and the whale for example, which as I said is, is told to some degree in the story of Pinocchio there, the gist of a lot of things and people have been boiling those damn stories down for, for a very, very, very, very, very, very long period of time. Thousands of people over thousands of years and they come up with these weird stories that people remember and then people think, well, they're real. It's like, yeah, they are, but they're not real. The way of scientific story is real. It's a different kind of real. So here's, here's the story of Jonah.

Speaker 1:          46:02          So it's an old Jewish story. There's probably a very intimidating in the Korean, but I don't know that variance. So, and maybe there isn't. Anyways, Joe Lives in 500 BC and uh, God has a chat with them one day and he says, look, Jonah there, there's this city, Nineveh, and the people there, you know, they're really not on the straight and narrow and things are going to go to hell in a handbasket very rapidly if someone doesn't do something about that. So I think that you should go to Nineveh and you should tell the king and all the people that are there that are really there, they're just not doing the right thing. And Jonah being a perfectly intelligent person says, you want me to go to a city and you want to go meet me to tell the king like this authoritarian die who has absolute power of everything, that there's something wrong with what he's doing, that all of the citizens are corrupt.

Speaker 1:          46:53          That's what you want me to do. And Jonah says, there's no way I'm doing that because as I said, he's a smart guy. So he runs off and he goes to this town and and as he's reading off, he rents a boat more or less than it's big boat. And there's fishermen and they're gonna like him somewhere. God can't find them, which is not going to be an easy thing. And so god of course cannot be fooled by such relatively poorer strategic choices because he's omniscient and all that. So he's out on the water Jonah and there's the fisherman there. And then some God calls up this big storm and up. The fishermen are shorting out about this and because they're going to swamp the boat and then they're all going to die and they're not that happy about that. So what they decided to do is throw everything overboard so that the boat is lightened, but that doesn't help much because the storm gets worse.

Speaker 1:          47:38          And so then all of them start praying. They all have different gods. So you know, it's like a little God competition. One fishermen talks to one God, another fisherman talks to another God and nothing's happening. So Joe and it happens to be asleep in the hold of the ship. Now he's already told them that he's been running from his God and so they think, ha, we'd better go wake up Jonah because maybe he's the guy that's causing all the trouble. So they'd go down there and they wake them up and they asked him about his God and he says, well, my God made the heavens and the earth and their gods, they weren't doing anything that magnificence. So they're pretty freaked out about this. And so they tell Jonas like, what the hell are you running away from this guy for it? It's not a good idea.

Speaker 1:          48:17          And Jonah says, yeah, yeah, I'm sure it's my fault that this storm has come up. So why don't you just throw me over and they say, well, we can't really do that because you know, you shouldn't run away like that, but you're not a murderer or anything, we can't just toss you over. And so they decided to try to row to shore, but God's not having any of that. So he raises up a big storm and it's getting worse and worse. And finally the fishermen say, Oh, you know, over you go in, join is into that because he knows he's a bad guy and so away all swallows them. Now you think, hmm, that's probably not exactly right because first if a whale swallowed you, then you'd be dead. And it was probably a shark anyways. It's not like you're going to be driving down there.

Speaker 1:          48:55          It's not a big cavern. Like, you know the Pinocchio Whale, it's, it's solid and there's no oxygen. So your dad. But that isn't what happens. Jonah's in the whale. And he's Kinda freaked out by this because now he's in a whale and there's a storm in God's angry at him. So the first thing he does is pray and tell God what an idiot he isn't, that he'd like to be forgiven, and so the whale zips up to shore and vomit some onto the beach, which is the very, very undignified mode of arriving anywhere. So, so that's, that's the Jonah Story. And then of course Jonah picks himself up and he thinks, yeah, yeah. You know, that wasn't so good. It was a little rough. I think maybe I'm going off to Nineveh to tell the ninevites or whoever they were that they're just not living properly because that's a lot better than making God angry, you know, because what with the storms and the fishermen and the whales and all that.

Speaker 1:          49:45          So then he goes off to Nineveh and he tells them what's going on in it seems to more or less work. So. So that's a very interesting story and you think, well, how did people believe that? Me? And one question might be, well, do you believe that story? And then you think, well no, but then you think, well maybe that's more complex question than you might think because it turns out that I believe the Pinocchio Story. And you say, well no, I didn't really believe it. And then I would say, well it kind of depends on what you mean by bleed, doesn't it? Because you watched it and while you were watching it, man, you were into it, you understood it, you didn't want it to be disrupted, you followed it. So it's like, did you believe it? No. You were like a four year old skeptic sitting there thinking, well, you know, pop it whale.

Speaker 1:          50:31          No, it doesn't add up. You're not. You're acting out your belief in it by being engaged in it. And if someone taps you on the shoulder and wakes you up 30 years later, 20 years later you say, oh no, I don't believe that. It's like, you know, it's kind of remarkable what you'll believe. You know, how many of you are star wars? Like Aficionados? No, you won't admit it, will you? But there's lots of you in here. I know. You know. And so that's all mythology, all mythology, you know, that of course the person who, uh, what was his name, the guy who came up with star wars idea, Lucas Lucas was a student of Joseph Campbell. Joseph Campbell was a psychologist slash mythologist. And The star wars stories are updated mythology, just like Harry Potter and all the other things that capture people's imagination. So you bloody well do believe this. And there's a reason for it to now. What time is it now? We'll stop there. I'll tell you the reason. The next time we meet.
