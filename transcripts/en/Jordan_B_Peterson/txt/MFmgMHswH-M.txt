Speaker 1:          00:00:44       So you're all wondering what your papers, no doubt they are. Mark do I have no, um, I'll leave the papers outside my office on my bench. Hopefully tomorrow morning. I am struck hypothesis about the relative value of things including the self and others. But this might not make sense. It's pretty complicated idea. What pages are going, don't you, don't you have that memorized?

Speaker 2:          00:01:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       Anyways, they're simpler. One 31 30 middle of the first power. Oh yes, yes. Okay. Okay. So we haven't, well, things get complex here rapidly, so that's what we're going to do at first a little bit is do some brick capitulation so everyone knows where we are before we go somewhere new. I'm trying to convince you of the notion that when we model our experience, we're coming up with two different kinds of models, which are usually conflated. We don't, we're not really clear about the difference between, one is a map of fact and that map it's construction has construction of that map has been formalized as the scientific endeavor. The map itself is the sum total of scientific knowledge. Science is how we generate our knowledge about. Fact, and I'm sort of in that fact, is consensually apprehensible phenomena or its pattern of transformation because science is not only interested in clarifying the nature of objects, who also wants to be able to tell how one object, how an object changes into something else over time.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       As Einstein pointed out in the quote that I provided by him were generally used to regarding that sort of phenomenon has real Einstein wasn't a philosopher of science. I think it was obviously a great scientist and at the very least his quotation who talks about the consensually validatable properties or things describes the manner in which people conduct science under normal circumstances. That's what we think we're doing and there's a different kind of map and that's a map not of fact about things, but about what those things signify for behavior. And I mean for motor output, what they signify for what you should do when you're around them, when you encounter them. And we don't really understand that map very well. We don't naturally, I don't think we naturally think of it as sort of a separable phenomena. It strikes me that you can make a reasonable case that it's actually the type of map that proceeded the formal development of of science because we like animals are primarily concerned with how to act rather than with what is in fact.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       And if you understand that, then you can answer some questions that otherwise remain somewhat mysterious. For example, how do you know when you're right about something and a fundamental basis, you're never bragged about anything because wherever you look, there's an infinite number of mysteries, at least from the factions. They tend not to disturb you. And it is the case that we have placed implicit faith in the notion that we know things and that what we know is sufficient even though we know that what we know isn't sufficient in the final analysis, not only is it wrong, but it's sufficiently wrong. So that over the course of centuries and transformed itself into something that's often even unrecognizable but it, but it still strikes us as knowledge and that's because I think we think we know something when acting on that knowledge. We produce results that we want and that's sufficient.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       If you get from point a to point b using procedures, see, then you're convinced that you're right because that's it. That's right enough and that's our criteria. Antonio Damacio for example, he just wrote a new book called Descartes' error, big carts era being, I think therefore I am. It makes, it was pointing out that people with damage to the prefrontal cortex start to lose the ability to make decisions, to decide between trivial things like when or to decide to reveal things. Not necessarily just between like when you throw out old newspapers or which restaurant to to you don't sum total all the facts about given a given restaurant and everything you can think about it and then contrast that restaurant with all conceivable restaurants. When you go up to eat the process, it's pretty automatic and amaze. You aren't used it. We do it by recourse to emotion. The frontal lobes help us determine what our emotions are. Say, define it. As a consequence. We can eliminate vast swaths of material that would just sort of clog up our cognitive faculties otherwise. But the thing is,

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       knowing a little bit about how stories work, how are we paused? Our ideal futures and how we move towards them instantly gives you some insight into how it is that we determined that we actually know something and when we say we know something we basically need, our knowledge is sufficient to get us from point a to point b. And that's enough. That's that that keeps us in the expected role. It keeps our emotions regulated. And I would say that the purpose of knowledge is to regulate emotion. That's what you have at four so I mean you're always engaged in the endeavor to increase. Well, this is right. This is kind of a behaviorist way of looking at it, but it's sufficiently accurate so that it's useful. You want to live in a world where there's lots of hope for the future, but where you're satisfied all in all, or at least you're working to maximize your satisfaction, you also want to avoid anxiety to the degree that that's possible within the context of maximizing hope and satisfaction. And also this same goes for pain. They're always trying to regulate your emotions. In fact, the reason we modify the external world is to regulate our emotions. We tend to think that emotional regulation is actually a psychological processes, right? Calm down, bring your cell phone under control. That's only true in the most trivial of circumstances almost all the time. What we do to regulate our emotions is to change things around us with our behavior so that we're satisfied more or less with the manner in which our limbic system is conducting itself, motivates our behavior.

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       It kind of knowledge that you have that enables you to act so what you want appears, I'd call that. That's what we're, that's what we're contrast on this class. I guess the domain of pathology, that's how wisdom is transmitted, not factual knowledge. Wisdom is how to act so that you get no one only. It's not really so that you get what you want it. That's a really simple way of looking at it and saw that your emotions remain regulated, stable over time in a situation and it's primarily composed of others who are doing the same thing. Cool. Who all have to act, including you in a manner so that that stable regulation is flexible enough so that it can update itself wouldn't necessarily across time. So there's a lot of constraints that have to be satisfied in order for your solution to the regulation of your emotions to be considered optimal.

Speaker 2:          00:08:50       When you talk about how to act in any given situation, it sounds as if I only think of social

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       situations I'm talking about because most of our environment is a social environment. Most of what I consider my environment is is you and everyone else that I can offer. You want to know how to ask as well. I would, I would say look, okay, that's a perfectly reasonable question. I would say wisdom is an abstraction of behavioral low, so I wouldn't say necessarily, but knowing how to open up the box of the computer and fix whatever particular electronic park happens to be followed up constitutes wisdom. But I would say that, but usually what happens if your computer falls up is that you don't know what to do. But what you do know is how to figure out what to do. And basically what you do when you're trying to fix a computer based on the presumption that you can fix it, which is like the presumption that leads the whole behavior is to hold everything constant and very one things, right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       You engage in a process of trial and error list. That's the bonding towards solving the problem. And I would say being able to engage in the maneuvers that allows you to generate the specific answer to the problem. That's pretty much akin to wisdom. So, so I mean that's the computer, it's a little different because the computers, the computer computer is a bit peculiar though because it's an artificial environment in that it's it, it isn't something I've infinite to flexibly in a sense, at least at the level at which you want to interact with it. It's a finite domain. So a real standard set of problem solving techniques can be applied to it. So yeah. Yeah. So the computer, while the computer is probably the only part of the University of actually who works exactly as you predicted would from the scientific perspective. So we will, if there's not a lot of them remaining mystery. So it was just the mirror you freeze. Yeah. The first time. Especially if you're doing something at court and then you sort of fee then don't you need a strategy to allay your anxieties, which is calling the help number. That's recourse to authority. Yeah, that's a comfort mode and promise all.

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       That's true. That's true. I would say I would still, I would say that the process of generating solutions is more akin to wisdom than the actual, their knowledge of any specific solution. And that sort of without actually serves as a good introduction to the internal things we want to talk about today. Okay. So anyways, so I was, I was summing up reiterating the distinction between the domain of myth and the domain of science making the additional point and that mythology is both, it's the story we tell about our wisdom and it's also our means of transmitting it basically in the same can be said about narratives in any sort of specific examples of more general myths. So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:02       okay. Well then,

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       okay, the next question that pops up is before the second, the next question that pops up, isn't it? Well, if you can, you can conceive of the world as a collection of objects and that transformation, but we're not doing that. We're conceiving of the world as a place to conduct action in. And so then the next question is, if you conceive of the world as a place in which to act, what's the structure of it? And it's strikes me that you can determine the structure by contrast and myths and seeing, picking out their commonalities. There's a bit more to it than that because there are creationists and creation myths explicitly statement. What you're dealing with is a description of the genesis of the world. So it's also a natural natural field of inquiry for mythologies. And what I have been attempting to describe, it's my summary, I guess, of these various myths and the world that they portrayed and the mythological world has basically has three constituent elements. You could say four. There's the chaos that precedes the construction of anything and that's representative as their gross has the dragon that eats its own tail as the winged serpent and the winged serpent is similar [inaudible] a creature of spirit, and that was the sky as the masculine world and a creature of matter. That's the feminine world.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       Masculine world has two aspects. One is more akin to spirit speaking traditionally, and the other is more akin to the patriarchal structure to the great father. The masculine world is both the process by which knowledge is generated and that dual image. That's why, for example, in the Egyptian mythology that surrounds the Pharaoh, the live pharaoh is simultaneously ocirus and horace. Oh, seriousness of Syrah stands for the state as a historical entity. That's one way of looking at it. And Horace stands for the process by which that state is updated and generated and the live pharaoh in so far as he's doing his job is both the dead steak and the process by which the dead state is regenerating. Remember when horace goes to the underworld to find his father was blind and living a sort of a semi vegetative life. After he, after you become seth, by the way he gives him, he gives him his eye and that brings them back up the surface, so to speak.

Speaker 1:          00:14:38       Well, now you know what that story means. That's a very common story. That's the myth of the rebirth. That became basically part of the hero's journey. He saw a little bit of that echoed in Nokia. Really kind of a peculiar place to find those serious and chorus. I think if you think about, it's kind of hard to figure out how that might have come about unless you're willing to entertain them. Like one consistent, some of these images we're going to do get saved and passed around and all sorts of bizarre forums. So Remember Pinocchio to be the true hero, which meant to be real, which meant to be born again. He no, he not only had to go into the belly of the whale, that's the unknown your boroughs, but he had to save his father, couldn't just abandon it and save himself. He had to bring the culture along with.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       It does, that's a really potent story if you think, and obviously true sincere culture protects you to abandon it or to him to fail it when it needs help, so to speak means to turn your back on precisely the thing that protects you from things that you understand so poorly that you don't even know they're there. So I remember in the hall, but this isn't the Hobbit, it was very popping in the 60s I mean it's a myth. The hobbit saw live in a kingdom that it's threatened by vague forces from outside. Their little people, among them are large people who they call the striders and the strategy has looked like vagabonds and they patrol the perimeter of the hobbits kingdom, sort of unknown to the hobbits, but they're the mythical ancestors, like the hobbits have a fair amount of contempt for them actually thinking of them as traps, but they're actually the forces that keep the unknown.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       The vague. I've known at bay so thoroughly that the hobbits don't even know that it's there really well. That's the position that we're in. I mean, that's one of the things I want to convince you out, so to speak. In the commerce of this class, there's the remnants of the old kingdom, right? And the remnants of the old kingdom. Absolutely. They're the ancestral powers. There are lots of cultures worship their ancestors, erect stone monuments to the for example, so they don't forget all the ancestors. It's easy for ancestors as well to turn into gods. In fact, that's what ancestors do over time is they turned into cost and we added points out, for example, that among our key people, and that in this context means people without a written tradition, when people who only transmit information orally, historical events get transformed into mythological events when they pass out of living memory, which is to say when the last person who's alive that remembers the event dies, then that event is immediately in a sense remembered as an event that took place in the unspecified time that preceded the construction of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       And I think the reason for that is is that you don't want to burden your memory. All you want to remember is the things that are important and we're talking about remembering things say over the course of 25,000 years, all of the unnecessary information that gets burdened away and all that's left is the core pattern of information that any historical event worthy of note necessarily contains when we consider an event historical. This is part of the reason why history, so he sits on the boundary between pathology and science in a sense to consider an event worthy of historical note necessarily has to contain elements of your own mythology because otherwise if it didn't contain an element of conquering the unknown, for example, we would never regarded as sufficiently valuable to even relegate to the domain of necessary fat. This is troublesome for history because study of history is supposed to be formalized into Sam's.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       This is a big, big problem in history of generals. Historical stories are told from within cultural perspectives. It would be awesome example of that is how you conceive of Columbus if you're a European side. Traditional York painting the standards story four years ago was no, Columbus was a hero conquered new territory. Columbus. By the way, this is a historical fact. Columbus was in fact looking for paradise when he went out on his missions. That was his express motivation. He thought like many people of his time, that the paradise described in the Old Testament was an actual location on earth that perhaps could still be found somewhere. Columbus hypothesized that paradise could be found in the domain of the unknown. You never, the medieval maps, there's vaguely defined territory with terrible monsters surrounding and Love Columbus presume that paradise could be found in the domain of the unknown and now anyway, conflating a mythological viewpoint of the world with with the actual word, but it's very peculiar because of course, even from the perspective of pure fact, even though we wouldn't regard that has an accurate description, it is the case from the mythological perspective that paradise still does reside out in the unknown because the only way you can ever get there is to explore it and constantly regenerate new information.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       So in a sense he was wrong, but he was also, he was also right. It depends on your framework interpretation. Anyways, the problem is that reading of Columbus is necessarily in contrast with the reading of Columbus, for example, that might appear more natural to the North American Indians. So it's hard to, it's hard to figure out the appropriate historical perspective or two. And if you, if you separate all the facts from the fiction so to speak, the problem then becomes that the facts are dead and you end up in the position of having to memorize endless states and lists of places that will learn, embed themselves in your memory because they have no significance for behavioral output, which is what students need when they say, why is it necessary for us to learn this? And this dude is then say, for me, this holds no intrinsic interest. And they're saying because my limbic system is intelligent enough to discriminate between information that it has the potential to impact my behavior or the way I framed the world and that which does not have that capacity.

Speaker 1:          00:21:16       And since I only have a limited time, I should probably attend to what's important. And generally what we mean by what is important is what will actually change the way we conduct ourselves if we learn it. This is something that we seem to have either never quite figured out or forgotten or I think much of education is that the purpose of education, the purpose of facts even is to aid the generation of wisdom and if it fails to produce that end then it's useless. It's worse than useless, it's just, it's, it's, it's noise, that's all. So we don't have a formalized method for the transmission of wisdom and we've forgotten the domain in which it's transmitted and we know a lot about fact is that another person's worst nightmare, nightmare. And different cultures share different stories to such an extent that like one person can be seen as like more cultures constantly at war, each other every day has it. The whole thing has become so did that we all recognize like one basic, well I guess it depends on what you mean by everyday. I mean there's been more than 150 wars since the end of World War II.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       So that's mean which we consider in a, in a sentence the last war. Well with certain exceptions, Obviously Korea and Vietnam, certainly large conflicts of the sword you described do occur all the time. And the other thing that needs to be taken into consideration is that wars can be conducted at many levels of analysis. It's like one of the, one of the advantages to being able to abstract ideas is that we can have a war that proceeds at the abstract, that domain without unnecessarily unnecessarily degenerating into physical conflict, which means that there's at least the possibility that if you hold one in theological stamps, which means that you ascribe one meaning to an object and I ascribe another meeting that we can discuss it and fight and conduct the war in words. And as a consequence come to an agreement, which I suppose might be considered the construction of annuity Ologie or doing the film without necessarily having to allow the process to cascade back down behavior where the we're forced determines. Okay, so what is peace then? Like? Like what is like, it's just like a lack of social aggression like out now battling it out with this. Is that like are just like just contending ourselves, didn't speak verbally at each other's throats? Is that the best we can do? Right. Well that, well that's a perfectly reasonable question. I guess the question is what attitude most most essentially characterizes the attitude piece.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       I saw one time when I was in Montreal and I saw a 19 year old guy standing on the street in an outdoor shopping mall. Here's a big character, tough luck. You had a punk haircut and a leather jacket and he was standing on the corner holding your pink shopping bag full of something. I thought, all right, sorry. He looked somewhat in the RV and I suspect that he thought he looked the same way holding this up and I thought you look at someone like that will be aware of their capacity for aggression on the outside of their skin where everyone can see it, but there's no domain for its proper expression. So people in that situation ended up doing things that are essentially inserted, like working in seven 11 for example, standing up at quarter of a shopping mall to pink shopping bag in there.

Speaker 1:          00:25:09       Harrison, what are the things that you might wonder under those circumstances is that, is there any way that you could construct an attitude towards peace that was sufficiently difficult and aggressive that it would satisfy someone who's in that particular position? We tend to think of on that as a state, as a default condition I suppose as the state then rains when nothing is necessarily happening. Strikes me that in order to make peace and attractive proposition has to be demonstrated incontrovertibly in a sense that it's actually a more dangerous and interesting answer. War War I think I understand now different perceptions of wisdom meaning like different ways of regulating emotions and the fact that cultures regulate emotions know differently than many of the societies. Yeah. Maintain order and yeah, they like the motions like I, cause I was thinking about wisdom and I was like, well that's kind of a subjective term.

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       Like you may, I think of your wisdom is dysfunctional, you know? Whereas I think the mind is functioning, handle things to regulate your emotions. It may not be the truth, the truth, so it's an war being fought because of different in those are placed here. Right, and that's why. Right. Okay. Okay. I mean you can, you can push the argument down a level of analysis even insane which basically the point of this particular quote that our maps determined in the meaning of objects in our, in our spiritual field, so to speak, and wherever there's a difference. Wherever you presume that this object has a different implication for your behavior, what can I do or for our mutual behavior, love what's in its presence. Then there's an unknown right there and there's also instant room for conflict because you can only do well. This is not always the case, but it's frequently the case that only one set of behavioral outputs can be manifested in any particular situation.

Speaker 1:          00:27:19       That's certainly the case for an individual. I mean that's why you have to solve your problems is because you can't do two things at the same time. You can only do one thing. So this is going back only long ways. I'm curious that you tend to refer to the domain of methods, the men that we have forgotten because it seems to me that if we were to know it, if we were to know it now, we would know it in a way that we never could have known it before. Yes, it's not exactly, I forgotten there was that. It was now in a home. It was the whole way in which we now know was built out of that and that's behind. So it didn't do it because I never know how well I think that's, that's a reasonable, but that's a perfectly reasonable way of looking at it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:08       Except I would say that there's one more twist to that, Matt, is that at a defined time in the past, and I would say starting approximately 500 years ago, when the scientific methodology really came into its own, we made the mis attribution that we did in fact understand what we had never understood. And not only that we didn't understand it, but we understood it thoroughly enough to know that it was no longer a valid form of knowledge and that we could safely discarded as superstition or as, as a primitive form of science and move into the future. But it seems to me that there was never a point at which we said, well, we said what we were doing and Ben was silliness. And what we were doing now is the, is the road, uh, to understand that. All right, thank you. I have a real problem. Jerry Hagen and I borrow your class. Go down. It's just

Speaker 3:          00:29:13       objects. You see as soon as you mess with the object, because it's mapped in accordance with this mythological structure, you instantly start to wreak havoc on the whole structure that determines the appropriate, the appropriate behavior of books. So we know already what that structure inhibits. It inhibits, well, one of the things that inhibits his anxiety. One of the things that you may have found doing, by the way, when this unexpected occurrence, the roads was doing something that children do when they don't know what to do, which is called referencing. Oh, if a child does something unexpected, say it drops a glass of milk on the floor, the first thing it will do is look at its mother or whichever it all happens to be present because the unexpected is just revealed itself, which is to say that an event that occurred contrary to plan emerge, it's indeterminate insignificance, although it evokes anxiety.

Speaker 3:          00:30:19       The fastest way to get rid of the anxieties to reference, which is that you look at your parent and you watch your parents actions and the parent's actions determined the actual significance of the event, thus reducing its infinite significant. So to speak to a definable category. And what you have to understand for children is, and I think this is true anyways, even if the parent is angry, the definite anger is better than the in determinant significance. Well, children, that's why children prefer order to chaos even if it's relatively straight door. Anyways, um, set of questions. So you're dying dominance hierarchy. I don't know. I don't understand what we were talking about. You're talking about the, the, the, um, the meaning of the projector to you as opposed to the meaning of the projector to him that had a conflict. Absolutely. No, but not only the meaning of the projectors so to speak, but everything that the, the dispute implied say about relative importance of pursuit.

Speaker 3:          00:31:21       Like in an institution like this, there's at least a, um, what would you say? There's at least the theory of equality of access to certain things at, at any number of levels, like access to audio, visual equipment. You know, the fact that someone's been around here longer than me, for example, it has no bearing in theory and in actuality under almost all conditions on their access to things like audio, visual equipment. So when being comes in here and says, you know, despite what you're doing and the fact that you followed the rules, someone who's senior so to speak, wants this and that's that. So there's a lot of information in that sort of interaction about relative importance and not just relative importance off of that projector, but of the parties who were engaged in negotiation for the projector anyways, with regards to referencing, I was wondering like you can think back about your own reactions.

Speaker 3:          00:32:18       Do you look around, did you look around when that was going on to see how other people responded and because that's, that's a way of coming up. That's a way of trying to instantly acquire consensus. It's right. What the Hell's going on? I don't know. Maybe some of these other people know all look at them. I can tell by their facial reactions are their patterns of behavior, what this event might signify. That's exploratory behavior. You're exploring the environment but the environment, many cases is composed of other people. In fact, the most important part of the environment is composed of other people and when we have a map of the environment who were mapping is other people in relationship to herself and and vice versa. So that's referencing you poached. You pushed him like you wouldn't back up. I thought, I mean you could have considered again in the fight as well.

Speaker 3:          00:33:04       That seems like that's the other, that's the other purpose or the demonstration is that if I have a map and you have a map and they and they conflict with regards to a particular object, then which happens very frequently. Then one of the things that's interesting to do is to consider the options for eliminating the conflict. One option is to eliminate one of the conflicting parties. I mean that's an option that's very helpful. Commonly held when you buy. What people generally do is they start to negotiate verbally, which basically means that they're using their verbal behavior to put their plan back into action to get what they want and as that's blocked saying it doesn't work, more and more emotion builds up and other strategies but are sort of lower on the access hierarchy. Get thrown into play culminate possible. Possibly. What I wanted to get dean to do, he was, he was a little bit nervous I think doing it because it's not part of his character. I wanted him to take the project. I was given him, hold it and see if I could get someone to help me hold on the trait.

Speaker 3:          00:34:16       Now, one of the things that we want to figure out is given the maps of meaning are going to conflict with regards to the importance of objects including in this notion of object including ourself and other people. What's the appropriate strategy to adopt in the process of negotiation, which is very much related to your question. You said, well what constitutes say the essential aspects of peace? Well, what are the things you have to figure out is when you're in unknown territory and you'd be put there by someone else who's also there because of you, what do you do? How is it that you should act so that you're acting optimally, so to speak, to resolve the problem in the most positive of ways. Most causative of conceivable weights, which is to say we need to figure out a set of rules that everyone can agree on for operating in the domain where there aren't any rules.

Speaker 3:          00:35:15       We cook a black Melvin cause I haven't want on tape. Yes. Yeah. So we know, you know it's culture aid as this story. Culture B has this story and they meet as soon as they meet the members of both cultures are no longer in these stories. They're in some domain in between and the rules that apply here and the rules that apply here do not apply here. So kind of course the question is what rules apply here and well, the other diagram that I'll keep showing you, somebody described it as the bouncing ball, which is kind of a good way of describing it. The rules that apply outside of the domain. Here are the rules and that constituted the way that's the hero's path. So you would say that the hero, this is interesting, this is why you get archetipal hero figures. There was really the ideal figures for culture and they're also as a general rule, representatives of peace, sorry, this is very, very common food.

Speaker 3:          00:36:30       If for example, the sort of the embodiment of pace and the same thing is true for Christ. It's because they are those, their patterns of behavior characterized the optimal form of action that is to be undertaken in the domain. This between two specified domains. Um, I guess he came into our territory and were part of your culture. All of that done. I was just wondering in general meeting, wow, what do you think, what would happen if instead of just your map again, pin on all of us. Um, the police stated a crucial meeting. Well Danielle did a toss an insult adding mousy lab, but this is something that you like, I don't know how thoroughly you were taking in by this particular demonstration, but one of the things that you have to try to, um, appreciate is, you know, as, as clearly as you can, is just what were your responses during the, during the interruption, because this was the entrance of the stranger, so to speak, to hostile, strange.

Speaker 3:          00:37:48       I mean, he had his own agenda. They weren't actually, he wasn't really his agenda. It was an agenda that he was acting out for someone else. So he's kind of in a sense just the emissary of bad news. But this is a PC. This is a pretty minor example of hierarchy disruption. But you think, for example, had it mean real. There's a, well, one of the things that I was told before I came to Harvard was it, there was a certain amount of tension between junior and senior faculty members. This is not nearly as true as I was led to believe before I got here. And much of the distance that exists is a function of age and, and well in large part anyways, but one of the things that this sort of disruption would do the me if it really happened, would be to undermine my confidence in my position here and since I have devoted a lot of my life to attaining this particular position, or at least that's how it's worked out, that sort of objectively minor intervention could have, you know, all sorts of highly negative consequences in this case though wouldn't really have such consequences because of what, what really made me think that this must be, this must be stage taking it to borehole.

Speaker 3:          00:39:08       Yeah. Well that's okay. Okay. That's a good, that's a good point. That's part of it because I didn't, Dean wasn't as forceful as I would've liked to have been on. I actually asked him to come in here because he has natural politeness, overcame his acting ability. Unfortunately, I wanted him to come in here and just tell me what was happening, you know, more or less abruptly and just take it. I was certainly, I had made it, made it fairly believable. I mean that's true. That's true. Oh yeah. We were all anxious, but we're not anxious anymore because we've redefined what it means now. We've right. And even before it was clear to everyone in the room that it was staged. Like as soon as he left, he, as soon as he left, we started talking about it as an example. So now everyone got what they wanted it. I mean going with his story, he got the projector and we took the, the event of having the projectors taken from us to mean, well great. Now we have an example to talk about for a mile. So kind of thing was a change card sort of rec revisionist history. Even before I realized that, we said as we started talking about, I want a perfect example.

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       I was pretty sure it was stage because I thought it would be highly inappropriate for him to come. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. [inaudible] was the real situation. That professor was in the lecture of 300 people and had to have this machine and this was the only one. I don't think that would be, that wouldn't be an unreasonable situation. Well, no, but the what is the more appropriate, right, exactly right. He should have asked me brothers, the room or equipment. What does this mean? Interest. Why do you think it took you such a long time? Um, yeah, I probably do a piece together so, so sorry. Somebody else again. Tiny. You think it took you such a long time to la first? The issue was you needed, well that was at least that was my cover story. I mean the real issue is what the hell are you doing barging in here in front of my whole class, taking this dam project or make me look like an idiot. But the cover story is I need this projector to finish my class anyways. That's how it work out in reality I think.

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       Yes. Okay. We come back in. Yeah. I'll just call and tell him, you know, this, this hoax day. This is, what is that? Um, well I don't remember. When did you leave? Immediately afternoon. That was a stage that was staged. Yeah. Okay. Jerry Kagan and the basement using the overhead projector to lecture class. Oh, well I asked him to come in here. Do you have a dispute with me about the meaning of an origin? So unimportant I stage [inaudible] classic example. That's right. That's right. Back to the most appropriate fantasy. And the fantasy being an alternative story where the motivational significance of things is the way that you wish they would be entertained by it. Because I was actually seeing if you would ask the same with, you know, that you've been telling us and seeing if you would actually go through like it was cool to see, like in real life you would have had, it depends how you're approached the, if the cover story is plausible and the emergency seems to justify, well that's another, and that's one of the things I've been trying to point out to the meaning of an event depends on the behavioral strategy that you using the presence of the event.

Speaker 3:          00:43:52       So even with Dean, for example, in his intervention, it's the strategies that he used to, uh, to offer me the anomalous information aren't going to determine the phenomenon that I am in that particular context. So if he, like if he would've called me outside and say, look, you know, excuse me, but here's the situation and it's a large context situation. You know, like let's say Kagan needed the projector because he was involved at some major fundraising episode for the, for the department and it had broken down suddenly, et Cetera, et cetera. Well then I'll basically what you're doing under those is, I can erase this now is this idea, alright, little stories inside this is a dominance hierarchy by the way. He thinks a lot.

Speaker 3:          00:44:57       He did. Uh, anyways, so what gene would have to do in order to, well dean would have to do in order to convince me that his intrusion into my story was justified. Say My story of being at this level of analysis cause to make would be to make reference to a larger story of which I was also a part that I considered as well as him super ordinate to the things that were going on now. So he would say, yes, I know that this event has meaning a from the frame of reference of this ongoing class. But from frame of Reference v, which you also share, it has this alternative meaning we'll contrast the meanings and come to some sort of agreement about them. And I'd say, well, you know, if I found his story convincing, I'm subordinate, I'd altered this story because it would be less motivationally challenging then for me to be engaged in altering the superman story, assuming they're shared. So that's, that's the kind of decisions you're always making. If you're negotiating with someone, for example, you do the same thing. I mean, what if I want something from you that you don't want to give me, I have to offer something to you that, that is sufficiently important to counterbalance your laws or offer you the possibility of that in the future or anyways. That's okay. Okay. So yeah, there were two things right after he left. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:46:33       Uh, turning the [inaudible] into, uh, talking to beginning to talk about it as an experiment or it changed the whole valence of the thing, right. Right away. And the humor was also a part of that too. It became a source of humor at the same time. And it was just interesting to watch whether everyone immediately saw that it had been a hoax or not treating it as if it had been treating it as an experiment, took away all the anxiety and the negative energy attached to it and neutralize it and put it in this new site. So

Speaker 3:          00:47:08       that is the instant provision of a story. Yeah, exactly. Right. And that, that, so you know, that's a, that's the classic demonstration of the fact that the story is in fact what makes your emotions and you're always trying to regulate your emotions in the face of the unknown, so to speak. So the, the notion of the humor is interesting too. One of the mythological precursors of the figure of the, of the savior, which is sort of the archetype of the hero is the trickster shrinks. Right? Right, right. The trickster is but bugs bunny for example, that's his classic rule in, in Warner brothers cartoons. He always has a, uh, he always gives the events at twist negative events of twists that make them turn out right. And the twist may not look exactly on the straight and narrow window occurs. But as the story unfolds, it appears to be the right thing.

Speaker 3:          00:47:57       And trickster figures are very common figures in mythology, especially. Okay. Apparently at the stage of cultural development where the thicker of the hero is really being elaborated up into something identifiable. So he's sort of a transition figure. An adolescent, you might say. In a sense. So the irony is to see that there's an ironic distance, right? I mean I'm in, the humor is in a kind of an ironic distance, isn't it? You know, is it something that turns out to be not what it seemed to be, right. I mean cause the trickster seems to be fit. It turns out it's that. And so there's a kind of double meaning. But why, you know, I think we also find things humorous. When did we become spontaneously aware that once again, we've transcended a set of arbitrary limitations. So I think keywill occurs at least in some instances when you move from a bounded domain to outside the domain of that back and do another one because you have a fleeting, you have a fleeting moment there where you recognize your, where are, you recognized yourself as sort of a transcendent figure and people find out, well hey find that, oh, the word empowering springs to mind.

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       It's a word I particularly hate, but

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       what I don't really understand is that my feeling in the sea, which I didn't realize until the end of the stage, which is great embarrassment. You

Speaker 3:          00:49:23       okay? Why were you bear? Okay. Why were you embarrassed for me? See that's thoughts.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       I think similar to what she said was that instead of like we sit here and we listen to you as a professor and you then placed in the position of a bickering of a boy. Right, right. And just be like your credibility with seriously on the ride. Right, right. And so it was Kinda like,

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       yes, you see that, like the phenomena. I think the phenomena of embarrassment is one of those things that all curves when you, when you watch rabid movement down a dominance hierarchy, like you sometimes in your own case for example, if you feel ashamed about something, say you turned back, well that's because you've just manifested a behavior which you know full well is in very poor record with the way you conceptualize your position in a given Darwin, sorry, which basically means that you backed and blow yourself and that makes you self conscious and also puts you out. The other thing that happens under those circumstances is that like if you have adopted a story and it protects you, the story has certain rules that you have to fall right. And if you don't follow the rules, then you immediately forfeit the protection of the story. So if you're like high up in the story, so to speak, climbing up the dominance hierarchy that's associated with a particular story and you pull off of behavior, that's, you know, it's tricky and it works, but it's really, uh, it's immoral from your own perspective and you get self conscious and you've also exposed yourself to the unknown there in a big way because you've just broken your own rules.

Speaker 3:          00:50:52       And the problem with writing your own rules is your rules are what protect you. So it's easy to, if that's a good trick of cell cells from others and from, from the unknown in general. I mean, no matter where it, where it manifests itself, right, including inside, inside yourself. That's right. Because the story that you act out is how you ensure that you remain predictable to yourself. Which that's another thing that you don't want to underestimate the significance of this. That what are the reasons for the shared story is so that we don't have to have fights about the projector and we have, and that is dominance are determined by dominance hierarchy. Um, it's also so that we don't reveal any of our own mysteries to ourselves unexpectedly. It's not just to keep other people in line. It's also so that, so that we can, I think so we can tolerate looking at ourselves in the mirror.

Speaker 3:          00:51:43       No, not in any sort of horrific sense, but just as well. It's comforting to consider yourself with predictable entity even when in many, in many ways that's an illusion. There's because there's way more to you than you know about and you don't exhaust your possibilities when you're participating in most stories. I mean that's why if the context shifts well, if the context shifts, your personality shifts because much of what you consider your personalities, the story you acting out, it said like if things really fall apart when you, you mentioned the small possibility for physical altercation here. I mean you could say I would develop an argument and then there'd be a little physical dispute, maybe hydrive with the projector and so dean pull it and that would embarrass me more and that would make me angry and maybe I'd give it a push and he fall over by accident.

Speaker 3:          00:52:36       And that would hurt them. And that, you know, it's just like the whole system spirals out of control because of this one entry point. And so then you say, well you have grounds for the beginning of a small war. And the problem is, is that as soon as you're outside that the bounded domain where your emotions are regulated and controlled, you're literally in the grip of forces that you poorly understanding. This regulates your aggression, for example, and predict predictability. That's, that's implicit in shared participation in historic. As soon as you step out here, it's like there's all the gods of the unknown in a sense are waiting for you. It's like you are now controlled by, by anxiety. To what degree depends on how much of your story has been disrupted. The same thing goes, goes for regression and emotions under normal circumstances you don't feel you don't have a personality built up for because they just, they're not part of your environment even though they're part of you.

Speaker 5:          00:53:33       So, okay. So the goal I guess, of all our adaptation is to, to have our emotions regulated, right? Um, but that gets disrupted by when, when something anomalous comes in and there's always something anomalous. However, I like should we exist until the anomalous information comes in and hits us or because I sometimes feel myself just going for things that I'm afraid of just because I want like the thrill of whatever and but that is my searching for it and, and dysregulating my emotions.

Speaker 3:          00:54:05       What are the things that sort of complicates the idea that novelty is threatening on first exposure is magnitude. It's like, cause it's not always true is that there's, there's an optimal level of novelty. Where are the magnitude of the event is sufficiently small. So that once activated primarily is your incentive reward systems. And that's the sort of thing that if you're, if you're operating optimally so to speak, you're, you're consuming novelty at the rate that's precisely appropriate for your particular temperament. That's interest. I think when people say, I'm following my interest or I'm interested in this, what they mean is there's an appropriate amount of novelty in this, in this area of my experiential field and I'm feasting on it, so to speak, at my own rate. But then you're aroused and while you're optimally adapted at that point the same because you're updating your models about adaptation and perhaps everyone else's as well.

Speaker 3:          00:55:05       Well at the same time remaining relatively secure. C One, one foot. Remember that I'll get you written. Wait, that's, remember this diagram that's down the world. The cosmos, it's constructed of chaos and order. Too much of either is debney. Your place is right here on the line. That's the, that's the razor's edge, so to speak, a very narrow line, halfway between chaos and order where one is being transformed into the other but neither predominates and that's, there's two translations for downs. One is the way which is the path of life and ask the bouncing ball diagram and the other is meaning and that's because if you're on the path, then your life has meaning and the meaning is contact with novelty. At the appropriate rate. So it's something you feed on that's the source of the US, that spiritual bread. That's what that is.

Speaker 5:          00:56:04       I was just, I was just thinking about this kind of thing the other day and, uh, I can't remember, I knew exactly what contexts, contexts, but it seems that they're all there instances all over our lives where there is, where we encountered islands here were a novelty. Novelty is, uh, actually a predictable part of our lives. And I think, and what I just thought was that the

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       part of the administrator, what you're talking about, chaos there, where's there can be a bounded region of unpredictability. Yeah. Yeah. So that, you know, everything in it so that everything in there is unpredictable and number, the lesson has very well defined boundaries so that you can, they're, they're whole, they're all, there's a whole, there are whole classes of phenomenon that are completely unpredictable in and of themselves. Nonetheless, you know what? Right. But nonetheless, you know what their effects can be, right? You cannot be, somebody wrote in the essay in this class, I believe this title in Games and Games are new. Example of exactly that. They're bounded domain in which novel events can nonetheless take place. So if you mean when your emotional response to novelty depends on a number of things, it's not, it's not necessarily terror, gay priority. One of the things that hero myths tend to point out, cause there's sort of two classes of romance.

Speaker 3:          00:57:13       There's a pyramid that describes the successful here and there's the hero myth that describes the unsuccessful heroes like vehicle man. And the unsuccessful hero is someone who encounters the unknown accidentally. So one of the things that transforms. Yeah, and he's the one who gets devoured and never comes back. So that's what md did this by the way, he accidentally slept with his mother, his mother, she's the great mother that seems incest. That's the incest motif. Now Freud read that sexually, but really let the incest motif refers to is the possibility of creative union between the hero and the great mother, which is between the explorer and the source of all new information. But the problem is if it's accidental, well then it might kill you and eat it. This blinds himself, right? His consciousness is destroyed because of this accidental encounter. And Freud, Freud thought that was the, like the core story that underlied the development of humanity.

Speaker 3:          00:58:07       It's a very, well, it's a very, depends on the level of analysis, but if you know what that story means, it's very, very pessimistic. That's it's a failed hero myth. If you think of Freud Friday in psychoanalysis as a form of religion, which is, which is a perfectly reasonable supposition because Freud tried to provide people with a map of meaning was one of the few religions that I know of where the central hero is a failure nor success because almost all religions, religions organized themselves around successful heroes. I mean, that's why they were useful. Substituting ordinary misery first. Well, it's also the case that Freud, Freud explicitly presume that the domain of culture associated with religion, which is a broad domain and for which for Freud also included literature and art was a defense mechanism and illusion that defense mechanism erected against death anxiety. It was an illusion. One way. That's true. Well, it can be true, but it doesn't have to be true dogma. It's true that no one serves to protect you from the right. Right. Look, there's nothing trivial about Freud's objection and it's also the case that people hide inside Reggie dv Ologies precisely in order to protect themselves from not just death, but from the all those things they don't understand. But the fact that something can be true, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is true or that it's true in all cases.

Speaker 6:          00:59:40       Um, last week you had mentioned positive delusion and how there was a literature that that implies healthy to have some,

Speaker 3:          00:59:49       was the illusion

Speaker 6:          00:59:50       that is being debunked at this time?

Speaker 3:          00:59:52       Well, there's, there's a big debate about it, but, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:59:54       All right, well just, just thinking about, okay, what have you, what if your way, what if your path to get from, you know, the unbearable present to your future goal included? I'm thinking of the unknown or intrusions from the unknown as lessons. So in other words, you were looking at them as a positive every, every time. Um, anomalous information came to you. You said, this has been brought to me to teach me a lesson, right? We'll learn something. And that would take the anxiety away from it?

Speaker 3:          01:00:30       Well, no, this yeses. Okay. That's a perfectly interesting argument. The last part of it, I think, I don't think you have to classify that as a positive allusion. Um, I think that the transition in western culture from Old Testament, uh, morality to do testament reality is a transition of exactly that sort because the message, it's sort of implicit in the Old Testament. God is a pretty horrible figure. I mean, very powerful, but quite frightening. And how's it and 10 constantly displayed in that manner. And God, that's new testament. Just theoretically God love. At least that's the attitude that you're supposed to. How and why is that? Well, it's for the reasons that you just pointed out is the content of the time. No one is inevitable. The only thing you can do about it and just change your attitude to it. The hero myth 10 to point out that if you approach it voluntarily, it's the source of new information.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       If you run from it, it kills you. Oh, those are your options. Your option isn't too to not happen. If things didn't change, there wouldn't be any light, but you do have the option of how to face it and it does work. I mean if you're in getting engaged in an argument with somebody, like somebody that you have to argue with and that you have to come to a solution with, say someone you're married to, someone in your family, it's like you have to solve the problem or an or not. You can just fight about it for the rest of your life. That's the other option. Fighting about it a few times in the rest of your life if you actually have to address it. Then when they present you with anomalous information, which is essentially like a poison apple, something that's an adjustable in its present form, your only option is to sit and think what is there in this that I can actually constitutes usable information for me.

Speaker 3:          01:02:13       So you might say someone's objecting to the way you conduct yourself. Do you think that they're being hostile and unfair but laid down some ground rules so you more or less trust each other? You're only option. There's no circumstance cause is to remove yourself from the argument symbolically Europe or in actuality, is there any truth in the information I'm getting Andy? If so, how? How do I have to adjust my behavior or my scheme of interpretation to take that information into account? That's presuming that what you want from the argument is the reestablishment of harmony and the capacity to continue to move forward. So that is the attitude that you, I don't think that's a positive allusion at all because the way things manifest themselves is dependent on your attitude towards them in a nontrivial way. It's like you in in a, in a major way. You determined the Valence of phenomenal by your approach to them and we don't know the limits of that.

Speaker 6:          01:03:10       Okay, so you're saying basically then before the hero can venture out into the unknown, he has to take care of the anxiety right before he can do the exploratory behavior?

Speaker 3:          01:03:20       Well, no, not necessarily he, but no, no, I wouldn't say that because the anxiety might accompany the exploratory behavior. It often does. I would just say what, what the hero posits this. This goes back to your point about, uh, last week about how the transference and union psychoanalysis, what the hero has to do implicitly or explicitly is pause at his site or what, what the individual has to be. We implicitly or explicitly is positive. His identity with the hero as a potential fat who's validity can only be tested as a consequence of actual action, which is to say you have a Schema. Some anomalous information comes in, you have a choice, act on it or not. If you decide to act on what you've done implicitly is identify with the hero. So that's an act of faith. And that act of faith is that despite the way the anomalous information appears and it's destructive context, there's something within me that I don't know about that will enable me to cope with it if I make the effort.

Speaker 3:          01:04:24       It has to be faint because? Because it's enormous. You don't, you can't know low. Okay. Now you made, you made a, uh, when you, when you talked about the rate of a known being related to temperament. Yeah. Um, what, what do, what temperament do you think the ideal here? What would happen? I don't think it matters. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because, because it's a subjective phenomenon. It's like, it's the same with intelligence. You could say for someone who is profoundly retarded, learning how to tie their shoes might be regarded as a heroic act and justly soul from the perspective of morality. And because they had to overcome what were innumerable subjective obstacles. So timber bent or intelligence or native ability does it, this is a level playing field. It doesn't demand, it doesn't determine that that a person can be a hero. However, you might say that there are different kinds of heroes.

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       There's there could be here with that ties his shoes or the hero that brings, um, you know, uh, that, that takes America to a different place. Whatever the Mesoamericans do, leave that, that Schamens, um, had stronger temperaments and they were, they were seen as basically the heroes and you know, they could go into there, there, there, there, there, there were more passionate and that. So it seems to me that there is a difference between, I want to read you something just to move because it's such a good design. This is really interesting. It's very relevant to your question about levels of heroism, so to speak. Okay. This is an Indian doctor, doctors of cosmic cycles. Okay. I want you to think about with regards to this, to this diag riffle right now we know already that this is a kind of a schematic representation of a story with all these other stories embedded within it and they organize themselves over time.

Speaker 3:          01:06:13       It's a dominance hierarchy because the most dominant story, so to speak, occupies superordinate territory. So if you're in a dominance hierarchy, the most powerful person determines the story that has the greatest domain. And it is the case. I'll read you some examples of this suit. That time. The story of dominance disputes between the gods are very, very common, mythological, mythological tales about talk about the movement towards monotheism. For example. The guards are, are very often portrayed as at war and it's the victorious God that becomes the Supreme God. I think that's a mythological representation of the fact that those processes actually occur in time on earth. We, we dispute, we dispute constantly the meaning of things, relative meaning of things and over time, at least within cultures, we come to agreement about that. That means that some positions when another positions lose it. That's a Darwinian competition of ideas, although sometimes it's cooperatively, cooperatively induced as well.

Speaker 3:          01:07:16       Anyways, these are stories. We know that stories too, that when they transformed themselves, they go through this cycle of dissolution and reconstruction. So you could say that if this is the arrangement of stories at every level of analysis, each of these separate stories is constantly undergoing dissolution and reconstruction. So that's happening all the way up the chain. I listen to this. This is really interesting. The doctrine of cosmic cycles from India. A complete cycle you got comprises 12,000 years. It ends with the disillusion of her mayor, which is repeated more drastically. Matt have per layer the great disillusion at the end of the thousand cycle for the paradigmatic Schema, creation, destruction, creation, etc. Is reproduced an infinitive. The 12,000 years of the Bahai Yoga were regarded as divine years each with a duration of 360 years, which gives a total of 4 million, 320,000 years for a single cosmic cycle. 1,000 such Matt, how are you?

Speaker 3:          01:08:21       This makes up a KALPA 14 culpas makeup, a man, Vera. Then Tara so named because each Manvantara, it's supposed to be ruled by man who's the mythical ancestor king. Okay, so one of the implications of this is that the cyclical or that if you pick a domain of this cyclical process, you can ascribe its establishment to the mythical ancestor king. Okay? Kaaba is equivalent to a day in the life of Brahma, a second cup or two a night, a hundred of these years of Brahma. In other words, 311 millions of human 311,000 millions of human years constitutes the life of Brahma. But even this duration of the God's life, there's not exhaust time. The guards are not eternal on the cosmic creations and destruction succeed each other forever. So the Indian notion is that this is kind of an infinite, this thing is infinite and structure all the way up as far as you can go in all the way down as far as you can go in. And every level of analysis, there's these constant cycles of creation and destruction. That sounds almost like alchemy. I mean it's sort of a very, it's a way of playing messiah with the symbols and the way that scientific sounding way. Yeah. Yeah. Well they know, oh, people had scientific intuitions prior to the, to the onset of science as a formal enterprise as well as mythological intuitions. Oh, this, this, this dark. Turn this off I think is obviously representing something like this. So

Speaker 5:          01:09:58       the, uh, you mentioned earlier that the dominance hierarchies are this way and for some reason that doesn't, it doesn't make sense. In my head, um, because it's, it's, he would seem to me that, that they'd go, um, instead of going up there, they are within each other. So if, if, if Sean came in and say you have one of the, the three right there, the little ones right there. You, you both had, uh, a story there, but he, he gave you a bigger story. Yeah. Then that would change. That would change yours instead of looking at it as going up there, I would look at it as judged as being different and he has to give you one that incumbent.

Speaker 3:          01:10:30       Yeah, but, but I would say that's a more dominant story. It contains more territory. It rules more territory. That's, that's the notion. Literally it rules more territory. So I'd be willing to subordinate my story to this large, the largest story, say for the Mesopotamians that's ruled by Martech. So you see there's a real neat twist in this. I think it's really something else. So it's like you have a real paradox is that you need known territory to protect yourself from chaos. But the problem with that is known territory has, it has real disadvantages, right? It gets rigid. That's one thing. And it makes you have conflicts with other people who have no territories that are different, different way the Mesopotamians solve. This was by saying that the thing that makes the superordinate story, which is Marta, is actually the process that transforms all stories, right? So they put a paradoxical loop into this process I suppose. Absolutely brilliant, brilliant. We say, well, all your, all your conditional stories have to be dependent, have to always remain dependent on your ultimate subordination, to the process by which all conditionals towards from generate. So that's an amazing idea.

Speaker 5:          01:11:38       So, so I, I don't understand how can, okay, so, so I understand that, that the bigger the territory that the more topical the story, but how can on on the level where they, where they don't come from the same territory, how can one be above another graphic way? It's not obvious up in terms of power. We're talking about an abstract, right? So is it power? So like the bottom one is, is lower and louder than the top line. Yes. The middle one is lower in power, then the outside one it goes from, it goes from in to out. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:12:10       Yeah. No, that's right. And I know when we were talking about, here's an example, you're working for a corporation. You're not the chief executive officer, you're a vice president. Okay. This is your store. There's three vice presidents. There's one chief executive officer. Okay. You're going to be concerned. One of your domains of concern is the viability of your position and everything that it's like in, cause you're also the head of a whole whole set of other subordinates who are beneath you, so to speak. So that's your particular domain of concern. But it would be rational, so to speak, under most conditions to subordinate your desire to maintain this territory in favor of maintaining the entire territory. Yes. Whenever there's a conflict, I mean generally speaking you could envision perhaps some cases where that wouldn't be,

Speaker 5:          01:13:02       Hey John ain't sure I understand. Okay. So my question is really do the vibe and do the vice presidents, is there a hierarchy amongst amongst them? You mean this way? Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm asking. I'm asking. Oh, um,

Speaker 3:          01:13:15       well there would be, if there isn't that there would be, if they were ever engaged in a task that would require them to arrange themselves. I mean like, I'm not, I'm not reading this and this isn't a fixed picture of like there's not necessarily three of these subs subs if you place in that way. Does that mean that it's possible in a dominant is hard for them to be relative to quality of position? Um, although that I think that would necessarily break down those, say if there's three vice presidents, they have to organize themselves to do a job. There's going to be a, a dominance hierarchy that actually is hierarchical emerge in the course of their cooperation or another story. That's right. They no tied into it. Not your story. It's also the case that like your position in the dormant attire, he shifts across stories.

Speaker 3:          01:14:05       You know, it's like, well, you might be a senior at Harvard and you know, so that you're at the top of, of at least one part of dog's hierarchy there. But then when you go on the workforce, it's like whack. You're at the bottom of another dominance hierarchy or you can just shift in and out of them during the day. And that's partly because we've been able to abstract or dominance hierarchies up to such a degree that you could participate in and innumerable some of them even a symbolic coming, you can change the valence of a phenomena just by shifting your reference point. Nope. Say It depends on what you contrast it with. I can say in the big picture of things, right. That's the big picture. Exactly. Take the big, something terrible happens to you. I take the big picture so the picture is too big, then everything becomes worthless.

Speaker 4:          01:14:47       What's the button? This goes back a little ways to what you said about, um, when anomalous information is promising as opposed to threat. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and it sounded like you were saying that it relates to the feelings of advocacy of the hero or of the confront her. Yeah. Uh, would you describe it as an act of faith? Yeah, just curious about that. I mean, um, what creates, I mean is that what you did you mean to say feelings of personal efficacy? Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:15:24       You mean instead of an act of faith? Well or how, how would you relate that to I guess what I'm trying to say that if you, if you undertake to voluntarily, if you undertake to voluntarily expose yourself to an aspect of the unknown that is an act of faith. And whether you know it or not, you are emulating this heroic model. So one of the things that young attempted to point out was that since you're doing that, you might as well know it because as soon as you don't, then you have access to this incredible wealth of information but sort of details the structure of that process and that it can provide you with more explicit knowledge about what it might mean saying cause you're, if you say, boy, I wrote down, when I think of the history as the historical historical a hypothesis.

Speaker 2:          01:16:13       Let me see if I can find,

Speaker 3:          01:16:20       can we ask revolutions in procedure bring about revolutions and experience. That's the hypothesis of historical man fundamentally. Which is to say that you can pause it, that through your actions you can transform your environment. That's an act of faith and it's the act of faith that precedes the construction of culture. Because by doing that, what you are saying is that the individual, despite the immense power of balance that appears between the individual and not knowing the individual is in fact part of the process. It's of equal magnitude. Equal side. Remember I showed you these pictures?

Speaker 2:          01:16:57       Let's see.

Speaker 3:          01:17:06       Yeah, this is a good one. Look.

Speaker 7:          01:17:18       Okay. Yeah, I know. Sweet. Anyways, you know, I would regard, this is pre Columbian. I would return this as an image constrict constructed by the member of a culture for whom the hypothesis that the individual was equivalent potency in comparison with the great mother or as as not true or just barely dawning on consciousness is there as the hero. I mean there's a huge difference in terms of perceived relative power. And then you see, well here this is a much more modern issue. You see, there's much more uh, indication of equality by this point. Yeah. So the notion of the divine individual like that's, that's the, that's what I think. I think that idea, it's mythological idea cause it has to do with meaning. That's at the core of the democratic notion that everybody is equal before the law, which is has its roots in the idea that everyone is equal before God, but what that means by, well by equal, what equal means is that your capacity for heroism is not limited by your native abilities, which I think is really interesting because it's very difficult for us to think of anything that you can do for that.

Speaker 7:          01:18:40       There really is an equal playing field for it. Like most things are dependent say on your intelligence that's heritable to at least a substantial degree or your physical ability or your gender, your race or these things that are really built in, but your capacity to face things that are anomalous, that's really a part of your character. I think that's, that's above, above those biological constraints in a way because what's anomalous to you is very much dependent on your personal nature. So you get the, you get problems that are exactly the same size that you are. So that's, that's another part of the reason why you get this weird notion of equality before God. I wrote a story about that later in the manuscript to try to make that clear in this story. I met this woman when I was a behavior therapist and this was a devastated woman.

Speaker 7:          01:19:25       I mean she had every problem that you could imagine essentially and then a bunch more. She, uh, she was so pathologically shy, but she could not look at anybody that she thought was up higher. The dominants are not meant anybody. I mean, literally she was at the block and when she approached people say, who are doing therapy in this one unit? She'd go like this, just like in just like an arcade figure approaching an amperage. She couldn't bear to look at the person. And part of the behavioral treatment was to help her stop doing this because we should do it in public as well. And of course, people who act oddly in public tend to have a log social troubles. So we were hoping to get rid of this particular symptom, but she was also, uh, she, uh, she was not an intelligent person by any stretch of the imagination.

Speaker 7:          01:20:12       She probably had an Iq. So we're in the neighborhood of 70, which is about two standard deviations below the mean or about four standard deviations below the average in this route. So like she, she's not a smart person unless you've tested people with Iq tests, you really have no idea how much difference there is, how much difference four standard deviations means. It means a lot. Uh, she had very poor personal hygiene and because I think probably because she was raised as badly as you could possibly be raised. Um, um, she wasn't particularly attractive as a person either. She was, she was, uh, oh, okay. What else? Well, her boyfriend was at schizophrenia and he was also an alcoholic and he was violent and he is to accuse her of being possessed by the devil. And he theater. She lived with her mother who was like old and sick and an aunt who was bedridden and they were on welfare and she had no education to speak.

Speaker 7:          01:21:05       I've been really no hope for a job. Like when I saw her, she's probably close to 40. Um, anyways, like this woman, the cards were stacked against her, you know, in every way you could possibly imagine. But what her primary, this was interesting. They will, her primary concern in therapy was not really what could be done for her. Like she'd gone through behavioral treatment kind of work temporarily, but she reverted to her old habits very, very, very soon. What she really wanted from me was to help her sort of make a dent in the, she was an outpatient in the hospital administration so that she could find an inpatient and these like the inpatients that are left in mental hospitals now, these people are seriously troubled because anybody that could possibly be let out has been let out. So like I used to go into the basement at the Douglas Hospital in Montreal and it was like, it was like something out of Dante's inferno.

Speaker 7:          01:21:52       It was an old building and the people, like there was a coke room in the basement and the people that were in there were just, well, you know those mini, you know, the medieval paintings of, of disfigured people that were in common. Well, that's what it was like down there. And that's what most of the inpatients were like. They're just, they were just totally destroyed. And some of them had been that way for like 30 years. So anyways, what she wanted was not help for her. And she didn't come in to complain about her situation, even though there was lots of reasoning can play about, she wanted to find somebody in the hospital grounds that she could take out for walks. So yeah. And she had dog that she used to take care of, you know, it out for walks. And she was, I thought she was remarkable this person, because from the deterministic standpoint, so to speak, there's no reason at all that she should have been anything but the hostile and bidder.

Speaker 7:          01:22:40       But her problems for whatever reasons, we're not, we're not her primary focus of concern. And, uh, well I thought that was just a good example of how, you know, regardless of your particular circumstances, it is possible that you might make the right choices. So, and that that's maybe not dependent on things that you might consider biological givens. So, and then I do think it's true that the burrata your talents, the bigger your responsibility. So that's how things work out just because, well, that's one way you can make sense of the theoretical lead unequal distribution of talents. The more talent, the more responsibility simplest still.

Speaker 4:          01:23:28       All right. I guess I asked that because really you're, it sounded as if we were describing, uh, the non threat, the promising anomalous as occurring sort of within a space that was, you could define a space within which like in a game of space within which the anomalous occurs and it's safe.

Speaker 7:          01:23:45       Yeah. Well we do, but this is an account in which it's more in the self, um, yeah, that was able to deal with the anomalous wherever it occurred. Right, right. No, that, that's a perfectly reasonable contrast. I mean, when we play, that is what we're doing. The first thing you, we're carving out a defined space. We say, look, here's the actual borders within this, we will allow a certain amount of anomaly to occur so that we can practice coping with the anomaly. People like that. They like watching games for example. Right. That's, that's why kids play games as well. It's like kids, you know, if you watch them, if they're eight or nine years old to get together in the playground, they'll say, well, here's the rules. Black, black lab that defines the territory's, right. Well the rules are just enough to get to get something going so that someone normally can occur at formal games are like that evening.

Speaker 7:          01:24:36       And it is often difficult to distinguish when it is that you're not playing a game anymore. I mean, some people play games their whole lives formally. A lot of the things we do as academics ideologically are abstracted games, that's for sure. But there is a difference between that and the general sense that if a normally arises, I incapable of dealing with it. Yeah, and that's, that's the more, well, they're both, they're both hero types. I mean sports heroes or heroes, right? The ritual models for emulation, they deal with anomaly and bounded circumstances. I would say there, there paragons of normal adaptation. That's right. They master a bounded domain. They're not necessarily mastery. The transition between domains, that's, that's a different type of heroism but it's still a form of heroes.

Speaker 6:          01:25:25       Are you saying that the greater your biological gift, you say the bigger your responsibility, do you mean the bigger your responsibility to go out and encounter

Speaker 7:          01:25:36       and bring it back? I would say well there's more. That's right. That's part of it. Right off the backs. Like what you don't know is differing in contrast to what you know. So the structure of what you know and its and its size, so to speak is, is a proportionate innocence to the kind of unknowns that you'll encounter. Like in a sense I read it say, I don't remember where that one of the hallmarks of genius is the capacity to see mystery where others only see. So you won't even see the same things with variance and capacity comes very innocent perception. So, and then I would say adapt. Is it? So like coping with coping with the stresses of a about well-run household might be sufficient challenge for a given person. I mean, in reality, I mean they may do a very good job of that and that's at the limits of their ability.

Speaker 7:          01:26:32       And when you meet someone like that, you regard them as admirable sort of intrinsically for someone whose talents are greater, their field of, of conflict has to be greater, otherwise they're not. They're putting artificial limitations on their, on their development and all that unused talent down. Just work against them. You know, there's nothing worse than a neurotic intellectual cause. The neurotic intellectual is, it's incredibly devious even to themselves. I mean, if you're dealing with someone in therapy, an Iq of 130 say, and they'd be telling themselves lies for 25 years and these lies are, are unbelievably coherent and convincing because they've used all that intellectual talent too to erect this thing that's really going to devour them.

Speaker 5:          01:27:17       So, so then you've made a, you separated. Okay. So there's a lot of time. It's from the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere is, produces the, the pleasing sensations in the unknown and the Right Hemisphere, the fearful lens. Well, you've also separately the dimension of, um, it's not related to in the left hemisphere of the ability to organize, et Cetera, and then the in the right hemisphere.

Speaker 7:          01:27:37       Can you tell there's this, I think there's a certain amount of, of, I don't know exactly how it

Speaker 5:          01:27:42       thank you. Social personalities have, uh, or you know, people who are in prisons or whatever, they have generally low intelligence and uh, but also, uh, stimulated very easily by, by thing.

Speaker 7:          01:27:56       Well, that's one, that's one line of theorizing. Yeah. There's, there's more to the story than like Tamar men alone doesn't, I don't think temperament alone is enough to make you conduct disorder anti social. I mean, I would say that among like every temperamental tight has its own, has the kind of pathology gets most prone to like, if you're really inhibited, you'd likely to develop anxiety disorders. Like that's your sphere of weakness. Like everybody has the sin towards which they're most, uh, they're most attracted so to speak. But I think under very few circumstances, could you say that temperament was destiny and even then if temperament is destiny, can you say, well, the story that someone's participating in you isn't going sequence of biological forces. I would say then that the morality of that person is still can only be calculated by looking at how they dealt with what they were particularly, particularly given.

Speaker 7:          01:28:50       I kind of, I had a friend for example, when I grew up who had an extensive family history of alcoholism. It's like went back at least three generations are affected a lot of his male relatives and by the time he was 14 he was alcoholic and I would say, well, how do you judge someone like that? Well, I mean you want you say is that there was much more temptation there, so how he dealt with it, that was his particular province and it didn't work out very well for him. But I guess what I'm trying to say is that, well it's the Senate. Same thing I was trying to say with that story about the woman at the hospital is that, you know, you're handed up your hand, didn't know rang of problems that are unique. Some of those problems are biologically determined. The manner in which you approached them determines the integrity of your character.

Speaker 7:          01:29:37       It's hard to judge that from outside. And I think that's another reason why in, in, in various religious traditions, there's the notion that the only accurate judgment can come after your death, for example, that you know, you have to be judged by a trans, something of transcend the door edge and for it to be accurate. So, but it would seem like you said, of of his person and the 70 at Yosemite, that intelligence could help them to face, to develop a better story. Well, consider it depends. It depends on your, it depends on what you mean by better. I mean that's the, that's the issue. More debt. Well, I don't know. I don't know. It's like if you, if you're a smarter, you have bigger problems there could've just made it more bitter. I mean, she was at this dad's postures at this point, willing to satisfy herself just by helping someone who was lower down the issue.

Speaker 7:          01:30:28       Right. But she was more intelligent. It might have just met her. At least it's conceivable that would be the case. I mean for you, I mean you could look at this on a broader evolutionary scale and say, well, like our intelligence, does that make our life better? Well, I would say, well it's a toss up because on the one hand, well here we sit and everything's perfect. On the other hand we've invented the atom bomb and like it's only been 40 years and we don't know whether the fact that here we sit and everything's wonderful is sufficient to counterbalance the fact that using the same intelligence, we've also created this massive weaponry, which, which is still around and will always be around to pretty much bring things to an end. So intelligence is a moral, that's my, that's my take lines. Like you can, you can use it one way or another and it broadens your domain of action, but there's nothing intrinsically good about it.

Speaker 7:          01:31:23       It's a tool. And it's not related to temporary. Well, I don't know if it's related temperament or no. Does this relate to like the dualism and the bureau move to the hero has a divine parents with the hero also comes from humble? Yes. Often. Sort of like from unexpected places. Absolutely. It's the same idea and it's the same notion that couldn't give Christianity. There's the notion of an eternal Christ and Christ that's, it has a historical moment and what that idea is trying to portray is the notion that the hero is that transpersonal force, so to speak. It's a constituent element of the psyche. It's eternal because it's always regenerated, but at the same time it's perfectly reasonable to view that eternal thing as something that's also necessarily exist within a specific set of constraints. And I would say that could not exist without that set of constraints, which is something that will also deal with more of the latter half of the man of the chorus, the manuscripts, the constraints, not only our constraints, but they define the capability for action.

Speaker 7:          01:32:30       Sorry, I was talking with someone the other day and they said, well, if everything was orderly, there'd be nothing left to do. And that's well that's the same sort of notion that Dostoyevsky describes when he points out that if we established a political utopia where everything was predictable basically in perfect, the first thing that people would do would be to drive themselves crazy just so that something unexpected could happen. And so in literal truth that life could go on. So anyways, this is, this is something that's really useful to consider and we will get into it because one of the questions that people always pose is why is it the terrible things have to happen? And I, you know what the myth basically suggests that well for there to be something, there has to be a division between the limited domain in an unlimited demand. There has to be, it's a precondition for existence.

Speaker 7:          01:33:21       So then the question is, if the existence of limitation is a necessary precondition for existence, is it justifiable? And you know, that's the big question. Ask The big question if limitation is a precondition for experience is limitation justify. And I would say what these mythological stories are trying to do is to tell you the story about how it could be that limitation might be rendered bearable. If it's, say it's a precondition for experience. Well this is like for me, this is something really worth knowing because that's a big question for people, especially when something really traumatic happens. It's like, why? How can I make sense out of this? Or isn't this event so terrible that it undermines the utility of any possible story I could tell myself, oh, that's what happens when someone close to you dies. You know, this is such a, this is such a catastrophe that everything in, in the line of this is evidently few tile. Well that's, you know, that's sort of the bottom line of questions. Can you make sense out of that?

Speaker 2:          01:34:23       So

Speaker 7:          01:34:27       other questions?

Speaker 2:          01:34:32       Okay. Wow. Okay. Well that's probably good enough for today.

Speaker 7:          01:34:37       I will put your papers outside my office on, there's a little black bench there. Um, every paper will have a sheet attached to it that has detailed comments and the grade and I hope it will be there. Don't come until Friday morning to see it. It'll be there Friday.

Speaker 2:          01:34:56       Okay.
