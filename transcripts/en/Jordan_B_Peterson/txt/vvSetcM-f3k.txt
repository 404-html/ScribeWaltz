Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hi, this video has two components, a three minute announcement of the remaining venues of my American 12 rules for life tour and the new Canadian venues that will open up in July and August, followed by a lengthy discussion with Ben Shapiro on the narrative substrate. If human cognition derive from his new Sunday Youtube video and podcast. So either I'm in Denver, Colorado today. It's May 7th, 2018. I'm going to give the fourth talk of my American 12 rules for life to her tonight. Or maybe it's the fifth. First one was Toronto in Washington, then Chicago and Detroit. Now Denver. So yes, I guess that's the fifth. I'm announcing the remaining venues today in the u. s where tickets are still available and the dates and places for my Canadian tour. 10 Canadian cities in July. So there's tickets remaining to 10 venues in the United States on May Twenty Third Philadelphia on May 29th, Houston on June dates Richmond on June 10th, Charlotte, June twelfth, Nashville, June 14th, Louisville, June 15th, Indianapolis, June Sixteenth, Milwaukee Twenty Fifth, Portland Twenty Seventh, Sacramento.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       And in between all that on Wednesday that June the fifth, I'll also be enriched vic in Iceland, so tickets are available for those. And then I'm going to be touring Canada in July and August the 19th in Toronto on the 20th in Hamilton. That's July again. Twenty first in London, Ontario, 22nd in kitchener onto on the 23rd in Ottawa on the 26th in Vancouver on the 27th in Calgary on the 28th in Edmonton in August on the 14th at Regina and on August 15 in saskatoon, Saskatchewan. You can find out more about that if you go to Jordan b Peterson.com and look up events. That's Jordan Peterson.com under events also in this video is a discussion that I recently did last week. In fact it was just released with Ben Shapiro as part of his New Sunday podcast initiative and I think we had a very good conversation and so the rest of this video is taken up with the conversation that I had with Ben.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       I think we got farther on the issue of how human perception and cognitive function is nested inside a fundamental narrative substrate and we related that to modern findings, neuropsychology related to hemispheric function. I think it was an excellent discussion and so I'm very happy to bring it to you. There's some ads in it because I took it directly from Ben's video, so anyways, so that's the tour. Philadelphia, Houston, Richmond, Charlotte, Nashville, Louisville, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Portland and Sacramento and that's all in June and May and then rick to vic and June as well, and then the candidate tour in July and August. Toronto, Hamilton, London, kitchener, Ottawa, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina and Saskatoon. And as I said, you can find out about that at Jordan b Peterson dotcom events. Thank you very much and I hope that you can come to one of the talks so they seem to be going really well so far. We sold out a very large number of them and the people seemed quite enthusiastic and I've been able to get farther in my thinking than I was in my book and each of the talks is designed to eliminate a different element of the, let's say, the 12 rules and the topics that are associated with that. Um, so thanks very much and I hope you enjoy the discussion with Ben Shapiro.

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       There's lots of times in your life you're not going to be happy. And so that's not gonna work. You want to have something meaningful that's the boat that will take you through the storm.

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       Well, here we are with Jordan Peterson and I could not be more excited to talk with he best selling author of 12 rules for life and I will talk with them.

Well, as Jordan knows before the show, we talk for an hour before the judges got interesting things we should have caught on tape, but now we're actually going to get a chance to do it live. So here is the Jordan's new book. If you haven't bought it yet, everybody on planet has bought this book.

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       I was walking through the office today. We didn't have a copy in the office. The person, the front desk had a copy of book just sitting on your desk. So that's the way this works. At 12 rules for life. An antidote to casper, fantastic book. Obviously tapping all the best seller lists all over the world. Jordan, thanks so much for joining the show. Really appreciate it. Thanks for the invitation. You know, obviously your, your prominence has just blown up in the year and a half when we were talking before the show about why that is and why there are so many people who suddenly are very angry about you. I notice there was an article in politico suggesting that young, angry white males, your now their leader. So congratulations. I wanted to ask you about that. Why do you think that, number one, your profile has become so big of late and number two, why do you think it is that so many members of the of the left are so angry about that? Why are they characterizing people who listen to you as angry and enraged? Young white men? We could look at the the characterization

Speaker 3:          00:06:25       to begin with, you know, because I think it speaks to the pathology of the radical left instantly. There are absolutely incapable of viewing the world except through group identity terms. Know when. So if someone comes out and disagrees with them, then they have to characterize them by their fundamental group attribute, whatever that happens to be. Maybe it's gender because that's a favorite or maybe it's race and so angry white men young. There'll be go sexist, ageist, and racist all at once. Right? They're angry young white men. Well, it has to be that way. If you're going to be the. If you're going to play the left, this game because that's the only way that you can look at the world and then if you can't make your opponent reprehensible in some manner and it's strange that they would attempt to make them reprehensible on the grounds of race, age, sex since that's precisely what they stand against hypothetically, but if you can't make your enemy reprehensible along some dimension, then you have to contend with them seriously and so you know, if I'm not an outright right fascist like Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos, which was how I was characterized in Canada because the radical leftists can't even get their bloody insults straight.

Speaker 3:          00:07:33       He's like Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos because there's no difference between them. Right? No obvious difference. It's just another attempt to pilloried as far as I can tell, and I think that it's. It's dreadful. I really think it is. There was an article written by the, by, I believe the editor of the New York review of books that was just republished in the globe and Mail. Talking about the emergence of hypermasculinity and how I was somehow responsible for that are contributing to it like most Fellini and I read that and I thought, yeah, like miscellaneous and I thought, okay, so what are you doing? I see you're, you're defining masculinity are conflating masculinity and hypermasculinity at the same time. Then your virtue signaling by being against hypermasculinity, but really what you're trying to do is bring down whatever it is that's masculinity and what masculinity is in in this frame is something like competence and so it's part of the radical leftists, general war on competence.

Speaker 3:          00:08:31       It all as well, which I think is one of the most pernicious elements of the culture wars, the dissolution of hierarchies. They the assumption that every hierarchy has to be based on power and serve the needs of your group. Whatever that happens to be, that there's no such thing as competence and so and then the other thing that's reprehensible about it because that's not enough, is that it's just wrong. Like there's. I've got tens of thousands of letters from people and people come up to me all the time on the street. I'll give you an example. This is a great story. This is really touching. So I was in la about a month and a half ago and I was downtown La and downtown La. It's kind of rough and I was wondering around and with my wife and this young guy pulled the car up beside you, knocked out and he was kind of a stylish look in 21 year old Latino guy, something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:09:22       It was all excited. He said, he asked me who I was and I told him and he, you know, that's what he had presumed and so he was kind of excited about that and he said, look, I've watched all your lectures and it's really helped me and I've been straightening out my life and trying to get my room clean. Me laughed about that, but you know, developing some names and trying to tell the truth and, and look, I've really fixed up my relationship with my father. And so then he said, wait, wait, just wait a minute. And I thought, sure, sure. And so he went back in the car and God is farther out of his car and he came over with his dad like they have their arms around each other and he said, look, we've really improved our relationship and they were both smiling away.

Speaker 3:          00:09:54       And you know that man, if you're going to target me for that, just go right ahead. Sounds real white supremacist. Oh yeah, yeah. And, and it's wherever I go now, and this is one of the things, this is the thing that's so wonderful about that, all of this as far as I'm concerned, is that people come up to me all the time and that's exactly what they say. They say, look, I was lost, aimless, depressed, nihilistic. I'm anxious. Drug addicted, alcoholic wasting my time masturbating too much. Although they don't generally use that particular example last essentially and, and, and hopeless in some sense. And I've been watching your lectures and they've really helped and I've really been putting my life together and I'd been trying to say what I believe to be true and develop a vision. And it's really helped and like, and it's so overwhelming, you know, like if I'm doing book signings after a talk, then they'll be a dozen people or more who and these aren't like I'm only talking to people for about 15 seconds, but you can have a very intense conversation in 15 seconds and they'll say, look, you know, I like, I was suicidal man.

Speaker 3:          00:11:02       Like I was really hanging onto the edge of the earth by my fingernails and I'm better. And they have tears in their eyes. It's like, it's amazing. Middle with that goes a long way, man.

Speaker 2:          00:11:13       I think that when I look at, at your rise and look, I talked to people who love what you do. I mean, every time I go on the road and I'm speaking at a campus, you're the number one name that gets mentioned at people by people who come to my lectures. And I think that the reason for that that I've, that I've seen is, is really twofold. One is that one of the things that you really talk a lot about is the notion of self discipline and purpose in your life and control. And the idea that you are in control of your decision making and your decision making matters, that's one. And the other is that you have, you have a unique capacity to say no to things and when somebody says something to you that is illogical but popular, that you have the capacity to say no. That's what happened in that Kathy Newman interview that somebody was saying to you that made no sense

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       and you just said, well no. And then you just stood on that now and when you stand on that. No, I think it gives people a lot of courage. Yeah, well I mean the, the, the gender issue is really an interesting one because one of my professional domains of expertise is individual differences. I'm, I'm a personality psychologist and so I know the gender difference literature and it's, it's a very solid literature. Well first of all it's very solid. It has a 30 year history once per psychologists got the personality models down. So that would be the big five model. All empirically derived straight statistics, right? Brute Force empiricism. Nobody had a theoretical ax to grind with the big five except to say maybe there are human traits. Maybe they're encapsulated in language. We can use statistical techniques to find out what they are. That was it.

Speaker 3:          00:12:41       That's the whole ideology, so very, very neutral. As far as ideology, school five traits emerge. Okay. Are there differences between the sexes? Turns out there are all right. They're not massive, although a few some them across all the traits you can separate men and women with about 75 percent accuracy, so it's not trivial, but you have to sum across all the traits. Then another question comes up, well, are those differences social, cultural or biological? Okay. We can test that. We'll go around. The world will look at cultures will rank order them in terms of the gender, equality of their sociological policies. We can do that with broad agreement from the right and the left. Then the hypothesis would be if gender differences decrease among more egalitarian societies, then the gender differences are sociocultural or at least more associate culture. That's exactly the opposite of what was found repeatedly that pseudo science.

Speaker 3:          00:13:38       It's like, no, that's mainstream psychology. Those papers have thousands of citations and right. The average humanities paper has zero citations, right? And then the next most common one has one, 3000. That's an. That's an unbelievable classic. And, and here's the other bit of fruit. Like you say, well, how do you know that you can trust someone's judgment about a fact. The fact emerges despite their ideological presuppositions. Okay, so it's well known that the social sciences and the humanities have a, have a left tilt and a lot of that's temperamental and the tilt has become more pronounced. But as Jonathan hightest pointed out, there are no conservatives among social personality psychologist or, or, or none to speak of. Very few, vanishingly few. And if the field has a bias, it is definitely and indisputably a left wing bias. Okay, so you have to fight that if you're, if you're a scientist, right?

Speaker 3:          00:14:34       Even if you're left wing scientists, you have to fight that because you want to get to the facts. It was these social scientists who generated the data that suggested that the gender differences not only were real, but that were bigger and to Galitary and societies. They didn't do that to grind the radiological acts because they're ideological. Presupposition was, no, no. You make the society you get with Terrian men and women get more of the same. It's like, nope, they get more different. Oh, isn't that something? And so then there's a corollary there, which is all right. You could still say, and they're kind of pushing in this direction in Scandinavia, boys and girls are different. Men and women are different. It looks biological, but because people are malleable, you could push the sociocultural structure harder and harder to minimize the biological differences. Okay, well first of all, maybe and maybe not.

Speaker 3:          00:15:26       Maybe you get a rebound and they'd get even like the kids would rebel. That could easily happen, but let's say, okay, you could. The problem with that is, is that if you see that much power to the state, like you're basically giving the state the right to socialize your kids, right? It's like you, you really, you really, you really want to do that. I mean, the people in Israel couldn't do that with the cabooses, right? It didn't work. So people aren't going to give up their children to the state and thank God for that. Well, I mean this is one of the big questions that we were discussing earlier is that we were talking about the polarization in politics between right and left and obviously you're, you're a psychologist, you're a philosopher, but you've been dragged almost kicking and screaming into this political sphere because everything has been so politicized.

Speaker 3:          00:16:11       And so when you say, when you say social science statistics and they are scientifically based, you're called a racist. You're called the sexist or called a homophobe and all my. Exactly. So it was a. Why is it that? So why do you think it is that so many folks on the left who purport to be all about reason and science and and objective factors, so willing to throw those out the window the minute that it becomes politically inconvenient because you imagine that cognitive system, so an interpretation of the world has levels there. Axiomatic levels, some fundamental presuppositions are more fundamental than others and you could say, well, the leftists historically maybe because of their atheistic rationality are more on the side of science than say the fundamentalists of any sort, but when push comes to shove, you find out how the axioms or are nested. There's deeper axioms underneath that which is that all hierarchies are based on power and all power plays are based on group identity, tribal identity essentially, and that the entire history of the world is nothing but a power play between between these different identity groups.

Speaker 3:          00:17:21       It's like, okay, well if the science indicates that some of that's wrong, then do you alter those beliefs or do you alter the science? And the answer to that question is, well, it depends on how you've hierarchically arranged those. If the science is at the bottom, then you alter your beliefs, right? If it's the scientific facts or the axiomatic some structure, then you then you altered your beliefs. If your beliefs are the axiomatic substructure, then you alter the science. While we've seen how that plays out, and one of the things I've tried to do so to speak is to diagnose the axiomatic structure. It's like, okay, what's the. What's the metaphysical presumption structure of the radical left? Well, what what it is is your basically your group. Your groups are basically engaged in warfare, right, and the warfare is arbitrary except in so far as it serves your group.

Speaker 3:          00:18:12       Okay. I don't buy any of that. I think that's. I think that's a route to certain disaster. I think it's a degeneration into tribalism and that we will seriously pay for it, not only because it returns us to tribalism and tribes fight as the anthropological evidence for that is overwhelming, right? Tribes spite. It doesn't even matter if they're chimpanzee tribes. Even chimpanzee tribes fight. So not only do you regress to a tribalism, but you also invalidate the one proposition that's been able to help us rise above the tribal, which is the idea that the individual should be sovereign. And so I think the culture war is about what's the proper framework within which to view human identity and what's the relationship between the individual and the group in relationship to that identity. And the leftist answer is it's all group and it's all powered like.

Speaker 2:          00:19:09       Okay. So just a second. I want to ask you a little bit about some of the, some of the more enlightenment minded thinkers who are out there right now because it seems like we've been discussing the big gap in, in Western civilization right now, which is between the collectivists and the individualist, if you were to put it broadly, but I want to talk about some of the divisions among the individualist in just a second. First, I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at Birch gold. So with the uncertainty of the of the market right now with all of the volatility, a lot of Americans are increasingly concerned about the security of their savings. And the Federal Reserve obviously has a loose monetary policy. It's been shoring up recently, but there's a lot of volatility in the markets. Well, this is the reason why I need to talk to my friends over at Birch gold, so vertical Dicom is the place to go.

Speaker 2:          00:19:46       If you want to put some of your assets in precious metals. Now I'm not saying take all of your money out of the stock market and push it and precious metals, that'd be stupid, but you should have a little bit in precious metals to hedge against inflation and volatility in the markets. Vertical sells physical precious metals for your own possession. They'll ship metal right to your front door and right now, thanks to an irs tax law, you can even move your Ira. Are Eligible for a one k into an IRA backed by physical gold or silver if you so choose. It's a good option for people who want to ensure that their retirement savings are protected from the possibility of inflation or stock market volatility. Gold group, they have a really good long standing track record of continued success. They've been advertising with me for years, thousands of satisfied clients, countless five star reviews and a plus rating with the better business bureau.

Speaker 2:          00:20:24       Ask All your questions about precious metals investing, get all your answers, and then contact Birch Gold's group to request a free information kit on physical precious metals. They're comprehensive 16 page get shows how gold and silver can protect your savings, how you can legally move that IRA or 400 k out of stocks and bonds and into a precious metals IRA. If that's something you're interested in. They get a no cost, no obligation kit. Head over to [inaudible] dot com slash [inaudible]. That's [inaudible] dot com slash Ben. That also wants to know that we sent you. Okay, so Jordan, one of the things that we've been talking about obviously is the big gap that I think we certainly agree on between the collectivists identity politics and, and the sublimation of science in favor of subjective politics that favors a power group. Uh, but I, I want to talk a little bit about a division that is also now breaking out among those of us who I think would consider yourselves friends of the enlightenment.

Speaker 2:          00:21:12       So you consider yourself a friend of the enlightenment style thinking at least in the essence that individuality matters. And if the individual is sovereign scientific nf at the end that it matters, right? Data matters are useful. Exactly. And, and in this group, you know, I consider myself as part of this group, people have started to call it the intellectual dark web. Sam Harris is part of this group. Uh, there, there are a wide variety of folks with a lot of broad political differences that are part of this group. But there are some real differences that are broken out even among people who consider themselves part of this group. Right? Steven pinker has a different perspective on the world then, then you do a, I have a different perspective than Sam Harris does. You and I have our differences probably on some matters of philosophy. So where do you think that the vulnerability lies in the, in the possibility of vivifying enlightenment mentality?

Speaker 2:          00:21:58       Because it seems to me that one of the big problems that's, that's popping its head up above the water now is the rejection of the enlightenment in favor of this old style tribalism that you've been talking about. That we're now going to repeat history because we benefited so much from the enlightenment and we forget that things don't have to be this way, but we've got so much nice stuff. We live in so much freedom that we forget that if we just tossed those enlightenment ideals out the window, things get really ugly again. I think that's what unites us

Speaker 3:          00:22:21       well, that, that's the question is what, what, what do you toss out the window before things get ugly, right? And the enlightenment proponents, you could say Harris, you could say pinker, um, Charles Taylor in Canada, they trace back the development of the modern self. Let's say Taylor wrote a book called sources of the modern self to the enlightenment. And it's quite interesting because like if you look at the typical academic psychologists say their historical knowledge generally runs back about 15 years. And so because they're all concerned with the, with the modern literature and there's some utility in that. But the downside is they don't have any historical context. So you read someone like Taylor and you think, wow, he's stretching it back 500 years, you know, but there's, there's reading that goes way beyond that to look at the sources of the self and the source of the modern ethos, and this is a huge bone of contention between people like me saying people like Harris and I think between people like you and people like us is that my sense is that the enlightenment values themselves are grounded in an ethos that's much deeper and much less articulated.

Speaker 3:          00:23:29       And that would be an ethos of metaphor, image, drama, ritual, religion, art, music, all of that dance even for that matter, the nonverbal, the pattern recognition. Ian Mcgilchrist has written a book called Master and his emissary, which lays that out quite nicely with regards to hemispheric specialization. It's kind of predicated on Elk Conan Goldberg's observation that the left hemisphere is specialized for what we know and the right hemisphere is specialized for what we don't know if that's an order chaos dynamic. And the rough idea would be that the left hemisphere generates paradigmatic systems. So that would be like the enlightenment system, axiom predicated, right? Even stainable axiom predicated, but that that entire axiomatic system is based in a nonverbal, in the nonverbal domain that's associated with while it would be associated with the right hemisphere, but it would also be associated with deep motivations, biological motivations and emotions.

Speaker 3:          00:24:30       And so because here, here's one way of looking at it. You think, well, how do you validate an axiomatic system of ethics? And the answer is quite straightforward. John Psj figured this out is you play it out in the world, literally you acted out in the world and then you watch each other's emotional responses and if the thing that you're playing out, if the axiomatic system that you're playing out satisfies the motivations and the emotions of the people who are engaged in that system, then the system is justified and then you say, well, it's not just that their motivations and emotions are satisfied. It's more complex. It's that the motivations and emotions of each individual are satisfied, but not only now but now next week, next month and next year. So you have to extend it across time. And not only my emotions and motivations, but yours as well.

Speaker 3:          00:25:21       Now, next week, next month, and across time. So this, there's terribly tight constraints that are placed upon an act. An axiomatic system is validity. Now the way jump, piaget thought of that, he said, well, think about it like a child's game. A bunch of kids get together and they decided to play pretend okay and pretend is let's mortal the world, right? And, and as a place to act, because to pretend you don't, right? So the kids get together and they assign roles and they say, well, you're going to be mom, you're going to be dead, you're going to be the dog and we're going to play house. And then they, they acted out and what they're doing is seeing if they can regulate the manner in which they're constructing the game so that everyone's emotions and motivations are so well satisfied that they want to continue the game.

Speaker 3:          00:26:09       Okay? And so that's so cool. So what it shows you is, that's how an ethical system is, is tested and justified. It's like you play it out and you see if everyone wants to keep playing, and so that's a whole different methodology than the scientific domain, right? So the axiomatic system isn't. The ethical axiomatic system isn't justified by reference to the scientific method. It's justified by reference to the emotional and motivational wellbeing of all the players of the game. Now that game me emerges, this is the second part of this and this is so cool. Then the question is, well, how does that game emerge? And the answer is the same way that children's games emerges. So what Piaget noted is that kids would get together and they play marbles and if they were young kids, they could all play marbles say six, six years old, they can all play marbles.

Speaker 3:          00:26:59       And, and if they were in a group, they were playing marbles and it all worked out fine squabbles and all the kids would keep playing, right? Validating the game. But if you took the kids out of the game and you said, what are the rules of the game, they would give completely disparate accounts. So they knew how to do. It was like the, the wisdom was in the group, the wisdom was fragmented enough among the individuals, so if you pull the individuals out, they'd give disparate accounts, but if you put them altogether, they could play the game, but then if you waited until they were 11 or 12 and you pulled them out of the game, then they can tell you the rules. Then at 14 or 15 they would be willing to. This is with more sophisticated games, they would be more willing to regard themselves as makers of the rules.

Speaker 3:          00:27:40       Okay, so here's how it happens in an evolutionary sense. People going all the way back to our primate forebears organize themselves into functional hierarchies. Okay? And the hierarchies are complex and they're not just based on power. Despite what the idiot marks is, say, even if the wall has noted that chimpanzee hierarchies are unstable, if they're only based on power, they don't last. They generate into violence. So you have a hierarchy that's, that works, but it's acted out. No one knows why it works. It works because everyone seems to be happy with it. Okay? And so those hierarchies get more complex and more sophisticated and then people start to observe them and talk about them. It's like, oh, we've got this hierarchy here, what's it like? And then they spin off dramas about the hierarchy. Here's a hero who climbed up the hierarchy and here's what a hero looks like.

Speaker 3:          00:28:31       Okay, so then you get the idea of hierarchy and then you get the idea of the hero as the person who moves up the hierarchy and generates it. Okay. Then out of that you get the extraction of the idea of the hero and then you get development of that idea and it's out of that. You get the monotheistic religions and so it's like the procedure and the hierarchy come first. No one knows what the rules are. It's all played out the same way that we'll just play it out in the pack or chimpanzees play it out in their troop. Then we wake up and think, oh, we live in a structure. Here's the structure. That would be, oh, Cyrus, in the Egyptian mythologies. Here's the structure, here's how the structure goes wrong. Here's what the structure does. Here's its tyranny, tyrannical aspect, here's what you have to do to generate the structure and to thrive it.

Speaker 3:          00:29:16       Okay? That's even more important. The hierarchy is important enough, but what we want to know is how to master the hierarchy. Okay? That's where you get the mythologies of the hero. Okay, and then so then there's generates all sorts of different heroes because there's different ways of being successful. Then you have a panoply of heroes. Then you think, okay, well now we've got all those heroes. That's a set we can move, pull back and say, okay, something about all these heroes is what makes them heroes. That's when you extract out the monotheistic savior, because that's why in Christianity, Christ is the king of kings. It's actually, you can think about it as a literal statement for forget about the religious overlay. It's like, okay, you got a bunch of people. Some of them are kind of king, like, okay, so you admire them. It's like for whatever reason that is right.

Speaker 3:          00:30:04       It's not easy to figure out why you admire someone, right? That's complicated, but let's say you've got to admire admirable people. You start telling stories about that's why you go to a movie, right? You want to go watch someone. You don't care about your board by. No, you want to go watch someone admirable and interesting or maybe the opposite of that. It doesn't matter. It's the same thing. Then you think, okay, well we've got all these admirable people. They're generating the world properly. That's what makes them admirable. There is a principle they embody and that principle is the process by which the admirable world is generated. That's the logos. Okay? That's the thing that's operative at the beginning of, and here's my. Here's my question about about all of this because now we're really not talking about 12 rules for life as much as naps.

Speaker 3:          00:30:44       Meaning which is your first book which you're doing need the audio recording audio. It's, it's, it's definitely a harder book, a then 12 rules for life and a much more complex book and a lot of ways than the 12 rules for life. So how universal are these systems? Meaning, why isn't that the enlightenment only arrives at one time in human history, in one place, in human history as opposed to if human biology is essentially consistent across, you know, across humanity. Then why is it that that you know, if at the, at the apex of the levels you adapt with the enlightenment idea which started this particular question, then why is it that it only arrives in one place at one time as opposed to arriving in a variety of places in a variety of different kinds of great culture and that's okay. The first thing we would say is the process by which this, the hierarchy itself and success within the hierarchy is generated.

Speaker 3:          00:31:29       That's to be accounted over millions of years, at least hundreds, thousands of thousands of years, but I would push it back because you can see analogs in the chimps, so 20 million years, let's say. That's a long time on that timescale. The fact that the enlightenment values of in Europe 500 years ago before anywhere else, it's like, well, who cares? It's. It's five old men long, right? If you put five 100 mineral men in line, it's like it's yesterday, it's this morning, so we've. We've evolved these hierarchical structures. That's our culture. We've evolved ways of maneuvering within the hierarchical structures that are successful and now we've started to evolve ways of mapping our, our adaptation, not just adapting but mapping it. Okay, so how does the mapping occur? First, admiration, second, invitation of admiration, and that would be drama. It's like you, you dramatize Shakespeare, extracts out what's admirable and interesting and plays it out, so that's the use of the body as a representational structure of the body.

Speaker 3:          00:32:38       So we act out what's admirable. You think, okay, now we've kind of got the drama down, were all captured by this drama. It's like, well then the literary critics come along, the philosophers and they say, oh, what are the principles by which the admirable people operate? It's like chimps woke up and said, oh, well some chimps are more successful than others. What are the rules of success? It's like, well, there were no rules because they weren't running by rules. There aren't rules until you described the patterns. Then you have a rule. That's what happens with Moses by the women, right? Moses has a revelation. Here's the rules. It's like, yeah, we'd been living out those rules forever, but we didn't know what they were because they weren't rules. They were customs. Right? Okay, so you start by mapping your customs in drama and story and that way you can represent them and you can transmit them.

Speaker 3:          00:33:24       Then once you have them in your grip, say the representative now not just act it out, well then you can move one step backward from them and you can say, well, what's the commonalities among these? What are the general principles? That would be the development of something like the code of Hammurabi, right? It's like, well, we've got all these customs. What are they? Right. Revelation. It's like, Oh, here's how you map the customs. That's the decalogue. It's the same idea. So I took human beings are very long time to evolve their hierarchies, to evolve their structures of success, and then to have enough people around with enough spare time to engage in the cultural process of the artistic cultural process of mapping the adaptive structure, not only merges in mythology and drama, then that lays the groundwork for philosophy. Then the philosophers could come in, especially once it's written, like in the Judeo Christian Pantheon. It's like, oh, now we've got it written down. Oh well we don't have to remember it. We can read it and while we're reading we can think about it. And so then out of that starts to come the semantic codes. Well then you get the enlightenment. It's like, okay, well here's a bunch of semantic codes. It's like, yeah, yeah, those are great.

Speaker 2:          00:34:38       So this is really interesting because you know, if you read pinker or if regional Goldberg's new book, essentially they attribute the enlightenment to Jonah. Colbert calls it the miracle it. It's almost as though it accidentally occurred in a certain place at a certain time. Joan doesn't quite go quite that far. I think to be fair to him, but uh, I think that that philosophy that this sort of sprang up randomly here, uh, is, is very much embedded in a lot of Sam Harris is thinking a lot of thinking and you're taking it further back. But I do wonder if this may be an area of actual disagreements. We have two of us. It should be fun. Are you attributing the growth of the Judaeo Christian ethic that emerges into the enlightenment as also accidentally just pushing timeline further back?

Speaker 3:          00:35:19       You think it's accidental? Okay. I'm not making a reduction to start. So the first thing is I'm going to say this is how religion evolved, but I'm not saying, I'm not saying that this explanation exhausts the phenomena because it's a very strange phenomenon. It's very, very strange, but, but that doesn't mean we can't generate a plausible evolutionary account. So like if you have a bunch of motivated emotional limited beings occupying the same territory and competing and cooperating for the same resources, including the resource of cooperation which can generate more resources, is not a zero sum game. There are going to be patterns of adaptation that emerged from that, that are similar. So here's a way of thinking about it. If you put a bunch of kids together, they're gonna evolve games, right? Well which games? Well, a bunch of different games. Yeah, but they're all games, right?

Speaker 3:          00:36:13       So even though. So that's the moral relativist element. A bunch of different games. But the moral absolute establishment is, yeah. Yeah, but they're all games and the games have to be playable, which means they have to continue in an iterative way. Right? So that's a big constraint. People have to want to play them. So not only did they have to be games, no, and comprehensible to everybody hand enjoyable, but people, but they have to be self maintaining and everyone has to want to play with them. Okay. That's the answer to the postmodern conundrum. A plethora of potential ethical implications of the world and infinite variety. Yeah. Okay. Fine. Not an infinite variety of pragmatically applicable interpretations. You instantly constrained the universe to while too, to what? Well, this is why there's commonalities in mythologies. It's like if you put enough people together in enough different places, the commonality of the groups of people there because of the grounding in common motivation and emotion and embodiment, because we're embodied, means that they're gonna generate hierarchies that are broadly similar with strategies of success within those hierarchies that are broadly similar with descriptions of the strategies that are broadly similar, and so you could say in some sense, the ethic that gave rise to the enlightenment is in place more or less everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:37:36       Now. It's tricky because not every hierarchical system is as functional as every other hierarchical system. Some of them can degenerate into tyranny. We're talking about the set of all voluntarily playable games or something like that, and that can degenerate out of that. You're going to get common myths. You have to and then that and that lays the groundwork that lays the groundwork for even our ability to communicate. Right? Right. So, and this is, the enlightenment dies. They just, they're not getting that. So, and this gets to, I think, the broader question that I know you and Sam went on for three hours about, about the nature of truth. He has a particularly truth in the moral sphere. I think that. Yeah. Um, and what would it be fair to say that you guys agree on the idea of truth in the scientific sphere that did you know if, if something is that there is such a thing as objective truth or are you going to say we agree on a lot of that.

Speaker 3:          00:38:23       The question is to some degree, why do scientists accept the idea that objective truth is true? And then I would say we probably don't agree about that because I would ground that in and Sam would ground out in the idea of an independently existing objective world, right? Which is a leap of faith, more like my own actually than the pragmatist view. Right? And if you believe that there's a god who's out there in the universe who created the structures and in particular certain way than what he created is the truth. And it is apart from you. And if human beings didn't exist and they weren't able to utilize the truth, that truth would still exist out there, whereas the pragmatists might say it's truth is in the use that it has for him. That's the thing is that, you know, I don't know if we would consider a scientific truth true unless we are also simultaneously accepting the idea that scientific truth is good for people.

Speaker 3:          00:39:11       So there's one other thing I wanted to bring up that's relevant because you brought up the idea of God. So here's a way of thinking about it. And, and I don't know what to make of this because this is stretching me. This is stretching my thoughts out beyond where I've been able to develop them. So this is the intuition that I have based on a variety of things, experiences I've had. So imagine that there's a very wide range of human behaviors, okay? And some subset of those are both admirable and not admirable. So let's call them good and evil at this, at the extreme. So okay. Then we might say, well, there's a pattern that characterizes all the actions that are good and a pattern that characterizes all the actions that are evil, and that's a transpersonal pattern because it's, it's not just about me, it's about everyone.

Speaker 3:          00:39:58       Okay? And so then that gets persona fund. That's Christ and Satan, let's say, or Cain and Abel, right? That gets personified. And that's a bad guy, a good guy in a movie, like it's personified all the time. It's thor and Loki. And then the marvel movies, you know, so now you have the, let's say you take the idea of Christ and you think, okay, so that's the abstraction of everything that's, that's admirably good about the set of all human behaviors. Okay? And then you think, well, what sort of reality does that have? And this pulls back into the reality of the idea of the logo. Send the idea that it was the logos that God used at the beginning of time to extract order out of chaos. So you think, well, it's transpersonal, the goodness, because it's not just characterized stick of any one person.

Speaker 3:          00:40:47       It's more like something that inhabits a person other than that a person is. You can really see this, for example, on the other end too, with the satanic end, because if you read the writings of people who do absolutely horrific things like the shooters, you can see that possession extraordinarily clearly. If your eyes are open, it's like an. It's shocking, so people don't usually look at it and they even say that themselves, like the columbine kids, their writings or hair raising, you know, and they were called clearly possessed by an evil that you only encounter if you sit in a dark place and brood on your hatred for months and years, right? You go places that you go places where all the dark people go, right? Right. And then that it, that takes you over. Okay. So the good and can take you over as well. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:41:35       So there's this, there's this spirit of good, let's say, and what the spirit of good does is act in the world on the potential of the world to generate the actuality of the world. And the Judeo Christian proposition is, is that if you confront the potential of the world with good in mind, using truth, truthful communication, then the order that you extract is good. And then that's echoed in genesis when God is using the word and he creates cosmos audit potential. And every time he does that he says, and it was good. Which is, I think it's so interesting because there's a proposition there and the proposition there is that if you encounter potential with truth, the cosmos you create is actually good. Well, that's, that's just an absolutely overwhelming idea. It's like if it's true, if it's true, it's the greatest idea that river watson. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:42:26       like your, your, your thoughts on this. Actually from maps of meeting help generate what we in a injuries and called Barataria and Hebrew leading into a thought about the, about the, uh, the Bible. But this merged with a little diversity alien thought led me to the idea that when it comes to the mystical notion of the tree of good and evil in, in Eden, what does that supposed to be? What did, what did people do wrong by eating from the tree of good and evil, and my feeling is that what they did wrong is that God created a universe in which the value was embedded in the object right there in the same way that you in your, in your book, talk about if you're teaching a child about an object, the rules of the object are embedded in the teaching about the object. So you use the example of the vase.

Speaker 2:          00:43:06       We were discussing this earlier, um, but you used the example of a vase where you teach your child, don't touch the base because the base will break so that the rules embedded in the object in the same way in Aristotelian thought, the rules for behavior are embedded in the nature of the universe. Meaning what makes a man good is what makes them unique, which is the reason they ideas. The reason is what makes me unique. So acting in accordance with right reason is what makes something is what makes an action good. So if you believe that God created the universe along these lines and what natural law is just a human attempt to understand the lines along which created God created the universe, then we're human beings went wrong is when they decided to separate values from the universe. When we decided to take values and say, this is a completely separate thing, so this base has no rules attached to it anymore. It's just a vase and we can construct the rules, arbitrarily is to what to do with this vase, and so eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil changes the nature of good and evil from the universe comes along with a set of rules to human beings. Think that they can use their own intuition to supplant God's rules and discipline universal rules with their own particular vision of what the universe ought to be and at that point they have to be expelled for.

Speaker 3:          00:44:11       Okay, okay. So that's also associated to some degree, I would say with Milton's warning and paradise lost because Milton basically portrays Lucifer, who's the bringer of light. Weirdly enough, as the spirit of unbridled rationality, which accounts for the say the Catholic Church antagonism, the Catholic churches, antagonism towards rationality, the idea was same idea and the Tower of Babel that human beings have a proclivity to direct their own dogmatic, um, ethical systems and then to expand them into a grandiosity that challenges the transcendent and that that's a totalitarian catastrophe. And for Milton, Satan was the spirit that eternally does that, right? Who says everything I know is enough. That's the plants. What I don't know, that supplants that transcendent and that that's a catastrophe. How that's tangled up with the, with the knowledge of good and evil, while you're making some headway towards, towards sorting that out. I mean there is a cataclysm that's, it's explained in, in, in the story of Adam and Eve, right?

Speaker 3:          00:45:14       The cataclysm is the coming two to wakefulness and its associated partly with recognition of nakedness, which is recognition of vulnerability and Mortel and ham, the discovery of death. And then also the discovery of good and evil that goes along with that. So you said, well, that's partly that. The cognitive division of ethics from the facts of the object, so I have to think that through. I would also recommend to people, I think I mentioned this before, is Ian mcgilchrist spoken, the master and his emissary because he looks at this neuropsychologically right and and looks at the left hemisphere as the hemisphere that's dealing with the explicitly axiomotic systems and the right hemisphere that's dealing with what those systems are embodied in. Okay, so part of what happens with the emergence of good and evil, it's as far as I could tell, it took me a long time to think about this is the w, and this is different than the than the hypothesis that you laid forward, which is why I can't reconcile that exactly as you recognize, you're naked.

Speaker 3:          00:46:11       You know you can be hurt. You know you're vulnerable and insufficient. You hide from God because that's what happens next, and the reason you hide from God say God is your destiny or God is the. You're walking with God is a manifestation of your ultimate, proper destiny. You, you doubt whether you're capable of that because now you realize you're embodied finitude your nakedness and insufficiency, so you hide in your ashamed. So there's that. You also realize that you can be hurt and suffer and that Kinda goes along with God's command, that you're going to work in the sweat of your brow and that you're going to die and that women are going to be subjugated to men, which has put on as a curse, not as a moral imperative, right? Um, but then what emerges out of that is that as soon as you, you know that you can be hurt, and this is what differentiates us from other animals, and you really think that through, here's all the myriad ways I can be hurt.

Speaker 3:          00:47:04       Then you're angry about that because you can be heard, but even worse, you can figure out how to hurt other people. And, and so that's part of that knowledge of good and evil. You associated with this dissociation of the, of the object from its ethical can obtain the right of the universe has created by God from our interpretation of the universe that there is a gap between the two and that once human beings begin to supplant their own rationality for a telus right in, in the diversity here and that geology well we end up doing is creating all sorts of awful systems that end up destroying us in the show. But something about that. That's right. I mean, part of what happens in the new testament as far as I can tell is that what Christ says, so he's trying to transcend the rule structure might be not because there's anything wrong with the rule.

Speaker 3:          00:47:48       If they're necessary precondition for discipline, which is actually white wrote 12 rooms, right? It's like you need rules but there, but rules conflict and they don't always apply and so there has to be an ethic underlying the rules and you should have more respect for the ethic than for the rule. Right? Okay. Christ's idea, and this is part of the idea of the reestablishment of paradise, is that you should orient yourself towards the good and that's something like an alliance with God and then that you should tell the truth and that's the ethic that generated the rules to begin with. Okay, and then we can be serious about this, you know, and we can say, well, how do you adjudicate the reality of that claim? Right? So then we might think, well, we already walked through the fact that the heroes of the past acted on potential to extract out the world of actuality and if they did that properly, then the world they extracted was good and that that is a divine principle.

Speaker 3:          00:48:39       And then we might say, well, he hasn't been defined principles and you might say, well what is it that's acting through people in the good, like the Christian theological answer to that would be the logos, right? That's the idea. That's the idea of the Holy Spirit, roughly speaking, right? Might think, well, is that a real thing? It's like, well, to me it's real the same way that consciousness is real and we don't know the role of consciousness in determining reality even, but even if you're an evolutionary biologist, and this is so interesting because the evolutionary biologists actually discriminate, differentiated themselves from Darwin on this point, like Darwin was very, very forthright in his claim that sexual selection was as powerful as natural selection or even more so and so that, so here's where this that goes in and because that was because that brought consciousness into the world as an active player, the materialistic evolutionary biologist ignored that, so like 150 years and only concentrated on natural selection where they could play.

Speaker 3:          00:49:37       While this is all chance, it's like sexual selection is not chance. Okay, so here's a hypothesis. Human being separated themselves from chimpanzees. One of the reasons they did that was because human females are sexually selective. Chimps aren't. Chimps will female chimps in estrus will mate with any chimp. The main chimps that dominant ones chased the subordinate males away so they're more likely to have offspring, but it's not because of female choice right now. Female human females have done this whole different things that they've, they've, they, they have hidden fertility and they're much more likely to go after guys who have climbed up the hierarchy. So let's say heroes will give the women's some credit for intelligence, right? And say that that's what they're after, even if they are using wealth and so forth and status as a marker, they're actually using those as a marker for competence.

Speaker 3:          00:50:30       And, and I think that's, I think the evidence think the evidence for that is clear. Okay. So you might say, oh well it was human female conscious choice that selected us. Okay. And you think, well that's not random, that's not random at all. It's the farthest thing from random that there is. And that means consciousness is making it's choices with regards to what propagates, but then it's even more complex than that. So here's what happens among men. The man all get together in their hierarchy, they pause a valued goal. They all accept that as the goal because otherwise they wouldn't be cooperating, right? Then they arrange themselves into a hierarchy and they let the most competent guys lead because they want to get to. They want to get to the promised land. They want to get the most competent leaders leaning, right? Competent defined by that value.

Speaker 3:          00:51:17       Okay, so here's what happens. Essentially the men all get together and vote on the good man and the good men are then chosen by the women and those are the people who propagate and so it's like men are voting on which men get to reproduce and women are going along with the vote and and being even more stringent in their, in their choices, let's say. And so then what you get is that the consciousness that through its active expression transforms the potential of the world into actuality also selects the direction of evolution. Right? And that's where the meme darkens term turns into the biological reality. It's not interested in. So yeah, this is something that's so cool about darkens. It's like I've often thought this about Dawkins is if he would push his thinking to the limits, he would fall right into young. The men, he'd be lost because that's a whole other universe, but if you take that mean seriously, like and I mean really seriously think, yeah, there's some ways of conceptualizing that becomes so all encompassing, right?

Speaker 3:          00:52:24       They start to become an actual force of evolution itself, and so then here's the case. You could make consciousness extracts the proper world of being from potential through truth and then it's good. It's like, okay, that's a hard one, man. That manifests itself in human beings at the individual level of individual consciousness. That's the logos with it. That's the metaphysical foundation of the idea of natural right and responsibility. Hey, that's a bloody killer idea. That's expressed in the hero of heroes. That idea, that hero of heroes is the driving force behind human evolution, so not only do you get the action of the logos metaphysically as the process that extracts order out of chaos at the beginning of time. You also get it as the major driver of evolution, and so then you ask, okay, then what kind of reality does that have? Because you chase consciousness back and like it disappears into the mystery of our past and we have no idea what it's relationship is with matter, but it's the forest that gives rise to the cosmos and drives evolution.

Speaker 3:          00:53:29       It's like you're getting pretty close to God. They're even just pragmatically speaking. You're certainly not close to you, but in the midst of it, an argument about free will because obviously if you. If you make the hard determinist argument, that free will doesn't exist and the consciousness is merely a sort of trick that your brain is playing itself. Then how exactly does. How does culture propagate? How do, how do these means propagate? How are people choosing sexual selection and natural selection become one of the same as soon as you boil sexual selection down to natural selection. And also I think that the freewill argument, I mean I see why Harris gets tangled up in that, you know, because well first of all, deterministic arguments are unbelievably powerful and when we use deterministic models for many things, they really were right. So you could say, well, we're going to use that by default.

Speaker 3:          00:54:12       It's like, fair enough. We're gonna deviate from that with care, but I don't see people as driven like clocks winding down. First of all, we don't wind down in any simple way. We're dissipative structures to use. Um, he wrote Schrodinger what is life a human being as a dissipative structure? We're not, we're not an entropic structure like a clock running down. We are in some sense, but as living beings, we pull energy in and so we're not winding down like a deterministic structure where something other than that and the way we treat each other is as logos, as far as I can tell, the way I treat myself, if I'm going to be good to myself in the proper sense, is that I'm an active agent of choice confronting and infinite landscape of potential and casting that potential into a reality for good or for evil.

Speaker 3:          00:55:04       Okay? And if I treat myself that way, then I have proper respect for myself and proper fear of myself because I can make bad decisions and work the structure of reality. And I think if you read Frankel through example or Solzhenitsyn and you see how your bad decisions can work, the structure of reality, then that wakes you up, right? Okay. So there's that. If you don't treat yourself like a, an active agent imbued with logos, then your life doesn't go away, but more if you don't treat other people that way, they do not want to play with you. If we set up societies that aren't predicated on the idea that people are like that, then the society's become, they'd dissolve or they become totalitarian almost instantly. So then I would say, well, you've got the problem of determinism was like, fair enough, man. How do you reconcile the fact that if you lay out a society at every level of the analysis on strict deterministic grounds, it fails. So it doesn't, doesn't have any in your hypothesis has a flaw. I mean, maybe not. Maybe you can say no, the facts are independent of the ethical concepts. This is what are the truth. This is where the truth pragmatism question back into being right? Because Sam say, well, it's true. Regardless of what the effect is. And you would say, well, it's obviously not true if morals are constructed for pragmatic reason and if this pragmatism

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       doesn't work, if it falls into nothingness, but also it also depends to some degree on what you're willing to, how you're willing to test your hypothesis. Because I might say, well,

Speaker 3:          00:56:32       if your hypothesis is factually correct, wouldn't you assume that if people base their, their, their, their behaviors individually and familial and socially on that set of facts, which is basically what Sam claims about facts to begin bandwidth. If you base your ethos or not those facts, wouldn't it work? Right? Well, he claims that that's a test and I'd say, well then it fails that test. It doesn't work. We have to treat each other like divine centers of consciousness in order for society to work. Yes. I think, wow, that's. I can't see anything

Speaker 2:          00:57:05       way out of those arguments. I, I can't say they're obviously, which is why you and I agree on so much about this kind of stuff and I think that it's also the reason why people find your work really inspiring and while the left wants to claim that you are an angry person or they'll claim similarly than I'm a deeply angry to. I don't think there's been quite an angry conversation. I'm pretty sure it has not been, um, but I feel horrified by what the radical left is capable of, but that doesn't make me angry. Exactly. And, and I think that it's, it's demonstrative of why so many people find what you're doing inspiring because unlike the radical left which is consumed with the idea of victim hood and victimology and were victims of the system like Marxism makes the claim that the only way that peoplesoft is the Clinton mark is a makes, but the only way to cure people of sucking is by changing the entire system, which will in some magical fashion transform the nature of humanity in the proper direction. Right color. Exactly the claim that you're making. And I hope that I'm making as well, is that human beings do soc unless they decide to stop sucking, right? And, and, and your whole goal is to tell people exactly how it is the bacon and clean up their rooms. You're a famous phrase. Guts. Yeah. Well they might as well start. Start

Speaker 3:          00:58:08       with what's right in front of them. It's a lot harder than it looks because to clean up your room means to accept that it's actually necessary for you to take that little bit of chaos that's in front of you, that chaotic potential and cast it into habitable order. And then you have to develop the right attitude towards that. It's like, okay, well I'm going to put my room in order. Well what do you mean order is in relationship to something you know, like if your desk is ordered, it means you've ordered it because you're going to work there and you're working there on something valuable. And so the order is conceived of in relationship to a tee loss. It's like, okay, you're going to order your room. Well what are you going to do in it? Like what's your room for, what's the purpose, what's the purpose?

Speaker 3:          00:58:47       You can't order your room without falling into purpose. And I would say, well, if you're going to fall into purpose, it's like try it out on a local scale first, right? You don't want to go out there and change the system. It's like, what the hell do you know? Leave the system alone, see what you can do locally, see if you can put yourself together, see if you can put your immediate environment together and you'll find if you're in a chaotic household and a chaotic household would be one where no one has any discipline. No one has any ames and there's a terrible battle between Cain and Abel going on all the time. Right? So, so life socks and everything is miserable and more cynical and that's what wisdom is. It's like, and there's no point in trying anything because everything's meaningless than who the hell is going to care in a million years and you're a full to move forward.

Speaker 3:          00:59:34       In any case, it's like there's your household. Okay? And so now you decide. No, despite all that, I'm going to put my room in order. It was like you will have a war on your hands because the first thing that people around you who are aiming down, we'll do is think, oh, you, you really, you think you're so much better than we are? Do you really think that you and your fancy God damn plans? It's like we're going to put every psychological obstacle we can possibly think of in your way because if you succeed even in something that trivial, you shed a very dim light on our existence and so we're going to put, we're going to do everything we can to take you out, and so this people think, oh, well, it's cleaning your room. That's just a cliche. It's like, yeah, really? I just go ahead and try it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:17       You see how much of a cliche that is and if you've got your room in order, then put your office in order. See, and then you're going to encounter. The soon as you do that, you step out into the social world. You're going to encounter that antipathy between men and women. You're going to encounter the identity politics in the workplace. You're going to encounter how you regulate your sexual morality while you're working with people of the opposite sex. You're going to encounter the ethics that are necessary to move your business forward. It's like the whole. It's a microcosm. It really is. And so to take those microcosmic caused him seriously. Well, that's what I'm asking people to do and I'm saying, look, it isn't only about you being happy. It's like, yeah, whatever, pap. There's lots of times in your life you're not going to be happy, and so that's not gonna work.

Speaker 3:          01:01:03       You want to have something meaningful that's the boat that will take you through the storm, right when you batten down the hatches, but there's more ads isn't even that. It isn't even me. A meaningful, engaged life. We'll see you through the catastrophes even though that's a big deal, right? That's a great proposition. And I really believe it's true because you can say to yourself, yeah, it's worth it. Right, right and great. And, but there's the other part of it too, which is don't be thinking that your errors aren't linked to hell because they are. If you look at what happened in the 20th century, the brilliant commentators on the, on the 20th century, totalitarian states and all of their atrocities said the same thing over and over. It isn't top down evil leader manipulating innocent masses. That's not it. It's the moral failings of every single individual unwilling to say their truth, unwilling to act out what they know to be right that accumulate and produce the catastrophic state. And so when you're fussing about with your life, when you're not manifesting your potential, when you're falsifying your speech and your auctions in the service of short term expedience, you are working to bring about hell on earth. And that's true. It's true. Literally. And then it's true. It's.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       I suspect it's also true metaphorically. And that's a real truth man. When you get the literal and metaphorical working at the same time, it's like that's, that's real. So it isn't just that you have to fix up yourself so that you know you can have a better life. It's like, who cares about you for a moment? You know, it's, you have to fix up your life because if you don't, every time you make a mistake that you know to be a mistake, you are leading the world toward hell. And I believe that. I think it's true. Well, Jordan Peterson's book is 12 rules for life. Uh, honestly, I, we could do this all day long and will certainly have you back. I really appreciate the time. There's a reason so many people follow Jordan. There is some reason so many people are buying this book. The book is fantastic and his other book maps meeting is also fantastic, so they'll get a copy of that as well. Jordan, thanks so much for stopping by. I really appreciate it. Thanks Ben. It was great.
