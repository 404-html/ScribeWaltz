Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi everybody. So first I'd like to thank all of my viewers and listeners for their attention and support. It's been absolutely overwhelming. I still haven't reconciled myself to it, but so far so good. And I hope to continue to produce content that strikes a chord. And I would also like to thank my patrons supporters who have been extraordinarily generous and helpful and whose support has enabled many of the projects that I'm going to discuss today. So here's what's been happening and what's going to happen over the next couple of months. The first thing I'd like to announce is the release today of my new youtube channel called Jordan B. Peterson clips. It will feature clips that are five to 15 minutes long, some of which will be original and some of which will be derived from youtube videos that have already been posted. It's not obvious what the optimal length is for a youtube video.

Speaker 1:          00:59          It's new technology. And so my team and I are experimenting with videos of different lengths to see what might be optimal. So we plan to release two to three videos a week on that. And so, uh, that's Jordan B. Peterson clips and thank you to Gillian Vardy who's going to be my daughter in law. She's engaged to my son Julian, who's also helping on this project. And also my daughter Mikayla, who is about to have a baby in about a week. So they're all doing the editing and setting up the channel. And so thank you very much to them for the hard work. And so that's the first announcement. The second thing I would like to announce is the release, sometimes later this month of a new website that will enable students to enter their course descriptions of their university courses and perhaps their high school courses as well, along with the professor's name, the discipline and the university.

Speaker 1:          01:52          And the website has an artificial intelligence corps that will do a linguistic analysis of the content of the course description and rate it as postmodern, neo, Marxist or not. And so if you're interested in taking postmodern neo Marxist courses in the university and undergoing that pathway of cult like indoctrination, then you can use the website to do that. And if you'd like to avoid that and get yourself a classical education and learn to speak and write and communicate and thank and familiarize yourself with the great works of civilization, then you can use it to do that. So we're hoping that that will be an extraordinarily useful website. And the overarching goal in part facilitated by that website is to cut the enrollment in postmodern Neil Marxist courses of indoctrination in university across the Western world by 75% over the next five years. So that's announcement number two.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Announcement number three is that we're going to release a psychometrically valid personality test called the big five aspects scale, and it's online form within the next month. So you'll be able to go there and do a five factor analysis of your own personality that will give you your ratings for extroversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, as well as breaking each of those down into two aspects. So for extroversion, that's assertiveness and enthusiasm. For neuroticism, it's withdrawal and volatility. For agreeableness, it's compassion and politeness for openness, its openness proper, which is interest in aesthetics and interest in ideas. That's intellect. So openness will break down into openness and intellect and finally conscientiousness into industriousness and orderliness. And that will enable you to receive a report on your personality that will detail how you compare to other people in terms of a percentile on each of those five major trait dimensions and the 10 subsidiary dimensions.

Speaker 1:          03:51          We will also soon after release a couples or dyad form of the same test so that once you take the test, you can have a friend take it or a sister or a brother or a child or a parent or an employee for that matter. And it will give you each a report on your respective personalities but will also inform you as to your similarities and differences and where you were clashing, where you won't and what the basis for your misunderstandings might be and how to work through them. And so that's the third announcement. And then for the fourth announcement, you may know that we've already created a set of programs called the self authoring suite that helps adults right about their past experiences, analyze their personalities in written form. That's different than getting a personality report and make a plan for the future. The future authoring program has helped university students increase the probability of staying in their courses by about 30% and increased their grade point averages by about 25%.

Speaker 1:          04:50          We're going to release a high school version of that at the beginning of September. So we're really looking forward to that and that that will take elements of the past authoring, president authoring and future authoring and make them all accessible to high school students who will be asked to look three to six months down the road in terms of character development and future plans. And then finally, I'm just putting the finishing touches on my book, 12 rules for life, an antidote to chaos, which will be published by Penguin Random House Canada and released January 9th, 2018. And I'm hoping that that book will provide further background information regarding the sorts of things that I've been discussing in my youtube lectures, including the biblical series and uh, provide an introduction to my ideas that substantially more straightforward and, and public friendly, let's say. Then my previous book, maps of meaning. So that's the announcement stream.

Speaker 1:          05:44          So here, here it all is. In summary, I've launched a new youtube channel, Jordan B. Peterson clips. Uh, there'll be three to five videos a week. Going up on that. From five to five minutes long, we're going to launch a postmodern Marxists content analyzer and consumer information site for university students who wish to avoid being indoctrinated by the radical leftists who've taken over the humanities. And we're hoping that that will help transform the universities back into something approximating what they should be. We're going to release the big five aspect scale, which will enable people to get an accurate indication of their personality along the big five dimensions and also break each of the big five down into two canonical aspects. We've developed a high school self authoring suite that should come out in September, that'll help high school students write about themselves and understand who they are and start planning for the future. And I'm putting the finishing touches on my book, 12 rules for life, an antidote to chaos that's already available by the way for preorder at Amazon. So, uh, thank you very much and I hope that you enjoyed the new channel and also that you find these programs that we're developing useful and practical and that they help you put yourselves together and lead productive and meaningful and high quality lives with the least amount of tragedy and suffering possible. That would be really good. So thanks very much. Bye. Bye.
