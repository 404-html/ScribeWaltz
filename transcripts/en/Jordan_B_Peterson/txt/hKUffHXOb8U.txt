Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Welcome to the fence planers. I'm Danielle crittendon and I'm Christina Hoff summers and we are thrilled to have the father of all mansplainers in our studio today. I think he's actually more of a man whisperer. Yes, a man whisperer. I'm the mad genius behind the intellectual dark web, whatever. Welcome to the FIMS planers Jordan Peterson. Thank you very much. So delighted to have you and it's an honor to have you honor. It's an Ode to our listeners. We're recording this in front of a live audience at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC where Christina is a resident scholar and there'll be video of the podcast as well and we will let you know where to find that when it's ready and we're also grateful to Aei every week for the use of its recording studio for the podcast and now for an introduction though he needs no introduction to the people here, but Jordan Peterson is a professor at the University of Toronto and author of many books and and poster of many fantastic lecturers and his most recent book has. I can't keep track of how many languages it's been translated into and the sales. Just a phenomenally successful book tour. In fact, my first question is really about your tour. You look pretty good for somebody who's visited what, 100 cities in the past since January 23rd. I don't know how you do it and mostly flying.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       What do you do for fun? What do you ever get to relax in brief moments and what do you do? Go on twitter and

Speaker 2:          00:01:42       good. Although I've been qualified that is relaxing and I tried to forestall that temptation as much as possible. Well, I have the automotive bit of time that I spend with my wife. She does travel with me and so, you know, we've had, we, we try to take some time to walk around the cities that we're in, um, and see what we can. It's, we're usually not at any given place for more than a day or two and they're usually pretty packed up with, well, whatever is associated with the lecture. And then with press that the publishers usually arrange.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       Well, I heard you interviewed in Sweden in Stockholm and you were, you had a half an hour to visit the city with your wife and you loved it, but that, you know, it's true

Speaker 2:          00:02:26       breaks where you get them. Well, the thing is is that the, the lecture tour is unbelievably positive and a lot of this is, is ridiculously positive, you know, like, so if I'm going out on the streets now or in cafes or you know, airports, I meet people all the time and they're always polite and they're always happy to see me and they always have some very touching story to relate and then the audiences themselves are very positively predisposed to whatever it is that doing together. And so that makes it a lot easier to stay motivated and, and to continue right now. I mean it's demanding because everything's scheduled so tightly and, and I do a different lecture every night, every, every time I go,

Speaker 3:          00:03:18       I find that amazing because I get a lot of lectures that I anguish over every word. And then I have another one and you go up without notes.

Speaker 2:          00:03:27       Yeah. Well, I have a large collection of things that I know what, how to talk about and usually what I try to do is to formulate a problem before the lecture so I'm addressing a specific problem and then I can track how I would set up the argument and then I walked through it, but part of it's also an attempt to formulate the argument on the fly, you know, to, to make the question what would you say to formulate it more precisely and to make a more precise and engaging answer and then I can use the audience to judge whether or not that's, that's happening. And so it's also a real challenge to do that. So I enjoyed that and it's a excellent intellectual workout and I've been recording the lectures and I've been using fair some of them to write the first draft of the chapters for my next book and for books after that. And so, you know, I'm, I'm able to maximize the, what would you say that utility of doing this at each event and my wife seems to be particularly well suited to traveling like that. She actually enjoys it quite a bit and is a very stable person and so that's also helpful. So, uh, and, and, you know, it's nice to have an extra brain along because things are scheduled so tightly that we don't ever have any room for error.

Speaker 3:          00:04:46       Yes. Well, we're going to, I can't, I don't know how intellectually rigorous we plan to be with you today because we know that when ever you on one of these platform, you're talking about your ideas, but on the fence planners, we want to hear more, a little bit more about Jordan Peterson, the man desk desperately and definitely want to hear about your wife Tammy, and also you're so well known for your views on men or how your ideas have been taken up. So enthusiastic or by young men, but we want to talk to about women. Yep. That's good. So, but one of the things you and I share is that we both grew up in Canada. I promise, Christine, I would not do my Canadian accent. So while you were here, but you grew up in rural Alberta. I grew up in Toronto. Um, and you are what the country's most famous guru now since Marshall Mcluhan, m and a, but it's the fact that you came from Canada, have any effect on your views, do you think, has it formed you in any way? I mean, what did, what would it, what would it be the same if you think you'd grown in rural Texas?

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       How is Canada contributed to your worldview? She's always looking to the Canadian Angle Canada. So in Canada,

Speaker 2:          00:06:08       well I think is a particular part of Canada I grew up in probably was formative to some degree. I mean the town I grew up in was only 50 years old and the particular part of the world that I grew up in was really the last settled part of the North American prairie. This was outside of Edmonton, correct? Both 400 miles north of Edmonton. Oh, 400 years.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       Yeah. Yeah, it's right at the tip of the short, short, short. So the prairie,

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       the prairie stretches up that far north. It's stretches up farther north in Alberta than it does anywhere else in the North American continent. And so we were at the tip of viable farming essentially, and so it was, um, it was a new place and it was a rather raw place and it was, it was a rather harsh place in many ways, especially because of the winter and it was fundamentally a working class place, although a prosperous working class place, right. Because most of the industry there was related to the oil and gas industry on. Although it was cyclical when things were good working class people could make a very good living. This was during the whole. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       that's great. I to be a kid in 400 miles outside a small town. But yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:07:21       I liked it when I was a kid. I, I wouldn't say it was as fun when I was a teenager. Um, but I'm not convinced that, you know, the majority of people who are teenagers necessarily have the most wonderful time of it. Um, I think adults often look backwards at the pass through rose colored glasses. I think that's what the cartoonist trudeau accused Reagan of doing continually. Gary,

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       Mr. No, no, definitely not. Used for it in your book was teenage wasteland? Yeah, what you call it, but yeah, but it's Canadianness does. How does that form you or affected you, if at all? Maybe it didn't.

Speaker 2:          00:08:07       It's hard to say. I mean I've lived in lots of different parts of Canada now and and Canada does quite different. I lived in Alberta for a while and it had this particular flavor of existence. I mean mostly in fairview. I was striving to leave [inaudible] and to move ahead let's say, or two moves, I hesitate to say up, but somewhere different somewhere more urban, but that's the case with many people. I mean the small towns all across the West in theU , s and Canada are dying. They're down to nothing because everyone's moved to the cities. I lived in Montreal for a good while and that was interesting because it was a very, very different culture. It was a culture that was to some degree stratified by language and by class. None of that was true in Alberta because it was so new that there is no class. Right. So that was quite

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       interesting. You worked what I loved. I pulled a passage because I think as you say, people are born in small places everywhere and someone to leave and some don't. You said I wanted to be elsewhere. I wasn't the only one. Everyone who eventually left the fairview I grew up knew they were leaving by the age of 12 I knew and my wife who grew up with me on the same street knew. What was that thing? What would you call that? What's the thing that makes you want to leave and sets you off? Because you point out there was no class system. Education was cheap in Canada compared to them. It wasn't ego, it wasn't cost. It was stopping people from a middle class or you other

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       teacher. And my wouldn't. My mother was a librarian. The Bush, you're trained as a nurse. So, you know, we had a comfortable, I would say a suburban lifestyle essentially, you know, um, moderate, middle class suburban lifestyle. That's what fair have you looked like? It looked like a suburb that was built mostly in the ninth, say between the 19 fifties in the 19 seventies. So

Speaker 3:          00:09:56       the young Jordan and the then young Tammy, and you'll have to tell us that story, how you met but wanted, wanted more.

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       Well, you know, I think that's one thing that is different to some degree about class. Um, my father and my mother had both left the towns they were from and they were forward future looking people and you know, most of my friends who quit school and who didn't attend university, they didn't have,

Speaker 2:          00:10:25       they didn't have that sense. I would say that more developed sense of a world outside of what they knew. And the other thing is that my, my father took us on long trips when I was a kid. He was a teacher and so he had summer holidays and we drove all over western Canada and down into theU , s long driving trips, thousands of miles. And you know, that also gave us the sense that the world was a bigger place. But I knew way before I was 12. I believe that I was off at least to university. And I think generally in your family, if you're liable to go to university, people don't even really talk about it. It's just a given that that's what's going to happen. It's something that you take in with every breath almost. It's, it's an and it's often an unspoken expectation and maybe people make casual reference like well when you go to college, but it's not like there's a question about it. Whereas if you're from a working class background, especially if your family hasn't pursued postsecondary education that isn't in the realm of unspoken or spoken expectation. And it wasn't like, like lots of my friends, including many of them who dropped out before they hit high school, they weren't by, they were by no means the dumbest people in the class. Like they were plenty smart but they weren't oriented towards the idea of pursuing a career that involved intellectual.

Speaker 2:          00:11:51       What intellectual engagement wasn't in their worldview. And you know, when you hear people on the, let's say more socialist end of the distribution, talk about barriers to education. They are often talk about cost and sometimes cost is a barrier. And, and, and it's more the merrier. Yeah. And it's more of a barrier, although there's still plenty of community colleges and state colleges where you can get educated for a perfectly reasonable amount of money. But for my friends, it was never a reason that money was never a reason. They didn't pursue post secondary education. It was more like a truncated view of time, I would say, you know, there was more of an emphasis on the here and now and there were jobs the plenty. I guess there also that. Yeah. Yeah. And well paying jobs, like it wasn't obvious that you were in better shape economically to go to university.

Speaker 2:          00:12:41       They have. Yeah. Well, especially if you were doing something like working on the oil rigs. Right. But um, but you know, that was rough, cold, harsh work and it wasn't, it wasn't once you had an in you could stay employed, but it wasn't that easy to land an entry level job either. And so, um, yeah, well it was wise for lots of work. He caused people to work in those jobs because they were unbelievably lucrative. So, and they should have been because they were very difficult and dangerous and frigid cold and, and, and rough. So, you know, it's not like the people didn't earn your money. Let's just tell us quickly how you met your wife. You were, you met her when you were seven or eight, or in grade three and grade three? Yeah. And you, did you fall in love with her in grade three? Grade three, yeah. And was it mutual?

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       She wouldn't, she wouldn't admit it if it was. There were lots of the boys in grade three were in love with her. She had a whole little crew of guys that were perfectly willing to follow her around and she was perfectly willing to exploit that. She very good at it. Yeah. She was very popular. Little girl. Wonderful. That you met his children. We were friends for a long time. You know, we used to play chess together and croquet and she is a vicious croquet player. She would, I don't know if you've ever played croquet, but if it's, if your balls touch then you can stand on Ireson wack it and then the other person's ball will vanish off into the stratosphere and she liked to knock it all the way down the street and then she'd laugh and so she, she always had a good sense of, of good vicious sense of humor is one of the things I actually admired about my wife when we're not, when we've had our verbal disputes, which you know, have certainly happened. She can string together a sequence of insults that. So hair racing that you have to laugh. It's like, did she have brothers? She did. She has a brother much older, eight years older, but he's quite a peaceful person and she had two brothers can't seem to get along with guys where they show love and affection by

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       insults and jabs and jeers. And if you and I had brother and I sort of learned, okay, I can, but if you don't have brothers, girls like, oh, that's so rude. That's so, so she was. Yeah. Well, she, she, she has a naturally or maybe case she came by it naturally in twists. She lost her father is,

Speaker 2:          00:15:10       are quite sharp, witted and, and, and um, well he was a real town character. He's still alive and he was a real character in the tone, real hyper extrovert. Everybody knew him and he had a pretty good width on them and she had some of that while it still does have some of that, so she was a side from her humor and her

Speaker 3:          00:15:32       ability to whack balls and I just don't want to go further on that description, that many, many things that tells us about you. What else brought, what else attract. I mean you've known her pretty much your whole life, so some of the other qualities that not just attracted you but enable you to sustain. I mean, I think every young person in this room will want to know, and maybe there isn't one, but what's the secret? What's it like to be with someone that long? How do you sustain that?

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       We're fortunate. Some of it's, some of it's good fortune. When I would say this is true, I've watched people in their relationships, no personally for a long time, but also as a professional because I've done a lot of clinical counseling and I mean there's some things that need to be a given about the relationship. I would say it doesn't hurt to find the other person very attractive, you know, and that's a mysterious thing where we're not exactly sure what it is that produces, let's say chemistry between people. Although chemistry is definitely part of what produces it. There's subtle things that attract people to one another that are way below the level of consciousness. So for example, women don't like the older men who have rh blood factors. Who if they had children with would be likely to produce a stillborn infant.

Speaker 3:          00:16:49       Well that's definitely a category on match.com. Well, it's so strange though, because you know, that's a good question. And you know, you know, by older apparently, and so there's all wearing Cologne then it would depend on what type of Cologne smell is very

Speaker 2:          00:17:12       strange sense and it's very deeply tied to very profound emotions including memory. And so you find people attractive for reasons that you can't always determine. And so, so that, that was part of it. I mean I've always found her very attractive and that continues and I liked her combativeness, you know, like I think that there's, you want someone I think in a relationship that you can spar with and it's partly because you have hard problems to solve and if the person you're with isn't willing to put forward their opinion, then you only have half the cognitive power that you would otherwise have now. And hopefully you find someone who's interestingly different from you, like not so different that you can't communicate and you have to be careful of that. But interestingly different. And then hopefully they have the ability and the will to express their opinion.

Speaker 2:          00:18:12       And then all, then it's, you know, then then your interests stays heightened and there has to be that tension in a relationship. You know, people think, well I want to get along perfectly with my partner. It's like, no, you probably don't. You just get bored and then you go looking for trouble. And so you want a little bit of trouble in the relationship and the little bit of mystery and a little bit of combat of medicine and the ability to exchange opinions forthrightly and, and I trust her, which is a huge element. I mean, when, when we finally did decide to get together permanently, we're both in our later twenties and, you know, one of the things that I had learned by that point and insisted to her about was that we had to tell each other the truth and she took to that wholeheartedly, you know, and um, for better and for worse because truths can be harsh.

Speaker 3:          00:19:12       Does that include like does this outfit? Yeah. Well, the truthful answer to that is I don't answer questions that are likely to get me in trouble. So my, I have a son who will answer honestly, and it's infuriating, but then I realized if you want the truth, talk to Tamworth. Well that's the thing, you know, it's, it's useful to know the truth is empowering truth tellers are charismatic. And actually both my sons are like brutally honest, which is disconcerting. Yeah. But it's, I can see that it has made them very formidable. And, and because of that, people trust them and friendships and just, it gives them the. And you've written a lot about this.

Speaker 2:          00:19:57       Well, you know, if, if I tell my wife that she looks good in an outfit, she knows that I mean it. Yeah. And so there's some utility.

Speaker 3:          00:20:04       No. And then if you're silent and say I don't answer her questions that she goes and she goes, well sometimes sometimes, you know, she'll say, you know, do you like this and all Keller that I don't. And, and you know, and that really

Speaker 2:          00:20:16       make her happy in the moment. Right. But, but if I do say I like it, she knows that I mean in, and you know, I actually liked her sense of style a lot. So it turns out that 90 percent of the time it's pretty easy for me to say, look, I think you look great and mean it. And uh, you know, she's a fairly harsh standard bearer to like, she's, she's insisted that I stay in whatever reasonable physical shape I happened to be in, you know, that was, that was something that she's very demanding of and I would say that it's the same my side and we've been good at negotiating, which is, you know, what do you want from a partner? Fundamentally, what, what do you want need, I mean, the first thing is that I'll hopefully you, like I said, you're blessed with the fact that you find each other attractive and I think it's very difficult for the relationship to begin or proceed or sustain itself without that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:12       But having that, then what do you want? While you want someone that you can trust, you want someone that you can build a view of the future with and you want someone that you can negotiate with. And that's very hard to negotiate with people because they have to tell you what they think. They have to know what they want or figure it out. They have to tell you what they want. They have to be satisfied when they get what they want, which is also a very difficult thing to manage and you have to continually update that because your life goes through different stages and well in your attraction wanes as we all know it are

Speaker 3:          00:21:45       agent live not fatally necessarily for yourself but but no, but you will go. I mean you will not be 25 forever so.

Speaker 2:          00:21:54       So that that has to be renegotiated. Yeah, well when you have to work at that too, you know, and that's something that people also don't understand because they tend to think that, well, the that all romantic interaction should be spontaneous. It's like, well, if that's your theory, then you might as well just give up right now if you're going to get married because that like the only reason you can think that is because you don't have enough responsibility to make romantic entanglement virtually impossible. And what happens when you're married, especially when you have little kids, is that, and you both have a job, let's say, is you're so busy that the probability that you're going to find time for spontaneous mutual interaction is decreased to zero. And so if that's what you're hoping for, then you're never gonna have it. And so what you have to do is you have to make time for each other and you know if you're dating, when you're establishing a relationship while you put some effort into it, do you know you, you decide that you're going to go out for dinner and you dress up to some degree and you know you try to present yourself to each other in some halfways mutually acceptable manner and you hope that there's going to be a positive consequence of that, that you're going to find each other attractive.

Speaker 2:          00:23:03       But then as people somehow think that once they're married, that the same amount of effort isn't necessary. And that's wrong. I would say more effort is necessary on the same front end. And you have to think it through. It's like, you know, if you don't want to be bitter about the intimate element of your relationship, how much time do you have to spend together each week, and my, my rule of thumb sort of derived from clinical observations is that you need to spend 90 minutes a week with your partner talking and that means you're telling each other about your life and staying in touch, you know, so that you each know what the other is up to and you're discussing what needs to be done, keep the household running smoothly and you're laying out some mutually acceptable vision of how the next week or the next months are going to go together.

Speaker 2:          00:23:52       Right? So that, that keeps your narratives locked together. Like a, like the strands in a rope. You need that for 90 minutes or you drift apart and you need to spend intimate time together at least once a week and probably more like twice. And that has to be negotiated. And if you don't negotiate it and if you don't make it a priority, then it won't happen in all likelihood. And then, well, well then you don't have it. And that's a catastrophe because there's not that many things in life that are intrinsically, what would you say, engaging and meaningful and pleasurable and also bonding all of that. And if you let that go, then well part of you dies and part of the relationship dies and while then there's always the possibility of becoming attracted by alternative entanglement, which, which you would do if you had any spirit left.

Speaker 2:          00:24:42       Right? I mean that's the thing is if, well, if you're not, if you're. If your relationship at home is entirely unsatisfying sexually, what are you supposed to do with that? Nothing is supposed to just bear it in one way. The answer is yes because it's your marriage, but another way as well, that's all the fight you've got in you. You're going to just let the erotic element of your life die and accept everything that goes along with that because you're not willing to cause a bit of trouble to ensure that it's maintained and you know, and we're not very good at thinking these things through consciously. I mean, people are bad at negotiating period as far as I can tell, but they're particularly bad at negotiating things that are deeply private. How much do you want your partner to know about you anyways? It takes a lot of trust to have a real conversation about what you need and want.

Speaker 1:          00:25:35       Now you have it in the press. People read that you are a. You have a following of young men and I went to hear your lecture and Washington DC and there were a lot of women there and your book, first of all, men don't buy books that often compared to women, so I'm presuming you have a lot of female readers and I found it, Danielle and I found it completely readable and it wasn't uncommon for men. It was more like a delusional desire on the part of the radical leftists that the only people that could possibly be attracted to me or angry men. Exactly. It'd be better if they were angry young white men, you know, because then that fits the narrative. Particularly, there's a way you have a diverse audience and diverse following, including many women and they're also not particularly angry. I mean, I've talked to 200 using the anger. That's the point of your book is stop being angry. Stop being resentful. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:26:32       Of resentment is that. That's absolutely crippling. Resentment. Just zenman deceit, arrogance. That's part of. I'm writing another book and one of the rules is don't allow yourself to

Speaker 1:          00:26:45       resentful receiptful, deceitful and arrogant fingers together. Yeah, but it could be rad if you just. Well, that's supposed to be a good thing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:56       There's been 250,000 people, as I said, come to the lectures and there hasn't been a single negative incident.

Speaker 1:          00:27:02       Not One. This is what I find fascinating is that I found you early on. I said I'd had no idea you were just that. It was like butch cassidy and the Sundance kid. Like who is that guy? Who is that guy? Like you were pretty good and we were covering a lot of the same topics later on. Yeah. Wow. And then, you know, I found out who you were. What is astonishing to me is that there's this amazing, it just split between the positivity of your audience, the diversity of your audience, the, the, the, the intellectual content of your message and then you get with a snarky journalist with an agenda. And I'm not mentioning names, but no, no, this, this young woman from a Gq and it was just me on, so it was just like lady. Gotcha, Gotcha, Gotcha. For we don't want to blame the BBC saint and then I. and she seemed, you know, like as often she seemed intelligent and capable of insight up to a point, but it's almost as if something had seized her mind and show you something, had something new. But I think people, it can be a poly says that a whole generation, some of our most talented young women are incapable of thought because of this. I thought maybe you can just an openness to she couldn't and you were saying completely like interesting, fascinating, original things even to me who've studied these topics and. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:28:41       No, it was quite the day. So I went to Baltimore. You survived it very well, but it just made me think a lot that day because I went there and I had to go out of my way to do it. Not that I'm complaining, but there's a reason for saying that, you know, so I got there in Baltimore. Yeah. Well I was talking in Baltimore, so. Okay. So, so, um, the aquarium and I showed up to the, to the hotel room where this was all occurring and you know, what you expect generally speaking, even from journalists who aren't, you know, who are more of the attack dog variety or who may be, aren't positively predisposed to you ideologically or personally, you expect a certain modicum of professional politeness. Right. Because while you don't have to be there and you came and you and you accepted an invitation and, and all of that.

Speaker 2:          00:29:29       And so even with the channel for journalists, Kathy Newman, she was quite polite and, and forthcoming in the, in the green room before the interview, you know, so she would have had at least that professional persona, which is, it's not nothing right there. There's something to be said for, for going through the motions professionally in an inappropriate manner, but when I walked into the hotel room in Baltimore, it was obvious that this interviewer had already made up her mind about me 100 percent and that she was absolutely, you know, negatively predisposed to me with a personal animus. Animus is exactly the right word. There was about a half an hour photography session because it was Gq and so I was in that atmosphere. The photographers were fine. I was in that atmosphere for about 45 minutes before we started to talk and part of the reason that I'm so I'm not as calm during that interview is are usually I'm, I'm a little bit harsher and the reason for that is that, you know, it just started off instantly combative and, and what I, what I should have done, you see, it's very, very difficult to be awake enough to do these things properly and they interview progressed fine.

Speaker 2:          00:30:47       Although by the end of it, I thought that I had maybe done enough interviews for awhile because I didn't think I had regulated my temper as well. During that interview as I might've, I wish. Well so bad.

Speaker 3:          00:30:59       So you were getting it and then she brought up a question about anger and I just saw you kind of adjust and then after that it was smooth sailing.

Speaker 2:          00:31:07       Well that's good because it was touch and go, you know, and I thought, boy, you know, maybe you're running out of patients. Maybe you know, maybe it's time to dial back on the interviews because you know, I've had many interviews like that and they're very. I find them like it takes me like three days to recover from an interview.

Speaker 3:          00:31:24       You start thinking yourself like what I should've said, I should've said that, and I dragged myself mad. No, but you did very well. But it's so interesting that what it told me was how parochial she was and she lives in her own little world, isn't it? More a little bit about the ideology of our time and Gosh, you encountered this everywhere and I used to write about this wisely. I would. I would encounter it. I mean, I think part of the issue is that you will acknowledge that there are differences between the sexes. That seems to be, I know that's a hell of a heresy. Heresy because when I was reading your book, um, there's nothing about it that is anti female. In fact, you, you do a lot of examination of the Adam and Eve story and you have this wonderful passage about like Adam being the originally agreed, okay.

Speaker 4:          00:32:18       The man who throws the woman under the sea, a return fault do you made her really funny. So, so, so there's nothing in you

Speaker 3:          00:32:31       this and the rules such as they are, you know, they seem very common sensical. They could apply to anyone. Um, so is that a fair

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       surmise of why you get so attacked a that just the very fact that you're willing to speak about the sexes as being not unequal but different but equal? Yeah. Well, you know what, I would say that that's part of it because there's a threat there. So one of the things that happened when I was in Scandinavia, I just wrote a column about this actually, um, was interesting being in Scandinavia, especially in Sweden because they've pushed the equality of opportunity doctrine farther than any other country in the world today. It almost started there like in the UN and the original charter. The Swedes were there and they, they've never given us. No, no. And so, and the week that I was there was the same week that two articles were published on gender differences, um, in, in temperament and an interest in the biggest sex differences that we know of that aren't morphological are in interest.

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       So women are more interested in people by and large and men are more interested in things by and large. And the difference is actually large. It's one standard deviation. And so that means if you're a man, you would have to be more interested in people than 85 percent of men to be as interested as 50 percent of women. And if you're a woman, you'd have to be more interested in things than 85 percent of women to be as interested as the 50th percentile male. So the difference is actually quite substantial and it's certainly large enough to drive occupational choice differences and it explains a lot of configuration of people in the workplace. Absolutely. Well, and you know, we're approach approaching parody in terms of workplace overall workplace distribution of women, but there's massive differences in occupational choice. Like it's very interesting, for example, to go to the website of the US labor department and look at male and female dominated industries.

Speaker 2:          00:34:42       And you know, there's the top 10 male dominated industries have basically zero women in the brick layers being one of the people. There are people three zones according to Camille Paglia that you find is a lot of men in the people freeze up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the women are in. You ask a group of women and men, would you rather spend the next three weeks taking apart a machine and putting it together or helping a group of people work out their problems and the pool of people who want to do them, she, it's just far more men than women. There's more men in women dominated industries than there are women and men dominated industries at the extreme. So that's like nursing. Nursing is way more male nurses, brick layers. I've studied these male nurses and they already, you know, gender activists are upset because they earn more than women.

Speaker 2:          00:35:35       And a professor of nursing at University of Pennsylvania tried to find out why and she found out they immediately find out what's the best paying field subfield. So they go into like nurse anesthesiology, it pays a lot more than men are there and disproportionate number and they're willing to work in insane hours. They're far more willing to move to a higher same thing. Feral phone with, with gender differences is that men are more willing to move million or more. They're more willing to, to, uh, work outside. They're more willing to take on dangerous tasks. They're more likely to work in scalable industries, so we'd like you can't scale personal care. It's really very. It's very, very difficult. They're much less likely to work part time if they have small businesses, they're much more likely to work full time in the small business rather than this than part time.

Speaker 2:          00:36:22       And I mean women have their reasons to want to work part time and feral also pointed out that if you work 10 percent longer hours, you make 40 percent more money. Your non linear nonlinear return on overtime had something that's really useful to know, you know, in terms of your career to an employer. They have some also marks you out, you know, like if you have 10 employees and they're all doing a reasonable job, let's say, but one of them is working an extra half an hour a day or 45 minutes a day and you can observe that everyday. Then that gives them an edge with regards to potential promotion and so. And the return on those edges is nonlinear. And so anyways, so I went to Scandinavia and it was the same week that two studies were released showing what had already been established beyond a shadow of a doubt that the personality differences between men and women and the differences in interest as well actually get bigger as your society gets richer and as it gets more egalitarian and, and not just a little bit either.

Speaker 2:          00:37:20       That's the other thing that's so interesting is you might think, well the effect is it's the opposite of what the social constructionists would predict. First of all. So that's the first thing to point out is it's not only that their hypothesis wasn't supported, it was decidedly refuted and, and none of them have come to terms with that. And, and, and it's not a small effect. The, the, the difference between personality between men and women in Scandinavia is a lot larger than it is in non egalitarianism, rural but true in the United States. And the richer the democratic, your household demographic, your household, the more likely the woman is to take time out and be at home with, right? Because you can afford to do it. And she can afford to major in od, you know, low paying fields, like a feminist dance therapy. The other thing you see too is that one of the things that's also interesting I think is that, you know, there's this idea that made that marriage is a patriarchal institution, you know, that's primarily put there for the, for the utility of the, of the mail and think, well, like I think that's complete bloody rubbish.

Speaker 2:          00:38:27       And I don't think there's any evidence to support it at all. But I think the best counter evidence is that, well if that's the case, then rich people shouldn't be getting married because they don't have to oppress themselves. But the truth of the matter is is that the higher your demographic position, the more likely you are to be married. So marriage is falling apart among the more likely the wife is staying home and not. I mean she has all sorts of pursuits but

Speaker 3:          00:38:52       wasn't. She's not. Well, there's an old saying, anyone, any woman who marries for money earns it. But now let me just. Okay. This is where you might get in a little trouble because in your book you call men order and women chaos, and you say order. The known appears symbolically associated with masculinity and chaos. The Eternal Feminine is also the crushing force of sexual selection. Yeah. What's up with that chaotic chaos? Men and women net

Speaker 2:          00:39:20       or order and chaos. It's masculinity and femininity symbolically and so what's happened fundamentally is that we're. Our brains are wired for social cognition, so we're not natural. Scientists were natural sociologists. That might be a better, even though I shutter to think that that might be true, especially given the sales associate as well. That's it triggering or maybe or or maybe we're more, we're more naturally a people who observed through the lens of fiction and that what we see as the world as characterized and w the world. Obviously it's made out of men and women and children and those seem to be our fundamental cognitive categories. Masculinity, femininity and, and, and, and then the category of children and those categories have expanded to take on connotations outside of, of pure person perception. And so, you know, it's for this reason that if you go to a movie and that maybe it's a Disney animated movie, and I like to talk about those because they draw on a very deep symbolic, well, it's perfectly reasonable to see a witch that lives in the swamp because those go together like it makes sense.

Speaker 2:          00:40:37       You know, the which doesn't live in a gleaming chrome, high rise, you know, she lives in the swamp. Is that. So maybe you could just fly up. Well that's it. That's where the high rise would be better for. The brain could take off, you can take off better. But there are categories of, of symbolic association that are natural to the way we think and the fundamental elements of those categories seem to be gendered. And so this is partly why make reference to Taoism, for example. So for the Daoists, the world is made out of chaos and order and chaos is the domain that you don't understand and that emerges unpredictably, but also the domain from which new forms emerge, right? Because it's from novelty that the new way emerges. And I think the fundamental association between femininity is chaos is the association between what's unexpected and novel and what's new because new forms emerge from chaos and it's not.

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       The chaos is, is bad in order to good that that's both have their pathologies. Yes. And, and, and what you're looking for, and this is, this is the book concentrates on above all, is that you're looking constantly to find the balance between those two. So for example, formerly speaking, the domain of order is that place that you are, when what you're doing is producing the results that you want, who have produced. So imagine, imagine, think about the preconditions for not being anxious. Okay? So the preconditions are that you're constantly making predictions about what's going to happen next. And those predictions are tied tightly to your behavioral output. So you act in a certain way and you presume that a certain thing is going to happen. And if your actions produce the results that you desire, then you assume that you know where you are and you know what you're doing and that your plan is intact and that the environment is secure.

Speaker 2:          00:42:29       And that keeps her anxiety under control, that order, and then you know, maybe you're at a party and you don't know anybody and you tell a joke and everybody looks at you like what you said was not only not funny but also downright offensive and then all of a sudden you've moved from the domain of order into the domain of chaos because you thought you were somewhere and you thought you were someone and you thought you were with people that were of a certain type and you got all that wrong. And so it causes suggesting it is going to be the woman who says, I find that really offended. I'm not suggesting that, but it probably is nevermind. But women are also more sensitive to negative emotion. Right? So there is some slightly higher probability that that might be the case. But then I think women are also associated, at least in men's imaginations with nature, which is part of the chaotic domain say as opposed to culture because they're sexually selective.

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       So you gotta think what? What is nature? When we have that as a cognitive category, right? We think of the natural world, we think of nature versus culture. It's a fundamental opposition. What is nature? Well, nature is trees and landscapes and animals and all of that up, but that isn't what nature fundamentally is. Nature fundamentally is that which selects from a genetic perspective, that's nature. That's the fundamental definition of nature, and it is the case that human females are sexually selective and it's. It's a major component of human behavior, so the. The evolutionary theory, roughly speaking is that the reason we diverged from chimpanzees 8 million years ago, 7 million years ago, is at least in part because of the differences between sexual selectively between female humans and female chimpanzees. Female chimpanzees are more likely to have offspring from dominant males, but it's not because of their sexual selectivities.

Speaker 2:          00:44:30       So female chimpanzee has periods of fertility that are marked by physical, by observable physiological changes, not the case with human females. Human female ovulation is is concealed, so that's a very profound biological difference between human females and chimpanzees and the chimpanzee. Females will meet with any male, but the dominant males chased the subordinate males away, but human females are sexually selective and so and and it's not trivial facts. So you have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors. You think, well, how can that be? Well, imagine that on average, every single human female has had one child throughout the entire course of history, which is approximately correct by the way. Then imagine that half of the men had zero and the other half had to. Okay, and that's roughly the case. So half of males historically speaking, have been reproductive disasters and the reason for that is because of female sexual collectivity.

Speaker 2:          00:45:32       So it is actually the case that female humans are nature. It's not only that they're, that they're associated with nature symbolically as far as production is concerned. They are the force of nature that does the selection and so their nature in the most fundamental way and there is a chaotic element of that, at least in relationship to men and also in relationship to women. Because a lot of the female on female competition is competition. That's chaotic for the right to be sexually selective, right, not only with regards to men which drives a lot of politics, but also in relationship to each other because part of what human females do his jockey for position in the female dominance hierarchy for the top position, which is the woman who gets to be most sexually selective and so that drives female female competition and it's a different dynamic. There's similarities between female female competition and male male competition, but there are also differences and they're pronounced. So men for example, while men are more likely to compete, compete for socioeconomic status, and that's partly because that drives female mate choice. So the correlation for men between socioeconomic status and sexual success is about point six. And for women it's zero zero. In fact, it's actually slightly negative. So when that's a huge difference between men and women,

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       the anthropologists, Sarah Hrdy, h r, d, y, and, and she's like my favorite feminist theorist, although is she would say I'm a theorist who happens to be a feminist, but she studied primate behavior and she watched. She lifted the women very the the females. And we very carefully and looked at it, a chimpanzees and gazelles and found that, um, the female initially like male primatologists would look and say, oh, the females, the males are dominant in the females are so cooperative. She looked more carefully and so the females weren't exactly cooperative, like they would pass around their infants, their baby, you know, whatever they were and would find it. And so the male primatologist who say, oh, they are, they're so kind and caring. She found out that when it was not your, it was not hers. They would take a little tufts of hair, it would come out or they do something to the eyes and the baby would be injured and she saw all this violence.

Speaker 2:          00:47:58       But it was true in the status differentiation. So it's much more likely that it'll happen when a higher status female is taken care of. Lower status infant.

Speaker 1:          00:48:05       Exactly. And she said the great tragedy, but it will not tragedy. She had the reality of our species. And in fact, the subtitle for the book is that the woman who never evolved, we didn't evolve for niceness and cooperative. There's an immense competition and we can, according to her, we are, it's indelibly marked in our nature to compete for the dominant males and no doubt about that and so,

Speaker 2:          00:48:35       and that seems to cross culturally as well. That doesn't fly in a little bit in the morning. Gilda tarian societies. So instead of being exaggerated, it does flattened to some degree, right? So you could imagine that there's a biological component and the cultural component both in in, in that case, if you modify the cultural component and that seems to decrease the overall. So like, let me be more clear about this. Women are less prone to mate up across an upstate is hierarchies in Scandinavia than they are in less egalitarian countries, but there are still prone to do it. So worldwide. For example, women, young women find men who are about four years older than them, maximally attractive and they tend to mate across an upstairs hierarchies. And so one of the consequences of that, for example, is that as women have entered the workforce, they've actually driven in equality because rich women will only marry rich men. Men is riches, them or Richard. Whereas rich man will marry women who are poor than them, but women won't, and so what that means is it's another factor that's pooling wealth in the hands of fewer and fewer people

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       assortative mating now, and you just find someone with your background. You'd whereas a doctor might have once married his secretary now marries another doctor. Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:49:53       Can I ask then stepping a little bit back from primates as well, how does this selection work in the era of swiping right and left? How? What is your reaction to the way young people date today? Oh, that's a good. I was really hoping we'd get into that. I was really into the monkey, so I didn't want to interrupt. You know what? I should close off the Scandinavian discussion just by pointing out, and this is something that the scandinavians are already going to have to wrestle with, is that if you institute effective policies to promote equality opportunity, which the Scandinavians have done, you're going to produce some equality, so like a 50 slash 50 distribution of men and women in the workplace, but you're also going to exacerbate certain kinds of inequality and you can't get out of that. So you cannot have equality of opportunity and equality of outcome together.

Speaker 2:          00:50:46       They don't work together and equality of outcome. Essentially quality of outcome doctrine which is often described with the code word equity, is that at every level of every occupation, the people have to be represented by the same number that they're represented in the population. So if it's not 50 slash 50 men and women at each in each occupation I need and in each strata at each occupation, then that sort of prime fsc evidence for discrimination and for systemic discrimination. It's like, nope, sorry. You have to factor in choice and choice actually turns out to be a very important determinant. And as the society gets flatter and flatter, choice becomes a more important and more and more important determinant. And so you. So what that essentially means is that the most radical end of the left wing political agenda is logically impossible. Apart from the fact that it's impossible for a variety of other reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:51:40       And they should look at the data. I mean it, it's just a cliche now have in, in a group of activists and they'll say, oh, well we need to, in order for women to achieve equality, we need government funded daycare and we need. They have it in Sweden. Sweden has fewer women in managerial levels. The American women are ahead. In fact now they have a, they have quotas over there, so they need more female ceos and females on boards made any difference between bringing in memory American women because we're so much further ahead. So it's called the no difference in the distribution of men and women. Lower in the. It's called the Nordic paradox and say, you guys are so wonky. I want to get back. Okay. Yes. We all want to get back to get back to these monkeys. Well, I was thinking just

Speaker 2:          00:52:30       thinking this morning about. I was talking to a variety of political types and we were talking about this morning in DC. It hard to believe, hard to believe. No, I'm not. I'm not telling you a bunch of Republicans here and I'd been talking to Democrats as well, but it was mostly Republicans here and we were talking about abortion and I made a case that that's really not a very productive discussion because you're talking about a problem way too late in the sequence of problems. So by the time the discussion starts to be about abortion, there's 50 problems that have already emerged that no one has addressed and some of those problems are. The fundamental problem is how human being should regulate their sexual behavior and that's a big problem. And you think, well there's an interesting thing that's happening because you know the people on the right would say, well that's easy. It's like don't sleep around and get married and have sex with your marital partner and that'll solve the problem. So there's strictures on sexual behavior and those would be the traditional ones and what you see on the left is that there's this weird paradoxical demand, let's say that people should be allowed to express their sexuality in any manner that they choose whenever they want,

Speaker 2:          00:53:50       but that sex is so dangerous that it has to be carefully regulated at every single stage of the interaction. And so you know that many state legislatures have now followed the example of university campuses and put in affirmative consent legislation so that every move you make towards physical intimacy has to be preceded by the instantiation of a verbal contract. Essentially. It's like, what? Can I take your hand? Yes. You actually, from what I understand, you actually have to say yes, like nodding is not sufficient. And so and so each stage has to be, has to be proceeded by affirmative consent and

Speaker 1:          00:54:34       you know, which, which.

Speaker 2:          00:54:36       Well, I won't, I won't say anything about. Yeah, I will. It's desert. It's absurd to assume that that's how human intimate relationships are supposed to proceed. And then you have complicated laws emerging that are part of that that, for example, this is the case in California as I understand it, is that you cannot give affirmative consent if you're intoxicated. Okay. So you think about that. It's like what? What does that mean? It means that like a lot of sex is. This unit has been illegal for a long time. Including marital. Marital? Yes. Next to me on my honeymoon. Okay. Well that is Marie thinking. It seems. It seems to me, it seems to mean. No, I'm. It seems to me, to me the California legislation that if you have sex with your wife or husband and either of you is intoxicated, then you're either one of you or both is guilty of rape. That's what it looks like to me. Actually. I was in a debate a few years ago at the University of Virginia Law School

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       and I turned to my debate partner and said, so if what you're saying is right, um, two people can rate one another, right? She said yes. And I thought, Oh shit.

Speaker 2:          00:55:57       I mean, how can that be? Well, that's the question. Well, okay, so then I would say, well it's interesting because I think that a lot of this confusion has emerged fundamentally as a consequence of the birth control pill, so you know, because you gotta think situationally before you think ideologically or psychologically, it's like, it seems to me that the 20th century will be remembered for the hydrogen bomb, the transistor and the birth control and those are unbelievably radical technological innovations and maybe the most common. Yeah, but on my fair lady, just dependent on the transistor so that, that's the big technological innovation that spawned all that. And of the three I would say that the birth control pill is probably the bigger hydrogen bomb. So because it, it changed the fundamental biological nature of women and men and because it gave women for the first time in biological history the, the option of choosing their reproductive status. And that's, that's, that's abs. Well, yes and no. Like, yes, we like it, but it's not something that's come without a tremendous.

Speaker 2:          00:57:13       Well it's come with a fellow. Can you, have you been reading align with? No, no I haven't. You'll find them interesting because he's. He writes about that I'm not, I'm not making a case for the abolition of the birth control pill by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm pointing at its complexity and so because one of the questions is, well, once you can regulate your reproductive function, what attitude should you have toward sex? And one answer might be the more of it under the more varied circumstances, the better because why not? And I would say that was actually part of the attitude that emerged in the aftermath of the birth control pill in the 19 sixties. Right. And it was, it was a reasonable response in some sense because it's such a cataclysmic change that you don't know what it implies. Well, what's the consequence of that?

Speaker 2:          00:58:02       Well, first of all, people aren't reliable enough to use birth control in an entirely reliable manner. So even though it can work at near 100 percent efficiency, you have to take it extraordinarily regularly and in a discipline manner for that to work. And so there was still the problem of unwanted pregnancy, let's say. And then there was the problem of the proliferation of sexual epidemics and that culminated in aids, which could have easily wiped all of us out but didn't. But there was other sexual epidemics that could have had the same effect. But we've, we've been fortunate enough to escape them. And then, and then more recently there's been this weird inversion, especially on the radical left that points to the reemergence of something like a set of sexual taboos, you know, like I think the idea that sex is casual and that it's a form of entertainment is I think it's an absolutely preposterous idea. I think that

Speaker 2:          00:59:05       it's, it's psychologically shallow beyond belief to hold that as a core proposition because it forces you to, first of all, if, if, if it's repetitive sex with multiple partners at it, it forces you to treat people as if they're interchangeable. And I don't see how that's good for you psychologically or for the people that you're using interchangeably. It, it implies that you can divorce sexuality from play, from the desire for a relationship, from emotional fragility, from love, from family, from responsibility, all of those things that are part and parcel of every one and I don't think you can and I don't think people's experience indicates that you can and especially on the emotional front. And I think that's partly what's driving and there's also a residual sense that there's something about sex that's fundamentally dangerous and maybe it's dangerous emotionally and personally and maybe it's dangerous socially and psychologically, which most certainly is because it's a powerful force.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       And the way the left is reacting to that is by insisting that all forms of sexual behavior are valid and, and, and that it's reasonable to manifest all of them, but that it's simultaneously so dangerous that absolutely every aspect of it has to be state regulated and in an increasingly draconian form. And so I think what needs to happen is that the left and the right have to get together and have like a real discussion about what constitutes valid sexual morality. And that's the conversation you have to have. Way before you worry about solving like the abortion debate, which is very divisive and very and very intractable.

Speaker 3:          01:00:48       Well, one of the things we talked about actually just last week on the podcast is this cover story in the Atlantic about the sexual recession amongst young people that despite the advent of the birth control pill, abortion is going down. Um, uh, it's, that there's a, there's lexus, there's less thing is going down, fewer things. And what have you looked into that you worry about that?

Speaker 2:          01:01:12       Well, if you raise the cost of something, you decrease its prevalence. You know? And, and I think that it's, it seems to be, you know, your wrists now to look up. I kinda think that it's also a reflection of the same thing that Bloomberg reported on just a few days ago. They said that across businesses, men are thinking, I'm not spending any time with a single woman that isn't, you know, associated with me in some formal manner. Like my wife. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to mentor young women. I'm not going to be in a room alone

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       because I could face career annihilation and instantly they're frightened of young women. Now, Kate Julian said that's part of it, but we can overexaggerate the part. I mean, anxiety and depression is going up amongst both young men and young women. A suicide is going up, um, that, that there's, it's, it's not just a, you know, most people I think are not. We're talking about an elite demographic who is into the consent and political correctness and workplace [inaudible] this is across the board and it's global. Um, it's, it's happening even in Sweden. It's really happening in Japan and Japan. Exactly. So

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       that speaks to, and especially in Japan, they just have people, especially young men have given up on intimacy and that having sex is actually, I mean, that had too much trouble. Sex robots. Right? Well, right, right, right. Well, my last question. Well, and there's pornography. There's basically zero risk when you allow for pornography that, that, that the men and women will sort of separate that from their actual.

Speaker 3:          01:02:46       Exactly. Maybe we were seeing a whole, I guess, collapse of intimacy, let alone sex and, and, and, and, and I don't think that's just explained by the political nature. Um, so I'd be interested in your thoughts.

Speaker 2:          01:03:01       Yeah. Well, I don't know that I don't know the literature on the decline in sexual activity well enough to know if it's valid or reliable, but I mean, I think that, you know, in a stable society you take lots of things for granted. You take, you take the fact that men and women are going to be sexually attracted to one another for granted and even though it's more fragile than it appears, you know, and it's suppressed more easily than you might think. Um, and you take the idea that men and women are going to move together towards the establishment of longterm intimate relationships for granted. But that's partly because you don't understand what invisible preconditions exists to make that self evident, you know? And when those invisible preconditions are disrupted by rapid technological or sociological change, then things shift underneath you when you don't know why.

Speaker 3:          01:03:53       A lot of it is traced to the advent of the smartphone, especially in the generation z that, that kate was explaining this to us that you could see it was broadband internet and the smartphone that led to this increasing fall off of relationship.

Speaker 2:          01:04:11       Well, maybe the abstract is more interesting than right proximal.

Speaker 4:          01:04:14       See that? I just want to. I want to know the truth. Have you ever been with somebody you loved? If I'm fascinated in all that, but you really wanted to get back to your smartphone. Has that ever happened?

Speaker 2:          01:04:24       Yeah. Well, it happens all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:04:25       Happens to me. Happens during our podcast. Tell you to put your phone. I'm, I'm researching. Very addictive, very addictive. You know, I read the other day that like they are kind of going together. The preferred method

Speaker 2:          01:04:46       method of interpersonal communication between young people now is testing rather than face to face communication.

Speaker 3:          01:04:51       Right. And the swiping that apes.

Speaker 2:          01:04:53       Well that's, that's, that's, that's a very interesting topic to the, the like the tinder phenomenon. That's right. Because that that's also a major technological revolution because what it's done, I would say for the first time is reduce the cost of rejection, two males to zero because it hides it you the only people you ever hear from people who haven't rejected

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       you, although, although they. True. But, but there was one man who had to make 300. He key actually tallied it. You had to make 300 requests, a swiping right or whatever. So I think he had the sense of, sure, sure, sure. But it's massively attenuated because you're not being humiliated. Not at all. Not at all. It's really, it's really at arm's length and you know, you can swipe very, very rapidly and so you can get all that rejection over within a very short period of time. It's like losing a video gamers or will last because it's not. I mean, not nearly as bad.

Speaker 2:          01:05:51       Yeah. So, and I don't know what tinder also reduces the. One of the other things that things that you want to think about with regards to sex, and I think this is probably particularly true for women, is that to what degree is it in women's interests to allow the cost of sex to fall to zero, because with pornography certainly does that and it just seems to me that that's not a very good longterm strategy for relationships between men and women because whatever sex is worth, the cost of zero is the wrong price and so that's, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:06:24       All right. You heard it from Bunny ranch and pay quite a bit for it. Well true, true. That's true. But

Speaker 2:          01:06:30       do you know, I've heard from a number of women what written read blog reports on their frustration with their attempts to be relatively sexually selective. Like let's say they decide that they're not going to sleep with their new partner on the first date. You know, they're frustrated by the fact that to the degree that they're being cautious in their sexual behavior, which I think is actually an admirable idea that they're instantly out competed. Especially if their partners are somewhat impulsive by women who will say yes at the drop of a hat and so, well, again, I don't think you know, it depends on what the goal is. That's the thing is that there's the short terms there, short term sexual gratification, but the literature indicates that married couples for example, or couples in a permanent long term, monogamous relationship are more sexually satisfied than single people and maybe the single people have to be parsed out into those who are sexually successful and those who aren't, but I suspect that wouldn't make that much difference, but whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       There's the utility of relatively immediate sexual gratification for whatever that's worth and the adventurousness that goes along with that. Let's say the hunt and the excitement of having a new partner and all of that and maybe even the danger that's associated with that because people like to have a little bit of danger in their life. But what's the goal? It's like what do people want? And I mean there. There's a great book called a billion wicked thoughts that was written by Google engineers and so it contains great psychology because Google engineers don't care about political correctness and they just write down what they find. They don't even notice that it's politically incorrect. Hence James Demore for example, and what they found was that women use pornography just as much as men, but the pornography that women use is verbal. It's not in logistic. And the pornographic novels essentially follow the same extraordinarily standard plot line to the degree that publishing houses like Harlequin, which was going to say it's the, it's the bodice rippers the veteran.

Speaker 2:          01:08:36       Right? So in the Harlequin series, you have the ones that were published like in the 19 seventies that are pretty tame. There's a small bit, they're pretty hot actually. Well, there's a variety. They range from. They range from red team to essentially to hardcore pornography, but the, but the plots are quite similar in the plot is, um, you know, young, relatively innocent woman finds powerful, interesting, dangerous male tames him and then they live happily ever after. And it's the beauty and the beast plot, which is a fundamental, which is to search for women on pornhub. We discovered we did an episode on porn was for women. It was getting

Speaker 3:          01:09:14       rape. Wasn't that like there's no lesbianism or at least that was your port. Yeah, that was me. Oh, okay. I don't like porn is going to the William Sonoma store. I know it is. It is female. All those losses or Bill Maher, one said that men and women should never tell one another their fantasies because when are outraged by what we say and we're totally bored by what they say. And I thought like women have kind of these scenarios and you know, I don't know Unicorns, I don't know what they're doing. Storylines, storylines, and it's just like A. I don't want to say this to you, but it is a lot of just close ups of female body parts. Yeah. Well men are much more visually oriented sexually, but now they're being shamed. I mean now that it's called the male gaze, and so there's all of this sick.

Speaker 3:          01:10:05       Oh my God, the sports illustrated is exploiting the female figure. Yeah, been men like it and I'm worried that now sort of the way in the past, um, sexual sub, you know, gays were shamed. We're now reversing it in shaming like heterosexual. Yes, that's definitely, that's definitely. Remember we had the young woman who complained about being whistled at and I said, don't worry, it stops. Yeah. Do we have a little bit of time for a couple more topics with you because one of the things that are just coming out of this younger generation and you have a chapter of in your

Speaker 2:          01:10:40       book, which I wanted to finish what the line that we were pursuing to do this. Well with sexual behavior. The question is what's the end game? And then this is what people have to ask themselves is like, one of the corollaries to the female pornographic romance is actually the establishment of a longterm relationship. And the question is, you know, it's so funny because I got pilloried in the New York Times, um, for, for talking about enforced monogamy was quite interesting because that gets brought up like in every scene was so ridiculous. I to that woman for two days. I know it is just like a little side comment and then that became like the center showcase, like like enforced monogamy, you mean forced marriage or. No, I mean that was an anthropological term which she knew perfectly well because she's a very smart person and all it means is that there's a pronounced proclivity in human societies around the world to enforce monogamous relationships at multiple levels of the sociological hierarchy.

Speaker 2:          01:11:39       You do it culturally do it. You do have an expectation. You do it legally enforced monogamy. So my son was just married and if he came to me next year and he said, you know, Hey dad, guess what? I've managed to have four affairs in the last year with hot women and my wife hasn't found out about any of them. I'm not going to pat them on the back and say, good job, kid, you know, I'm going to say, what the hell is up with you? You know, you violated the vow that you took your putting your whole future risk. You're betraying yourself and your wife and well, that's enforced monogamy. You know, the, uh, the idea is that the social norm is the establishment of a long term monogamous relationship and that there are structures put in place to support that, but also to punish deviation from it and you say, well, you know, maybe, maybe not so much on the punishment in, but you can, it depends.

Speaker 2:          01:12:26       It's like what do you want, what, what is it that you want, you want a longterm stable relationship or not, and if that's the goal, then your behavior should be devoted to whatever it is that facilitates that goal. And I don't see that. I certainly don't see that casual and impulsive sex fits that bill now, not in the least. And all of the evidence with regards to living together shows that that's actually detrimental to the establishment of a longterm relationship. So first of all, common law marriage, people who are in a common law marriage are much more likely to be be divorced. So that's the first thing. The second thing is people who live together before they get married are much more likely to be divorced after they get married. So the idea that while you can try someone on for size and see how it works and then you're going to see if you're compatible, it's like that's one story.

Speaker 2:          01:13:13       Another story is how about you and I lived together for a little while and you know, if you're, you're not so bad, but maybe I can find someone better and if I do, you know, in the next year and a half or so because we're not hooked together in any formal way, I can just trade you in. It's okay, you can do the same to me, but I don't really see that as the sort of complimentary mutual interaction that leads to the formulation of longterm trust. And I think it's a better story for interpreting what constitutes living together then. Well, you know, we're going to try each other out because that's what mature people would do it. So our rental. Yeah. Well that's right, the rental car. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's, that's it. And, and, but what more, most importantly, the data indicate that it doesn't work is that you're more likely to get divorced.

Speaker 2:          01:13:57       Not less likely because maybe the right attitude is, well, you're probably about as flawed as me and you know, we're lucky that we found each other and so let's see if we can make a commitment because we're engaging in something that's very risky, you know, an intimate relationship and we're going to commit to each other and see if we can build something of value across time and there's a definite risk in that, but there is a compliment to your partner. It's like, well, I think you're worth making a sacrifice for and what's the sacrifice? While it's everyone else. It's a big sacrifice and there's. If you don't see that as a compliment, then I don't think you're thinking because not only is it a compliment, it's sort of like the ultimate compliment and maybe you don't get to have a marriage that works without that compliment. Maybe it's so difficult to establish a longterm relationship that's functional that you have to make a walloping sacrifice very early on in the relationship. In order for that to even be a possibility. Maybe not because what the hell do we know about what binds people together, but, but it's not that easy to stay with someone for a long period of time, you know, it's, it's a real, it's a real commitment. It takes a tremendous amount of effort.

Speaker 3:          01:15:05       So actually you're bringing us back to the beginning and your time with Tammy and I'm. One of the things about. I think I'm going to guess this is a bit of an overlooked part in your chapter in your book, but I just was like one of my favorites. It was your book on modern parenting. Oh yes. And that was good.

Speaker 2:          01:15:23       I thought I would get most trouble for. I know, but it reminds me don't read that far into the book. Well,

Speaker 3:          01:15:29       it, my mother, when I had my first child gave me a 19 fifties copy of Dr Spock and he was considered so controversial and yet he was just like the most sensible person made new children very, very well. Was a pediatrician and you, your rule for parenting is do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them and you kind of in that one chapter and it's not even one of your longest chapters, just did this wonderful sweeping overview of modern parenting and the problems and in some ways that we're producing maybe some of these kids who are prolonging adulthood, prolonging the markers of adulthood, um, that, that you feel that parents, uh, you said you see today's parents is terrified by their children, not least because they've denied credit for their role as benevolent, unnecessary agents of discipline, order and conventionality. And then you told some hilarious stories about when your wife ran a daycare center out of your house and you would, you would get into tests of wills with some of the two year olds, but

Speaker 2:          01:16:34       sun is ordinary. It here, he got married. Congratulations. He still doesn't want to do anything he doesn't want to do. He's very charming and very emotionally stable. So it's like he's easy to get along with, but trying to get him to do something he doesn't want to do. It's like he had my wife defeated when he was nine months old and she's tough like seriously she, she's no pushover, but he would just sit there with his mouth closed and glare adders like I'm not eating out and I can take more than you can. Dish out. Was really something to see, you know, to see that kind of force of will and someone that small.

Speaker 3:          01:17:08       Talk a little bit about that and just the modern roles between men and women were less. You know, you don't really. You're not really supposed to distinguish between fathers and mothers even though that seems to inevitably happen in most.

Speaker 2:          01:17:22       Well, it happens in large part because the children differentiate between them. Like parents are under the delusion that most of what you do with your children is driven by what you want to do with your children. When in fact it's driven to a massive degree by what your children want you to do with them. And so there were studies done 30 years ago on feminist parents who decided that they were going to raise their children in non-gender differentiated matters. And when they were studied, they found that the parents who had that explicit philosophy, we're just as gender differentiated with their children as the parents who didn't have the philosophy. And the reason for that is that if you're a parent that has any sense at all, you don't respond to your children as a rigid idea log. You respond to them as whatever it is the child man manifests it, him, him or herself as like, you know, with any individualized relationship, you take your cue from the person and you might think, well a child has no intrinsic nature, but you know, if you think that you either don't have children or you've never seen a child or you're so blinded by your radiology that you don't have a child.

Speaker 2:          01:18:26       You just have a blank projection screen onto which you project your presuppositions and then heaven help your child. You know. So, so a lot of the gender differentiation is actually driven by the children's demands. And that's all for the good. That chapter, I thought I would get into tremendous trouble for writing that chapter because it's contentious, right on the surface. Just to the rule, because the rule first implies that children can be dislikable and then I would say again, you know, like have you met children, every child where their children you didn't like obviously, and so lots of children or dislikable, but it's taboo to admit that because they're all sweetness and light and innocence ever since Rousseau, but you know, was so put all five of his children in an orphanage where they all died. So maybe we won't, so we won't talk too much about Rousseau and um, and then the next taboo is while that parents can dislike their children, right?

Speaker 2:          01:19:21       But if you're a clinician and you don't think that parents can dislike their children, then well then, well then you're not a clinician because one of the things you constantly see is that path all within families is an incredibly common common source of psychological destabilization. Right? And it's terrible tension between parents and their children in between siblings. What I suggest in the book, which I think is radical by today's standards, is that your fundamental job as a parent is to ensure that by the time your child is four years old, that they are maximally desirable to other children and to adults because what happens is that after the age of four, you aren't the primary agent of socialization. The social world becomes the primary agent of socialization and if your child is the sort of child that's invited to play by other children because your child is capable of for stolen gratification and taking turns and playing someone else's game when, when it's necessary and abiding by the rules and not having a temper tantrum when they lose and not getting to, you know, high on their horse when they win, than many children will invite them.

Speaker 2:          01:20:38       Sorry,

Speaker 4:          01:20:39       I, I don't know what you mean. Just say it. What do you want me to do? No, I, I know we, we have, we have our limited time and so I just wanted to. I was actually saying

Speaker 2:          01:20:50       anymore,

Speaker 4:          01:20:51       so this is great. I was selfish of me because I really wanted to hear you talk. I know I just want to let him take this. I'll take 15 seconds to wrap that up and then stop. Well, so look,

Speaker 2:          01:21:02       you get married when you have your children and you're flawed and your partner slaughtered and hopefully you're flawed in different ways and so you put the two of you together and you make one approximately normal person and then hopefully and then your child has to interact with that dyad. That is a reasonable representative of social norms and if they disagree or if your child disappoints you with their behavior, the probability that they will disappoint other people is very high and so you have an ethical obligation to ensure that your child is behaving in a manner that makes them optimally desirable to their playmates and also to other adults because then the kids invite them to play and they get to be socialized, right? They get, they have friends for God's sake. It's like, what do you want for your kids? How about some friends? Wouldn't that be nice and maybe what you'd like is that they regulate their behavior well enough so that when you take them places, restaurants to see your friends, to see your relatives, they behave in a manner that's sufficiently civilized, so their intrinsic charm winds over the adults and everywhere they go, people are smiling and welcoming instead of wishing with fake smiles that the Damn Brat would leave along with their foolish parents, which is not a good.

Speaker 2:          01:22:18       That's not a good environment to have your child constantly exposed to no friends because they're too selfish and immature and irritated era irritating to adults so that they're barely tolerated under the mask of false smiles. It's like you have an ethical obligation to regulate your child's behavior so that they're optimally acceptable socially and that is not how people look at children in the modern world. They think, well, you raising their self esteem or you're enhancing their creativity or you don't want to put constraints on their behavior because you're going to interfere with the flowering of their intrinsic self and you know, it's all roost, soliah nonsense and there's no evidence to support it. Yeah. Father, yeah, he was such a corrupt

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       and he had these babies with this poor scullery maid and left them all in a actually a place where they would just languish and die. Yeah, right. Five of them Russo.

Speaker 2:          01:23:17       Yeah. No, I know. Yeah, exactly. Oh man, that is intrinsically good.

Speaker 4:          01:23:21       Yeah. One example, I just remember

Speaker 1:          01:23:25       a few weeks ago I was reading about you in somehow I got onto somebody's twitter feed whom I will not mention because, oh my God. But anyway, a difficult person and she was attacking you and had a, a selection from your book a bit where you would called two-year-olds little monsters. And so suddenly all of these distraught twitter followers of this feminist were saying, ah, called them.

Speaker 4:          01:23:55       Yeah. Little monsters and everybody. And then occasionally there'd be a

Speaker 1:          01:23:59       apparent who would take a two year olds kind of are monsters, you know, and then there'd be kind of art and they had taken this out of context and shown it like something to deplore and, but, and it was so amusing to me. This little. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:24:15       Hopefully they'll soon be cursed with some.

Speaker 4:          01:24:19       My son was, I won't say which one was two years old,

Speaker 1:          01:24:22       had he was a good boy, but he had an insane meltdown in a supermarket. I was with my mother. We both pretended we didn't know

Speaker 4:          01:24:31       to be the parent and we heard people say, oh my God, look at that child and watching a two year old have a Tantrum is I didn't want to be associated with

Speaker 2:          01:24:43       boy who used to be like when my wife was taken care of more kids than ours. There was a little boy who who, who had learned to throw a pretty decent town and and he would do that and it didn't work in our house because we'd just leave him, have his tantrum and going into a different room and then he'd kind of wake up out of it. There wouldn't be anybody around. And so that

Speaker 4:          01:25:01       like if you put all that work to a dramatic difference

Speaker 2:          01:25:04       play and you have zero audience, it's not. You're not going to sustain it anyways. He could actually turn, hold his breath until he turned blue. So you should try that. Go home and see if you can do that in front of the mirror man. Like it's hard. It's very, very good. Will you do. It was impressive. It was. And, and you know, two year olds are very impressive. They're there. They have unbelievable outbursts of rage and disinhibited emotion. And your job is, you know, they're, they're driven by these underlying motivational systems that are unbelievably powerful and as part of what makes them delightful because when they're happy, they're insanely happy. And when they're playful, they're incredibly playful. And so the positive end of the MS is way exaggerated compared to, you know, or rather drab adult and, and so it makes two year olds extraordinarily interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:25:51       But the same is true on the negative emotion side. They're completely dysregulated and it's really hard on them. Like to have a two year old who isn't in control of their emotions means that you have a child who's developing central personality, you know, their, their ego, for lack of a better word, is constantly being swamped by these powerful underlying emotional systems. You know what it's like if you are enraged for any period of time or if you're engulfed by grief, like it's exhausting. It's, it's demeaning and it's exhausting and it's the same with a little candidates like it's a real defeat for the developing integrated individual to be subjugated by those catastrophic, really powerful emergency motions and part of your job as a parent is to scaffold the part of the child that can regulate and inhibit those powerful underlying system. So with my son for example, when he used to misbehave, I would count say you're going to go sit on the steps.

Speaker 2:          01:26:47       He'd say, oh no, I'm not. I would say, Whoa, yes you are. And then usually I'd have to chase the morale because he wouldn't go sit on the steps and so I put them on the steps. Say you're going to sit there until you've got yourself under control. And so he'd say no, I not say yes you are. And then he tried to get up and I just told him, see, you're going to sit there. I'm going to hold you until you sit there. No, I'm not. It's like I could out wait a two year old, so I usually won those battles and then he'd sit there and say, look kid, this is the deal. I'd say two things like you want to have a bad day or you want to have a good day, you think about that because if you want to have a good day, have a bad day, we could have a bad days.

Speaker 2:          01:27:25       You sit here and as soon as you get control of yourself and you're ready to be civilized, then you can come back and we can have a good day. So we'd sit there just, just, it was unbelievable to watch. Just the developed with rage, you know, just trying to get himself under control, you know? And so I'd come back 30 seconds later and I'd say, you know, but got yourself, got your act together. Yeah, no, now I wait. And usually it took them two or three minutes and he'd calm down and then he'd come back out and he'd say, I'm ready to have a good day. And he meant it, you know? And I can tell he meant it too because whatever resentment, I was harboring towards him for his misbehavior and you have to watch that when you're an adult would vanish because he'd come and he'd, he was done.

Speaker 2:          01:28:13       He was ready to just, you know, to proceed on a civilized basis. And it was really interesting to watch that because it took them every time he sat on the steps, it took them a shorter and shorter period of time to attain mastery. Right. Until, you know, it got to the point where he could only have to sit for 15 seconds or so when he would bring himself under control. And that was a victory. Like if you imagine the neurological systems developed that are responsible for personality integration, it was a victory for those systems because they were attaining the ability to regulate the lower order, spontaneous emotions and you know, and, and he, he turned into an individual who's capable of a tremendous level of self control and you know, and he had large daymond's defined with. Yes, absolutely. And, and, and while it turned out well for my daughter too, because she ended

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       up being very ill and he ended up being extraordinarily levelheaded and reliable and thank God for that. Could you, could you come to my house and do that for my little multiport izzy? Because I can't, I can't, I can't train her. She's nice. The next book, the dog. I would love to know how to train your dog. You like cats? That's the one role I have checked. Like petting the cat. I wrote about dogs for two pages to begin with, just to satisfy the dog. It didn't satisfy satisfied. You can't satisfy them. All right, well we can't thank you enough for coming here. Um, I know the Aei audience is just so delighted to have had the chance to hear you talk. Have once we met in DC, but I've seen you passed electronics. Yes. Yes. Oh, you've swiped past. Oh yeah. Well there was that. We're not going into that. Okay. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you Jordan.

Speaker 5:          01:30:06       Thanks.
