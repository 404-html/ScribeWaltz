Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, so we divided up the brain one way and now we're going to divide it up another way, and so this is the brain from the top down and you know you have two hemispheres and you might think, well, why do you need two hemispheres? Do you know? By the way, some of you probably know this, that a Zana who's a relatively famous neuropsychologist, studied split brain patients. Now you know that your cortical hemispheres, your brain is united down in the subcortical areas. You know, it's sort of stuck together. Although you have twin 11 twins of many of the subcortical structures like you have to Hipaa camp, eye to Amygdala, for example, one on each side, but at the top the hemispheres are quite separate and, but they're connected by the Corpus callosum which makes them communicate. It's kind of interesting because you kind of wonder, well why aren't they just all glued together?

Speaker 1:          00:51          You know, and what it seems to indicate is that there's some utility of functional independence combined with some utility of communication, you know, so it might be like, do you really want to be networked at the same time? To everyone in the world, it's like, no, you don't. You want some narrow channel pathways so that only the important information comes through, so it's sort of maybe like the right hemisphere is one kind of computational device in the left hemisphere is another kind of computational device. Of course they're not computational devices, but you get the point and only the important information and process information from the right hemisphere goes across and only the process, the information from the left hemisphere goes across something like that, whatever. If you have someone who's epileptic or or that that has a brain illness of some sort of specific type, it's usually epilepsy but not always and you do surgery on them and you cut the Corpus callosum.

Speaker 1:          01:45          What you find weirdly enough is that each hemisphere develops its own personality and so it's Kinda Nice as other evidence. I would say for the idea that what the brain does is produce personalities, right? You can keep pairing the brain down and what it's going to do is produce lower and lower resolution personalities all the way down to the bottom. They're just known as detailed. They're like, if you lost, say 80 percent of your cortex randomly, you'd sort of be like a thumbnail of yourself, so you'd still be you, but just not at the same detail. So I'll tell you, here's an interesting idea from the Catholics. It kind of goes along with the Avatar idea. So the Catholics had been wrestling for a long time with the question about how God could have fit himself in the human body because you could imagine that would obsess Christians.

Speaker 1:          02:31          It's like God is great, Big God and you know, little bitty body put God in there, just bursts the boundaries. Well, they have this idea called Kenosis, which means emptying. And so the idea is that God had to empty himself, followed before and get inhabited human body and it's very much like a thumbnail ideas. So you know, and young would have of course thought exactly that the self was a thumbnail of God. I mean, if you wouldn't put it that way, but definitely that's where his thinking was leading. So. So that's a pretty damn cool idea. So anyways, so this is from. I developed this before I ran what I'm going to tell you, but it doesn't matter because I'm going to talk about it from another theorist, his point of view, the guy I'm going to tell you about, his name is Al Cohen and Goldberg and he's a neuropsychologist and he was one of learning as students who ended up in New York and Goldberg was obviously influenced by Luria and all the Sokolov and vinegar, silver and gray and all those people that I've already talked to you about and he was interested in why you have two hemispheres.

Speaker 1:          03:36          Well, there's a bunch of things that you can say broadly speaking about the hemispheres, and I've written them some of them down there, so the right hemisphere. This is an idealized representation of a relatively highly lateralized right handed male, and the reason I'm saying that is men seem to be more lateralized than women and the right handed lateralization is the standard kind, but you know the brain can be louder, lysed all sorts of ways. What you might say is that there's a bunch of ways of looking at it. One way you can look at it is that your cortex gets colonized by underlying structures so and that each underlying structure is likely to call annise a particular area. So for example, when you, when you are born and you wake up and you see your eyes are going to call an eyes, your visual Cortex, most likely because it's sort of adapted for that, but if you don't have a visual Cortex, then your eyes will colonize something else.

Speaker 1:          04:33          So, so that's. So the brain has proclivities towards a certain kind of structure, but especially early in development. It's unbelievably plastic. And so brains can be organized in lateralized in a bunch of different ways. But so to simplify what you do is you kind of take, okay, well let's take the most straightforward and typical brain and talk about it as if it's the canonical brain. But I think what you can say is regardless of where these systems are localized, they exist. So it's an over simplification, whatever. It doesn't matter what you've got with regards to your core to cs is a quick and dirty cortex and that's the right hemisphere. And then you've got a longterm detailed cortex and that's the left hemisphere, left hemisphere, specialized for language language, cuts, things up into little tiny bitty pieces, you know. And that's really useful if you're doing little tiny bitty things and you shouldn't be precision, right?

Speaker 1:          05:30          Pinpoint accuracy. But that takes a lot of time and a lot of computation. Whereas the right hemisphere says, yeah, yeah, let's get to the bloody point, you know? And so it captures the thing in an image. So like the monster I showed you from the hippy cartoon, that's a right hemisphere thing. It's an image that represents a class of entities and which of course the images do. Now, here's this woman named I carefree number autistic woman. She's a developed cattle handling facilities all across. What's her name? Temple. Grandin. Yes. Very cool person I saw at temple grandin speak at the University of Arizona at the consciousness conference. And it was like the funniest speech I'd ever seen in my life. Not because it wasn't perfect, it was bloody perfect. Like she's a tough woman. She looks like a cowboy and she spent a lot of time with animals.

Speaker 1:          06:23          She kind of comes out on the stage and her cowboy outfit and she's unbelievably straightforward and without nuance. She's autistic, she's severely autistic and she, you know, her mother helped her a lot and she developed this thing that you would go inside to compress her and hold her was a little machine and that would comfort her. Anyways, she turned herself into quite the quite the person and she thinks she thinks like an animal, which is why she can design cattle handling facility often slaughter houses so that the cattle don't get all freaked out as they're on their way to their eventual demise. And so one of the things she does is she walks through where the counselor going in anything that bothers her, she assumes will bother a cow. So for example, if the cows are walking through this say spiral or they're on their way to the slaughterhouse and there's a coke can lying on the ground, all the cows will stop and look at the coke can to normalist.

Speaker 1:          07:17          Now. She talked a lot about how she thought and what she said was she could not devise abstract representations. So she said, okay, imagine, imagine how a child draws a house. Okay, so what, what is he now? Charles' house, right? There's a triangle and a square on the left, and then there's another rectangle and another kind of Parallelogram, and then there's a door and two windows, right? Then there's a chimney with smoke coming out, which is quite cool. It's like, why is that? Where's the smoke? You know, you don't see that modern houses, but kids still do that. It's like, then maybe there's a tree and usually there's a sun and then house. It's like you think, oh, isn't that cute? A simple drug. It's like that drawing. It's not simple. You've never seen a house that looks like that in your life. It looks nothing like a house.

Speaker 1:          08:07          It's not a house, it's not a picture. It's a hero cliff. It's a pre linguistic representation and it's like the essential elements of house. And so you might say what the child has done is extracted out all those things that are common across all houses and then represented that it's not a drawing. Now if you take autistic people sometimes and you get them to draw, they'll start in one corner of the house and what they'll draw is that helps, like with every damn brick in place. So there are autistic people, for example, who they can look at a building and they can count every single window at one glance. And then there's another guy who in England who's really famous, this guy is just completely out of. He's unbelievable. They take them up in a helicopter and show them a city that he's never seen.

Speaker 1:          08:52          Then he goes home and has a piece of paper, like as big as a wall and he starts in one corner and he draws the entire city, you know, and he doesn't sketch it out, right? It's, it's from the bottom up. And you know, that's autistic savant drawing. And often what happens is he's very realistic looking. You know what happens if the autistic drawing survivors languages, they start being able to draw and that's because the abstraction interferes with the realism, you know? So it's really hard to draw a hand. And the reason for that is if you draw a hand, you draw a hieroglyph the hand, this is what heroin looks like. You tried to draw your hand. It's really strange. And one of the strange things about trying to draw your hand is that in order to draw it, you have to stop seeing it as if it's a hand and then it pops out.

Speaker 1:          09:40          You think, my God, that's the weirdest looking thing. It's like a tree root. It's like you know it's a claw because it's, you know, if you look at your hand like that, it looks nothing like a hand. That's how it hair looks. What the hell is that? It's like some sort of spider, you know, so. But you have to see it that way before you can draw it. And so well. So partly what happens is that your capacity for abstraction interferes with your ability to see detail and not probably good. It's one of the ways that you simplify the world anyways. The right hemisphere looks like it's specialized for anomaly. Now the way I look at it is this, okay? So you've got your hippocampus down there and it's keeping track of the comparison between what you want and what you think is happening. Bang, something emerges.

Speaker 1:          10:25          It's anomalous. You don't know what the hell is going on, and so you freeze. That's the representation. Then you start to feel anxious. Then the right hemisphere comes up with some pictures. What might this be? You can experience this at home for your own enjoyment. Let's say you're home at two in the morning and it's dark and you're alone. Okay? Maybe you've watched a horror. Movies are all nicely pride, you know, and then you hear a noise in another room and not knowing shouldn't be there and so you're going to go investigate, right? And so let's say the door is just a little bit open and it's dark in the room and you have to put your hand in to turn on the light. It's like you just watched what your imagination populates that room with. When you do that, it's like, you know, guy with acs, snake alligator, like whatever.

Speaker 1:          11:08          But your right hemisphere is going. There may be one of this class of dangerous things in there and what it's doing is basically coming up with a hypothesis. What sort of monster might be in there and you're all sort of freaked out about that even though you know that you know, who knows what happened, you know nothing. Something creepy, but you're all like on edge because your brain doesn't work at night like it does in the day and everyone knows that. Wake up in the middle of the night. It's like all manner of horrors go through your imagination and that usually happens when you're asleep. You're asleep for that most of the time, but sometimes you wake up and it's like you worry about everything. So anyways, so that's the right hemisphere. It's coming up with pictures of what might be there and they're generally monstrous pictures and reason for that is while it's obvious what the reasons for that is, you know, now you'll probably turn the light on and look anyways, even though you might sort of peer around the corner and then when there's nothing, you'll be embarrassed about how foolish you are.

Speaker 1:          12:05          But. But you can see the instinctual behavior right there and it's, it's wise, you know, there's a low probability that something terrible is there, but zero times low probability times infinity equals large danger. So if there's a two percent chance that there's a killer in there, it pays to be a little on the 10 side because being killed really sucks. And so your, your, your prime to feel negative emotion more intensely, right? Because you're so vulnerable. So anyways, that's kind of what the right hemisphere is up to. It does quick and dirty representation, but it also does categorization. So it's not, it doesn't give you exactly realistic representations of what's there. What it does instead is gives you categorical representations. And so you might say, how should you represent an unknown danger? You should use an amalgam of all known dangers to represent it. And that is what it is in a sense.

Speaker 1:          13:03          You know, like that's why I talked to you earlier about the category of all dangerous things. So the aborigines in Australia have this, this category, which is women fire and dangerous things like what you think, well, why are all those things in that category? It's like, oh, it's not that hard to figure out if you think about it, but it's also a category that you very frequently see say, and Disney cartoons. So the wicked queen for example, in sleeping beauty, I mean she's constantly bursting into flames and turning into a dragon and no one seems to object to that. It makes perfect sense that the wicked queen would turn into a fire breathing dragon. It's like it doesn't make any sense at all, but although it does, but it's not a rational transformation. But because it's in keeping with an archetypal structure, everybody goes, yeah, of course that's what she's going to do.

Speaker 1:          13:50          And it happens all the time. And Disney movies like Ursula, you remember her from, from the Little Mermaid. She's trying to keep her daughter from becoming conscious. Yeah. Nice mother doing that. And she trapped. Sold Zeus, you know, she squeezes it soul to death. Traps them in the underworld because he's also. Well, we won't get into that, but anyways, what happens to Ursula is when you find, get her irritated. Now if she grows into this huge ship destroying store monster, that's part octopus, right? Or giant octopus, you think, wow, that makes sense. Okay. It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it's a kind of hypothesis now that's a representation of mother nature, red in tooth and claw, and there's also a reason that that's female. It's not female, it's feminine. It's actually a different thing. So. But we'll get to that. So the right hemisphere, well, it's specialized for a.

Speaker 1:          14:43          normally it does quick and dirty analysis under the influence of the limbic system. It's not linguistics, so I would say it's still dominated by the systems and my suspicion is that animals are still dominated by the subcortical systems. Their brains worked from the bottom up. We have a top down model and that's at least a part of the left hemisphere linguistic system and it's a new thing that people have and it's based on our capacity to abstract. So that would partly be visual like here or glyphic. And then also to transform things into linguistic form. And it seems to me that that's the part that we really identify as ourself, right? Because it's weird if you're, let's say you're home alone and you get freaked out and all these images come to mind. No, if you think of those images is part of you, you think more.

Speaker 1:          15:30          There are things, things that appeared to you and that's what you think about your dreams. There are things that appeared to you. They're not you. It's like, why would you think that? I mean they're there in your experientials space. Why is it that separation between you and your dream? I had a dream, not I thought up a dream, or look what I created. It's like there you are. The Observer. And up comes a dream. It's very, very weird and you know, it shows you that there are forces operating in your psyche that are impersonal, genuinely impersonal. And of course that's part of what you can call it, the collective unconscious. So, and it's the thing that generates these weird images and protects you. So in its nature, that's for sure. And it can be absolutely terrifying. I mean, people can have dreams that are so terrible that.

Speaker 1:          16:15          Well, like the one my my little niece nephew had that's pretty damn nasty little greasy door things with big beaks. I mean that's an ugly. That's a very ugly representation. And then if that wasn't bad enough, there had to be a fire breathing dragon behind them, creating them in to this thing like it's no bloody wonder. He was waking up screaming. It's like, oh no. I figured out what life is like. So like at four, that's pretty. That's pretty traumatic. So okay, now the left hemisphere, this is, this is out, and the goldbergs. Hypo potts says she got one hemisphere or system that operates when you know what you're doing and when what you want is happening, and that's the happy talky part that thinks it knows what the hell is going on. And then you have another part that only turns on when you don't know what's going on.

Speaker 1:          17:04          And it's full of anxiety and negative emotion. The Right Hemisphere, by the way, is specialized for negative emotion. If you, if you sustain right prefrontal damage, you become inappropriately happy and you think you're full of positive illusions. You Think, oh, that's an excellent thing. It's like it's not. You make really impulsive, risky decisions and your life goes directly to help because he needed the negative emotion. Obviously you know the reason you suffer with negative emotion is because if you didn't suffer with negative emotion use, you'd suffer from being destroyed. Those are your options. There are people by the way who were born without pain and so you think, hey, that's a good deal. It's like they never last past 20 and part of the reason for that is you don't this, but while you're sitting there, you're going like this all the time, and the reason for that is, is that if you sit for any length of time on one part of your body, then it doesn't get much blood and it doesn't get oxygenated, and so you do that.

Speaker 1:          18:02          A bitch is a little bit little pain, so you shift, you shift and you shift and so you're just doing this all the time because otherwise you wear out your damn body or you get bedsores or that sort of thing. Well these people that don't have any pain, they just wear themselves out. So. So you need the negative emotion, you know, it keeps you going and, and it can get out of hand and have its own pathologies, but, but it's definitely necessary. So the right hemisphere does negative emotion inhibition of behavior. That's the freezing and its attendant on anxiety does image processing, holistic thinking. So it's the quick and dirty hemisphere pattern recognition, pattern generation and gross motor action not. It's interesting too, right? Because the gross motor action is again, the quick and dirty stuff. You know, if you need to slap something away, it doesn't really matter that it's a, you know, a gross motor gesture.

Speaker 1:          18:51          You don't have to go like this and be precise. It can just be fast and sloppy and it'll still work. Now the left hemisphere is specialized for when you know what the hell's going on and you can concentrate on the details so and then you can think about it in terms of the hierarchy that we discussed, right? So what it implies is that at the level of specific fine detailed motor output, the left hemisphere is operating and so that's kind of associated with positive affect. I know exactly what I'm doing and I'm making minor adjustments and everything's going well, and then if you go up the hierarchy towards more and more abstract representations, then increasingly that's moving over into right hemisphere space. And so that's also partly why when you disrupt those higher order structures that well literally all hell breaks loose. So left hemisphere operation, unexplored territory, positive emotion, activation of behavior.

Speaker 1:          19:45          So that's also exploration, a word processing, linear thinking, detail recognition, detailed generation and fine motor action. So you need one system that works when you don't know what's going on and you need another system that works when you do, because sometimes your where you don't know what you're doing and sometimes your where you do know what you're doing. Now Ramachandra, who's a fairly famous neurologist who operates out of La, he associated that totalitarian eagle with hyper domination of the left hemisphere. And the reason he did that, it's very cool. So he's got these patients that have a. what's it called? He said Agnosia. It isn't. We'll call it neglect. Neglect. Okay, so this is what happens. Okay? You have a stroke and the stroke affects the back part of the right hemisphere. All right? So what happens? Your left side is paralyzed. You can't do anything with it.

Speaker 1:          20:44          Okay? So however you also don't notice that it's not working. And so one of the things you might do if you do become aware, you're laying in bed, you've had a stroke, and for some reason you noticed that there's an arm lying in there with you and then what you do is you pick it up with your other hand and you try to throw it out of the bed and when you find out that it's attached to you because it's not your arm, you're not very happy, or maybe you throw yourself right out of bed. And then if someone gets you to draw a clock, you draw half a clock and if you eat a plate full of food, you eat half the plate unless someone turns it and then you eat half of that and so half the world is gone. It's hard to imagine what that would be liking.

Speaker 1:          21:21          But I think what it's sort of like is, you know how there's a whole world behind you and you don't, you don't detect it as not there. Like it's not black or anything. Like when your eyes are closed, it's just not there. And I think what happens with people with neglect is that the not there becomes three quarters instead of just half. It's something like that anyways. So fine. So you don't know what's going on. And there you are like this and someone says to you, I noticed that you can't move your left arm today. And what do you say? You say, well that's because I'm tired. Or you say I'm, I don't feel like moving it and, and so forth. So you'll have this reason that you're not going to move it. And you know, you might say the same thing about the left foot or whatever.

Speaker 1:          22:06          It's like, yeah, well I don't feel like moving it. Then you'll have some story about why you're not going to move it. Okay. So that's fine. So for Indians thought about that as traumatic denial, you know that it was so overwhelming to you that you lost the left part of your body, that you couldn't face it and you just denied it happened. It's not a bad theory. It's not quite right. But it's not a bad theory. So, so fine. So I'll tell you a couple of associated stories. Let's say you're on dialysis. That sucks. You have to have this big thing in your arm that's like a shunt and then you have to go get hooked up to a dialysis machine like all the time because your kidneys are failing. And so who wants that? Nobody. So everybody thinks time for a kidney transplant. So then they're on a long waiting list, make it one kidney that's not very many kidneys.

Speaker 1:          22:55          And so then they say, okay, you got your kidney. And everyone's thrilled about that. Here's your antirejection medication, make sure you take it and so then a year later you lose your kidney. Why? Because you don't take your damn antirejection medication. That's the most common reason you might think, well, why in the world would you not take your antirejection medication? While the Freud's would say denial? Here's a different hypothesis. You're a whole map of you is person with kidney and then you lose your kidneys and it's like you're a whole weird thing that you have no idea about and it's virtually impossible for you to update your model and you think, well, does that make any sense? Like, have you ever lost a tooth? Right? What is your tongue do for like six months? You're sitting there in your tongue is like fiddling away in there like a mad dog investigating every nook and like it's an obsessive exploratory device and it doesn't even when you don't want it to and then six months later you get your mouth remapped.

Speaker 1:          23:53          So that's just a tooth man. Lose a kidney and see what happens or lose the whole left side of your body. It's like, what are you going to do about that? Well, okay, so then Ramachandra and he's testing these people for balance and so what he does is he checks out this phenomena called Nystagmus. And so if you pour cold water in someone's ear, their eyes move back and forth because it screws up the, um, you know, you have a balanced system in your, in your ear. And if you pour cold water and air it screws it up and then your eyes move back and forth. And you know, it's not very pleasant. So what he found was that if he poured water in the cold water in the left ear, then all of a sudden the people would wake up and go, oh my God, I don't have the left side of my body.

Speaker 1:          24:38          And then they would have a catastrophic emotional experience, may be all upset about it and crying away, which is of course what they should do. And then 20 minutes later it would wear off and then you'd say, well, you know, is there anything wrong with your left side? And they'd say, well yeah, I just don't feel like moving it. So, so what seems to have happened is something like, so there's a body representation center, let's say in the back of the right hemisphere and you blow that soccer out with a stroke and that means you can't represent that part of your body anymore, but maybe there's tatters of it left. Like it's like a network that's damaged and under some conditions you could more or less get it to operate. So you pour some cold water in the year, you shocked the whole system. And then there's enough neurological activity.

Speaker 1:          25:21          So the network kicks in even though it's damaged for like 10 minutes. And then you get this tremendous burst of negative emotion, which is what the right hemisphere should be doing. When you lose half your body and you experienced that and will left hemisphere is like flapping away trying to account for this, which it can't because it's such a massive archer catastrophe. But then you know, the, the shock wears off and bang, the system shuts back down and Poof, you're back in denial. So that's a good example of the relationship between the left hemisphere and right hemisphere. The left hemisphere has a fixed idea about the world. So in some sense you might think about it as the instantiation of your latest Avatar. Even certainly see that with people who are ideological, he possessed, right? They've got this verbal system that accounts for the whole world and there's just no damn way that things go in anywhere.

Speaker 1:          26:13          So you know, and it's got this totalitarian aspect because it wants to explain every last thing. It doesn't like to normally at all. It hasn't come to terms with the normally at all and there's no sense of transformation within the system, which is partly white totalitarian systems die. It's like the Red Queen says to Alice in wonderland when she was in the underworld and my kingdom, you have to run as fast as you can just to say in the same place. That's why totalitarian systems don't work is because the damn environment shifting around on, you know, and if they are fixed in place, the gap between their theory and reality gets larger and larger and larger and larger. Until finally, you know they fall into a pit and that's the end of it. So now it's what happens to people too. If they don't stay updated, you know, if they let things get away on them, eventually the ignored reality comes flooding back and we'll see that represented in mythology because it's represented very nicely and mythology.

Speaker 1:          27:11          That's where I often dragons in fairytales, for example, in the St George Story and in the Hobbit, for that matter, the dragon is an eternal thing. It lives underneath the earth and most of the time it leaves you the hell alone, but now and then it comes back and it tries to destroy the city and then you have to zip out there and fight the thing so you get to go back and it's whole and maybe you get the treasure that it's caring and then it's back in the hole for a while, but that thing's coming back. It's always coming back and so you build the walls and all that, that's fine, but a dragon can destroy any walls and so walls aren't enough. You have to be prepared to go out there and fight the damn thing, and that's how you keep it at bay and you know, that basically means that you have to maintain everything you build. It's something like that, right? Because otherwise it falls apart with increasing entropy. So, all right, so

Speaker 1:          28:09          Goldberg thought about this as an anomaly system and offy system and a route and ization system. But I tended to think about it more from an anthropological or, uh, um, uh, what would you call it? A ecological perspective, thinking about an animal. US In our natural environment, it's not so much novelty versus root analyzation. It's explored versus unexplored territory. And that's what the world's made out of. It's made out of, explored versus unexplored territory. And so there's a domain that you inhabit which is the center of the universe from a mythological perspective with you, right in the middle of it and around you is this circle of which is your place that you move around with you. And in that circle you know what the hell's going on. And that's partly because you've mapped it, but it's also partly because you don't go outside of it, you know, so you have your friends and you have your routine and that's nested inside your culture and you try to keep that thing from flipping upside down and you do that all sorts of ways partly by doing the same thing all the time, but also partly by refusing to go anywhere that might seriously challenge your beliefs.

Speaker 1:          29:18          And you know, fair enough, you can understand that although it makes you weak to do that because you're not as prepared as you might be. So you could say, you know, human beings are tribal, social animals that have a territory and the territory. Then you think, well what's the territory while let's say tree dwelling chimp, ancestors, territories, the jungle. It's like, no, it's, it's not the territory. The territory is a little bit of the jungle plus the things that come in from outside plus the primate dominance hierarchy that exists in that area. Right, right. So that's the, that's the territory. That's the environment, you know, because for mythological reasons, we tend to make a separation between the environment and culture, but it's yes, makes sense at one level of analysis, but at another level of analysis, all it does is screw you up because your territory fundamentally isn't the world, not the natural objective world.

Speaker 1:          30:18          You want to stay as far away from that thing as you possibly can. Your territory is that circle of people with whom you spend 90 percent of your time and so if you're a gym for example, or some other kind of monkey, highly social, what do you do all day? You sleep, you eat, your chew leaves. If you're a chip and you grew mother gyms like it's constantly social interaction and you're jockeying for position in the dominance hierarchy like mean girls and not in that movie. You know, and you're mapping out the social territory, knowing who's who and what's what, and then trying to get up somewhere near the top. And that's your environment. That's your environment. And so your, your, your world is that social natural circle, which is a four dimensional territory because it's, you know, what's going length, width and height, plus it stretches across time.

Speaker 1:          31:14          So it's this transforming natural entity. And then inside that there's a pyramid and the pyramid is made out of all the primates that you interact with. And that's the world. A circle with a pyramid on it. Now I'll give you a vision. This vision I had once when I was trying to figure this stuff out. Okay? So what is the world? So imagine that there's a field in front of you that stretches as far as you can see. Okay. And then you're flying above it. And what you see everywhere are these pyramids, let's say for the sake of argument that they're like skyscrapers made out of glass. There's peers, tears in them and you fly down and one's here and one's here. And some of them overlap and some of them are really big and some of them are small and like they're just everywhere.

Speaker 1:          32:00          And you're flying around above them and you fly close enough to look inside. And what you see inside them are people all packed together trying to scramble up to the top. And that's the world. That's the reality. And the funny thing is, is that you can be in one of those pyramids, crap, clambering away to the top or you can be flying above it. Those are your options and if you have to choose, you should be flying above it. And so the relationship between the self and the Ego Avatar is the same as the relationship between the thing that is flying above and the thing that's within one of those pyramids trying to scramble to the top, you know, you say, well I'm going to get to the top, top of what? There's 100 talks, there's 200 talks and then you might say, is there anything above the top?

Speaker 1:          32:45          Well, there is. There's this part of you that isn't entrapped within that particular system. And that can move from place to place. If you look at Egypt mythology, so you know, you see on the back of the American dollar bill, that's a symbol of value, right? Okay. So what's The pyramid? There's a pyramid on it, right? What's the top of the pyramid? It's the triangle separate from the pyramid. There's an ID inside it. That's because the top of the pyramid is an IRA and it's separate from the pyramid. And what that means fundamentally is that

Speaker 1:          33:19          the thing that transcends the structure is attention, voluntary attention. Now, the Egyptians worshiped voluntary attention in the form of Horace [inaudible]. He was, uh, he was gone, right? Horace. And I'll tell you about horace and detail, but one of Horus is avatars was the fault and the reason for that is falcons can really, really, really, really see and they fly around. And so they're like the king's eyes, like, like the little bird zoo in, uh, in the lion king, right? He was the king's eyes to thing that flies around the boat and he was a particular enemy of scar scar. Eat some at the beginning and then spits them out. And the reason that the king's eyes is an enemy of scars because the king's eyes can see what he is, right? And he's the eternal forest that works to disrupt the kingdom and bring everything into ruin. Classic myth. Classic Grantham. Partly accounting for why that was the largest selling highest grossing cartoon in Disney history. Right. They got from mythology pretty right. So okay, so attention. Oh, okay, well we'll do this. So you might say what's a human being like?

Speaker 1:          34:36          Remember I told you that when Penfield was mapping the brain, he was poking people and you can either poke them along the sensory strip, which is if the motor strip is here, the sensory strip is just behind it and the motor strip is where the motor systems of your body are represented in so far as you can control them. And the sensory strip is where the sensory systems are represented in so far as you can feel them. So what this is is a that the bar is laid out weirdly on the motor cortex. One of the things that's pretty funny is that the Genitalia area in the sensory Cortex, it's right beside the feet. And so I think you know, there's, that's why people have foot fetishes and love massages, foot massages is because they're spreading activation from the foot area to the general area and God only knows why that is.

Speaker 1:          35:27          Maybe because you had to have really sensitive feet to tromp around without stepping on horrible things, whatever. So you can, you can put this weird stretched out body representation together in a, in a representational form like this. And they called that the whole monkey plus, which is the like the little man that exists inside your brain. So what you see that's the motor Homunculus, not the sensory Homonculus, but what? So what do you see? What? What's a person as far as brain is concerned? Well, hand, that's for sure. Thumb, that's for sure. It's like your thumb is represented as your whole body and it's because your, your, your chest, your torsos hardly represented at all is why is that? It's like, well, how many things do you manipulate with your chest? Like none. Right? So you don't, you don't have motor control over it. So it's not represented so.

Speaker 1:          36:19          But the hands man, those things, they're represented like mad and so is the face and the lips and the tongue and there's a bunch of reasons for that. One is that when you're an infant, you explored like mad with your mouth, but you do that through your whole life because when you eat, you know what it's like. If you're eating something and there's a bit of sand in it like you, you find it and you take it out. It's like you can detect this teeny little thing that's not supposed to be in your mouth and while that's a good thing because lots of things aren't supposed to be in your mouth. So that's part of the reason. Then the other part of the reason is, well, think about what you do with your tongue. I mean there's a lot of things you do with your tongue.

Speaker 1:          36:57          Some of them are eating, some of them are talking, some of them are all sorts of intimate behaviors. That thing is wired up and it's wired up right at birth and then it's the same with your lips and your and the rest of your mouth. You use that to communicate so your hands will wander around taking the world apart and putting it back together, which is exactly what your brain does and then you blab about what you're doing to everyone and that's basically a human being and I like to think of this thing is it's sort of the. It's a comical representation of the hero that goes out to confront the world, right? Because the hero has two elements. One is explore and that sort of what? That's where the West is powerful. I would say like we have a really well developed mythology of the exploratory hero, but where we're not so well developed as the second part because in the second part of the classic Hero's story, you're supposed to come back and communicate about what you found and so there's a individual exploration element and then there's a communicate and update.

Speaker 1:          37:58          The culture element and both of those are equally important and it's something that we don't do well. We don't have much respect for tradition in the west and it's a really, really big problem because the ethical responsibility of a human being is to take the dead culture, so that's the dead father or the dead God, and to revivify it with attention and communication and you've failed to do that. Then everything disappears and we, we are failing to do that. We're leaving it all behind instead. It's not a good idea. You know, if the old gods die, as Nietzsche said, they had new gods in very rapidly and if you think the old guard was bad, you wait till the new gods get ahold of you. So while we saw what happened in the 20th century, right, with all the ideologies that sprang up in the absence of classical religious belief, it's like, okay, you're not so thrilled with Catholicism.

Speaker 1:          38:52          If you think about that as, you know, the fundamental tradition of the West, you know, with the witch burnings and the inquisition and all that, it's like, yeah, yeah, well get a load of the Nazis and then see what you think. So or the communists for that matter, it's like from bad to worse in an unimaginable way, you know, so and that's partly because those archaic systems, those are religious systems, they weren't ideologies. There are a whole different class of thing and we don't understand them very well and it's not good because you cannot live without understanding them. You don't know who you are. And then you fall prey to weird mental diseases like nihilism. That's, that's one. And the other one is ideological possession. So you become a totalitarian or a analyst and that's a bad outcome and you might think, well, what's the alternative?

Speaker 1:          39:42          Well, you know what happens in Pinocchio, right? You've watched Pinocchio. Okay. I often show up in oak you to this class, but I don't know if I'm going to do that this year. But anyways, but now he's a puppet marionette. Someone else's pulling his strings has. It wouldn't hit. He's not very bright. He hasn't banged around the world at all. He's got a good father. The old Japan who really would, rather than he was a real boy, right? A real person. So he's the kind of father that wants to produce an individual and not a slave. So, and that's why, you know, in his workshop it's all friendly and there's a nice fire and he's making toys and there's lots of music. It's like go Japan. Oh, he's a good guy. So it makes this little puppet and he sends them out in the world, says, go be a real boy.

Speaker 1:          40:21          Well, Pinocchio runs into a whole class of different obstacles. One is evil, right? That's the, uh, that's the coachman. And uh, the Italian stereotype guy who makes him a dancing puppets celebrity, which I think is pretty funny. I mean, that's really prescient because you might think, well, what's the goal of your typical boneheaded, you know, mid adolescent in North America. It's like unearned celebrity. Well, that's exactly what Pinocchio goes for first. And that doesn't work out so well because he ends up a slave. And then the next thing that happens is he capitalizes on the fact that he's vulnerable and pretends he's sick and goes off for a vacation under the direction of the coachman who's basically Satan in disguise. And it goes out to treasure island, pleasure island, and meets all the delinquent. So we're just like Nazis. And it turns out that in fact, the whole ploys to enslave everyone, to deprive them of their voice, that's the donkey's brain and to make them into slaves pretty damn horrifying.

Speaker 1:          41:23          And that was, that movie came out about the same time that the Nazis were really, you know, grasping power in, in central Europe. It's like they got it exactly right. Here's what's really going on behind the scenes. So. And then what happens? Well, Pinocchio turns halfway into a brain donkey because, you know, he's gone off the path and in order to get back on it, he tries to go home, but it's too late. He's grown up. You can't go home. He's not a kid anymore. Goes home and dad, isn't there surprised, surprised? Because once you grow up and you go home, dad isn't there. It's just another human being. So then what happens? Well then he has to go into the ocean. Now that's particularly weird, right? It's like, there he is, half donkey. He's a puppet. The dove comes down and drops him a message from God.

Speaker 1:          42:09          It's like the Holy Spirit descending, except it's actually from the blue fairy weirdly enough, and the message says you have to go to the deepest part of the ocean and rescue your father. It's like, yeah, that is what you have to do. If you don't want to be a bloody puppet donkey, you have to go down into the depths and find your dead father and you have to revivify him. And that's what happened. So Pinocchio goes way down there to the deepest depths and finds monster who's a monster. So terrible that the fish swim away just at the sound of his voice, just like, what's his name? Uh, he who shall not be named Voldemort, right? You can't even say his damn name. Same with monster. Put occhio goes down there. It goes into the whale. What happens in Japan? Oh, says there's no getting out with this.

Speaker 1:          42:56          There's no getting out of this. We just have to sit here and Cook Fish and Pinocchio. Thanks. Cook. And then he starts breaking up all the chairs and everything. And as far as freaking out, it's like, what do you do? Breaking all these chairs? What are we going to sit on? And then Pinocchio Lights them on fire. He's a master of fire. It's a shamonic ritual, but he is a master of fire. That's where human being is. He, he gets everything burning. Of course, pedal was all freaked out about that because what are they going to sit on and Pinocchio thinks, who cares about sitting? We're going to solve the problem once and for all. And so then the whale turns into a fire breathing dragon, which is pretty damn weird thing for a whale to do. Half Kills Pinocchio. He lived, washes up on shore dead, but he saves his father.

Speaker 1:          43:36          And then at the very end of the movie, he's lying on his bed, all drowned. They're all like having a show. He's a dead pop it now. It's like, do you want to be alive? Popular? A dead puppet? Well, maybe the dead puppet is better than the live property. It depends on where you're going. So then he's on the bed. The blue fairy comes down and says, well, you've been honest and courageous bag. Now you're real. You know, and then they have a little party and that's, that's just exactly right. Got that. Exactly right. So that's how. That's part of the hero mythology is the rescuing of the father, the father, because otherwise you're a corpse like you're a historical creature.

Speaker 1:          44:20          You're cultural creature. You're a. You cannot live without your culture. You think you can, but you can't. It disappears in and you don't even look. I'll give you an example. In the Mesopotamian creation myth, which I'm going to tell you about next week, one of the things that happens is that the first round of gods, so they're like primordial forces. They're pretty damn careless and they killed their father and they make this place to live on his corpse. Okay? That's where we live. We live on the corpse of our ancestors because we live in this society. It's dead. It's the product of dead people. So it's got this dead element, but we're living on it. Okay? They're very careless. They kill it. They render it completely dead. Well, what happens is Taya Matt, who's the mother of chaos, she comes flooding back and she thinks, oh, you killed the thing that protects you.

Speaker 1:          45:14          You just wait to see what happens and that's exactly. Yet you killed the thing that structures you. You will know it. It's like niches, prediction from the death of God. It's like you killed this. You think are. It doesn't make any difference. It's like, Huh, wrong. It's like the striders protecting the hobbits. You get rid of that thing that protects you in chaos, comes flooding in and you like. You have no idea what's possible. We do though, because we lived through the 20th century, we know exactly what's possible. You know, hundreds of millions of unnecessary deaths. That's what's possible. We're lucky we didn't blow the whole damn thing up so and we still could. So people pursuing their dead etiologies. You don't rescue the dead father. You're the puppet of death. That's what you are already on. That cheery note.
