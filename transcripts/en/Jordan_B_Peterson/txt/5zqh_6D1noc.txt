Speaker 1:          00:02          Hello Am I Korean readers main fund, my publisher. I'm sitting here in Maui, Hawaii, taking a bit of a break from my tour and I just received word that sales of 12 rules for life and Korea are approaching the hundred thousand mark. So I'm extremely gratified to hear that. Um, I'm a great admirer of South Korean culture. I think that what you, you're people have managed in the last 40 years is nothing short of a miracle. And I'm filled with admiration for your accomplishments. I would really hope that the 12 rules for life can help your people, young, young, and old alike, and encourage them to develop a compelling vision for their life and to take on the sort of responsibility that you've been pastors at managing and to speak honestly and forthrightly and to live knowably and to bury your suffering properly and to help make the world a better and less of place. And so, um, thank you for all your support so far and I hope at some point to be able to come to your country and perhaps talk to you. Thanks very much Dr. Jordan Peterson.

Speaker 2:          01:25          Bye Bye.
