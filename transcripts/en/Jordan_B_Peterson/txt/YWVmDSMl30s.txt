Speaker 1:          00:00:14       I'm here with a couple of professors from Wilfrid laurier to talk about the Lindsay Shepherd scandal and what happened with Professor Rambo Canada and Pimlott and administrator Adrianne, Joel, Adrian, right Atria, Joel, who I think is the Unsung, what would you call it, the unsung villain in this entire process because she seems to have escaped relatively unscathed, even though I think her role is more reprehensible than anyone else's. Anyways, why don't you guys introduce yourself and talk about what you've been doing at Wilfrid laurier and also just let everybody know why we're meeting.

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       Yeah. Well, uh, I'm Dave Haskell and uh, I'm a prophet Laura Day. I'm in the Faculty of Liberal Arts. Uh, this is my colleague. Will, will, how do we come into this whole thing like this is, this didn't just happen with the Lindsay affair, like to background. We support maximum freedom of expression and we've really found each other along with a few other professors who feel the same way that we do that free expression and free inquiry is the core value of a university. And but sort of how did we run out

Speaker 3:          00:01:21       each other business school? Uh, so my exposure to the faculty of Arts is minimal and I've been really sheltered from this professionally, but watching what's happening in the U. s watching what was happening to you at uft, I'm a Grad, I did my phd here and um, it was in January that our university leadership sent out an email, um, explaining to the faculty how to think about the trump travel ban and declaring a, its, its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusivity. And I was really offended by that, that they would see fit to pronounce on a political issue in another country. Uh, offended. Why I, I'm, I've got a phd. I'm able to reach my own conclusions about whether these things are good or bad. I don't need my administration preaching to me about the, the right way to think about an issue, a political issue, particularly consumer.

Speaker 3:          00:02:19       So why do you think they did that and what do you think they were thinking when they did that? Because that sort of seems self evident, right? To the Snot, the administration's role to dictate a political stance to the faculty. That's just clearly not their role. So what do you think they were thinking? It would seem like a manifestation of trump derangement syndrome. It seems like just the same reaction that the Democrats in the US for having that they lost to this horrible person and they couldn't understand why and it was so reprehensible and here was yet another terrible thing that he was doing and we must all agree how bad it was. Well, I mean even if the funny thing is even if you can make that and say

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       personally and even socially, the idea that you could make that case and then be university administration and then tell your faculty to think that way. I mean that's taking it in a whole different. That's taking it to a whole whole different level of presump presumptuousness. Did that come from our administration? From the diversity and equity from the administration, from the leadership, the university leadership.

Speaker 2:          00:03:23       I remember the. It's confusing because I remember we also got an email from the diversity and equity office when when trump won and they said that they've created a safe space and they were going to be open for extra hours in case anybody needed to go and find

Speaker 4:          00:03:39       comfort. Right. That happened a lot in the United States. Hey, what do you think? At least the Americans have some justification for it, given that it's their country. I mean, we need safe spaces because a conservative was elected in the United States and they're not even in our country. It does seem to be a little bit on the absurd side.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       Well, it just to me, you know, they didn't send out an email when Justin Trudeau won and I have to imagine that there were some students who were offended, like there's got to be conservative students at l'oreal, but it's. It's very much a one sided conversation. When we talk about administration, when we talk about the diversity and equity office, they talk about diversity, but they really don't mean it because they do not want those students who are ideologically diverse. They talk about inclusion, but they purposely will exclude those students. And an email like that is proof positive of that kind of exclusion. But what?

Speaker 4:          00:04:29       Well that was, that was the thing that just got me hopping mad and I was emailing back and forth with a colleague at Queens, uh, and we were talking about the importance of free speech and this had outraged me. And, uh, and he sent me a link to a star article that David had written. This is now maybe a month later in February or March about a, this guest speaker. Oh, Daniel. Roberta. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And that she couldn't speak and where she was, she, uh, um, commercial lawyer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So merely because she served as a defense lawyer for someone, she was pilloried.

Speaker 2:          00:05:02       Well this was another, like when people look at the Lindsay Shepherd affair, this is not an isolated case at Wilfrid laurier. This is something that is, it is a regular occurrence and now it isn't always as high profile, but whether it's students in my office saying I can't speak, whether it's my colleagues sometimes saying to their students who believes that they're stifled and every hand goes up and there have been cases of that colleagues have come and told me, but we've got these other examples like when Daniel came to speak at the Brantford campus of Wilford Laurey and some students agitated until she was forced not to do so and, and my, My President Greg, we should provide some background. So that was the case. Right. And so give me a. She was a CBC journalist who was accused of sexual assault and sexual misbehavior by a number of people who was immediately let go at CBC, who was dragged

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       viciously through the press, I would say, and then was found innocent in the courts now, but, and he had a defense lawyer. The defense lawyer had been invited to,

Speaker 4:          00:06:08       to speak. Yes. She was part of the defense team. She was going to speak and she wasn't going to speak about the Ghomeshi trial. In fact, she was going to talk about what it's like to be a high power powerful lawyer, um, in, in the big city in Toronto. And I mean that would have been really valuable for the criminology students, but the students who were agitating against her really with the support of several professors, uh, they were saying, well, no, if she comes on, it will trigger students. It will, um, it will mentally harm students. And so that was used as justification for the act. Interesting to, to me to see that these claims of harm and so forth or

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       generally put forth by people who have no clinical expertise whatsoever. And their idea is that the way that you, first of all that, the way to aid people's mental health is to protect them and there's no evidence for that whatsoever. And the second is that in your attempts to protect them, the best thing to do is to shelter them from exposure to ideas that would be challenging or frightening, which is precisely the opposite of what a clinician does when he's trying to. Or she is trying to, um, deal with someone who has access anxiety. What you do in a case where someone who has access anxiety, even as a consequence of a trauma, let's say, is you get them to voluntarily expose themselves to increasingly larger doses of exactly what frightens them. That's the curative route. So not only is it a advice that's being disseminated, say by people who aren't clinicians, it's actually advice that's being disseminated, who are promoting the opposite of what an informed clinician would do. And that doesn't. That isn't my opinion, that's, that's as close to a consensus as anything you could reach among clinical practitioners, right? One rules for clinical improvement is get your story straight, something like that. Talk about your past, sorted out and expose yourself to the things that you're afraid of that you're inclined to avoid. That's the pathway to, to resilience and more robust mental health. Okay. So tell us the story a bit. You guys have an inside view of what's happened on the Wilfred laurier campus since the, the Lindsay Shepherd fair broke.

Speaker 4:          00:08:17       I should just say that, you know, after this rubber tie event, I read David's piece and immediately emailed him and just say, and that's how we injured and uh, we met and we had lunch and uh, in just talked about free speech and the Chicago statement and how can we get it implemented the university, but we just couldn't see any way forward and really. So that's another thing we want to discuss. You guys have rewritten the Chicago statement, right? So that it's more appropriate in the Canadian context, right? We call it the Laurie Laurie a statement for freedom of expression. Okay. Okay. And you've been trying to convince or, or you're trying to be in, you've been trying to communicate the university authorities to have that ratified essentially adopted as a state of principles and have you had any success with that or what's the consequence? They deferred to a task force that's going to be held and we can certainly. Okay, as in is that in the aftermath of the shepherd affairs that going to be part of it really do anything over the summer just because it just seemed too big a mountain a and there seemed to be no way to introduce the idea right now you've got your

Speaker 2:          00:09:23       catalyst and Lindsay shepherd becomes the catalyst and and, and you know what, what a object lesson in what goes on at l'oreal, but also what an object lesson in how you handle these free speech opponents. She's really given a model that other students I hope will follow, but it was, it was through this robot tie thing that we got to know each other and, and a few others. Yeah, there's a couple more of you. And so about five I think he told me. That's right. So, so the rope Italians incident really brought us out of the woodwork. We started a chat and say, you know, we see this problem on our university. We don't know what to do. And then when the Lindsay Shepherd scandal broke, we all immediately we were emailing as it's happened again, is essentially what we were saying. And we said, we've got to do something about this.

Speaker 2:          00:10:16       Uh, I'd already, I was out on a, on a trip and I came home and I said to my wife, where are the newspapers? This was a November twelfth when the story broke Christie Blatchford story. And I said, hey honey, where are the newspaper? She said, I can't let you see him. I said, why not? She said, you cannot read the papers. And of course it was [inaudible] Christie Blatchford articles in there. So as soon as I read it, I was beside myself. I thought it's happened again and this time, this is really terrible. They've attacked a Ta, is what they've done. So I contact with the full force of the administration and claims that she had done mental harm, broken two laws to laws, federal and provincial is sincerely worried that they were going to railroad this young lady

Speaker 4:          00:10:59       so they could have easily taken her to the Ontario Human Rights Code.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       The mission would have had field. What was gonna Happen? Uh, I contacted Christie Blatchford. I said, can you put me in touch with her? She was kind enough to do so I got in touch with Lindsay and I said, I know that this is a terrible time, but you've got a professor who supports you. I knew that these gentlemen also would, uh, and then quickly I as quickly as I could, I wrote an op Ed for the Toronto Star that we just again to saying this is happening. The world needs to be aware of it, but it was really after that, uh, that Monday after the story broke on the Saturday, we started to talk and, and how can we, how can we assist Lindsey and, and how can,

Speaker 4:          00:11:38       oh, the orbit helped you. And the fact that the star ran it was quite remarkable as well. So hurry to the star. The Star really does want to do its best to champion free expression. Yeah. Well you'd think journalists would actually be concerned about that to some degree. Think they are. Like, one of the things that's happened to me in the last year is that although the press coverage of what I did just to remind people. So last year I made a video about bill [inaudible], which was the bill who's provisions Lindsay Shepherd theoretically transgressed against. Just to be clear about that, and when I first made the video, I was accused by all sorts of people, including journalists, have, um, well first of all, making unnecessary noise and being unnecessarily alarmist, which were the minor accusations. And then the more major accusations were that, you know, I was all the things that you'd expect a far right.

Speaker 4:          00:12:25       I'm an agitator to be a bigot and a transphobic and racist and all of these things. And so, but what was interesting was that the journalists, by and large, especially the main journalists, turned around on that issue really quickly. It was probably within three weeks because what happened was a couple of them actually went and read the policy documents that I had referred to on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website, which are still there and which are still appalling and have led exactly to this situation with Lindsey. And as soon as they read what I had, uh, being uh, uh, what, what outing, let's say in my video, then they started to understand that this was, that I wasn't just ringing a bell for no reason at all. It was actually reasonable, I think, of people to go after me to begin with because Canada is such a safe and peaceful place and our political situation and economic situation has been so stable that when someone comes out and says, look, we're in danger of making a major error, the logical first response should be, no, there's something wrong with you.

Speaker 4:          00:13:26       It's like we're flying. There's something wrong with you. Right. Exactly. Well in Indiana. So it's reasonable. I think it was reasonable for me to be hit hard in the aftermath of doing that because, well, generally speaking, whistleblowers in Canada are alarmist in Canada. Have very little to be alarmist about this. This. Okay. So now, so fine. So this thing happened with Lindsay. What have you seen happening on the Wilfred laurier campus? Things that I'm not particularly proud of, I would say. I mean, I knew that a will and some other colleagues were going to come to the aid of Lindsey, but I was thinking that once her recording became public that we would just have a flood of professors coming to support our cause, which is we had a lorry, a statement for freedom of expression modeled on the Chicago statement. We thought that immediately people would just say, of course we need to reinforce that this needs to be the primary mission free expression, free inquiry needs to be the primary mission.

Speaker 4:          00:14:25       And we got that a pretty fast. We really did. And uh, and, and uh, and got it on change.org. And then where I was emailing everybody that I knew and trying to get people interested and I would say out of 50 emails I sent, I got 15 signatures from personal relationships. So even with personal relationships, you could only get a 30 percent hit rate. So what do you think's stopping professors from signing that say are clambering on board, especially in the aftermath of the shepherd recording, which we should point out. This is one of the things that's very interesting is that outside Wilford Laurey and perhaps outside universities that are in the same boat, the reaction to that recording was universal, right? And and national and international and uniform. And the reaction was, what the hell. This is scandalous. There's nothing about this that is acceptable.

Speaker 4:          00:15:24       Right? And so what's what struck me is so remarkable is that even though there's been international outrage over this and, and very and not an outrage of a sort that's only been disputed by a very small number of people, at least to begin with, Wilfred laureate responded on mosques, let's say as if this was somehow debatable. You know, as if there were two sides of the story here, let's say. And I thought, well, I thought Rambo Canada and Pim Lot who were the professors, did what they did. I thought it was appalling for in upgrading her and in the manner in which they did it and in the language that they used. But I thought what was truly terrifying was the presence of Adrian Joel at that inquisition because she was a administrator who was hired specifically to do exactly what she was doing by legislated necessity on the part of the Ontario Liberal government.

Speaker 4:          00:16:18       Right. Because it wasn't just the university that was involved in this. Her position was set up because of legislative necessity, which is something also to keep in mind when we're going after the university's. Okay. So you had a hard time getting faculty on board. How many faculty members didn't sign it out of, out of how many faculty? Five hundred and 50 full time and now. And so you say, well what's going on with them? Well, I think that some. Maybe, I know this is hard to believe, but maybe unaware. Even now there's a big proportion that are unaware. I unbelievable. I think. Okay, well that's it's own mystery because I don't know where you'd have to have been in the last month to not have noticed that this has happened, that people perhaps in the sciences, the computer sciences, the math, they, they've got their head down and they're doing the research and and so and so.

Speaker 4:          00:17:06       I don't think there's anything diabolical there. I think that as well. I've got very few signatures from the business faculty meet some, but a lot of people just aren't engaged. It's a bit of a commuter school a little bit so I think people are just getting on with their research and their teaching. Maybe not aware of. Well that's a. that's an interesting thing in and of itself because I think part of what's led to the occupation of the university, let's say by the radical postmodern types is the proclivity of the scientists in particular, but also I would say the more serious scholars to be focusing narrowly on their field of inquiry, which is essentially what they should be doing and not paying attention to any of the broader contextual issues.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Which is actually a perfectly fine strategy. When things are going well,

Speaker 2:          00:17:53       but a terrible strategy when they're not, and what you also see, so we've got these people who might not be aware and we've got the, the few who are aware and are supporting maximum free expression, but then you've got these other people who are convinced that maximum free expression, free inquiry is not a good thing for a university. And, and those people are definitely congregated within the arts and the humanities and they justify it because they are applying a social justice lens or what they would call a critical theory lens to this entire, this entire issue. And, and how, how about a quick summary of critical theory or critical theory? I mean in a nutshell, it's an idea that came from the Frankfurt school in Germany. It transfers over to Columbia University. Uh, it is some German scholars who are Marxists. And what they are saying is that a Marxism as an economic unit or as an economic philosophy really doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          00:18:48       It doesn't transfer very well, but let's change it over to a social theory. And it's a, it's a theory of oppressor and oppressed. And it's very bifurcated, you've, you are either one or the other and if you are the oppressed, you're good. And if you're the oppressor, you're bad. And it's as simple as that. There's no nuance or okay, I'm, I'm being as bad as they are to to. So I'm giving you the really broad strokes on this, but essentially it does set up the villain and the victim. And, and it is the idea that we must do everything to silence the villain, the oppressor, and to center the oppressed. Yes. And then we will elevate the oppressed. And same thing happened essentially with the French, a deconstructionist to 1970. It is. So this is, this is the motivation behind it. But when, when you hear them talk about critical theory, it is not critical thinking. There's a big difference. And so parents will hear while they're teaching critical theory. Isn't that a good thing? No, because critical thinking means I'm going to show you both sides of this argument. Critical theory means I'm going to deliberately give you one side of the argument. I'm going to tell you who's right and I'm going to tell you who's wrong. There's an oppressor and oppressed the oppressors, the bad guy. The oppressed is the good guy and it's a very manipulative way of.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       Okay. So, uh, so, so there's, let's say two reasons why people wouldn't sign the, the, the, uh, the petition one is they're doing something else and they're just not interested in it. And, and, and fair enough, even though I think that that's dangerous at the moment. The second is that they're actually philosophically or ideologically opposed to the proposition. Right. And so to what degree do you think the ladder is the determining factor behind the relatively small degree of support that you, that you guys have been able to draw out? The big thing that the, uh, a group of faculty signed an open letter to the University of about the

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       violence. Uh, and, and that, the, that the administration needed to make the campus safe. Yeah. They did the same thing with me after I made my video. I was, I made the campus unsafe and 200 people signed up. He signed a petition. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:00       What does unsafe mean? I mean this is the problem. The the, the left, the far left are taking words that have a traditional meaning, a traditional definition, and they're blowing that definition completely, completely away, and and at one time, harm meant that there was an infliction of damage that would have lasting effect and it would compromise the appearance or the function, right? We can think about damage to a car, right, lasting and it's affecting the, the appearance or the function. That's what harm is, but they've stretched that definition so that it becomes meaningless. That my an objectionable idea becomes harm, that that when you show a video, you've made a place unsafe and that

Speaker 4:          00:21:50       that's the language of trigger warnings and safe spaces, but it's disingenuous that there was a trans rally and one of the speakers said that, letting I can quote this, apparently letting Peterson's views be heard in the classroom is violence is violence. Yeah. Right, right. Yeah. Yes. You can react with violence. Yes. Well, that's often what I think that I've thought a lot about. One of the tenants of postmodernism left, so I would say of critical theory, but particularly of postmodernism in it's more Marxist variance, is that the only motivation for the construction of hierarchies is power and you think, well that's. No, there's lots of reasons for producing hierarchies, right? There's hierarchies of competence, there's hierarchies of interest, there's hierarchy, hierarchies of aesthetic quality, like there's all sorts of. Wherever you can make a qualitative judgment, you make a hierarchy. So there's the idea that power is the only driving force between behind the construction of hierarchies is absolutely preposterous.

Speaker 4:          00:22:52       So you think, well why in the world would anyone make that claim that it's only power that exists while as far as I can tell, at least one of the reasons is that it justifies the use of power and if you have your position because of power, which is basically tyranny, then I'm fully warranted in my use of power against you. That's all there is. So I think it's a great justification for it. Okay. So how many people signed the petition stating that the campus had become unsafe? That was like 79, 79. Just like that. Okay, so you got more people signing a petition claiming that what shepherd did made the campus on Save, then you did getting some. Okay, so that's interesting because one of the things we're going to address later is the president's letter as a consequence of the inquiry into the Lindsay Shepherd affair, and one of the things she says, I'm a people who've tried to downplay what happened at Lindsay at Wilford Laurey have said basically

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       two or three things. One is that,

Speaker 1:          00:23:50       well, the shepherd is not to be trusted and she's really like a. a, a subtle arm of the right wing. That's one. One. And that she's a reprehensible character. Yes. Yes. There are Pedrosa. I know they. They directly went after it. I'm quite sneaky that way. The second is that pim lot, ramboo Canada and Joel misinterpreted Bill [inaudible], which I think is absolutely preposterous. I think they interpreted exactly the way that it was written, especially if you consider the surrounding policies and that's what I was warning about last September and the third is that this was an isolated incident and doesn't truly reflect the reality either of Wilfrid laurier or other campuses and not stated explicitly in the president's letter, and so that's one of the things I wanted to discuss because I don't buy that. I think this wasn't an anomaly. This wasn't people stepping out of line and I think the proof of that is not what Rambo candidate or pim law, because we could say, yeah, yeah, they're ideologically committed professors and they and they're. They're not very professional in their administrative abilities and they went after a Ta unprofessionally and stupidly.

Speaker 2:          00:24:54       That's bad.

Speaker 1:          00:24:55       That's not really bad. What's really bad was that there was a paid administrator at the meeting who was hired to do exactly that, and so the fact that she was there is the proof to me that this is not only not an isolated incident. It's actually a logical and it logical and inevitable consequence of legislative moves that made these bureaucratic positions necessary and the practical reality that these administrative positions do exist on the campuses. So there's no isolated incident issue there. Now, how do you think Lindsay's been treated at Wilfrid laurier? Like what's your, what's your impression of her, of her personal situation there?

Speaker 2:          00:25:37       I think that, so on the positive side, there have been students who have rallied to her support and that's been really encouraging to see a, it was some students on campus who are dedicated to freedom of expression. They mostly are coming from the conservative clubs, uh, whether it's the conservative political club or other conservative groups. Uh, although definitely invitations have been extended to other groups of other political stripes or other. They really haven't rallied to Lindsey, sadly. Uh, so those students have to a certain extent, befriended her or brought her under their wing or just began associating with her and saying, how can we support you? I think in her classes, and I'm just going from what I've seen, I follow her on twitter, so I see what's been going on there apparently, and I don't think this is inaccurate, the other Grad students are being quite scathing.

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       Yeah, that's what I've heard from her and from her tweets is that at least they're cold at minimum, they're cold and the professors as well, including the one who told her that she couldn't use her laptop in class because she didn't want to be recorded.

Speaker 2:          00:26:50       I mean, you couldn't script this level of idiocy, but my. My thought is students always ask me a Dr Hascall, can I record what you're talking about? I say, yes, yes. The answer is yes. The answer's yes. Because you know what? I don't say anything in my class that I wouldn't publicly say because I and I want to be accountable. I want people to know what I'm saying in my class. I want them to know I'm fair. I'm balanced. I present both sides of the argument. I'm not afraid of that. I mean, why are people afraid of accountability that that's beyond my understanding. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:21       Well that's, that's a very good, that's a very good question. So, okay, so, um, I think, I think what we'll do now is go through this letter because what happened yesterday I guess is the president had appointed a third party fact finder to look into what happened with the Lindsay Shepherd Fair. Right. And there were concerns about that because many people, including Christie Blatchford were concerned, and the lawyer that's representing Lindsay Howard, Howard Levin, was concerned that the person who was appointed to do the third party investigation wouldn't be neutral because he had tweeted his agreement with a variety of, let's call them politically correct issues quite publicly, but it doesn't look like he's done a credible job. That that's what it appears to me anyways. The president who is very closed mouth or new assiduously neutral about this whole affair has released a report and I thought we could go through it and talk about whether or not we think that it addressed the issues reasonably so because I think it did in some part, but I think it didn't in others.

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       So this is from mcclatchy. Deborah mcclachi, Phd, who's the president and new vice chancellor at Wilford Laurey and relatively new at it, so she's really been raked through the coals thoughts for sure. She was still vice president academic, which is the second most senior physician for the last five or so. She's accustomed to this. Okay. Okay. It is. I believe it is time for some clarity around the events of the past few weeks here at Wilfrid laurier university, stemming from the very regrettable meeting, so that's an interesting turn of phrase to begin with. That followed the showing of a TV. Oh, clipped by a teaching assistant during a tutorial as the newly appointed president and vice chancellor of this incredible 106 year old institution. I'm here to set the record straight and announced some important changes. The issue has highlighted some deficiencies but input, but as importantly at is created opportunities.

Speaker 1:          00:29:15       Yeah. Well to me that's a. that's a kind of marketing doublespeak. It's like we could just go with the deficiencies issue for now. Opportunities for Laurie to improve our own performance, to lead a broader discussion on academic freedom and freedom of expression and opportunities to work together as a community to demonstrate the strengths we have as an institution. When the issue first broke, I erred on the side of caution as a person, as a president, as the president of Laurie am sensitive to the viewpoints and concerns of our students, staff and faculty. As an employer, I am cognizant that the four people who were in that meeting room, our employees and one is also a student. All four are entitled to due process. I did not want to rush judgment. Rather, I wanted to ensure we were able to objectively assess the facts and make sound decisions flowing from that assessment.

Speaker 1:          00:30:04       That seems reasonable enough. And I would say the events that have transpired probably justified her approach. Um, although I had taken issues with some of the things that she had said and not said when she was on the agenda, but whatever. We hired an external fact finder with expertise in human resources issues. I have received the report and we are taking decisive action to ensure these events will not be repeated. The report along with what we already knew has led me to the final conclusions following conclusions and actions. There were numerous errors in judgment made in the handling of the meeting with Ms Dot Lindsay Shepherd the Ta of the tutorial and question. In fact, the meeting never should have happened at all. Okay. That's probably the most damning statement and the entire report I would say because she. And then she says no formal complaint nor informal concern relative to a lorry.

Speaker 1:          00:30:54       A policy was registered about the screening of the video. This was confirmed in the fact finding report. Okay, so we can take that apart a little bit. No formal complaint. Okay. So Rambo Kana claimed that one or more students had complained. He wouldn't say how many and he wouldn't say what the nature of the complaint was. Now, what this document seems to indicate that is that, well, if there was a complaint, which it leaves vague, there was nothing that would constitute a genuine complaint in an administrative sense and that's why the meeting should have never happened. So I guess one question would be, um, what if any appropriate disciplinary action should be taken against Rambo Mckenna and pim lot. And I don't know the answer to that because you know, they're not administrative experts and I don't think faculty can be, but by the same token, I don't feel like I understand exactly what happened to bring about the meeting to begin with. Do you guys know?

Speaker 2:          00:31:56       I mean, whatever we do know we've had to piece together from different media reports because as has been said, uh, our president is not releasing the findings of this like this is, this is going to be, this is a secret. The Independent investigation. We will never know what it actually says. We don't know what all the recommendations are. We, I think we can take her at her word that she's telling us what's

Speaker 1:          00:32:20       and why is she making it secret or keeping it secret? Is that, is that the, this concern with, what do you call it? Confidentiality. That seems to be the, the what, the, the camouflage behind which these things are always hidden.

Speaker 2:          00:32:33       That seems to be implied and, or even said explicitly, but I've seen other cases where been disciplinary measures and, and we, we get more details than this. Right? So, so I don't know. I don't know the level of confidentiality that is required under law, but what I can say, and I'll let, will talk about what the disciplinary actions can be. Let's keep in mind that when Ramboo Canada said that there had been a complaint and it says here that there wasn't, he then echos that in his apology to Lindsay. He then says, of course, I'm, I'm paraphrasing here, so I'm not being completely accurate in terms of what he exactly said, but he said something like, of course there are things I can't discuss because of the complaint that was made by a student. So he's echoing what seems to be an untruth and while this is about

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       closest statement, as you might imagine in a statement like this, stating that it was an untruth, I mean he said, she said no formal complaint nor informal concern relative to a lorry. A policy was registered. I mean, that's, that's

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:33:42       That's as close as you could get. Two coming right out and saying that the statement that there was a complaint was a falsehood.

Speaker 2:          00:33:49       And I just want to follow that thread for a second. So here we have a controversy that was started on an untruth and it seems to be that this is part of the whole modus operandi here when we're here and there's been harm and it's unsafe violence, daily violence. Although again, when the media, global, National News, Globe and Mail checked in to see if there were any police reports related to any harassment or any threats.

Speaker 1:          00:34:21       No police reports had university of Toronto. So. So at some point, don't we have to say there was a boy who cried wolf. Well this is even, this is more egregious. Even though then claiming harm, I mean because you know, maybe people were getting nasty tweets and so forth and I suspect they were, um, but the thing is, is that Rambo Canada and pim lot directly claimed that there had been a complaint. Right? And so that's a big problem that isn't thoroughly addressed

Speaker 5:          00:34:47       well, and in either somebody, uh, heard about the tutorial and the fact that a Peterson video was shown a and uh, kind of found out somehow, but he decided that was unacceptable

Speaker 1:          00:35:02       and that the right way to approach it was to claim that a student had complained because it's not a problem that he found it. It's not such a big problem that he found unacceptable. Let's say it is his class, like he has a right to talk to, is ta about what's going to be shown and what's not going to be showing even though he handled it. I think reprehensive in that meeting, but he could come out and say look like that is what the sort of thing I want to be discussed in my class. I don't agree with Peterson. I think he's a jerk. And like, here's the other things you should be concentrating on, but to come out and say a student complained and then to buttress that the accusation

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       that she had violated federal and provincial law as well as the university bring in and I don't understand why Joel was there without some sort of follow up paper work or evidence of a, of a complaint. Well, I, I think that the, the, the, the reason for that is that the positions that people like Joel occupy are so ill defined and so fundamentally reprehensible in their organization and their, in their aims is that this is exactly the sort of thing that you would expect. And so I thought she didn't say much in that little inquisitorial recording, but I thought the thing she did say were spectacularly concerning. Let's put it that way. The way the discipline. What, what, what is the discipline? Do you have any sense of this? Like I, I, I can't speculate. I don't know. Communications are uh, well what, what happens when somebody lies or when somebody brings forth that complaint that wasn't a complaint.

Speaker 4:          00:36:34       I will. That is that. Well, that's one of the things this document does not address, like it's a big problem. It's a big problem. If there was no complaint and the reason she was disciplined was because there were because there was a claim that there was a complaint like that's well we can, we don't have to beat that to death claim that there's harm. What about if there's a claim that the campus has daily violence? What if there's a claim that such and such area has become unsafe? Does that need to be proven or should we be seeking disciplinary action against people who are making those claims? That's a very good, that's a very good question. Okay, so, so that's, that's a, that's a problem that isn't addressed in this report. It's a big one. Okay. And, and I mean the president is obviously not happy with this because she also says the errors in judgment.

Speaker 4:          00:37:25       Okay. No formal complaint, no informal concern was registered about the screening of the video. This was confirmed in the fact finding report. So they're not beating around the Bush about this. There are stating very clearly the errors in judgment were compounded by misapplication of existing university policies and procedures, basic guidelines, basic guidelines and best practices on how to appropriately execute the roles and responsibilities of staff and faculty were ignored, not just not understood, ignored or not understood. Okay. That's a pretty damn damning statement there too. So I don't even know how the particular here I heard Howard levins say that she was entitled to some sort of represent. Lindsay was entitled to some representation under the bylaws of our university and she was supposed to have had that, that nobody offered that. Right. So that's an administrative followup at the level of employee employer relationships to say nothing of the academic issues at stake here. We don't have policies and procedures about how to carry out and acquisition and that's not what she's saying. I think there's a med eval document that you can use, but one thing Jordan, I'd want to point out here is that the errors and were compounded

Speaker 6:          00:38:35       by misapplication of existing university policies, misapplication of existing university policies. At the end of this document, she's going to say that our gender and sexual violence policy needs to be reviewed. So which is, it was, right. Was it an error, an application or an error in policy and, and that's. This is confusing. Yeah, it is. Because my suggestion would be the policy is terribly flawed. We have a colleague who's one of the free speech proponents at our university, Dr Andrew Robinson. He is an expert in human rights law and he went through our gendered and sexual violence policy with a fine tooth comb and he says this document is unworkable. It makes thought a crime. And he wrote an op Ed to that effect. So my point would be, and what, and who did he, what organization is he part of interest? Yeah, but which, which, which, which, uh, human rights and human diversity.

Speaker 6:          00:39:30       I mean, that's exactly. It says field. Yes, exactly. And so when he looked at this, he says, this goes beyond what the Ontario government was even asking for. And it gets to the point where it actually makes. You can be guilty of thought crime. You can be guilty of transphobia without any intent if someone, if someone says, I've been harmed mentally, that is enough for conviction under this particular policy. It's the same with the Ontario Human Rights Commission's policies. Intent doesn't matter. So this isn't in this application. I'm, I'm saying, did Adriana Joelle actually get it right? And so is that a misapplication or do so it'll be interesting if the university does discipline her, if she gets legal representation, who claimed that she was actually applying the policies correctly because that is the question. Right? So, but it could be two things. It can be the policies are flawed and this is the consequence and they were misapplied.

Speaker 6:          00:40:28       We don't know, but if there's definitely ambiguity here and that, and that's a crucial issue. I think Lindsay was guilty under the gender and sexual violence policy and she was. Adrian was accusing her. She was [inaudible]. Uh, it would have been an Ontario human rights code violation, but GSP, she was right if there had been a complaint. Right, right. Okay. Okay. And how many angels can dance on the head? Okay. Procedures in how to apply university policies. Same issue here and under what circumstances were not followed the training of key individuals to meet the expectations of the university and addressing such an issue as an issue as such as this was not sufficient and must be improved. Okay. The question is who are these key individuals? Do they mean Rambo cannot pim lot and Joel is they, are they putting all three of those in there? And then the next question would be how are they going to improve the training of key individuals? Because that actually worries me as a faculty member, right? Because whenever the administration decides that it's going to engage in some additional training of faculty

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       members, then that raises the hair on the back of my neck. Like, is this unconscious bias training? Is that what they're talking about? Which has been. Well I think, uh, I can't remember. I've just read recently, no himself who developed the iat just published a review paper stating clearly stating clearly that attempts to reduce unconscious bias by explicit explicit training. There's no evidence whatsoever that they have any positive effect. And that was nozick himself who helped develop the IAT [inaudible], the little coterie that develop that test. I'm a chair of the Harvard Psychology Department. I'll remember her name in a minute. Green walled Anthony Greenwald and Nozek. What's her name? Mazda three of them developed it. They're starting to fragment a bit because the thing is being pushed way too hard. Right? It's not a test that's valid for the purposes that it's being put to and they know it perfectly well even though they're consulting about it and have made quite an enterprise out of it.

Speaker 4:          00:42:31       But no, Zack is, you know, it seems to be a pretty credible scientist and he's actually looking at the data and it's clear that the, these unconscious bias training programs have zero positive impact. There's some evidence that they have negative impact because of course people don't like being accused of being unconscious racists. Right. So I'm wonder is that the kind of training, and there's nothing in here that says this, but this is the problem that it says there will be training unconscious bias. Is that the same as systemic discrimination? Well, it's the, it's the neurological equivalent of systemic discrimination, so imagined discredit, systemic discrimination is built into the structure of the system, right? Unconscious bias is built into your perceptual structures. So even before you act or think you're biased towards against the members of an outgroup that's the claim, and not only biased in against the members have outgroup, which is a different claim that biased in favor of your ingroup, which of course almost every human being is, especially if you think about your family, but that, that, that implicit bias also manifests itself in behaviors that would essentially be categorizable as racist, at least at a low level.

Speaker 4:          00:43:40       And there's very little evidence that the implicit bias that this test, hypothetically measures, manifests itself in measurable behavior. So

Speaker 5:          00:43:50       we went through a thing in the summer where they ran a regression on salaries at lorry and found that women were paid a little bit less than men by about four percent. And so they gave all the time

Speaker 4:          00:44:02       include jade, did they include age as a covariate? The answer to that would be no. The model was a, it had, um, rank, uh, and I don't know that it had, it only had four categories of professor though when this has been done at University of Michigan for instance, because I looked at comparables, they had 21 categories of professor, uh, or 21 departments at ours. We had four. So you were comparing, for instance, within the business school who might be in marketing versus someone who. Well, I know, I know from setting up regression equations ad nauseum that the, the covariates that you included in the equation determine the outcome of the, of the, of the year equation, the conclusion they reached, the explanation for the statistical significance of the Jenica efficient was systemic discrimination, right? Right. Of course. Well, that, that wasn't the conclusion they reached. That was the conclusion.

Speaker 4:          00:44:58       They stepped into the inquiry width and they gerrymandered the statistics until they found a regression equation that supported their, their initial claim. So that was, that's not an inquiry, but. So there's, what I hear you saying is there's really no scientific basis for this idea that there could be this unconscious bias that could drive. There is evidence that were full of unconscious biases, I mean we couldn't even see if we didn't have unconscious biases because we have to use shortcuts and heuristics to just process the world. The issue is what measurable impact does that have on behavioral? That's the first thing and it's minimal at best. First of all, it's not easy to distinguish between racial bias and novelty avoidance, right? Because what you'd have to do is you'd have to find a person, interracial group, say a white person who is just as familiar with black people as with white people and then show that there was a bias because otherwise you can't distinguish it from a novelty, novelty aversion, and people are characterized by novelty aversion.

Speaker 4:          00:45:56       You already have developed a preference for that cop over this cup. I mean it happens that quickly and it's that. It's that subtle and great and grand, let's say. So the first issue is we can't really distinguish unconscious bias from perceptual habit, let's say, or from or stereotyping from categorization for that matter, and that literature is being under assault in a major way in the social psychology literature. But even assuming that an implicit bias does exist, which you might, there might be grounds for by noting that people do have an in group preference safe for their family members and perhaps even for the racial members, although it's hard to distinguish that from novelty or from familiarity preference, putting all that aside, which you can't. There's no evidence that these courses that are put in place to reduce that bias have any effect whatsoever on the bias it's complete.

Speaker 4:          00:46:48       Even the people who are pushing the IAT and the idea of implicit bias are willing to say, well, all these things that we're doing to try to reduce it have absolutely no effect. Or if anything, a negative effect. And again, just we don't know that what the training is going to be. I guess where we went down this rabbit hole was we don't know what the training is going to be. Right? We don't know. We have no evidence to assume. We have no reason to assume that the training is going to address the proper problem and every reason to be skeptical that it won't. Okay. So next, um, there is also institutional failure that allowed this to happen. Well, we don't know what that means because I'd like to know what the institutional failure was, but that's a pretty broad and she says when, when there is institutional failure

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       ultimately starts and ends with me, well that's a nice statement and okay, she's taking responsibility for it, but unless it's specified what the institutional failures are, it's just hand waving. Going forward, we will implement improve training and new procedures and engage in a very specific administrative review. Details would be nice to strengthen and enhance confidence in what students and employees can expect it. Lori specifically, there was no wrongdoing on the part of Ms. Dot Shepherd in showing the clip from Tvo in her tutorial showing a video clip for the purposes of an academic discussion is a reasonable classroom teaching tool. While thank God for that, given that Ti vo is a publicly funded, a middle of the road left leaning, liberal news media establishment, a credible one for sure. I wish that early on immediately following this story breaking that administration had said exactly that because remember for more than a month now the public, the Canadian public has wondered, can you show tv Ontario videos in classrooms that Lori, right, and I'm not.

Speaker 6:          00:48:39       I'm not joking. Yeah. Like this was this and there has not been an answer from administration on that. Very basic question. Yeah, and so people who are thinking about sending their kids to l'oreal are thinking, is that the place where they didn't know whether or not you could show public television in a classroom? Is that the place where it took a independent investigation to come to the conclusion that it's okay to play a clip from the agenda that we still don't? Yes, exactly. It is the place where all of that was in doubt. That is Wilfred laureate is the place where those things were in doubt and so they're not quite as in doubt, but we also still don't know what else is. What else is still in doubt. Right. Because if that can be you wonder, well, you know, that's pretty damn innocuous. Okay. Any instructional material needs to be grounded in the appropriate academic underpinnings to put it in context for the relevance of the learning outcomes of the course.

Speaker 6:          00:49:39       Yeah. Well, the questionnaire is any instructional material needs to be grounded in the appropriate academic underpinnings. To put it in context, the question there is who decides what the appropriate academic underpinnings to put it in context are because that's supposed to be the. That's supposed to be the bailiwick of the professor period. Right, and with with some leeway for the for the teaching assistance and so on. But I worry when I hear about context because I've seen opinion pieces from some of my colleagues who tell me that the appropriate context is within the frame of social justice or within the frame of critical theory. Well, that's what I'm kind of said to shepherd was that while part of the reason you were wrong was because you portrayed it neutrally. If you had contextualized it essentially have you had connects July's Peterson

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       as Hitler, which was Rambo kind of statement than it would have been perhaps appropriate to to to edit the video and that is equivalent to leading the witness. Right. And leading the witnesses when we have a lawyer up an authority figure telling the person on the stand what to say, taking my ideas and putting them into that person's mouth. Right. Well that's how you produce unconscious bias. But. But my point would be, so I'm not saying that this is in here, but we really need clerical error. Well that's, that's a. that's a sentence that doesn't. That I'm not happy about appropriate academic underpinnings. To put it in context for the relevance of the learning outcomes of the course. Jesus. It's just administrative. Double speak the whole way through. You present in class in order. The criteria for evaluating that. I, I showed videos all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:51:16       Every class says they have the adequate underpinnings. Yeah. Well that's. That's the question is who decides that did the. The answer to that. There's a simple answer to that. The professor. That's the answer. There isn't another answer. There's no board, there's no higher authority, there's nothing else you know, and I show I do show clips from Hitler in my class and my personality class when we talk about orderliness and totalitarianism, I show clips from the triumph of the will and I show this other documentary called Crumb, which is about, uh, an underground cartoonist from the 19 sixties named Robert Crumb. And it is an absolutely shocking documentary, like if you ever wanted to know more than you want to know about rapists and serial killers, that documentary will tell you. It's really, it's a tough. It's a tough watch. No one, I can't, I can't imagine a like a committee reviewing my teaching materials and allowing those things to go forward without challenge. It'd be a disaster. Okay. The ensuing discussion also needs to be handled properly. Yeah. Well, we have no reason to believe this discussion was not handled well in the tutorial in question. Okay. So whatever handled property means Lindsay Shepherd managed it, which I think is a good sign here because if we take that as the model, Lindsay did present the information neutrally. Yeah. And, and she was not taking sides and if that's our model, that's, that's a good sign. Okay, that's good. So that's acceptable

Speaker 5:          00:52:51       by this, because we're going to three or four paragraphs. Find out that we need enhanced training for tea. Great. So did she handle it properly? Why do we need to treat it? The training?

Speaker 4:          00:53:01       Yes. That's row on. And again, who's going to do the training because it's not going to be the faculty because the faculty don't have time or the inclination for that matter to run that kind of trains are going to be the diversity and equity. Yeah, right. Well, that's the question. Who's going to do the training? I have apologized to ms dot shepherd publicly, as has Dr Lew Rambo Khanna, who's supervising professor the university has conveyed to her today that the results of the fact report to make the results of the fact finding report to make sure she understands it is clear that she was involved in no wrongdoing. Yes. Well, for someone who is involved in no wrong doing, she should bloody well got raked over the coals for the last month. So the university is taking concrete steps to make changes to ensure this doesn't happen again. Yeah, well good.

Speaker 4:          00:53:47       It has been made clear to those who were involved in the meeting with Ms Dot shepherd that their conduct does not meet the high standards I set for staff and faculty. Well, that is a big question there. Right? How has it been made clear to those who were involved in the meeting with Ms Dot Shepherd? That their conduct does not meet those high standards? Because we don't know. Does that mean that the president talked to them as there'd being disciplinary action like we, we. Because if it was, I don't even know what would be appropriate, but I would say that not knowing what was done is not appropriate. So, and I think it deserves specifics. I mean that's what got me into this was the Christie Blatchford, his article was very accurate because she already had the audio, but then when we heard the audio, it was so appalling what was done to her in that room.

Speaker 4:          00:54:36       It was such horrible bullying. Uh, and, and just such a violation of whether the university should stand for. That's what all of the anger, I mean in Canada, the devil's in the details. So it's the same with the, how it has been made clear to those who are involved. So because I don't mean maybe this is something we could talk about too. I don't know what would constitute appropriate disciplinary measures as a concept. I mean, you have here three people acting on a nonexistent complaint who produced an international scandal that damaged lindsay in a real sense, although it might have also made her stronger, but it certainly, it certainly didn't have to because a lesser person would have crumbled. I don't know if she would feel that she, I think she might take exception to that. Uh, she certainly has not claimed any kind of victim status through this whole thing and I think that no, but that's more a testament to her character than, than anything else because I mean she was subject to the kind of attacks I would say that would have snowed under a lesser person, but she has risen to this challenge.

Speaker 4:          00:55:46       Yes, definitely, definitely. Well, and, and, and thank God for that. But then there has been real harm done to the university as far as. I don't know how you would quantify that and financial terms, but I suspect it's substantial. But reputational terms, I mean now I would say internationally this is what Wilford Laurey is known for, so maybe that's an overstatement, but I don't think so. As these are individual employment issues, I cannot go into greater detail on any individual case. Well that could be but know that the university has and is taking action to rectify the situation and send a clear signal that this cannot and will not happen again. That sounds pretty forthright. Yeah, it is. One key improvement highlight is the need to enhance our faculty and Ta Training. Yeah. Well, like I said, as a faculty member, whenever I see that I don't see the role of the administrators at a university to to train the faculty.

Speaker 4:          00:56:40       That's not their role. Their role is to move paper around for the faculty. Fundamentally it is the responsibility of course, instructors to develop guidelines for the roles and expectations of their tax. Fair enough. The university also has high expectations of professors. As Ta supervisors, we recognize the need to do more in this area. We wreck the university's intent is to enhance the training and support for both the supervisors and teaching assistants, making these mandatory and standardized. That's my favorite part. Jesus. Dismal. So that. So my suspicions as a skeptic are that the making of training for faculty, Mandatory and standardized will do more harm than this scandal has done over the long run.

Speaker 3:          00:57:32       So we don't know what the training is. We don't know who's going to do it. We don't know what it's going to be about, but the one thing we do now, is it

Speaker 4:          00:57:38       mandatory? Mandatory and standardized, right? Yeah. Mandatory and standardized. Be Interesting to see how they'll do that too because it isn't so easy to make training mandatory for faculty members. Right? You can't just do that by fit because they can generally tell you to go to hell and should gendered and sexual violence policy. It has become clear to us that managing the new gendered and sexual violence policy, now that's the one that's mandated by the provincial government.

Speaker 2:          00:58:08       So it was bill a one 63, the provincial bill that said you need to have a policy on gendered and sexual violence. According to our colleague Dr Andrew Robinson. He says, we go way beyond what the province even asked for to the point where it becomes unmanageable and, and you have instances of thought crime. So. So that's what we have like this like this where you can claim that somebody is transphobic for simply showing a video.

Speaker 3:          00:58:38       Can I. Can I read you? The definition is this from the gender is from our policies, from our policy. It is an action that reinforces gender inequalities resulting in physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or mental harm.

Speaker 4:          00:58:55       Okay, so what's the first part of that again? Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:58:58       Yeah. You get lost, don't you? It is an action that reinforces gender inequality. Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:59:04       so let's start with that. An action that reinforces gender inequalities. Okay. So the first thing we might point out is that no one knows what the hell that means, right? It's a box that you can put anything in. So actions that's a problem because what? It isn't obvious to what constitutes an action or an inaction for that matter. So I mean, and then that reinforces gender inequalities, right? So that, that's, that's the sort of sentence that only someone who's ideologically possessed to the maximum would create because you can't parse it. Gender inequalities. Like what does that mean exactly? I don't. Well anyways, discrimination, sex or gender, it doesn't talk about discrimination. It talks about inequality, right? Which is, which is, it would be different if, if the, the phrasing had included the words discrimination. Okay. And the next part is a resulting in physical, sexual, emotional, economic or mental harm. Right? Right. So it says broadly construed, both, both clauses are as broadly construed as they can be, and the reason for that is to allow maximum scope per interpretation, which is exactly what happened with Adrian Joel.

Speaker 2:          01:00:16       Well, mental harm, again, mental harm. And, and as you pointed out, mental harm is not backed up by the empirical evidence apart from posttraumatic stress syndrome, like cognitive behavioral therapy would suggest that you actually can do mental good by exposing someone to objectionable ideas when they've eaten in moderation in order to help them become less mentally fragile. Uh, Scott Lilienfeld out of emory university, very credible scholar. Well, he is one of the mass. He's written several textbooks on psycho pathology, right? He knows his stuff and just this year he put out a paper where you explored the, the empirical evidence around microaggressions, and he did all of the literature and microaggressions that are of course, these innocuous actions that are deemed to be bigoted or, or somehow sexist. It's rudeness essentially. They are actually. It's showing a video of from Tvo is what a microaggression is. And what he said was, there is absolutely no evidence. There's no evidence that microaggressions, these objectionable ideas lead to mental harm.

Speaker 4:          01:01:29       He also said that the, the concept itself is extraordinarily ill defined, which is also a big problem. That was the beginning of our conversation. Everything is if you make the box big enough, you can put anything into it

Speaker 2:          01:01:42       and and what you see in this gender and violence policy that will, is reading from there, they're actually go on to say that this can include

Speaker 4:          01:01:52       Heterosexism, like you can be your, your mental crime can be heterosexism. Yeah. So what if I said something in class, like the empirical evidence strongly suggests that raising children in a two parent family leads to better outcomes, which it does by the way, like it like and seriously it does that. Then also that's the question of, well arguably right? Arguably our transcripts, that policy. Now here's an interesting thing too, so it has become

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       clear to us that managing the new gendered and sexual violence, Paul's, he has led to a confusion in its application. Right. Okay. So this is back to the issue we described earlier. Is it a confused confusion in the application or in the policy? Now you just read the damn policy. Now it seems to me that there's no way you could apply that policy without confusion, so it's not a confusion in its application, its. It might also be that, but it's a confusion in the policy written right into it. Okay, so that's. That's of crucial importance, right? It, in fact, the interviews conducted by the fact finder confirmed that the rationale for invoking the GSV P did not exist. It was misapplied and was a significant overreach. Yeah. I'm not so sure about that because I know that these kinds of policies emerge from the same sort of policy framework that characterizes the Ontario Human Rights Commission.

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       It's the same people doing it and the Ontario Human Rights Commission policies are written so that they can be broadly misapplied with no significant overreach. So. So. Okay, so that's a problem. To provide clarity of the policies intent and to strengthen accountability. We will engage in an administrative review with the goal of finding the appropriate structure to oversee and execute the GSPP and its accompanying procedures. We will also undertake a full review of the policy and its procedures. Okay, so good. So they're. They're saying while it might've been misapplied, but maybe the policy itself also has some problem. I think

Speaker 2:          01:03:47       this is really good news and we had a meeting with our colleague Andrew Andrew Robinson today and we said, well, you know, what do you think about this? And he was pleased. He said, you know, if some good has come out of this controversy, this is one of those good things because definitely the gendered and sexual violence policy, we haven't. Lori isn't workable. It is prejudiced against certain people and certain ideas and so it needs to be reworked because at this is not an inclusive document. It excludes

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       and so it needs to be fixed. So this is a good thing. Well, and it's also a canary in the coal mine for similar policies at universities all across Canada. We'd say, and maybe broader because one of one thing you'd hope is that the Lindsay Shepherd affair has produced enough, may be negative repercussions to set people back on their heels a little bit and make them dig into these policies because I can't imagine that there's another university in Canada who would enjoy partaking in a scandal of equivalent magnitude.

Speaker 2:          01:04:47       What I would hope, and on that point, Jordan, if someone is a student or if someone is a faculty member, ask for the evidence. That's what I've learned from this. There are a lot of claims out there. Mental harm. Our campuses become unsafe. Uh, the ideas that are contained in the, the gendered and sexual violence policy. I'm saying, okay, what is the evidence that proves this? Because this is, this is what a university is to be based on

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       from the enlightenment to today. We are supposed to be able to say, here's the evidence for why we do this. And the further we get away from evidence and the more we embrace ideology, we completely remove what the mission of a university is supposed to be. And the idea of evidence, we removed the idea of evidence, which means we remove the idea of knowledge because there's no distinction between knowledge and evidence. Right? Right. So, so if you are a student and you want to say, what can I do say, what's the evidence of mental harm? What's the evidence that, that this, that I'm transphobic. What's the wealth? Well, so partly what you're also saying there is a restatement of the old presumption of innocence idea. It's like, okay, you're accusing me of something. Prove it. I'm innocent. Adi, prove it. Where's your evidence? Now I know when we do it.

Speaker 6:          01:06:06       I know. Well, part of that is tied up with this, with the sexual harassment issue, because increasingly, and this is, this is this has started, I think most particularly the United States, we're moving towards a preponderance of evidence standard instead of a assumption of innocence standard. That's especially true with these sexual harassment policies that are being derived by derive from institutions and administrators concerned with such things as the gendered and sexual violence policy. And that. That's related to the comment you made earlier about the lawyer who wasn't allowed to speak right, because she had the temerity to offer someone who is accused of a crime, a legal defense, right when, when apparently what we were supposed to do with just assume that the people who were making the accusations were right because they claimed that they were wronged. So and, and to, to be, I mean, we always have to do our caveats, don't we?

Speaker 6:          01:06:59       We say, I know that we want to protect people who are victims like I each of us would agree, but it can't be done at this sac by sacrificing truth. Well, you don't protect people from being victimized by undermining the rule of law. No, quite the contrary because ultimately it comes back to bite you in the behind. Yeah. So that's for sure. And very, very rapidly. So. Okay. In the interim, we will ensure access to the existing support and complaints procedures by providing management and oversight through the Austin Office of dispute, Resolution and support. Okay. I'm not sure what that means.

Speaker 3:          01:07:34       Well, it's actually very good news. Okay. Okay. Means that, uh, the oversight of this is being removed from the diversity and equity office and put under the president's direct control. So she doesn't think that they're responsible. I'm, and I'm very worried about diversity and equity office over

Speaker 6:          01:07:54       this suggests that the president should be, it suggests the president is also worried about the diversity and equity office that she has said we're not a bit, but the fact that she has done this is really a strong sign that, that she is aware that that office needs to be needs to be right or at least that she's concerned enough the reputation

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       of the university so that she's not going to let the same mistake happen again, which is a good thing. Like I don't care why she's doing it particularly, but it's a good thing that it is being done. Okay. So fine. So that's, that's a, that's good news that this has the added benefit of improved accountability as that office reports through to me as president. Yeah. Okay. Well you can see in those lines that she's not particularly happy about what's happened. I wonder what sort of financial hit Wilfrid laurier took because you could imagine that while the donors are going to be a lot more conservative than the, than the professors and the administrators and the students.

Speaker 2:          01:08:49       Well, we have a, we've been contacted by a group of alumni who have now organized. They haven't yet released what would be their, their press release, but slowly they've been reaching out to other alumni and it's the lorry, a alumni for free expression. And what they have said is their mandate is one to withhold all donations until laurie a excepts the Loria statement for freedom of expression. And uh, I, I haven't checked in. It was just someone acting on her own. Uh, she's a Lauria alumni. She has I guess, contacts within the alumni association and she just, she sent us some contact information and said, here's what I'm doing, wanted you to know I support your efforts and I'm, I'm working on this. I'll let you know when I'm ready to go. And so that was really encouraging. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:09:37       I have a colleague who does a survey of chief financial officers quarterly to gauge their optimism about the economy and started down at Duke and he's starting it now for Canada and he got responses from to a he because he sent out an email to shortly after this broke, he got responses from two alumni who just said, you're, you know, why should I participate in this? Why should I help you? This is not so I don't have any respect for you. These are alumni of, of, of Wilfrid laurier university as well, and I can imagine too that enrollment is going to take a pretty vicious hit. You know, our business school is quite excellent. We have a great car program. We in the finance area, tech, a lot of very strong students and we compete for top tier students in Ontario of the entry average is like 89 or something and, and, and we really could be for the, what we call the high flyers and they can choose any school right in the province, right?

Speaker 1:          01:10:26       Yeah. Well, it doesn't take much of a hit to a reputation to give people who have options, the reason to go elsewhere, right. And then you lose the best people and that's when things really started

Speaker 2:          01:10:35       the fall apart and what you might begin to see. And I would say that this is something that uh, the general public might look at, watch what happens to the entrance averages in the arts and humanities that so, so, so we might not take a hit, but let's see if the average is take a hit because suddenly and currently the entrance average to get into our general arts program in communications. Let's just talk. Communications is mid seventies with an average of 60 in English. So. So I, I don't, I mean, right, basically

Speaker 1:          01:11:09       a failing grade because I'm just few handy in the NASA. In high school

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       you'll get 60 you really well, right? So it's, it's basically the grading basically runs from 60, it goes zero. You didn't hand it in 60 to 100. You handed it in. And let's keep in mind that the tutorial that Lindsay was running was a grammar tutorial. The content of which looked a lot like grade six curriculum. Yeah. Yeah. Well that gets us into a discussion of the schools in general, but we're all ready. I'm, I'm thinking that maybe it's not a good idea to lower standards any anymore. Right, right, right. Okay. Okay. So academic freedom and freedom of expression for those who have chosen to use this incident as an indictment of Wilfrid laurier university or the plight of Canadian universities in general, I say your assertion is unreasonable and unfounded. Well, we better stop this interview. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you, you can say that all you want.

Speaker 6:          01:12:04       I. Well, I would say instead that what happened at Wilfrid laurier is a precise manifestation of exactly the sort of rot that both produced bill [inaudible] and that I was warning about last September. And so I don't think the assertion is unreasonable in an unfounded at all. And here's one piece of data. Eighty percent of humanities papers are not sighted once, so, so. So let's just translate that for the viewing public. Yes. That means that they're producing scholarship that nobody looks at that, that even their friends don't look at. And because, okay, so what a citation is, is I read someone's paper and I find a good idea in it, and then I use that idea to buttress and idea of my own or to, or to, or to riff off or to, or to, or to criticize even for that matter. And then I cite them, I say who they were and when they published it.

Speaker 6:          01:12:54       And then the paper, the size that there's a huge bureaucracy that keeps track of citations and it's a major indication of academic ability to be cited, right? It's, it's, it's the, it's like it's academic payment to be cited. Okay. So 80 percent of humanities papers don't get cited once. It's absolute failures, absolute failure as a game. If someone wanted to play a game, uh, I would suggest that they go and they look at the publications of the professors in a particular area and see if the titles all sound the same. And if they all say something about intersectionality, a colonialism and, and these other various, uh, social justice words, you might wonder, am I going to get taught the same course again? And again, by every professor in this program, because it seems to me that all of their research is, is very similar. Uh, and, and how can that be when there's such a broad base of knowledge and the world that we can have such similarity between every publication, which then goes on. Why? Why do I need to read my colleague stuff when it's exactly like my own, which, which we see. So just just as a baseline Jordan, how many, like what, what would you say

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       is, is someone who is doing some good research? What's, how many citations would, would they be receiving? Maybe collectively, like what, what are we looking? Thousands. Thousands? Yeah. Well a good. Like if you, if you write a good paper then like a great paypal, paypal will get you 100 citations, right? An outstanding overwhelmingly outstanding pay. I'll get you a thousand citations. Um, 10 isn't none. You know, if you register with 10, but zero is that failure. It means your work had zero impact it, it means your work wasn't worth the paper. It was published on this. This brings us to a kind of interesting little issue with regards to the rot in the universities, which, which Deborah mccloud she says does not exist. It's like, here's how the game works is that we set up a little ideological garden, right? The 10 of us play in, and then we all publish in the same journal and we peer review each other's articles and we just published them.

Speaker 1:          01:15:11       There's no critique or very little. So the, the barrier for publication is very, very low when it should be very high, like a good journal, a good journal will reject. Ninety percent of the papers that are, uh, that are, are, are, are, are submitted to it, right? So rejection rates really matter. So the question is why do the papers get published since no one reads them and they have nothing to offer. And the answer to that is very straightforward. The journals are extremely expensive, are way more expensive than they should be. So just to buy a single paper online for the ordinary person is like $40, which is more than a hardcover book. That's just a download, the PDF. And so the journal itself, the libraries are full of them, are very expensive and the subscriptions are very expensive and so what happens is the professors pressure the university libraries to by the journals and the library funds the publisher and so the publishers will publish anything.

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       Routledge is a good example of that, much to my chagrin because they published my first book but and they used to be a great publishing house, but they'll publish damn near anything and the reason for that is that the libraries are forced to pay radically inflated prices for the publications that no one ever reads. And so people right to publish in journals that libraries have to purchase at inflated prices to produce knowledge that no one will ever read. And that's the little scandal that plagues the humanities. I think it characterizes the humanities more than plagues them. So the idea that there's no systemic rot, let's say in the universities, especially in the humanities, is just not right.

Speaker 3:          01:16:47       This is just far too general. There. There is rot and it's not everywhere and this just reveals that. I don't think she's that familiar with the situation. She's in and, and I've been listening to some of your work and Jonathan Haidt trying to understand what's been going on over the last two years in universities protected as I am in a business school and starting to realize that it's not everywhere.

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       It's social justice perspective. Fields are fine so far. Yeah, and the business schools, although there are moves into the business schools, but they're still doing all right. Philosophy is not doing too badly. Like there are disciplines that have still remained untouched and mostly what's happened so far is that if the discipline has a strong economic or scientific footing, it's proved much harder to corrupt and empirical for my part. So I play in the playground of sociology of religion, but all my stuff, well most of my stuff is quantitative so I actually, I wasn't familiar with what was going on. I don't. I go to conferences where everybody has to have strong empirical evidence. I publish in journals that are international journals that are the scientific study of religion is what we do. So, you know, I'm familiar with food co and that stuff, but that's not where I play, so I wasn't really exposed to what's going on and you don't and you don't really think.

Speaker 6:          01:18:06       Well they kept no reason to be that concerned about it. Well this is it, but then I'm trying to get into the headspace of some of my colleagues. So I got out of text book, it was called race class and gender and it's, it's an anthology that's used in cultural studies courses in women's studies courses and it sorta the Goto text. So I'm told and I'm reading it and I turned it and I turn to page 14 and I can tell you it's page 14 because I was so astounded by what I found and it said, uh, we the, Oh, it says objectivity as found through rational thought is a western and masculine concept that we will challenge throughout this text. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. And I said it's too bad. It's too bad that you're shocked by that because the want to go for irrational pc types have been saying exactly that since the 19 seventies.

Speaker 6:          01:19:00       Like that is exactly. Make no mistake about it. This is why mcclachi is wrong. This isn't, this isn't something they're secreting in. This is the dead statement. Oh yeah. They said, um, the, the whole notion of logic and coherence and empirical data for that matter. The evidence. Let's question, let's question the definition of evidence because the underlying idea. Remember the underlying idea here is that all hierarchies are predicated on power. So if the reason that I put forward something as evidence isn't because it's evidence, it's because it's evidenced that I get to have that position of power. And so if you're a postmodernist and you say, well, I'm going to question your evidence, what you think you're saying is you're going to question my claim to that arbitrary power. The whole idea that there's evidence outside of claims of arbitrary power. The postmodernist dispensed without the 19 seventies.

Speaker 6:          01:19:52       That's Derrida. That's exactly what he said in all this time. I've been trying to get samples of thousands so that I could say, you know, this is a little bit. We can say something, God just in generalized. No, no. That just demonstrates how thoroughly entrenched you are in the reining patriarchal ideology, I guess, and I was just hoping to get beyond anecdotal. There's no beyond that. There's no beyond anecdotal. That's become a methodology. That's odd. It's called auto ethnography is a technical term for it and auto ethnography is the publication of a journey of a, of a private diary essentially in a hypothetically reputable, reputable academic journal. It's only because of in the last three or four years that these things have been happening and I said, well, where? Where do they get this? How do they, how do they find these thoughts? Yes. Well, we don't.

Speaker 6:          01:20:47       We don't want to fall into the mistake of making, of making the assumption that this hasn't been thought through. People are just misunderstanding what evidence is. That isn't what's happening at all. When they say they want to question the definition of evidence, that's exactly what they mean when they say, we want a question, the definition of evidence because the definition of evidence currently supports the scientific power structure in chemistry say, and that's fundamentally dominated by, let's say, white men. We can go after the definition of evidence itself and that's how we're going to bring it down, and so the next on the hit list are going to be the biologists that are already under attack from the paper. It said that mathematics is whiteness. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely. I didn't know that mathematics could have a race. Yep. Thinking the thing is there's nothing logical about these claims.

Speaker 6:          01:21:36       Once you accept this central axioms, the axioms are straightforward. The world is a battleground of power hierarchies. That's what it is. There isn't anything else outside of that, and each power hierarchy generates its own internal narrative including rules for what constitutes evidence that support and buttress the structure of that hierarchy and because the hierarchy's exclude, then it's in the best interests of the people who are excluded to invert the hierarchy and of course they also regard that as just even though that's part of the incoherence of the entire argument, that's where they have to turn to to Marxism, but make no mistake about it. This isn't. This isn't accidental. It isn't. People misunderstanding what constitutes evidence. Not at all.

Speaker 3:          01:22:22       No. I've been listening to some of your lectures on this for the last year and thinking you sound a little deranged.

Speaker 6:          01:22:30       Well, I, I might be a little deranged deranged about this.

Speaker 3:          01:22:34       And then this whole episode with Lindsay Shepherd just proves that in every dimension of this is about power. Uh, the double speak, the, the changing of terminology from the expulsion. People's ideas could be violent. The circling, the sacred, circling around the victim group. Well, look

Speaker 6:          01:22:53       what happened at Wilfrid laurier. One of the things that were so bloody interesting that I thought was just fascinating was the unbelievably strategic attempt to transform shepherd into perpetrator and

Speaker 4:          01:23:05       Rambo Kana and pim law into the victims, especially Rocana as a professor of color. Right? So, so what happens, the reverse narrative was, well, Lindsay shepherd was using something like her white privilege and their white tiers to, to harass a poor professor of color. Untenured professor of color. Yeah. Yeah. And that there was every attempt made on the part of the people who are going after shepherd to make that the narrative.

Speaker 2:          01:23:34       So

Speaker 3:          01:23:35       in the they started accusing everyone of being trans phobic just right out of the blocks. Within days of this, we were all tired without epithet.

Speaker 2:          01:23:44       Immediately labels have been just flying and without any regard to the intent of the person or even the content.

Speaker 4:          01:23:50       Here's something interesting about the transphobia issue too, so I've had at least now a number of discussions with trans people by the way, but also a number of letters from trans people over the last year, about 40 of them as a matter of fact, which is a lot of letters because there aren't that many trans people and every single one of them I think I got one letter from a trans person who wasn't happy with what I was doing, but every single one of the other letters said the same thing. We are sick and tired of being the poster child for these activists who claim to speak in our name because that's another thing that we should be very aware of is just because an activist comes out and says, I'm a member of this minority group and therefore I speak for them. It's like the first time it might be true, but the second claim is not only just unjustifiable, it's actually, I would say it's, it's not racist exactly, but it's groups just because it's predicated on the assumption that just because you happen to be the member of a class, that you're a representative member of that class, that class is so homogenous that everyone in it is the same enough so that all the members within it can speak for all the other members used to call that racism when it was, it applied to racial category.

Speaker 2:          01:24:58       Absolutely. But Lindsay has been very good to point out and so if some of the media that there have been a transgendered students at Laurie who have spoken out in support of Lindsay and we have to keep this in mind that this is not a transgendered issue. No, and neither was my comments on bill because I mean, all I know that Lindsey, as she even said, she is not transphobic. She supports the rights of transgendered people. This is, she's unequivocal in that. Uh, and, and I think that that's just cover story her for her. True, right beliefs, and there are transgendered students who have come to her support and at great personal cost to themselves. Like those are some brave people. They're right there to break with that group that the hostility in that group is real in the activist end of the group. You Bet. You Bet. Yeah. We're

Speaker 3:          01:25:54       so quick to take over this issue as their own and claim that the, the debate itself was and

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       that it was just cover for this transphobic climate that existed and it has nothing to do with transgender people. It's funny too. You saw the same thing with um, Rinaldo Walcott when he was on the director of the women's in diversity women's and gender studies at, at the, at, at, at the University of Toronto. He claimed that he claimed like four times in that interview that the University of Toronto was a white supremacist organization. And I thought I just don't know what to make of that. Like I traveled down to my office about a week after that, that, that interview and I happened by some students who were standing outside waiting to write an exam. So there's about 100 of them may, and like this is particularly true at the University of Toronto. I would say that

Speaker 6:          01:26:51       you couldn't look at that group of students for more than two seconds and think that that was a white supremacist organization. I mean it's so ethnically diverse. If you think that the University of Toronto is a white supremacist organization, then what that essentially means is that the most tolerant institution in the most tolerant city in the most tolerant province in the most tolerant country in the world is white supremacist. So it's like, well then I don't. I don't, I don't even know what you could. Especially when you say that, as someone who's a full professor, I don't know if he's a full professor who's a professor at that institute. It's like, where's your evidence for this? That same professor was using racial slurs against Lindsay. Oh yes. The white tiers thing. They're also misogynistic, right? Because it's white girl tears. I could never ever

Speaker 6:          01:27:54       do something like that to any student of any race. I just don't understand how the people on the far left can rationalize that kind of behavior. It, it just, it's so they can rationalize it with power, but in terms of civility, just incivility in recognizing the humanity in every person. How can you resort to those kinds of racial slights? I just, I don't. I don't understand how you can say don't be racist and then you make racial comments terribly racist comments. I just, I don't under do people. Well, no, there's the idea there is straightforward. You cannot on her racist comments against the dominant group. That's the rule. If there's a dominant group, so once you identify them as oppressor, you can say anything you want about them because by definition this is axiomatic in the ideology. You can't say anything racist about the oppressors, that that's like a rule. It's a rule of discourse. So here's where I go with this. For self interest, do you not realize when you say, I don't care about your efin white fragility? No, that not well cut.

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       Is that as I get his name right? Walcott, Walcott, he didn't say, but others other pundits have said that in it's appeared on Lindsay Lindsay's twitter page where they've assaulted her there or that's too dramatic where they've made insulted her. They're insulted her there. Uh, but my, my point would be, even in your self interest, do you not realize that you are giving ammunition to the real white supremacists? Do you not realize that there are really dangerous people on the right who are looking for that exact kind of comment to rationalize their behavior?

Speaker 4:          01:29:37       Well, if you're trying to burn something down, what makes you think you're going to be so careful about how it burns down? And I really mean that. Look, I mean I've, I've, I've had, have interactions with the right wing racial supremacists online. They're not very happy with me and it's because I called them out for the same sort of behavior that the leftists manifest, which is like, I don't, I'm not impressed by your manifestation of group identity, Uber All let's say. But I understand that the radical right wingers are playing the same game as the radical left winger. So you might say, well why would the radical left wingers play into their hands? I would say, well, if you're trying to, if you're trying to burn the whole damn house down, then why not inflame the people who are most likely to do it? And you might think, well no, that, that's not in anybody's best interest. It's like it's the stated aim of this ideology, right? They want to invert the pie. They want to invert the Patriarchy essentially. Well, what's the patriarchy while it's the White Supremacist University of Toronto. So who cares if you're handing your opponents weapons,

Speaker 2:          01:30:39       you're hoping that it will escalate that the people on the left as well as the people on the right. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:30:46       So its power because uh, this is the same thing has happened at evergreen state and the whole justification there was racism. I know when they went in after Bret Weinstein, who is about is, I mean Brent is, he's a Bernie. He's a Bernie supporter, right, exactly. They eat their own. Last week from Mike Paris, who is the only colleague of his that publicly defended him and he emails me and he says, I've been following the story closely and I just want to reach out and just, you know, commiserate with you and wonder is there anything we can do or talk about it together? And I thought, no, you're from evergreen state, you know, that's a nightmare and we're not that bad, but it's the same pattern repeated. It's not about transgender people and their rights and, and just the victim. They didn't know the term transgender people. As far as I'm concerned, we're, we're like sacrificial animals on the altar of bill. See 16, the activists have a new group that's oppressed to wave the flag for, to push forward their radiology. And, and as NSA said, the consistent message I've got from transsexual people is I wish they just shut the hell up and quit putting us out in, in, in the public

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       eye in that guys, because all they're doing is making our life more difficult. It's like, well, it doesn't matter. We're trying to tear down the patriarchy. Who cares if your life is being made more difficult? It's like you. You don't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. We want to keep that in mind. Okay. Laurie prepares our students and instructors for difficult discussions. Yeah, probably not. We support our teachers in navigating complex and divisive issues with care and confidence. That's a more credible statement. I mean, especially given the outcome of this is just want to take you back to the lessons of the previous paragraph. Lauria has commitment to academic freedom or freedom of expression. Well, that's unequivocal perfect. Yes. Except that they won't adopt the, the Chicago principles. So for example, something else to keep in mind that the. I think this is the first time anybody's talked about this when we were established in 1973.

Speaker 6:          01:32:55       The Wilfred Laurier Act says specifically that this university will be dedicated to research and teaching in the spirit of free inquiry and free expression. That is the establishing act of our universe charter statement and, and, and that is what it says is our mission. So in fact, we are breaking the law by not standing behind maximum free expression. And Max free inquire because it is right in our very founding principle, our very founding charter in the fact that we are so hesitant to to just embrace that and say, we know that it's within this contest of ideas that the best facts come forward and knowledges advanced. Why are we afraid of that? Why are we afraid? What's made made every university a great university because we're doubtful about the integrity of the institution like this. This critique that whose claim is that our institutions are patriarchal. Institutions are fundamentally corrupt and oppressive is sufficiently.

Speaker 6:          01:34:06       What would you say makes people sufficiently guilty so they're perfectly willing to circumvent their adherence to policies, to charter policies like that. I just think that at some point you have to say, this is why you were created. Maybe we should get back to this and maybe. I mean maybe there's a someone who is in the provincial parliament who's going to say, I'm kind of upset that you've actually rejected the very founding charter. I would hear, well, there's no one in the current in the current legislature that would do that. Certainly not in the current government. Not by any, not it, no, no chance at all. Okay. Um, we support our teachers in navigating complex and divisive issues with care and confidence. We are leaders in ensuring our students, faculty, and staff have the necessary supports and tools to help those who've experienced marginalization and discrimination to engage fully.

Speaker 6:          01:34:59       Okay. So now you see the reversal, right? Right away. Here is, and this happens every time now that a modern university, virtually every time that a modern university comes out with a statement in favor of free speech, the next thing they do is, is bringing this competing set of claims like the, uh, to help those who have experienced marginalization and discrimination to engage fully. As soon as the word marginalization is in there, then you know that that postmodern ethos has, has, has, has, has, has manifested itself within the, within the confines of the document property. Grounded academic debate at laureate occurs everyday and encourages critical thinking and civil discourse. Yeah, ideas that one finds objectionable should be challenged and debated. The common good of society depends on the search for knowledge and it's free expression. Hey, fair enough. Free expression and academic university academic freedom at the university require accompanying responsibilities and accountabilities to be met by members of the university community.

Speaker 6:          01:36:00       The other shoe drops. Well, even that statement, it's not so bad. I mean, okay. Faculty members have responsibilities and they should be accountable. I think. I think that university should be a civil place. I think that it should be civil, right? I think that there should be tolerance, but tolerance is very different from an embrace and a complete embrace of what diversity is now defined as. Or equity is defined. Tolerance means I disagree, but I'm going to let you speak anyway. And that really is the goal of the university. Uh, so anyway. Yeah. Okay. We, we, we will continue to ensure that we are protected against protecting, against and dealing with hate and intolerance. These have those have no place in civil society. See that I'm not so sure about that. Hate and intolerance have no place in civil society. The problem with that is hate, hate and intolerance is not defined here.

Speaker 6:          01:36:52       That is the problem and the I keep hearing hate speech is not free speech. And then when I asked, well, what do you mean by hate speech? Yes, that is the problem. Well, the other thing too is I'm actually allowed to hate you. It's okay. You might've done something that makes me hate you but that. But there are limits on what I can do as a consequence of that hate. And that is not. So there's two problems. The first problem is this is a big one who defines hate. That's a major problem. And the second is, well, you don't limit hate. You can't limit hate anymore than you can limit anger or aggression, but you can limit the manner in which people conduct themselves when they're motivated by those emotions. And let's be clear, there is really a clear definition of hate when you look at the criminal code under sections three, 18, and 3:19, it says you cannot advocate physical violence against an identifiable group.

Speaker 6:          01:37:46       I am totally on board with that. Like let's, let's be clear. You can't say go and hurt these people. I got that. But that's really clear. Where's that? Definitely. I just want to see all the issue. There is something we discussed earlier is while then we can gerrymander the definition of hurt, right? Well, I'm talking physical advocating, physical violence, right? Physical after that, physical in there because the criminal code also does. I think it does it in such a way to say we can harm what is harm. Again, harm is longterm infliction of damage that compromises your ability to function or your appearance. It's a pragmatic definition is grounded in common law. So we actually have a history of defining it so that safe and let's not move away from these definitions because they're the thing that allow us to have conversations that are uncomfortable but needed.

Speaker 6:          01:38:42       Okay, good. They, uh, these have no place in civil society, let alone on a university campus. They will not be tolerated at Lori. Yes. Well, we see you. We saw an example of that not being tolerated with the Lindsay Shepherd case. I remain concerned by the way faculty, staff, and students involved in aspects of this situation were targeted with such vitriol. Now now things are starting to get out of hand. I remain concerned by the way faculty, staff, and students involved in aspects of this situation were targeted with what, with such vitriol, vitriol. That's acid day. So, um, is she, you think she's talking about the tweets that Lindsay has received them, is that faculty, staff and students. So not just Lindsey, but I just wonder is this, does this apply to those who have been advocating free speech? And I, I'm, I'm just, I'm pointing it out there.

Speaker 6:          01:39:34       I mean all of us who have come out in favor of maximum free speech have been subjected to a lot of vitriol, both emails and it's always anonymous emails. It's always from people who will not say who they are. So, but my point would be I, unless there was something that simply said, I am threatening your life. I just, I deleted. That's what I do because this is what happens. I mean, I wish people were civil but they're not. There's no discussing heart issues without conflict. Like that's just not happening. The question is how you live with the conflict and you can't limit it to none because then people can't have a conflict. They can solve a problem, so what you do is you. You Limited well as we've limited quite successfully in our country to date, right? We use the definitions of violence that have prevailed throughout the establishment of English common law and that works just fine. My concern about that paragraph is that she's cowtowing, let's say, to concerns about the way that the people who actually, let's say perpetrated this event were dealt with by members of the general public, so member members of the university community must be supported to work and study in an environment free of discrimination and harassment. That's a tougher and they have

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       my commitment. We will continue to make this a university priority.

Speaker 4:          01:40:58       Yeah, that's a sentence that worries me in an environment free of discrimination and harassment and they have my. The problem is it's so difficult to distinguish that between real dispute. You know? I mean if you're. If you're committed to a line of argumentation, you stake your whole, your whole life on it, say your, your whole academic career and you're engaged in a dispute with someone else who holds a contrary view point. There's going to be heat and sparks generated by that exchange. There has to be because otherwise you're not talking about anything of any importance.

Speaker 2:          01:41:28       Yeah. If we all agree, we don't need free speech. I mean, that's standard. That's the thing, right? But when I read this line, uh, members of the university community must be supported to work and study in an environment free of discrimination and harassment and, and I just wonder how equally that idea has been applied at my university so far because certainly we know that our president has sent out letters of support to the Lgbtq community, which she was right to do. If they are feeling harassed, I have no problem with that. But at the same time, there are official bodies at our university, the women's center and other bodies that are under the auspices of the diversity and Equity Office, uh, if I'm correct that are petitioning to have a, there's a pro life group on campus and they are petitioning to have them defunded and shut down.

Speaker 4:          01:42:25       Right. So, so did Debra mccloud, she sent out a letter to all the people who are supporting the shepherd to say, well, we're really sorry about older

Speaker 2:          01:42:33       your responses. My point, our president is aware that there's a group on campus that are marginalized. These are the prolife students, and I don't care what your position is, pro life or pro choice, whatever your position is, you bloody will have to admit that there's at least a debate. There is a debate, but, and the point I would make is here truly is a marginalized group of students who have received no support from our university. None. And I know my president is aware because early on in this controversy I said, and another matter is that these students are being attacked or I'm sorry, I don't want to use hyperbolic language. These students are being harassed and they are being harassed because they were being threatened with having their funding removed by official bodies of the university.

Speaker 4:          01:43:23       Yeah, well there's the prolife students are real canaries in the coal mine as far as I'm concerned, regardless of what you think about,

Speaker 2:          01:43:29       do anything represent diversity, ideological diversity. But we're not seeing any reception of these diverse students. Do they? Are they being included in this diversity and inclusion? No, they're being excluded purposely by actual offices of my university. So I'm saying, yeah, that's standard practice. I would say on campuses

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       across the country, it's just uneven, it's uneven, and I think that what what we need to see a is just a policy that applies to all students and not just those who smell right or are orthodox to the social justice or who were in the. What would you call it? Acceptable class of victims. Okay. It bears repeating in the current context that Laurie is support for our lesbian, gay, Bi, trans, queer, and two spirited campus community and transgender people in particular is unwavering. It isn't the obvious that it bears repeating in the current context because the issue here fundamentally is that Lindsay Shepherd was was subject to an administrative inquisition despite the fact that she was 100 percent innocent by the university's own standards, and so it doesn't bear repeating in the current context that is support for our lbgt to Lgbtq campus community and pr and transgender people. In particular is unwavering. It actually isn't about them. It's not about them at all. It's about the fact that she got pilloried for doing something that she was actually right to do. So I'm not happy with the fact that this paragraph was inserted into here. I think it's an indication of exactly the kind of administrative weakness that allowed this sort of event to occur to begin with. Now,

Speaker 7:          01:45:13       this is the theme though, right, of the Justice Warriors, is that this is the victim group they've repeated over and over that there's been violence, harassment, vitriol. Everybody's picking up on that. The union president said that it was daily occurrence. The president's repeated. She's issued a campus wide email and response to the open letter saying, uh, we're going to make this a safe campus. She's repeating it here. So the validation, yes,

Speaker 6:          01:45:36       their narrative of victimization emerging from the Lindsay Shepherd event. Without evidence, we, we, we actually send an email to our faculty, uh, the Union president and we said, we're concerned about this daily violence on campus. Could you please supply us with evidence of this? And she wrote back and she said, uh, what did she say something

Speaker 7:          01:46:02       as I'm telling everyone in the press, no.

Speaker 6:          01:46:05       Yeah, because it would inflate, didn't she say because it would inflame the situation even further with something like that. So how, how in the world providing evidence that something like that with members of the union, we are paying our fees just like everyone else. And we just, we wanted substantiate some substantiation to these claims that there was violence as a daily.

Speaker 7:          01:46:30       Well, the whole premise is that there's injury happening and that's why we can't speak about these things. So if they can establish the violence, then maybe we're sympathetic to the argument that the space shouldn't occur. But. But that's susceptible to bogus claims. If there's no substantiation, you can't build policy that way.

Speaker 6:          01:46:48       Yeah. Not without

Speaker 4:          01:46:49       getting into the kind of trouble that's already emerged in light of recent events. We have added measures to improve campus safety while it is by. No. See that, that, that actually seems to me to be the one sentence in this article so far. That's actually a mistake because by going forward with what practices are that are going to improve campus safety, then the president is validating the claims of the people who claim that this occurrence produced an unsafe environment on the campus. It's like, so I, I, I think that that was weak. We will ensure that all students, staff and faculty know exactly what our commitment to academic freedom and freedom of expression means in the classroom. That would be good. To that end, we have established the task force on freedom of expression to take input from our community, which we should point out, which won't include Lindsay Shepherd. Right? Because she asked to be part of that taskforce. In fact, I believe that they offered it to her. I'm not exactly sure.

Speaker 2:          01:47:55       Some, some Grad students nominated her and it was prior to the revelation being made that it would be the position would be filled by the president of the graduate students association who, and I think this was poor form, uh, just before that announcement was made, the president of the Graduate Students Association put out a statement where I, I'm not sure if it's a he or she or a, I'm not sure of the, the uh, gender pronoun use, but um, that they were standing 100 percent behind the Trans and Lgbtq.

Speaker 4:          01:48:29       Yeah. And the. And that, the fact that they were going to sit on the, on the taskforce would indicate that all students would be represented properly,

Speaker 2:          01:48:37       but it's just the. They showed this incredible bias. And, and then they said, and we're going to be sitting on this. I just don't, I don't know that that does a service to all the Grad students who they represent.

Speaker 4:          01:48:50       Alright, look at best practices beyond Lori pay. They could look at Chicago, that'd be good and develop a clear tangible and you never know. Maybe they will. You never know. And develop a clear, tangible set of practical, implementable guidelines that will bring clarity to this issue for our own classrooms and we'll have the potential to serve as best practices for others. Well that's exactly what you guys are recommending. That is my commitment to you. Well, and it's not like the University of Chicago is a lightweight

Speaker 2:          01:49:18       and it's not just the University of Chicago over 30 universities. Many of them Ivy League have adopted the Chicago statements to great effect. Right? Right. And so, so this is. This is something that has worked that is working. It's clearly something that should happen in Canada. It would be a wonderful thing. It would be a wonderful thing to do. Would be. It would be so wonderful. So it's not like we're trying to institute this policy that hasn't worked and that hasn't been been accepted by really prominent universities in the US and it doesn't, it doesn't

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       involve us a law or legal ease. It is simply a statement of philosophy about what we want and which is maximum free expression and free inquiry within the bounds of the law.

Speaker 7:          01:49:59       And I just think this task force is going to be a disaster because, uh, the justice, uh, advocates aren't interested in free speech, uh, they, they want to forbid certain forms of speech and it's just a question of which topics and who's going to come

Speaker 6:          01:50:14       troll the lender might be enough public screwed. Like I don't think interest in Wilfrid laurier. I'm sure that the president would be real happy if this went away, but I think the probability that it's going to go away is very low because I think Wilford Laurey is now being watched and being watched by very many people to see what the genuine outcome of this will be. And I think that even if it was ignored by the mainstream media, which it might be, it's not going to be ignored by people on Youtube and the people who've been who've been generating content associated with Lindsay shepherd and the, the magnitude of that content online is absolutely overwhelming. I don't know if the Wilfred laureate administrators. No, because you know people older than 40, you usually don't know much about online media, but the amount of commentary this has been generating, this is generated on youtube is absolutely beyond belief like it was a major scandal.

Speaker 6:          01:51:03       Back to the task force though, and we'll you've said this in the past, the freedom of expression proponents, we already are the compromise position because we are saying we want you to be able to articulate whatever position you have. We want you to be able to like we are the compromise position. We're not saying we want to shut down anybody. Whatever your position is, let's hear it. That's that. That is where we are. So we're already in that compromise position in the boundaries of the law, within the boundaries of the law in respect to the university in its operations. Of course. So, so we're already saying we want all these sides to be able to be hurt. I don't understand. It's already approved diversity of opinion. It is. It is. And so what I have to look at is many of the colleagues that I have who are on the left and are hoping for restriction of free expression are really, to a certain extent, linguistic imperialists.

Speaker 6:          01:52:00       That's exactly why I objected to bill [inaudible]. I said that I wasn't going to let the linguistic imperialists take control over my voice. The fact that it happened to be about transgender pronouns with. Well that was just how that problem manifested itself at that period of time. But that, that what have you called them? Linguistic imperialist. That's exactly right. And, and these, the, these idiot ideologues on the radical left who were so good at neologisms are unbelievably good at grasping the linguistic territory. I mean the, the propagation of words like cis gendered is a perfect example of that. So it. Yeah, it's just, I don't understand how they can be so against colonialism and imperialism and then want to do that in, in the sphere of language, in

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       an authoritarian structure which can only be abused. Well, that's, that's part of the weird. See there's this weird marriage between postmodernism in Marxism. Right? Which makes no sense because you actually can't be a postmodernist and I guess you can be a critical thinker and a Marxist, but you cannot be a postmodernist data Marxist at the same time because the postmodernists hypothetically are critical of grand narratives, right? They don't believe that they, that they have in a universal validity. Of course, the problem with that is that without a grand narrative you can't act, but they sneak the Marxism in through the back door and then the justification I think is for these authentic authoritarian impositions is that, well, it doesn't matter as long as the right people are being hurt by them and the right people would be the people who are in positions of power now who, who have no justification for being in those positions of power. Right? Because they don't stable solution. If you're making the assumption that what's being sought after is a stable solution, and I think that's. I think that's a dangerous assumption because I think that the university activists mean exactly what they say when they say that we should be flipping over the patriarch.

Speaker 7:          01:53:56       They've put no counterproposal forward throughout this. Right? It's like they don't have a solution, a, they're not even talking about a list of forbidden topics and who's going to be adjudicated and what the appeals process, so that's always. That's always done post hoc.

Speaker 4:          01:54:13       Yeah. That way you can keep the level of fear that you can keep adding to the list as well. Definitely that will because it's way better. It's way better if you. It's way better if you want to exercise power over people to never let them be sure which policies they're violating and I think that what happened to Lindsay Shepherd is an excellent example of that, so it's a. it's a canonical example of that. If it's the Orwellian idea of freedom is the ability to say two plus two equals four and they want to keep avoiding the ability to say two plus two is four by creating new answers and moving on and he just went through this whole process with a statement unfree expression and it goes on for paragraphs and paragraphs and then the last, nearly the last sentence is freedom of expression does not trump all other rights in the university community. Freedom of expression. Can only thrive constructively when accompanied by other rights, including the equality rights of equity, diversity, and inclusion. There you go. That's right. And so now you no longer have free expression and that's the snake in the garden right there. Eating that. Yeah. So there's, there's this, but how. I mean those, those are so complicated. There's individual rights and group.

Speaker 7:          01:55:21       There's positive rights and negative rights and they're all in this salad with no guidance as to how you're going to trade them off against each other. It's, it's like you say it just ad hoc as we go forward. We'll.

Speaker 4:          01:55:33       Yeah. Was so funny to produce an entire document talking about freedom of expression and then put a sentence like that in is a Coda psyllid if. And by the way also this, it's like, wait a second, it's also this,

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       it's that little admixture of poison. It destroys the integrity of the entire argument and, and, and to, and to put all those words in their diversity. Okay. What the hell do you mean by that? Exactly. Inclusivity or. That's a word that really that's when I really have trouble with because it's very difficult to understand even what that means and equity equity is equality of outcome and so that's an impossible goal to begin with because it multiplies in difficulty as you add number of measurement dimensions. Right? So. And that's the intersectionality problem, so to speak. So. All right, well, well with the task force, the interesting thing is we'll didn't want to sit on it because having looked at what had happened, I, I suppose it was the experience at UBC that, well I just saw big arguments happening with no, no possibility of a constructive outcome and so.

Speaker 6:          01:56:37       But I was more hopeful and I understand wills position completely, right? Yes. Well it's easy as a faculty member to get pulled into interminable administrative duties that have no positive outcome whatsoever. In fact, it's pretty much par for the course. Well, he makes the, I mean your most compelling argument. Well to one, look what happened at UBC and two were already in a compromised position. You mean what, what more can you want? And I get that, but I, I have let my name stand for nomination. Uh, we'll see this week. I guess, whether or not I'll, I don't know if I'll get voted. Well, one of the things we should find out and publicize is whether any people who have a strong free speech orientation will end up on that task force. I mean that, that's absolutely critical. Important. Well, they'll certainly get their work done quickly if no one running the free speech side is on it because they'll just say, right.

Speaker 6:          01:57:31       But maybe they'll have to create a list of their own about what can't be talked about. Right? Who knows where that will go. Well, and one thing that strikes me though is just the disregard for history, uh, people who are marginalized or would be considered in the marginalized group. If we look at how did they get the rights that they have today, right? How did that happen was because of free expression, right? Actually, the easy case to make for free speech is left wing. It's like powerful. People don't need their free speech protected. They're powerful, they're rich. They can say whatever the hell they want. It's people who are precisely marginalized and oppressed, who need all the protection of the law. Of course they want to weight it against saying, yes, we want to have people without power to have the freedom of expression, but let's make this a quicker process by making sure those that have power can't speak whoever those who have power, it's not just, Oh, you know, you could say, well, wouldn't it be wonderful if those who had unfair power weren't allowed to speak?

Speaker 6:          01:58:32       It's like, well, maybe it wouldn't be wonderful, but who the hell is going to decide who has power and who has unfair power? Like the devil's in the details there. So the only fair application of this principle is to let everybody have equal opportunity, not equal outcome by the way. Well, that's the free market solution, right? Because you can't determine these by central Fiat because it's technically impossible, which is actually something postmodernist should know because that's actually one of the logical consequences of their philosophy. Right? Things are too complicated to decide by Fiat in some sense, but. All right. Is there anything else that you guys want to say that, that, that you've observed as a consequence of this Lindsay shepherd of fair or that or that you're hopeful about or pessimistic about what, what? What's the, how do we solve this? Just the way we're solving it.

Speaker 6:          01:59:21       This is the way to solve it is to, is to have W. I think this is a textbook case of the utility of free speech. Shepherd was able to make her case publicly. There's been a huge debate about it. There's been some moves made on the part of the university that looked positive. We've got ample opportunity. Everyone has ample opportunity to have their voice heard. You know, this video we're making tonight, I'll probably be watched by 150,000 people, so like, and we had a perfectly reasonable discussion, you know, I think we gave credit where credit was due with regards to this document and, and are jointly hopeful that something positive will come of it and made some pointed critiques about, about what it does contain and what it doesn't, but we don't want to underestimate the utility of doing these things. It's useful and I think the fact that you guys have this little cabal of people at Wilfrid laurier who are willing to speak, I was shocked when when you wrote that op ad and when the Toronto Star published it, I mean nothing like that from an academic happened in relationship to me last year and Bill [inaudible], we've seen such uniformity of outcry about this from all the newspapers, glove star son, which, which really just shows you the disconnect between what is happening in the academy and what is happening.

Speaker 6:          02:00:35       It's a disconnect of staggering magnitude. People outside the academy say, well, how can you believe that they have what they've been saying is really this happened, this actually happened. That's the universal response and and you know the response on the campuses as well. Yeah. It happened and we were right. I have a solution. I have a solution. I mean it's not a solution, but it's A. I call it an inoculant actually. So yes. Let's get the statement for freedom of expression at our university and similar statements at all universities. Why the federal government is not tying funding to this. I know that the Conservatives Med suggestion that I made to the conservatives, well this is, this is what needs to happen, but in addition to that, I think that young people and parents of young people need to look at what's happening and they need to start educating their kids at home and they need to start.

Speaker 6:          02:01:28       And I've written several op-eds where I've said people ask me, what is the solution that I say? Start watching the videos of Jordan Peterson. Start watching the videos. Uh, there's Jonathan Heit, Jonathan. Hi. You Bet. Look into the Heterodox Academy. They know what they're doing, who, who definitely are scholars of repute, the, they, they are moderate in the, like incredibly civil. Uh, there are also some people outside of academia. There's a, um, a fantastic utuber. Uh, my name is Josephine. She's a Canadian political science student who is at u of t moderate, really well spoken, articulate in classical liberal ideas. My name is Josephine. Okay. So she's actually been the reason that I know she knows you. She was at one of your rallies. I spotted a video there. She is in the background there. Another young lady as a woman who is her name is roaming millennial. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:02:24       I don't roaming millennial. I'd been on her show. Oh yeah, you bet. You Bet. Yeah, and she's a tough cookie. That girl, you bet. And I would say start watching these. Yeah, well the young people are watching them in droves. You know, she has a big following, roaming millennial, and I'm grateful for that because in fact when these students go into the university classroom, if they choose to go into the arts or the humanities, they're going to go in with knowledge where they can say, I realize it's tough to challenge a professor, but start a facebook group and say, Hey, did you know that there are other ideas to do? You know that there's an opposite side of this debate. Well, we should. Or we could also encourage parents who might be listening or or students thinking about going to university who might be listening to this, is that check to see where the university stands on free speech and if they dampen down their support for free speech and for your inquiry with statements about diversity, inclusivity and equity, then go somewhere else. It's a worry. Another thing, and this is just beginning in Canada, we have a society for academic freedom and scholarship that professors can join if a, if a. sorry if a professor has joined the Society for academic freedom of scholarship, you can be pretty sure they are going to be wanting to give you both sides of the story. So that's not a bad check either for. Do they have to do their research though the students to do diligence while that's good, it'll educate them. Right. I mean Lindsay Shepherd definitely got educated over the last two months.

Speaker 6:          02:03:52       No kidding. No kidding. She's got her phd thesis in communication. Pretty well demonstrated there is an auto ethnography for you. Yeah. I caused an international scandal by just revealing what had actually happened. Yeah. Alright. Alright, good. My pleasure. Thank you guys for coming and also for, it's not common for faculty members. Well to talk to me first of all, like this. Certainly not on record and certainly not common for them to be writing and speaking openly about such issues. So I don't know what the hell got into you guys. It's really good. That's happening at Wilfrid laurier to where were we realize we're finished now by being associated with you. Yeah. Yeah. I, I said, uh, earlier good of you to offer yourself on the sacrificial altar. I, you've got to look your kids in the eye eventually. Yeah. And uh, how are you going to say that you need to stand up for truth if you actually don't stand up for truth. That is a problem. Yeah. Yep. Alright guys. Good. Thanks a lot.
