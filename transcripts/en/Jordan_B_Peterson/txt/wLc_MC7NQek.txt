Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       all right, so I suggested to you last class that human beings world as a place of action through the lens of their social, cognitive, biological, substructure, and I made that argument on the basis of the supposition that our primary environment was actually other people and I mentioned to you, I believe that those other people are arranged in hierarchies of influence and authority or power or dominance, which is often how it's construed and that the dominance hierarchy as a structure is at least 300 million years old, which makes it older than trees and it's for that reason that you share the same neurobiology to govern your observations of your position in the hierarchy as lobsters do, which is a remarkable fact. You know, it's remarkable that the lobster uses Serotonin, has the mechanism to adjudicate it status position, and that modifying the Serotonin function in the lobster can produce changes in its behavior, can, can overhead the lobster overcome defeat, for example.

Speaker 2:          00:01:29       Which is very much equivalent to what happens to a human being when they take antidepressants. You know, it's, it's, it's a good example of the conservation of biological structure by evolution and another, a good illustration of the continuity of life on earth. It's really amazing. But the other thing, it is a testament to his, the ancient nature of the social structure. Now we tend to think of the social structure as something other than nature, right? Because society is, I suppose mythologically opposed opposed in a narrative way culture as opposed to nature. It's the town in the forest, but the town has been around a long time, so to speak. And the structure of the town is also part of nature in the dominance hierarchy is part of nature. And because it's so ancient, you have to consider it as part of the mechanism that has played the role of selection in the process of natural selection.

Speaker 2:          00:02:29       And so, um, roughly see what seems to happen is that there is a plethora of dominance hierarchies, especially in complex human communities and many of them are masculine and structure in that their dominance hierarchies that primarily men compete in or that has been the historical norm. And that some men rise to the top based on whatever the dominance hierarchy is based on and they make their preferential mates and it's a good strategy for women to engage in because why and and many sorts of female animals do precisely this is they let the males battle it out and then pick from the top and or often the dominant males. There's no choice on the part of the females. It's the dominant males just chasing away the subordinate males. But with humans it's usually the case that the females have the opportunity to do at least some choosing.

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       And so we have, if you think about that, what that implies is that we have evolved to climb up dominance hierarchies and then I would say it's not exactly that even because there are many different dominance hierarchies. And so the skills that you might use to climb up one might not be necessarily the same skills that you would use to climb up another. And so then I would say what we evolve evolve for instead. Um, and I'm still speaking mostly on the masculine edge of things. Historically speaking is the ability to climb up the set of all possible dominance hierarchies, right? And that's, that's a whole different idea. It's like the average hierarchy across vast spans of time and I think it's for that reason that we, among others that we evolve general intelligence because general intelligence is a general problem solving mechanism and it seems to be situation independent, so to speak.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       And of course there's been an arms race for the development of intelligence between men and women because each gender has to keep up with the other and women have their own dominance hierarchies. There's certainly no doubt about that. And of course now men and women more increasingly compete within the same hierarchies and we don't exactly know how to sort that out yet because it's an extraordinarily new phenomena. But in any case, because of the, uh, the permanence of the dominance hierarchy, it has come to be represented in fundamental narratives because human beings, and this is something that we share everywhere. It's the thing the Wall Street bankers shares with, uh, with the, uh, Kelly Harry Kung bushmen who are among the genetically speaking, they seem to be very close to what the original, most original human beings were like in Africa before the Diaspora for about 50,000 years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       But, you know, both of those people, despite their vast differences live in communities that have a hierarchical structure that are composed of individuals that are embedded in a natural world, you know, the world outside of the dominant Turkey. And so that's the standard human environment I would say. And so stories that rely on the representations of those environments and their interactions are what you might describe as universal stories and that's why people can understand them. And I would say further, and this is drawing substantially on say, derivations of the work of Carl young because I think he delved into this more deeply than anyone else. So a lot of this stuff is quite union in its, in its origins. Um, we, we, the commonality between human beings. So you know, you, you have to have commonalities in order to communicate, right? Axiomatic commonalities because otherwise you have to explain everything and so there's many things that human beings don't have to explain to one another.

Speaker 2:          00:06:42       We don't have to explain anger when we don't have to explain jealousy. We don't have to explain fear, we don't have to explain pain, we don't have to explain joy. We don't have to explain love, et Cetera. Those are built into us and so their predicates of being human and you could say that those human predicates and the standard human environment produce standard narratives and then you could say even further, and this is more of a leap, I would say, is that those who act out the role of the victor in those standard narratives are precisely the people who attain victory in life on and I would say biologically defined in that they make more attractive partners, but also I believe that there's an alignment between human wellbeing, which is a very weak word and participation in these metanarratives that drive success because, well, do you want to be a failure or a success?

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       Well, you know, it's hard to be a success. You have to adopt a lot of responsibility and so you might be willing to take your chances as a failure, but I can't exactly. I'm not going to make the presumption that that's going to put you in this situation other than one where you experienced a lot of frustration, anger, disappointment, depression, pain and anxiety at the bottom of the heap, and so generally that's not what people are aiming for. Although under certain circumstances, if people don't like responsibility and are willing to take their chances, they might take the irresponsibility and it's apparent freedoms over the necessity of thinking things through the medium and long run. Anyways, we stop here. I suggested to you that one of the primary narrative representations was the known or culture or order. I think there was a or the explored territory or the dominance hierarchy.

Speaker 2:          00:08:43       I think those things are basically interchangeable from a, from a representational perspective, and you know in the movie The lion king that's represented by pride rock, which is the central place of orientation founded on Rock, which is the sort of thing that people embed their memories in. That's why we make sculptures and gravestones and that sort of things. Roc stands for permanent than to have rock under your feet is to be on a solid foundation and that's a pyramid in some sense in that movie. And the pyramid has topped by the king and Queen and their offspring. So, um, that's, that's the divine couple. That's one way of thinking about it. And Simba of course is the newborn hero and you know, you, you understand that even though it's lions and drawings of lions at that and animals are acting it out, it's completely irrelevant to you that those characters happen to be animated and that what you're watching is a fiction.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       So, and I would say to you with regards to fiction, you know, you might say, well is fiction true or not? And the answer to that is yes and no. It's not true in that the events portrayed in fiction occurred in the world. They didn't, but they're fiction is true the same way numbers are true. I would say like, you know, if you have one apple and one orange and one banana, the common malady between all of those three is one and you might say, well, is one as real as one fruit is the abstraction one as real as one fruit and I would say it depends on what you mean by real, but representing things mathematically and abstractly gives you incredible power and you could make the case that the abstraction is actually more real than the phenomena that it represents. And certainly mathematicians would make that case.

Speaker 2:          00:10:45       They would say that mathematics is in some sense more real than the phenomenal world. And you know, you don't have to believe that mostly it's a matter of choice in some sense, but you can't deny the fact that an abstraction has enough reality so that if you're proficient in using it, you can really, you can change the world and, and, and in and in insanely powerful ways. You know. I mean, all the computational equipment you people are using are dependent on the abstractions one in zero essentially. And I mean look at what emerges from that. And so I would say with regards to fiction, if you take someone like Dostoevsky or we think it's a favorite of mine, by the way, I would highly recommend that you read all five of his great novels because they are unparalleled in their psychological depth. Um, and so if you're interested in psychology, Dostoyevsky's the person for you, tolstoy is more of a sociologist, but Dostoyevsky man, he gets right down into the bottom of the questions and messes around, uh, a transformative reading.

Speaker 2:          00:11:49       Anyways, Dostoyevsky's characters, this character named her skull and the cove is a character in crime and punishment and risk. And the coffee's a materialist rationalist, I would say, which was around rather new type of person back in the 18 eighties. And he was sort of taken by the idea that God was dead and took and convinced himself that the only reason that he, that anyone acted in a moral way in a traditional way was because of cowardice. They were unable to remove from them the restrictions of mere convention and act in the manner of someone who rose above the norm. And so he's tortured by these ideas. He's half starving. He said, law student who doesn't have enough to eat, he doesn't have much money, and so you know, he's not thinking all that clearly either and it's got a lot of family problems. His mother's sick and she can't spend, send too much money and his sister is planning to engage in a marriage that's loveless to someone who's rather tyrannical, who he, she hopes will provide the family with enough money so that he can continue in law school and they write him brave letters telling him that she's very much in love with this guy, but he is smart enough to read between the lines and realize this, that his sister is just planning to prostitute herself in, you know, in an altruistic manner.

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       And he's not very happy with that. And then at the same time as all this is happening, he becomes aware of this pawn broker who he's, you know, pawning his last possessions too. And she's a horrible person and not only by his estimation, she pawns a lot of things for the neighborhood. And people really don't like her. She's grasping and cruel and deceitful and and resentful and like, and she has this nice who's not very bright, intellectually impaired, whom she basically treats as a slave and beats all the time. And so risk called Nicole, you know, involved in this mess and half starved and a bit delirious and possessed of these strange new nihilistic ideas. Decides that the best way out of this situation would be just to kill the landlord. The, a pawnbroker take her wealth, which she, all she does is keep it in a chest, a free, the nice.

Speaker 2:          00:14:11       So that seems like a good idea. So remove one apparently horrible and useless person from the world, free his sister from the necessity of this loveless marriage and allow him to go to law school where he can become educated and do some good for the world. You know, so one of the things that's lovely about Dostoevsky is that he, you know, when sometimes when one person is arguing against another or when they're having an argument in their head, they make their opponent into a straw mat, which is basically they take their opponent and caricatures of their perspective. And try to make it as weak as possible and, and laugh about it, and, and then they come up with their argument and destroy this Straw man and feel that they've obtained victory. But it's a very pathetic way of thinking. It's not thinking at all what thinking is when you adopt the opposite position from your suppositions and you make that argument as strong as you can possibly make it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:11       And then you hit your perspective against that, that strong iron man, not the straw man. And you argue it out, you battle it out. And that's what Dostoevsky does in his novels. I mean, he's the people who stand for the antithesis of what Dostoevsky Dostoevsky actually believes are often the strongest, smartest, and sometimes most admirable people in the book. And so he takes great moral courage to do that. And uh, you know, in rascal of what he wanted to do was set up a character who had every reason to commit murder, every reasonable reason, philosophically, practically, ethically, even. Well. So ruskell Nicole goes and he kills the old lady with an ax and it doesn't go the way he expects it will because what he finds out is that post murder risk, golden cove and pre murder riscal Nicole have are not the same people at all.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       They're not even close to the same people. He's entered an entirely different universe and Dostoevsky does a lovely job of describing that universe of horror and chaos and and and deception and and and suffering and terror and all of that, and he doesn't even use the money. He just buries it in an alley as fast as he can and then it doesn't want anything to do with it again. Anyways. The reason I'm telling you all this is potentially to entice you into reading the book because it is an amazing, amazing book, but also because you might say, well, is risky is what happened to risk in the cove? True. Are the stories in that book? True? And the answer to that is, well, from a factual perspective, clearly they're untrue. But then if you think of [inaudible] as the embodiment of a particular type of person who lived at that time and the embodiment of a certain kind of ideology which had swept across Europe and really invaded Russia in, which was actually a precursor, a philosophical precursor to the Russian revolution, then Ruskell Niqab is more real than any one person. He's like a composite person. He's like a person who's irrelevancies have been eliminated for the purpose of relating something about the structure of the world. And so I like to think of those things as sort of met a real matter real. They're more real than real. And of course that's what you expect people to do when they tell you about their own lives, about their own day.

Speaker 2:          00:17:51       You don't want a factual description of every muscle twitch. You want them to distill their experiences down into the gist, which is the significance of the experience and the significance of the experience is roughly what you can derive from listening to the experience that will change the way that you look at the world and act in the world. So it's valuable information and they can tell you a terrible story and then that can be valuable because that can tell you how not to look in the world, look at the world and act in it or are they can tell you a positive story. You can derive benefit either way, which is why we also like to go watch stories about horrible psychopathic thugs. Um, you know, and, and hopefully we're learning not to be like them, although there are additional advantages in that, you know, someone who you might be some say that someone who is incapable of cruelty is a higher moral being than someone who is capable of cruelty.

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       And I would say in this follows younger as well, that that's incorrect and it's dangerously incorrect because if you are not capable of cruelty, you are absolutely a victim to anyone who is. And so part of the reason that people go watch anti heroes and villains is because there's a part of them crying out for the incorporation of the monster within them, which is what gives them strength of character and self respect. Because it's impossible to respect yourself until you grow teeth and if you grow teeth, then you realize that you're somewhat dangerous and or maybe somewhat seriously dangerous and then you might be more willing to demand that you treat yourself with respect and other people do the same thing. And so that doesn't mean that being cruel is better than not being cruel. What it means is that being able to be cruel and then not being cruel is better than not being able to be cruel because in the first case you're nothing but we can naive and in the second case you're dangerous but you have it under control and you know a lot of martial arts concentrate on exactly that as part of their philosophy of training.

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       It's like we're not training you to fight. We're training you to be peaceful and awake and avoid fights. But if you happen to have to get in one and the. I guess the philosophy also is, is that if you're a competent at fighting, that actually decreases the probability that you're going to have to fight. Because when someone pushes you, you will be able to respond with confidence and with any luck, and this is certainly the case with bullies, with any luck, a reasonable show of confidence, which is very much equivalent to a show of dominance, is going to be enough to make the bully back off, and so the strength that you develop in your monstrousness is actually the best guarantee of peace and that's partly why young believed that it was necessary for people to integrate their shadow and he said that was a terrible thing for people to attempt because the human shadow which has all those things about yourself that you don't want to realize reaches all the way to hell.

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       And what he meant by that was it's through an analysis of your own shadow that you can come to understand why other people are capable and you as well of the sorts of terrible atrocities that characterize, let's say, the 20th century. And without that understanding, there's no possibility of bringing it under control. When you study Nazi Germany, for example, or you study the Soviet Union particularly under stelling and you're asking yourself, well, what are these perpetrators like? Forget about the victims. Let's talk about the perpetrators. The answer is they're just like you and if you don't know that, that just means that you don't know anything about people including yourself, and then it also means that you have to discover why they're just like you and believe me, that's no picnic, so that's enough to traumatize people and that's partly why they don't do it and it's also partly why the path to enlightenment and wisdom is seldom trod upon.

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       Because if it was all a matter of following your bliss and doing what made you happy, then everyone in the world would be a paragon of wisdom. But it's not that at all. It's the. It's a matter of facing the thing you least want to face and everyone has that old. There's this old story in King Arthur where the night school off to look for the holy grail, which is either the cup that Christ drank out of it, the last supper or the cup into which the blood gushed from his side was poured when he was crucified. The stories vary, but it's. It's basically a holy object like the phoenix in some sense that's representation, a representation of transformation, so it's a. it's an ideal and so King Arthur's knights who sit at round table because they're all roughly equal. Go off to find the most valuable thing and they and where do you look for the most valuable thing when you don't know where it is?

Speaker 2:          00:22:57       Well, each of the nights looks at the forest surrounding the castle and enters the forest at the point that looks darkest to him and that's a good thing to understand because the gateway to wisdom and the gateway to the development of personality, which is exactly the same thing, is precisely through the porthole portal that you do not want to climb through. And the reason for that is actually quite technical. This is a union presupposition too, is that, well, there's a bunch of things about you that are under developed and a lot of those things are because there's things you've avoided looking at because you don't want to look at them and there's parts of you you've avoided developing because it's hard for you to develop those parts. And so it's, it's by virtual necessity that what you need is where you don't want to look because that's where you've kept

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       it. And so, and that's why there's an idiosyncratic element of it for everyone. Your particular place of enlightenment and terror is not going to be the same as yours, except that they're both places of enlightenment and terror. So their equivalent at one level of analysis and, and different at another. So anyways, back to fiction and, and, and, and what it does is it distills truth and it produces characters that are composites and the more they become compass, it's the more they approximate a mythological character. And so they become more and more universally true and more and more approximating religious deities. But the problem with that is they become more and more distant from individual experience. And so with literature, there's this very tight line where you need to make the character more than merely human, but not so much of a god that, you know, one of the things that happened to superman in the 19 eighties, superman started out, he's got a heavenly set, a parents bought, by the way in an earthly set of parents.

Speaker 3:          00:24:54       And he's an orphan like Harry Potter. Very common theme is that when Superman first emerged, he could only jump over buildings. You know what I mean? Maybe you could stop a locomotive, but by the time the 19 eighties rolled around like he could juggle planets and you know, swallow hydrogen bombs and you know, he could do anything. Well, people stopped buying the superman comics because how interesting is that? It's like something horrible happens and superman deals with it and, and something else horrible happens and superman deals with it and it's like, that's dull. He turned into such an archetype. He was basically the omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent God. And that's no fun. That's like Godwin's. And then God wins again and then again, God wins and you know, so then they had to weaken him in different ways with Kryptonite, you know, so green Kryptonite kind of made him sick and red Kryptonite I think, kind of mutated him, if I remember correctly.

Speaker 3:          00:25:52       And anyways, they had to introduce flaws into his character so that there could be some damn plot and not something to think about. You know, there's a deep existential lesson in that in that your being is limited and flawed and fragile. Um, you're like the genie, which is genius in the little tiny in the little tiny a lamp, you know, this immense potential but constrained in this tiny little living space as Robin Williams said when he played the genie in Aladdin. But the fact that you have limitations means that the plot of your life is the overcoming of those limitations. And that if you didn't have limitations, while there wouldn't be a plot and maybe there would be no life. And so that's part of the reason why perhaps you have to accept the fact that you're flawed and insufficient and, and live with it. And consider it a precondition for being.

Speaker 3:          00:26:46       It's at least a reasonable. It's a reasonable idea. So anyways, one of the main characters is the country, the known, the explored territory. We went over that a bit and it always has two elements. I mean your country is your greatest friend and your worst enemy because it squashes you into conformity and demands that you act in a certain manner and reduces your individuality to that element that's tolerated by everyone else and it it constrains your potential in a single direction and so it's really tyrannical, but at the same time it provides you with a place to be and all of the benefits that have accrued as a result of the actions of your ancestors and all the other people that you're associated with. So there's the good tyrant or the bad tyrant and the good king and those were archetypal figures and that's because they're always true and they're always true simultaneously.

Speaker 3:          00:27:50       Which is partly why I object to the notion of the patriarchy because it's a mythological. It's the. It's the, what do you call that? It's the apprehension of a mythological trope, which is that of the evil tyrant without any appreciation for the fact that the archetype actually has two parts and the other part is the wise king and you know you can tell an evil tyrant story about culture, no problem, but it's one sided and that's very dangerous because you don't want to forget all the good things that you have while you're criticizing all the ways that things are in error. That's a lack of gratitude and it's a lack of wisdom and it's. It's founded in resentment and it's. It's very dangerous both personally and socially.

Speaker 3:          00:28:38       I told you that captain hook is a tyrant because he's got this crocodile chasing them in. The crocodile has a clock in its stomach and that's death. It's like obviously, right, tick, tick, tick, tick, and it's a crocodile and it's under the water and it's already got a taste of him. So he's being chased around by death and that makes him terrified and resentful and, and cruel and bitter. And so he's a tyrant and he wants to wreak havoc everywhere. And then Peter Pan of course, looks at Captain Hook and thinks, why the hell should I grow up and to be a tyrant and sacrifice all the potential of childhood. And the answer to that is the potential sacrifices itself. If you don't utilize it as you mature and you just end up a 40 year old last boy, which is a horrifying thing to behold, it's almost as if you're the corpse of a child, the living corpse of a child. Because who the hell wants a six year old, 40 year old. You're a little on the stale side by that point and not the world's happiest individual. So you know

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       your potential is going to disappear because you age anyways. And so you might as well shape that potential in a particular direction and at least become something no matter how limited rather than nothing. So Peter Pan, that's a great story. It's a great mythological story. So

Speaker 2:          00:30:07       well. So let's talk about tyrants. Well, not only are they mythological figures, but they exist and they tend to be deified. Stalin was a, for all intents and purposes, God the father in Soviet Russia, although he was pretty much only the worst elements of Old Testament God who was constantly smiling people and, and wiping out populations and doing all sorts of things that seem to be quite nasty. But nonetheless, you know, people worshiped him in many ways. And, and, uh, he's a representation of just exactly what goes wrong when things really go wrong, when people stop paying attention and when they all lie. Because one of the things that characterized the communist state was that no one ever got to say anything they actually believed ever. And that was partly because one out of three people was an informer, which meant if you had a family of six people, two of them were informing on the government about you. And that included your own children and you. And if you were an informer, you were often amply rewarded by the state. So that if you lived in an overcrowded apartment building with three families in the same flat and you informed on the woman down the hall that you didn't like, she got shift shipped off to the old concentration camp and you got her apartment. And so that was a lovely society and it only killed about 30 million people between 19, 19 in 1959. So that's what happens when the archetipal structure gets tilted badly when people

Speaker 2:          00:31:39       forget that they have a responsibility to fulfill as citizens, as a wake citizens who are capable of stating the truth and the archetype shifts. So there's nothing left of the great father except the tyrant. And let's not have that happen. I mean, the one on the right is really interesting because consciously or unconsciously, you know, there's Stellan surrounded by what is, for all intents and purposes, fire. You know, he looks like he looks like maleficent in sleeping beauty when she shows up at Aurora's Christening, you know, she puts her arms up in the air and green fire surrounds her. It's like,

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       like he's surrounded by fire and there's Lenin above him who's like king of the fiery realm and that's for sure. So I mean, all the terrors that happened in the Soviet Union didn't start understanding and they started under Lenin and Lenin was stolen, was definitely Lenin's legitimate son, let's put it that way. So, you know, this is another example of the tyrannical element of the great father and the sorts of things that can happen. I mean, I kind of got an evil kick out of this ad was quite old, you know, it's kitschy in some sense. And, and you know, it shows, I don't think that's something you'd ever see in a magazine today. I'm 10 unusual stamps showing evil dictator, you know? Um, well, fair enough. I mean, that's what he was and that's the consequence and that's just a tiny bit of the consequence because the Nazis wiped out a very large number of people.

Speaker 2:          00:33:24       I'm often using compassion as a, as a, as a, um, as a justification. So when they went after the mentally ill and the terminally ill and uh, those who, whose intelligence was compromised for biological reasons and, and those who were too old, they basically justified it by saying that the enforced euthanasia was merciful and that you were actually being a good person by complying with the requirements. And so something to think about more mythological representations. I like these quite a bit. So there's, there Hitler, as you know, night of the faith essentially with, I suppose that's a recreation of the Christian Holy Spirit dove, you know, except its an eagle which is a bird of prey. And uh, and uh, and uh, what do you call those things? A scavenger, right? So that's kind of interesting, but that's Hitler as knight of the, of the blood, roughly speaking.

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       And there, this is an allied, a war poster essentially that assimilates the Nazis to poisonous snakes. And you know, we don't like poisonous snakes very much and it's probably because they've been preying on us for approximately $20 million years because snakes and primates, humans in particular co evolved. And so the snake is a representation of that which lies outside the comfortable domain, and that can be, you know, a snake obviously, or it can be a an abstract snake and the abstract snake is your enemy or an even more abstract snake is the evil in your own heart. And this is going to be a bit of a leap for you, but there's this ancient idea that developed in the West over thousands of years, far predating Christianity that at least it's origins, that the snake in the garden of Eden was also Satan. Which is like what the hell? It's a very strange idea, but the reason for that as far as I can tell is that, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       we have this circuitry that detects predators and a predator. A good representation of a Predator is a snake or a monster that incorporates snake like features like a dragon or something like that, or a dinosaur with lots of teeth or a shark that lives under the water. And we'll pull you down. You know, because I suspect a lot of our ancestors met a nasty death at the hands of Nile crocodiles while they were in the African Veldt going down to get some nice water, so you know, that's the thing that jumps up and pulls you under and you know, not happens in your own life because things jump up and pull you under, you know, and use the same circuitry. We use the same circuitry to process unknown things that upset us as we once used to detect predators who were likely to invade our space.

Speaker 3:          00:36:24       And so and, and human beings are capable of abstraction. And so, you know, you could think about the real Predator that might invade your space and maybe that's a snake or a wolf or, or some kind of monster, you know, and that's pretty concrete. And biological chimps have that, you know, chimps don't like snakes. And so if you, a chimp comes across a snake in the wild than like a big, let's say, I don't know what live with chimps. Uh, I don't know if they're pythons, but they have constrictors there anyways. So you know, maybe there's like a 20 foot constrictor and this and the chimp like stays a good distance away from it, but it won't leave. And then it has this particular cry that it outers that's called a snake ram wr. Ay Ay. And so it makes this noise, which means something like, Holy Shit, that's a big snake.

Speaker 3:          00:37:13       And I actually mean that because the circuits that primates use to utter distress calls are the same circuits that we use to curse. Just so you know, that's why people with Tourette Syndrome swear because like what, what's up with that? How can you have a neurological condition that makes you swear? Well, it turns out that got her role as effect laden curses are mediated by a different speech circuit and that's the speech circuit we share with the Predator alarms of other primates. So that's pretty cool. So anyways, this is the chimp stands there and makes this snake noise and then all bunch of other chimps come running and you know, some of them stay a fairways from the snake and some of them get pretty close, but they'll stand there and watch that snake for like 24 hours, you know. So they're fascinated by it. And you know, if you've handled snakes, you can understand that fascination because they're fascinating, you know, and they're numinous.

Speaker 3:          00:38:12       I would say that that's the right way of putting it. A numinous is a word that means intrinsically meaningful, like fire, you know, you can't look away from fire, you know, if you're sitting in front of a fireplace, it's like you're staring at it and that's because you're all descended from the first mad chimpanzee who had some weird genetic mutation that made it impossible for to stay away from fire. It was like the first chimp arsonist, you know, and, and he figured it out and well, hey, now he was a chimp with a stick with fire on it. Like that's a mega chimp man. And so, you know, we have that mutation in spades and no wonder. So anyways, um, so they, they make this, they have this reaction to snakes and chimps that have never seen a snake. If they're in a cage and you throw a rubber snake in there, it's like bang, they hit the roof, but then they look at the snake, you know, so it's like, it's terrifying and fascinating at the same time.

Speaker 3:          00:39:14       And you should look at the snake because you want to know what it does, but you should stay away from it because it's a snake, so you, you're kind of screwed in terms of your motivations, right? One is get the hell away and the other is, while don't, don't let that thing do anything that you're not watching. And so that's really the reaction we have to the unknown. It's terrifying. But we watch it. And then, you know, the Meta story is that not only do we watch it, but we go explore it. And so you might think, well back in the garden of Eden, so to speak, when we were living in trees, the snakes used to come and eat us and, and our, our offspring more likely and you know, we weren't very happy about that. And then we figured out how to maybe maybe by accident drop a stay a stick on a snake and that was a good thing because the snake didn't like that.

Speaker 3:          00:40:04       And then maybe the next thing we learned a little later was to like actually take a stick and whack the snake with it. And you can believe that the first primate who figured out that was just as popular as the Guy Who mastered fire. And so we're pretty good at whacking state snakes with sticks, which is why a springfield has a snake whacking day that's devoted to nothing but that. Right? I don't know if you know that simpsons episode, but it's quite comical. So. Well. So then you think about the snake as a Predator and it's the thing that invades the garden always because you just can't keep snakes out of the damn garden no matter how hard you try. And then you think of snakes and maybe you think of medicine aches and like a medicine ache would be also a predator, but maybe that's the Predator that represents the, the destructive spirit of the other tribe because chimpanzees, for example, are quite tribal and they definitely go to war with one another.

Speaker 3:          00:41:02       And so you think you abstract out the idea of the Predator to represent malevolence as such. And then you take that one step further and you realize that the worst of all evil predators is the human capacity for evil. And then at that point, you know you're starting to, I would say psychologize or spiritualize, the idea of danger and making it make it into something that's conceptual and something that's psychological and something that you can, you can face sort of on moss. I mean, one of the things people had to figure out was how do you deal with danger? And so you figure out how you deal with a specific danger, but then because human beings are so damn smart, they thought, well, what if we considered the class of all dangerous things? And then what if we considered a a mode of being that was the best mode of being in the face of the class of all dangerous things.

Speaker 3:          00:42:03       Well, that's a lot better. You get, you get solve all the dangerous problems all at once instead of having to conjure up a different solution for every dangerous thing. And that's basically as far as I can tell where the hero's story came from. And the hero story is basically, you know, there is a community. It's threatened by the emergence of some old evil, often represented by a dragon. That's sort of typical say of the Lord of the rings stories. There's a hero, often a humble guy, but not always. Sometimes a night decides he'll go out there and chase down the snake, maybe even or the serpent or the dragon and maybe even in its layer and he'll have a bunch of adventures on the way that transform him from useless naive hobbit into sword wielding hero and he confronts the Dragon and gets the gold and frees the people that it had enslaved and then comes back transformed to share what he's learned with the community.

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       It's like, well, that's the human story fundamentally. And that's, that's our basic instinctive pattern. And it's represented in narratives constantly. And that's partly what this sea, this has meaning, you know, what this means? Why, why do you know? Well, you know, because it draws on symbolic representations that you already understand. You understand that a mess of tooth snakes is not a good thing and that may be the sensible thing to do is stomp them and it's not like you need an instruction manual to figure out what the poster means. And so, you know, that's two different representations of Hitler that sort of the Pro Hitler representation. And I would say that's the Anti Hitler representation. And you know, that's the real Hitler, who at this point does not look like a very happy clam. So. So that's the known. That's culture. Now it's order and what's eternally juxtaposed to culture and the known and the explored and order is the unknown.

Speaker 3:          00:44:07       And the unknown is a strange place. The unknown is actually. It's a physical place like the unknown is the place that when you're camping and you're around a fire, the unknown is everything outside the circle of the light. And you remember in the Lion King, you may not remember when, when, when Mufasa, that's the king, right? Goes and takes Simba up to show him his territory. He says he is the king of everything. The light touches. And that's a very old idea. And you guys had no problem with. That was fine. That made sense. And that I would be on the light was the darkness. And that was the elephant graveyard. That was death. That was the place of death and danger. That's where the hyenas hung out. And you weren't supposed to go there. And so of course, Simba, because he's a rule breaking hero, just like Harry Potter immediately goes there.

Speaker 3:          00:45:00       And so, you know, that's like the forbidden fruit. It's the same sort of idea. If you want someone to do something, the best thing to do is tell them that they shouldn't and not explain why, you know. So for example, if I said to you at the beginning of this class, look, I've got one rule here, don't sit in that chair no matter what you'd be thinking the whole year, especially if I reminded you just what's up with that chair. Like that's chairs magical. All of a sudden you, some of you might even, while you probably wouldn't, because this is a ridiculous example, but maybe you know, you come to class early and sit in that chair just to see what would happen. You know, and people are very curious. And that's exactly what we're like. And that's a very old story too, right? It's like opening Pandora's box.

Speaker 3:          00:45:47       Don't open that box. You'll be sorry. It's like, oh, you know, all of the horrors of the world fly out and believe me, you will open Pandora's box many times in your life because you know with your family or maybe your mate or maybe your children, you'll have this idea that they have a box with things in it that you want to know about and you'll say, well, I'm kind of curious about this particular event, so why don't you tell me about it? And they say, well no, we probably really shouldn't open that box and you keep bugging him and then they open it and then all sorts of things fly out that you didn't expect and then maybe you think, hey, it would have been better if I would have just left that damn box closed, but, and you can do the same thing to yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:46:32       Believe me. And so the Pandora's box idea, the forbidden fruit idea. That's, that's a major league idea. And part of the reason in the Judeo Christian tradition, why people are saddled with the notion of original sin is because hyper cortically developed chimpanzees without much sense. Can't keep their hands off things. And so they keep exploring even when they know better and every time they do that, they learn something that is, that destroys the paradise that they currently inhabit. Right? Because there's plenty in the. And I never learned anything in your life. It's of importance without it having a pretty damn destabilizing effect on you at the moment of realization, right? You learn something happy. It's like whatever, you know, that'll, that means is that I was doing things right, like it's nice and everything, but it's not informative.

Speaker 3:          00:47:31       You do something and all hell breaks loose. That'll make you think now it's for sure you might never stop thinking for the rest of your life. So anyways, the unknown, the unknown is that which surrounds the known. It's unexplored territory. It's usually represented as female, I think for a variety of reasons. And not, not as female. Exactly. It's not the right way to think about it as feminine. And that's not the same thing because feminine is a symbolic category, whereas female is like an actual female. And so you don't want to confuse the metaphor with the, with the, with the actuality. Um, because we had these social cognitive categories built in, you know, you might say masculine, feminine and offspring, something like that. We had to use what we could to represent what we were attempting to figure out and we kind of mapped them onto the external realities of being the best we could, using what we could.

Speaker 3:          00:48:31       And so, you know, nature is benevolent and it's fruitful. All things come from nature and all things come from the unknown, right? Because the known is already there. It's the unknown that manifests the new, right? And so that's part of the reason for the characterization of the unknown as feminine. Um, and then there's also the case that women play a massive role in sexual selection among human beings. So that from an evolutionary perspective, you're twice as likely to be a failure if you're a man than you are. If you're a woman in that you have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors and you think, well, that's impossible, but it's not. All you have to do is imagine that every woman has one child, half the men have to, and the other half have zero. And so end of problem, and that's basically how it works out.

Speaker 3:          00:49:26       So women are more choosy maters than men by a substantial margin. There was a funny study done by the guy who established one of the big dating sites and he looked at how women rated men and they rated the 50th percentile man at the 15th percentile. So 85 percent of men were below average according to women's ratings. Now men had their same arbitrary choices because of course they preferred younger women to older women and they were more swayed, I would say by um, by attractiveness, but that didn't have nearly as big an effect on their actually actual rating of, of women. So anyways, so, you know, from a, from a Darwinian perspective, nature is that which selects, that's all it is. And so sexual selection plays a massive role in human evolution. You know, the fact that we have these massive

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       brains is very likely a consequence of a positive feedback loop and sexual selection, you know, because otherwise that's the only time you can get really rapid changes in evolutionary space where you get a process going. That reinforces itself. So there's a little preference for intelligence and then that produces more intelligent men and women and then there's a little more preference for intelligence and you know, maybe then that turns into the ability to speak and, or to master fire and then there's way more selection for intelligence in the brain just goes like this, you know, and women have paid a pretty big price for that because your hips are basically so wide that you can barely run and if they were any wider than you couldn't. And of course the, the pelvic passageway through which the baby travels is too small. So it's really painful and dangerous and the baby's head has to compress quite a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:51:23       I mean they come out, cone shaped often and then they're born really young so you have to take care of them forever. Like what the hell, you know, a deer is born, a fawn is born and it's like two seconds later it's standing and then it's running from a lion. It's like, you know, it's like 15 minutes later and a baby. It's like you just lies there and you know, utters plaintive noises. That's all it can do, and that does that for like 10 months before it could skitter away from a slothy if it was predatory, you know, so you really got to take care of those creatures. And so that's a big price to pay. That's a big price to pay for our critical evolution. So anyways, here's some of the symbolic representations represents representatives of the unknown, the unconscious dot uneasy, and four of the ID.

Speaker 2:          00:52:15       So that's sort of Freud's representation of the unknown, the terrors of the darkness. That's the unknown. The monsters that lurk there, the source and the resting place of all things. The great mother, the Queen, the Matrix which means mater, which means mother, the matriarch matter, mother, the container, the Cornucopia, the object to be fertilized, the source of all things, the fecund, the pregnant, the strange, the emotional, the foreigner, the place of returned and rest. The deeper the valley, the cleft, the cave hell, death and the grave because it's beyond the moon. Ruler of the night and mysterious, dark and matter and the earth. And you know all this because when you watch a movie that's rife with symbolic representations that draws on those underlying metaphors and they're natural, I mean where does it, which live well in a swamp for God's sake. She doesn't live in the penthouse of a New York Tower. She lives at a swamp and it's dark there. And if the moon's up, that's a better. And maybe it could be a crescent moon or maybe it could be a full moon, but you know, which is live in the right place if you're going to understand it

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       and you all, you understand all of that. And it's part of the structure of your imagination you could say. And so it's part of the unspoken fantastical Ah, imagination that unites all of us and that makes us specifically human. There is a good representation of the underworld and the place of transformation. So that's hell in Isis. In Egypt was queen of the underworld and the underworld generally has a queen and she usually shows up when order falls apart. And so you go to the underworld. When your life falls apart, that's what it means. And so when you see these stories of the hero, you know, journeying to unknown lands of terror and danger, that's, that's what happens to you. It happens to you all the time. You know you're, you're in this little safe space like the hobbit in the Shire, and then you know there's a great evil brewing somewhere and you can no longer ignore it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:26       So off you go into the land of terror and uncertainty and better to go on purpose then accidentally, that's for sure, because at least you can be prepared. And we also know that if you're going to face a threat, if you face it voluntarily, what happens is your body activates itself for exploration and mastery. But if you face it voluntarily, same size threat, then you, you, you, you revert to pray, pray mode and you're frozen. And that's way, way, way more stressful. It's way harder on your body and so it's better to keep your eyes open and watch for emergent threats because you all know, you know what you're not doing quite right and where your life is likely to unravel. You all have a sense of that. And the best thing to do is to not ignore that, to pay attention to it, to watch it, and to take corrective action early.

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       And then you know, you stay on top of things and things, your little trip to the underworld might be a few minutes long instead of a catastrophe that produces posttraumatic stress disorder, knocks you out for four or five years and maybe you never recover. So. And that's, you know, that's what these kind of symbolic representations mean. It's, those are states of being that, that, that indicate being devoured and you can be devoured by your own unconscious. Jesus. That happens all the time. What does that mean? Well, you know, and it's an autonomous thing in some sense. You know, like if you, if you get depressed or if you get really anxious, you don't have any control over that. It's like it sweeps up over you and pulls you down. Wydown well down is where you go when you're sad. You don't go up, man, I'm up today.

Speaker 3:          00:56:10       Oh, that's too bad. No, it's man. I'm down today. And while that's partly this, and it's partly because this is subordinate and it's partly because down is closer to the ground and farther from the sky, like there's all sorts of reasons you're feeling down rather than op. Op is where you're aiming, right? Yay. Mop. You don't aim down. Well, the reason those phrases make sense because they're locked deeply into this underlying structure of imagination. And while those are the architects of the archetypal structures according to young and um, I, I think that he's far as I can tell he's dead accurate. Um, and I think we understand the biology of such things much better than we did. So there is more representation. She's, she's quite the friendly creature. That's Kelly. Um, I like this representation better. Those are heads by the way and hands. Um, so she sort of represents well, very complex thing.

Speaker 3:          00:57:12       She represents death, she represents transformation in this. I really liked this representation. I think it's brilliant. So imagine that what the people were doing who formulated these representations, what they were trying to do was to make a representation of the domain of threat itself, right? So that they could deal with the idea that because we can say, threat, well, what is that? What the hell does that mean? Well, threat is the category of all threatening things. And so then you can think about threat and you can think about threat across all those individual instances and maybe you can figure out how to deal with threat, right? How, what's the best way to be in the world so that you most effectively deal with threat. While that's sort of like, apart from how do you deal with pain, that sort of like the ultimate question of human beings.

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       You want to be terrified? No. So you want to be in danger? No. So like, you better figure out how to deal with threats. So first of all, you have to conceptualize it. So we'll take a look at this representation. So now it's Kelly sheer. Her hair is on fire. Well, fire, you know, that's, that's a numinous phenomena. Dangerous but transformative. She's wearing a headdress of skulls. Um, she has a weapon in this hand. And, and uh, she has a tiger's tongue. She often has a snake around her waist. Need none of these do, but she often does, but in this case, the stem, that's because snake, we've already covered that. Well, these things that looked like snakes here aren't you notice how her belly is concave? Well, it's because she's just given birth to this unfortunate person that she happens to be standing on and she's eating him intestines first and that's a fire ring, which he is in, and then it's got skulls on the inside of it.

Speaker 3:          00:59:00       It's like, what's that supposed to do? Well, partly it's supposed to represent that which terrifies you. It's like, yeah, fair enough, man, because I don't imagine you saw those things in there before I explain them, but someone who was familiar with that image would know what it meant. It's like some poor artist was sitting there thinking, well, how do I represent? It's like, Bang, Whoa, okay, we'll put that down and then we won't look at it again. So, and then what do you do with this? You make sacrifices to it and you think, well that's kind of primitive, you know, first of all, well that doesn't really exist. Well it does. If it's an amalgam of threat symbols, I can tell you that it exists. That's for sure. So it exists as an abstraction. If nothing else do you offer it? Sacrifices? Well, what the hell do you think you do?

Speaker 3:          00:59:53       What do you do it in class? Why aren't you like drinking vodka and snorting cocaine? You know, because you could be doing that instead. Here you are listening to me, you know, slaving away in university, you're young. It's like, really? You've got nothing better to do than sit there. You know what you're willing to forego today's pleasure for tomorrow's advantage. And that's what sacrifice is. And human being's discovered that dramatically first. You know, like we're, we're apes for God's sake. We didn't just leap up and think, oh, we better save for tomorrow. You know, we took thousands of years for that idea to emerge and it emerged in dramatic form and it was sort of like, well, society is sort of like a god no. What they weren't thinking this through is like, if you're going to represent society well, it's like this masculine God. That's always judging the hell out of you.

Speaker 3:          01:00:48       That's everywhere, all at the same time. It's like, yeah, yeah, that's true. Absolutely. And what do you have to do with it? Well, you have to give it what it wants. Why? Why do you have to give it what it wants? Because it'll crush you if you don't. And that's exactly right. And if you're lucky and you give it the right sacrifice, then it will smile on you and you get to have a good life. And that was like, that was the major discovery of mankind. Man. That was the killer discovery. It was like the discovery of the future, you know, we discovered the future as a place and it was a place that you could bargain with. You can bargain with the future. Wow. That's just what an idea that is. You know, it's, it's so unlikely. Well, how do you bargain with the future while you give it what it wants?

Speaker 3:          01:01:39       And you know, some of that's you maintain your social relationship and you know, you make yourself useful to other people and you shape yourself so that you can cooperate with people and you, you don't act impulsively, and maybe you squirrel something away for the next harvest, even if you're hungry and you know, and then the future isn't hell and you make the proper sacrifices. And so if you sacrifice to Kelly, then she turns into her opposite and showers benevolence on you. And that's mother nature, right? It's like, look out for Mother Nature, man, you know, two weeks out in the right now and your dad and it's not pleasant. And then if it's the spring, you'll last longer, but the bugs eat you. And so that's not very fun either. So nature, you know, it's bent on your destruction, but if you treat it properly and carefully and make the right sacrifices, then maybe one of her trees will offer you some fruit and that would be okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:43       And so, believe me, lots of people died trying to figure that out. So here's another way of looking at it. So I said, you know, order and chaos, known unknown, unexplored territory, unexplored territory. I love this. This is the Taoist symbol. It's a symbol of being and being isn't reality as you would conceptualize it as a scientist. It's more like reality as it manifests itself to you as a living thing, which is completely different. You know, science extracts out all the subjectivity, all it is, there is an array of objective facts of equivalent value and that's part of its method, but that's not the world in which you live. The world in which you live is full of motivation and emotion. It's full of terror and pain and joy and frustration and, and other people. That's for sure. And so that's the real world. And so, well that's what this is.

Speaker 3:          01:03:37       It's, it's the real world. And what is it made out of? Well, it's made out of all those things, you know, that can get out of hand, you know, because the explored territory and the known can get so damn tight that it's nothing but a tyrant. And then it's all those things you don't know. And that's pretty exciting because you know, you want to go find out some things you don't know and that adds a lot of spice to life. You want a little adventure. You don't want to go out with someone who's so predictable that you know everything about them in a week. You know, unless you're hyper conservative, you want to go out with someone who's got there a little erratic, like not too erratic. Let's say they're a little dangerous, perhaps not too dangerous, but some of that at least you want predictability with a bit of unpredictability in there.

Speaker 3:          01:04:23       Well, that's exactly what this means. It's thick. That's predictability with a little unpredictability in it. And what that also means is that what you know can be turned into what you don't know just like that. And now it's going to happen to you. Lots of times in your life, man, when someone close to you dies, suddenly it's like, poof, order turns into chaos and now you're in chaos. And what the hell are you going to do there? And that's a good question because you need to know what to do there because you're going to be there and it happens to you when your dreams fall apart, you know, I mean your dreams for your life or you know, when you discover something awful about yourself that you didn't know or you know, it flips on you all the time and in small ways. Sometimes you know, you have a fight with a friend or in big ways that, that wipe you out for while indefinitely sometimes because you can fall into chaos and never get out.

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       You know, that's the people who are trapped in the belly of the beast. It isn't necessarily that when you descend into chaos that you learn something and you get back out. You could just be stuck there suffering until you die. And that's, you know, I wouldn't recommend that. You know, it's something to avoid. But it happens to people all the time. All the time. You see them wandering around, you know, shattered on the streets of Toronto, you know, they're done. They're in chaos and there's so much chaos around them that you won't even go near them. The chaos spreads like eight feet around them and so when you see someone like that, you're like, well first we're not going to look too closely, and people like that often don't like you to look at them because that also helps them remember where they are and that's no pleasant thing and you're going to just stay away from that.

Speaker 3:          01:06:06       Maybe you'll cross the street, maybe you'll keep your head down, whatever. You're not going anywhere near that chaos and no bloody wonder. You know, and, and you don't think about it much after you pass it because it's a hell of a thing to think about and what are you going to do about it anyway so you don't know what to do about it. You might just make it worse. Well, so chaos, you know, that's the other half of life and it can turn into order sometimes better order. That's actually what you do when you explore, right? You explore, you find out something new, not too new, not to Pandora boxy, you know, bite off as much as you can chew, but no more and so that rearranges the way you look at the world, but you're doing it voluntarily so you can kind of tolerate the recalibration and you strengthen the order, right?

Speaker 3:          01:06:57       Because now you become more competent and I would say that you're trying to live on the edge between order and chaos and I and I mean that's a real place. That's an actual. It's a Meta place, but it's more real than places because it's so old. It's such an old place. It really exists and your nervous system knows that it sees the world this way. In fact, the right hemisphere is roughly specialized for chaos and the left hemisphere is roughly specialized for order, which is why the left hemisphere tends to have the linguistic elements and why people are right handed. And the right hemisphere has a more diffuse structure. It's more associated with negative emotion and imagination and the to communicate between each other through the Corpus callosum and the right hemisphere appears to update the less left hemisphere kind of slowly, often in dreams.

Speaker 3:          01:07:46       And so if you are hurt, if your right hemisphere has hurt, for example, back here in the prior lobe, then you lose the left part of your body. You can't move it anymore, but you also lose the idea that you have a left part of your body. So it's like blindness. It's a blindness to the left. And so if someone comes along and says, you know, you're not moving your left arm, you're going to say, yeah, well my arthritis is bothering me to the I moved it for six months. Well, arthritis is bothering today, or you know, you don't move your left foot like, well, you know, uh, I'm too tired. Well, what's happened is the left hemisphere has a representation of the body and it's not being updated because the part of the brain that would notice that the left is gone because of a stroke.

Speaker 3:          01:08:33       It isn't there anymore. And so the left already has a model and it's not going to change. Just it's hard to change your model of yourself. You don't have a tooth pulled. What happens? It's like your damn tongue is in that hole for the next six months fiddling around constantly. And that's because you're rebuilding your neurological model of your body. It's like try it out with your whole left side and see how well you do. You know. So this guy named Ramachandran was experimenting with people like this and one of the things he did was Kinda. He was checking their balance and you can do that by irrigating the ear with cold water and that makes people go like this, makes their eyes move back and forth because it upsets the vestibular system. And what he found was that if he, if he poured cold water in the left ear of someone with right parietal damage who had left neglect, that they'd all of a sudden sort of wake up catastrophic Lee, they'd have a terrible reaction to the fact that they were paralyzed on the left and they would know that it had happened and cry.

Speaker 3:          01:09:37       And it made all sorts of distress and no wonder, and then like 20 minutes later they snapped back into their damaged mode of being and they would not deny because that isn't really what it is, is that they couldn't update the model, they just didn't have the neurology for it anymore. So they were backed in not noticing that it was gone and coming up with stories about it and so well. So that's a good example of how the right and left hemispheres work together and how they're kind of mapped onto this weirdly enough so you know, we're map were adapted to the Meta reality. And so what that would be is we're adapted to that which remains constant across the longest spans of time. And that's not the same things that you see flitting around you day to day. Those are just, they just like clouds.

Speaker 3:          01:10:31       They're just evaporating. You know, there's things underneath that that are more fundamental that are more fundamental realities like the dominance hierarchy, like the tribe, like the danger outside of society, like the threat that other people pose to you and that you pose to yourself. Those are eternal realities and we're adapted to those. That's our world and that's why we express that in stories. And so then you might say, well, how do you adapt yourself to this world? And the answer to that is, and I believe this is a neurological answer, I believe this, that your brain can tell you when you're optimally situated between chaos and order and the way it tells you that is by producing the sense of engagement and meaning. So let's say there's a place in the environment you should be okay, what should that place be? Well, you don't want to be terrified out of your skull.

Speaker 3:          01:11:26       Like what good is that? And you know, you don't want to be so comfortable that you might as well sleep. You want to be somewhere where you know you're kind of on firm ground here, but over here you're kind of testing out new territory and some of you who were exploratory and emotionally stable, you know you're going to go pretty far out into the unexplored territory without destabilizing yourself. And other people are gonna. Just put a toe in the chaos and you know, that's neuroticism basically, that's your sensitivity to threat, that's calibrated differently in different people and some people are more exploratory than others. That's kind of extraversion and openness working together and, and intelligence. So some people are going to tolerate a larger admixture of chaos in their order. Those are liberals by the way. And, and I mean that technically liberals are more interested in novel chaos and conservatives are more interested in the stabilization of the structures that already exist and who's right?

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       Well, it depends on the situation and that's why conservatives and liberals have to talk to each other because one of them isn't right and the other wrong. Sometimes the conservatives are right and sometimes the liberals are right because the environment's going like this, he can't predict the damn thing. So that's why you have to communicate. And that's what a democracy does, is it allows people of different temperamental types to communicate and to calibrate the damn societies. So anyways, so let's say you're optimally balanced between chaos and order. So what does that mean? Well, you're stable enough but you're interested, right? Because a little novelty heightens your anxiety that wakes you up a bit. That's the adventure part of it, but it also focuses the part of your brain that does exploratory activity and that's actually associated with pleasure. That's the dopamine circuit. And so if you're optimally balanced and you know that you know you're there when you're listening to an interesting conversation or you're engaged in one, it's a real conversation.

Speaker 3:          01:13:33       You know you're saying some things you know and the other person is saying some things they know, but the both of what you know is changing. It's like, wow, that's so interesting. You'll have a conversation like that forever. Or maybe you're reading a book like that, or you're listening to a piece of music that models that because what music does is provide you with predictable forms, multilevel predictable forms that transform just the right amount. And so music is a very representational art form. It says, this is what the universe is like. You know, there's a dancing element to it. Repetitive and then cute variations that sort of surprise and delight you and, and you think, wow, that's so cool and it doesn't matter how nihilistic you are. Music still inside infuses you with a sense of meaning and that's because it models meaning that's what it does is that's why we love it and you know, you could dance to it and that sort of symbolizes you putting yourself in harmony with these multiple poll layers of reality and positioning yourself properly and you like that too.

Speaker 3:          01:14:40       You know, you'll pay for it. Oh boy, I get to go dancing, you know? Oh boy. I get to listen to music. Like what the hell are you doing? Listening to music. What good is that? Well, you think that's a stupid question. I don't care about your dopey criticism. I'm going to listen to some music, right? There's no rational. There's no rational argument against music. It's like you just don't even think about him. He just walk away from someone who's stupid enough to ask that question. It's like some things are obvious. Well why? Okay, so that's pretty fun. So what mediates between these two domains? While that's what consciousness does, far as I can tell, and that sort of the individual, and that's the hero, that's another way of thinking about it. It's the logos. That's another way of thinking about it. It's the word that generates order out of chaos at the beginning of time.

Speaker 3:          01:15:38       It's the consciousness that interacting with the matter of the world produces being. That's basically it. That's basically you for all intents and purposes. Um, how do you do that? Well, the unconscious does it to some degree, you know, because it's with our fantasy that we first meet the unknown, right? Well, look, say you're going out with a new person. It's like what do you do? You project a fantasy on them and then you fall in love with the fantasy and aren't used stupid because you're going to find out that the match between your damn fantasy in the actual person is tenuous at best. And so young would call that a projection of either the anima or the animus. The Anima is what a man projects onto a woman he finds desirable. It's like, oh, she's the perfect woman. It's like, well, how do you know that you've like seen her for four seconds, you know, but it grips you and the same thing happens in the opposite direction and it's an action of instinct.

Speaker 3:          01:16:38       You know? It's like you fall in love with the image and but interestingly enough, what you do in a relationship that works is that you actually, I think that what you see a rough approximation when you project the ideal and fall in love with it, you see what could be. It could be that, but it's going to take a hell of a lot of work because like you got no shortage of flaws and the other person has no shortage of flaws and so you're bringing your flaws together and that's going to produce a lot of and you're going to have to engage in a lot of dialogue before you approach that level of perfection again. But maybe you can do it. Then you get to live happily ever after. Well, wouldn't that be nice? Well, so the unconscious meets the unknown and if it meets it with imagination and fantasy and dream and art, that's how you take.

Speaker 3:          01:17:33       So you don't just go from what you don't know to fully articulated knowledge and one bloody leap. You can't do that. You have to extend pseudopods of fantasy and imagination into the unknown. That's kind of what theorizing is like, right? Even scientifically, you know, you don't know something scientifically, you generate a theory. Well, it's an imaginative representation that you're unconscious is helping you generate and so you meet the unknown with fantasy. That's what the unconscious is for. From the psychoanalytic perspective. That's what dreams do. And you can see why you dream about the future. You know, it's like, well, what's the future going to be like, wow, you have a little imaginative story going on and it's like you don't really create it and it sort of, you watch it unfold, you know, maybe you can tweak it here and there, but it sort of comes to you from wherever the hell things like that come from.

Speaker 3:          01:18:24       You know, the unconscious, that's the psychoanalytic answer. It's not really much of an answer because it's more like a representation of a, of a place that we don't understand, but that's where creativity comes from. And I mean some people are really creative right down to the bloody core. So in my clinical practice, I often see people who are high in openness because they're attracted to me because they watch my lectures and you have to kind of be high in openness to like my lectures, so because, well you do because they go everywhere, you know, and they're not necessarily very orderly. So, um, so anyways, lots of my clients are really high in openness and they're funny people often, especially if they're smart because sometimes they have the most nihilistic intelligence you can imagine. It's just self critical and nihilistic and brutally brutal man and smart.

Speaker 3:          01:19:15       And so they just criticize themselves out of existence. And so often I have to just try to get them to quit listening to their chattering raw self critical rationality and go out and create something, you know, with their massive creativity. And as long as they're doing that, they're engaged in the world and happy as hell. But as soon as that self critical rationality comes in and shuts down the creativity, they're just there just like walking corpses, you know, and it's because if you're really open like that's you're a tree and it has some trunks and you know, your, your most prominent trait is the most lively trunk. And if you're a creative person and you're not engaging in a creative enterprise, you're just, you're like a tree that has been, that has had its vitality amputated. And so this is not trivial. This stuff is.

Speaker 3:          01:20:05       This is deeply, deeply rooted in your biology. And, and those are people often who have like dream lives. You just can't believe. I have one client, he has like four spectacular dreams a week. And most of the time we just spend discussing them. I mean God, he and I had another client who could be lucid in her dreams, which is more common among women. She could ask the damn characters what they represented and they would tell her. It was like, okay, that was pretty weird. And like a lot of the things they told her were really helpful and they were not things that she wanted to hear. She, she basically, one of them told her she, if she was going to live, she'd have to go visit a slaughterhouse. And the reason for that was because she was raised as a little princess and protected from horrible mother nature until she hit puberty, in which time she turned into an evil villain because that's how the family work.

Speaker 3:          01:21:01       Perfect child evil teenager overnight. And then, well that was hard on her and she wasn't prepared because she thought the world was princess world and she couldn't go through a butcher store without having a fifth and no wonder, you know, like really Jesus, you know, it's no wonder, but you do it. But she couldn't. So we used to go to butcher stores and that would make her cry. And, and um, she was a vegetarian that would make her cry and you know, be mon the cruelty of the world. And it's like, yeah, fair enough, man. Those are bloody slabs of meat. It's like, I don't know why everyone isn't screaming when they walked through the butcher store, but, but you got to get used to it band because you can't live in the world otherwise, and so the dream character who was a gypsy told her that she had to go visit a slaughterhouse which seemed rather impractical and so I asked her if she could think of anything else to do and she thought, well, why don't we go visit a funeral home and and watch an embalming?

Speaker 3:          01:21:58       And I thought, oh good, that sounds, that sounds like a fun way to spend a day. And so I phoned up a funeral parlor and I said I declined. It was terrified of death now and I was a therapist who is also a little shaky on the concept myself and so they, they had no problem with that. They deal with death all the time, which is really something to think about, right? A human being can actually have an occupation where they do nothing but deal with death and they don't go stark raving mad. It's like, what the hell is up with that? It's like working in a palliative care ward where your, your clients that you have a relationship, all they're going to do is die this week, next week, the week after. People do that. It's like those people are tough man. They're tough. So anyways, we went and watched this embalming, which was, I have a rather high level of disgust sensitivity.

Speaker 3:          01:22:54       So it, it was a little on the rough side for me, but she sat there and first, well she was not. We were outside this little room. She was not looking at that know away and she'd kind of go like this and you know, that was pretty good. And then she'd go like this and then she go like this and then then she watched it and then she asked if she could go in and she put on a glove and she touched the body and she didn't have a fit. She didn't have a panic attack and so she walked away from their learning that there was a hell of a lot more to her than she thought there was and that she could see things that she didn't think she could see. And live, and after that she sort of had a touchstone. It's like, well, I'm kind of afraid of this.

Speaker 3:          01:23:37       Was it as bad as going to see the bombing? No, it's not that bad. Well, I guess I can do it. It's like an initiation, right? She had an initiation and so did I, you know, and I learned a lot from doing that. I learned that one of the things you need to do if you're going to be a human being is to prepare yourself to be useful in the face of death. And so when you have a parent that dies, which shatters people's ideas, often they can't even think about it. If you can't even think about that, man, you've got some thinking to do because you need to be able to at least think about that because otherwise you're just going to be a wasteland when it happens. And you never know. You could even have a higher ambition. Maybe you could even be useful when it happens. Instead of being part of the heap of destroyed people who also have to be taken care of, you know? And that's brutal. You have to be brutal to be useful in the aftermath of your parents' death. You know, you don't get to crumble and fall apart and knowing you have every reason to, so you've got to be kind of some tough monster to manage that, but you want to be useful in the face of tragedy or do you want to be pathetic?

Speaker 1:          01:24:47       Well,

Speaker 3:          01:24:51       you make your choice so out of the unconscious, you get ritual, you get dreams, you get drama, you get stories, you could arc. You get music and that sort of buffers us. We have our little domain of competence and we're buffered by the domain of fantasy and culture and that's really what you learned about when you come to university, if you're lucky and, and the professors are smart enough to actually teach you something about culture instead of constantly telling you that it's completely reprehensible and should be destroyed. It's like why you would prefer chaos to order is beyond me. And the only possible reason is that you haven't read enough history to understand exactly what chaos means. And believe me, if you understood what it means, you'd be pretty God damn careful about tearing down the temple that you live it unless you want to be at Denison of chaos.

Speaker 3:          01:25:42       And some people do, you know, because that's when the impulses that you harbor can really come out and shine. And so a little gratitude is in order and that makes you appreciative of the wise king. Well being smart enough to know that he's also an evil tyrant. It's like that's, that's a total conception of the world. It's balanced. It's like, yeah, we should preserve nature, but good God, it is trying to kill us. And you know, yes, our culture is tyrannical and oppresses people, but it is protecting us from dying. That's helpful. You know, and yes we're reasonably good people but like don't take that theory too far until you've tested yourself and you know, that's wisdom at least in part. And that's what these stories try to teach you.

Speaker 3:          01:26:33       There is a nice mythological representation. I love this one. It's like the dome of the known and the seeker looking outside, you know, that's a metaphysical representation, you know, and that is the world is, it looks to us, right? You go out in the field and it looks like there's a dome covering it. It's a circle, a big circle with a dome over it. And you know what's outside the Dome while the unknown, right? That's where heaven is theoretically, you know, it's a projection. Obviously heaven is in the unknown. Well, it was localized in space. I suppose that's partly because when people looked up in the sky, they were overwhelmed with all. So it's a reasonable conclusion.

Speaker 4:          01:27:13       It,

Speaker 3:          01:27:15       it's a projection of an unconscious presupposition. It's a projection of fantasy, you know, heaven is a fantasy and, and I'm not denigrating fantasy by the way, and it's projected imaginatively onto the sky. And that's part of the way you discover what's in your fantasy. Well, this is us, man. We mediate between chaos and order and you know, those are the two archetypal representations fundamentally, you know, um, and I think they apply to both genders. You know, like women can act as the individual who holds the world on his or her shoulders and males. Men can play a maternal role, you know, feet, female, human beings are quite masculine and male. Human beings are quite feminine and so, you know, maybe maybe this archetype dominates among men in that archetype dominates among women, which I would say is that is the case as far as I'm concerned, although they're in our individual conceptions, of course those two things have to work in conjunction, but that's you, the eternal mediator between chaos and order, which also has its enemy. So that's, that's horace there. And that seth who's eventually turns into Satan as the, as the west progresses, so to speak, and that's represented there as well. The temptations of I would say resentment and hatred, which everyone has to fight with all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:28:49       Alright. Initiations. So this is cool. This is a standard hero story. And initiate initiatory rights are a part of human heritage. And so let's take a look. This is from Eliana. I would like even now stress the fact that the psychopathology of the romantic vocation is not profane, it does not belong to ordinary symptomatology. It's not mental illness, it has an ent initiatory structure and signification. In short, it reproduces a traditional mystical pattern. The total crisis of the future Sharman sometimes leading to complete disintegration of the personality and to madness can be evaluated not only as an initiatory death, but also as a symbolic return to the pre cosmogony chaos to the amorphous and indescribable state that precedes any cosmogony. While what he means by that is that I suppose the mythological view of the emergence of order that's a cosmogony is that there's a state of potential and chaos out of which order emerges.

Speaker 3:          01:29:47       And I, you know, here's, here's how it is that you think that way because you do think that way. So you know, imagine what you're facing when you're facing the future, right? While you might say, well, the future is full of potential, right? It's full of potential. What the hell does that mean? You know, you act as if that you act as if that potential is really a real thing and you're confronting it all the time. I'm confronting the potential of the future. Well, it doesn't exist yet, so what you're confronting doesn't even really exist. What you're conceptualizing doesn't really exist and in some sense you bring it into being by plotting your path through it, while the pre cosmo going to chaos is the same as the potential of the future, it's exactly the same idea. It's the realm of possibility from which actuality emerges and you participate in turning that possibility into actuality.

Speaker 3:          01:30:42       That's what you're doing all the time. Now, can I explain that? Well, no. I have no idea how consciousness and the substrate of the world interact. I can only say that that's how it looks. That's how it feels. You know, that's how people act and they'll get into trouble if they don't manifest their potential, whatever that is. That's all those things you could be that you're not well, where are those? It's just potential. While that's the chaos, this is a. that's the. I would say that's the cosmos. That's the cosmos that you live in all the time. It's a little story. It's the thing that you extract out of the chaos. It sorta consists of your conception of where you are now and your conception of where you want to be at some point could be 10 minutes, could be three years it has. You can slide it and then you have a little plan about how you should move your body to transform one into the other.

Speaker 3:          01:31:44       That's your action pattern. That's a little story and when you ask someone to say what they were up to, they'll tell you a little story like that. You know, I was at someplace and I went somewhere else and here's how I did it. Then they might tell you more interesting story, which is I was someplace and something happened that I really didn't expect and it knocked me for a loop, you know, and that's a good divorce story. I came home one night and my wife was gone. It's like, yeah, chaos and probably a bit of willful blindness proceeding it. We might suspect anyways down into chaos and then, well maybe you learn something down there and maybe you don't, but hopefully you do and you put yourself together if you're lucky, and then pop bang, you pop up into another little structure of order and that's an initiatory process.

Speaker 3:          01:32:35       It's like you're somewhere stable, falls apart, or maybe you break it apart on purpose. You do it voluntarily. You know people do that all the time. You know they do that. For example, when they experiment with drugs and they do that when they go on wild adventures and you know when they break themselves out of their normal routine and throw themselves somewhere, they don't understand and hope that that's going to produce a transformation of personality. That's the basic story. That's the initiatory story. Now, this is William James who was the one of the established rules of modern psychology and I kind of an odd guy. He was an early experimenter with psychedelics. Of course, they'll never tell you that, but he was and he has. His drug of choice was nitrous oxide, which is an inhalent gas, which seems to be inert. No one really knows why it works, but it produces quite intense, a hallucinogenic experience, mystical experience.

Speaker 3:          01:33:31       Although if you breathe too much of it, then you die because it doesn't. It doesn't have any oxygen in it, so, so don't do that. And, and he wrote some really bad hippie poetry back in the 18 eighties. Well, he was, you know, experimenting with, with nitrous oxide is. I'll read a little bit of that too. You pure experiences. The name which I give to the original flux of life before reflection has categorized it. Only newborn Babes and persons in semi coma from sleep, drugs, illnesses or blows can have an experience pure in the literal sense of, of that which is not yet any definite, what they'll ready to be, any sorts of what's fourth full, both of oneness and of many dentists, but in respects that don't appear changing throughout yet. So confusedly that it's phases, interpenetrate and no points either of distinction or of identity can be caught.

Speaker 3:          01:34:26       Nineteen. Oh, five William James, Journal of Philosophy. You know, a lot of these old guys that established what we regard as fairly stable bodies of knowledge were just as crazy as you can possibly imagine. They're just the most peculiar damn people and they get sanitized, you know, as, as they are represented in history and that's no fun. You know? I mean, it's much more interesting to know what they were like. They were just so bloody peculiar and strange and involved in all sorts of weird things. It's a lot more fun to know that. Here's his poem. Wow. Like right from 1968, no verbiage can give it because the verbiage is other incoherent, coherent, same, and it fades and it's infinite and it's infinite. Don't you see the difference? Don't you see the identity constantly? Opposites united, the same me telling you to write and not to right? Extreme, extreme, extreme something and other than that thing, intoxication and otherness than intoxication. Every attempt at betterment, every attempted other month is a. It fades forever and forever as we move, it's like it's just about as incoherent as postmodernist philosophy.

Speaker 3:          01:35:44       So we know for archaic and traditional cultures that are symbolic return to chaos is equivalent to preparing a new creation. It follows that we may interpret the psychic chaos of the future Sharman as a sign that the profane man is being dissolved and a new personality being prepared for birth transformation. Here's a way of thinking about it. Paradise, Paradise lost redemption. Classic story of mankind always. There was a great past. We're in a state of chaos. We're heading towards a better future. Everyone thinks that way. The stories are based on that all that's that. Now ellenberger who, who wrote a lot about the psychoanalysts believed that Freud and young in particular how to create an illness which he regarded as this sort of spontaneous shamonic transformation, and he said a creative illness has these elements. It follows, succeeds a period of intense preoccupation with an idea and search for certain truth.

Speaker 3:          01:36:43       It's a polymorphous condition that can take the shape of depression, neurosis, psychosomatic ailments or even psychosis. Young was in that state when he wrote this book called the Red Book, which was just released last year, which is full of visionary illustrations and and it's very strange poetry and it contains the, the communications he had with imaginative beings that he conjured up when, when practicing, doing exactly that. He practiced that for years and he had these autonomous beings manifest themselves in his fantasy and had long conversations with them, which is, you know, while he was working as a doctor and having a sane, normal life and well it's Kinda, well, it's really something. Whatever the symptoms, they're felt as painful while he thought maybe he was going mad and some people think he did, if not agonizing by the subject, with alternating periods of alleviation and worsening throughout the illness. The subject never loses. The thread of is dominating preoccupation. It's often compatible with normal professional activity and family life, but even if he keeps to his social activities, he's almost entirely absorbed with himself. He suffers feelings of isolation even when he has a mentor who guides them through the ordeal like the and apprentice with his master. The termination is often rapid and marked by a phase of exhilaration. The subject emerges from his ordeal with a permanent transformation in this personality and a conviction that he has discovered a great truth or a new spiritual world.

Speaker 3:          01:38:17       Many of the 19th and 20th century figures regarded universally as great niche, a Darwin, Dostoevsky, tolstoy, Freud Young. We're all additionally characterized by lengthy periods of profound psychological unrest and uncertainty. Well, you don't generate a new theory without some birth pangs, right? Because you're all theory has to bite the dust first. And when you're old theory bites the dust. It's like, where are you? You don't know. Do you know if you're going to come up with a new one? No.

Speaker 3:          01:38:48       Here's a cool thing. This is my daughter. She was five years at this point. She was playing prince or princess with Julia and her three year old. She said, dad, if we killed the dragon, we could use his skin, his armor. Wouldn't that be a good idea? I thought, hey, yeah, that's, that's a hell of an idea, kid. You know, you go right after the thing that frightens you the most and you develop something that protects you from doing that. It's like, where did she get that idea? Well, good work Kiddo. She had plenty of dragons in her life, so

Speaker 3:          01:39:22       the following dream was described by my daughter Mckayla. Three years, nine months old, above my son Julian. One year, Julian was in the process of toilet training and rapid speech development was having some trouble controlling his emotions. MCKAYLA liked to call him baby. We had several discussions about the fact that he wasn't really a baby anymore. She told me this story while I was at the computer, so I was able to get it verbatim. She wasn't very happy with the idea that he wasn't a baby anymore because she kind of liked her. The baby. She took care of that baby you lot and her little brain was having a hard time with the notion that whatever that thing is now it isn't a baby. It's like, well, where's my baby? And believe me, plenty of mothers go through the same thing. Then they attempt to keep their children babies for the rest of their lives, so this is what Mikayla said, the dream.

Speaker 3:          01:40:05       Julian's eyes fell out and then he falled into pieces. I said, what sort of pieces? She said, Julian pieces and the bones fold out to then a whole God, him and there was water in it and when he came out he was big mom. Julian isn't a baby anymore. No, he's a big boy and a bug with legs go out. I'm out cause bugs can swim and the hole was in the park and it moved into the backyard and he fall into it. A tree burned and left the whole. I thought, wow, that's so amazing. It's like it was a. It was a shamanic transformation dream. It was like the tree that's the tree of life had burnt and left a hole. The kid fell. Intuitive, dissolved them right down to his bones. This little bug, which would be a union representation of the self, like Jimminy cricket, by the way, in Pinocchio. The bug was the thing that was alive that helped them through the transformation. He stepped out and now he was big. It's like that was her little brain conjuring up the notion of radical transformation. So this is cool. I hope this works. This is a dream that my nephew had. Someone animated

Speaker 5:          01:41:11       Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychologist from the University of Toronto. Do disagree with some of those fundamental ideas. Put his thoughts and fixing problems. Merge with my stomach values within one of his maps of meaning lectures. He tells a true story about a four year old boy, his nephew who for months was suffering from terrible night terrors, terrors that were waking him up, screaming. This boy, by the way did have some areas of instability in his family life, Jordan versus the young boys hosts and the boy was running around, dressed as a need with a sword, a shield, and a helmet. At nighttime, he would take a sword and shield to bed. So Jordan goes back into him and the boy described his dream and the dream. He's standing thrown by me. Hey dwarves. These dwarves had beaks and every time you were trying to move the doors would jump up and Beta and very fretting scenario for a young boy, and if you look behind all the doors away in, up back, there was a dragon, and every time this dragon with puff owed fire and smoke, more dwarves will be created so there's no point fighting off the doors because more would just be made.

Speaker 5:          01:42:20       So Jordan tapped him and asked, what could you do about that? So the kid says he could jump up in the dragon's head, could put a's with a sword, but he couldn't see. Then he could go during the route to the box where the fire came, chrome, carve a piece out of that box, thereby destroying it and use that pieces of sheet. The change before Jordan a was already acting out in life. What he knew he had to do, and after that conversation he had no more nightmares. This is what Marcus really is meant when he said the impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes a way. He was telling us that we must not shy away from problems or shutting our personal responsibility. You must be willing to sacrifice or conference who does Roseboro problems to solve them and then take something away.

Speaker 3:          01:43:14       Well, there you go. So yeah, he was waking up screaming at night for, for weeks, the night terrors. He couldn't really remember what the hell was going on and there was instability in his family. His parents got divorced soon after and he was off to kindergarten and that was kind of destabilizing them too. And so it was fun to watch him zip around as a night. It's like, where do you get that idea? Well, you know, he watched TV, watched movies. He is a little imagination. Was aggregating the picture of the hero and then he was trying to act it out. That's what he was doing, pretending right. I'm pretending to be the thing that takes on the unknown. And then he has this amazing dream. It's like it's mind boggling. It's so sophisticated. It's like, well, here I am and there's troubles everywhere and they're biting me. They're jumping up on me and it's like a hydra, you know, in the Hydra, you cut off a hydros head and seven more heads grow. It's like, that's life, man. Solve one problem, seven more appear. Right? So also that was the dragon at the background. Chaos itself and chaos kept breeding

Speaker 3:          01:44:20       these evil little dwarfs, which is what it does. It's like it's one damn trouble after another. You fight this one off, fight this one off. It's like, who cares? The Dragon? The dwarf generating machine is still working in the background. So He. I asked him and that was purposeful. What could you do? See that's a leading question that implies that there's something that he could do. He said, well, I take my dad that was missing in the animation and we'd go, well, poke to drag. It's always out. Go right down to the source of the problem, extinguish it, make a shield. Right? So that meant that he would have strengthened his character by the encounter. So brilliant. And then I talked to his mom for months afterwards, done no more night terrors. What had happened. Yeah, identified with the mythological hero. He identified with St George and the dragon he identified with that little bloody tree dwelling primate who 20 million years ago was the first one to drop a stick on a snake. He adopted the classic human mode of being in the face of uncertainty and construed himself as that which could prevail. End of terrors. Well,

Speaker 3:          01:45:40       I guess we're done a.

Speaker 6:          01:45:45       So we're going to do something a little different than the syllabus today because we've got this one hour, two hour problem and I already can't cover constructionism reasonably in two hours or one hour that was supposed to be today. So I'm going to do instead is continue on the line that I've been pursuing, but I'm going to expand it up more into union psychology, which is the what we're going after after constructivism anyways. And so I can weave the constructivism and the depth psychology together and it's nice to do that because it gives you a kind of a coherent view. So just so you know, we're, we're one lecture ahead at the moment, roughly speaking. And I'll do constructivism on Tuesday for two hours. So. All right. So I showed you that enemy animation I told you about my nephew, his dream, which is a remarkable dream, you know, really, it's just amazing, amazing dream and it's got this archetypal pattern.

Speaker 6:          01:46:40       The pattern is that there's a threat and worse than that, that there's, there are threats and at the back of it, there is that the fact of threat itself. You see, so human beings, we're so smart. Hey, so this is so amazing that we figured this out. So you imagine, well human beings are the only creatures that can really conceive of the class of all threatening things right now. It's kind of why we can be permanently anxious. There's. So it's sort of annoying. So you know, here you are and it's safe. There's no lions here or a or anything that might prey on you, but you can think of something to be anxious about. No problem. You know, I'm, I'm certain you've got some little skeleton rattling around in your closet somewhere that's like eating away at you. And so I think part of the reason we're so damn awake human beings is because we're always anxious, like, and you have to be awake when you're anxious and the anxiety system actually activates your reticular activating system and that, that, that actually produces.

Speaker 6:          01:47:46       It's the substrate for consciousness. If you snap a few fibers in the back of your brain that are part of the reticulating activating reticular activating system in a car accident or something, you'll go into a coma and that'll be that you're in, you're not getting out of it. It doesn't take much of an injury either in the right place. So anyways, so human beings have been struggling with this problem of threat forever. A really for as long as there's been life or at least as long as there's life with a nervous system. And you know, that's several hundred million years. It's a long time. And of course

Speaker 6:          01:48:19       it's easy to, you know, to respond to a particular threat. Think about zebras, they're out there on the belt and there's lions everywhere, right? But the zebras are like, they're calm because there's lions are sleeping. And so the zebras don't think apparently, oh my God, what was going to happen with those lions wake up because they don't think that way. You know, they're not going to be happy if the line goes into a hunting crouch and starts it's hunting approach obviously, but it's not like the zebras are freaking out nonstop because there are lions around, you know, so they can react to specific threats. But human beings, partly because we discovered the future, which was a big mistake, it was a big mistake because the future is an uncertain place. We realized that, well, there isn't any threat right now, but there might well be some tomorrow and if there isn't some tomorrow, well maybe next week or next month or next year.

Speaker 6:          01:49:11       Like it's common. And so there's danger. So it's the category of danger, you know, and out of the category of danger emerged specific threats. And the dragon seems to be a symbol of it is a symbol I believe, of the ever present fact of predatory, slightly predatory threat. But our nervous systems as they've become capable of abstraction, have used that underlying architecture to represent more abstract category, so it's not the, it's not a Predator like a dragon is not a Predator because there are no dragons, but maybe a dragon is a snake and a and a crocodile and maybe a leopard and maybe a, a predatory bird all mangled into one monster. A monster is actually technically something that's made out of disparate parts. And so it's a good symbolic representation for the unknown as such that which lies beyond the campfire, let's say, and what lurks out there.

Speaker 6:          01:50:08       And so the eternal problem is what the hell do you do with the Dragon? And that also explains why the dragon typically is at treasure guarder right? Because it's even more, the problem is even worse out there in no man's land out there in potential there's threat and, and, and like mortal threat. But there's also endless opportunity and riches and wealth and, and, and the possibility of attracting someone and all of that. And so while the dragon, you can't just be afraid of it, you just stay in your burrow the whole time. And lots of animals more or less do that is, you know, especially the nocturnal ones, they just hide away. But that isn't what human beings are light because we're not only praying animals, we're also predators. And then of course we're crazy. We're absolutely insane. Chimpanzees, right? We're crazy. And so we're always out there mucking about with things and with our fingers and our thumbs and, and taking the world apart and putting it back together.

Speaker 6:          01:51:03       And we're crazily exploratory and troublemaking. And so we don't just run from dragons, we go hunt them down. And so and so there's a story here, there's the oldest story that mankind knows and literally it is the oldest story that we know is this stories. And the story basically is there's a bounded space, a walled garden, a walled city in, on all the original cities were walled because if they weren't, barbarians would swoop in and they just steal all your stuff. And so, you know, that was kind of pointless. So you know you wanted to have some major league walls surrounding your territory, so that's inhabited space and inside that is your little dominance hierarchy and so all you primates knew exactly who was who inside that space so you didn't have to fight with each other and you could predict each other's behavior because you believed the same things and saw the world roughly the same way and acted the same way and so you were sort of secure.

Speaker 6:          01:51:59       But then the problem is is that that can always be breached. There's always something outside of it that's a danger, and so that's signified by this, this little creature here is this dragon and that that twirl in its tail is very common among dragons. It's actually, it's actually a symbol because imagistic languages, images to symbols have an ancient language and it. It's referring to something that's basically eternal and see it lives down here in this, in this cave, because it's an underground thing, it's an underground thing and you can kind of imagine what that's like and sometimes this happens in initiation rituals among archaic people. They're gonna win. They're going to initiate. Usually the young men, because nature initiates women all by itself, I'm usually the young men, maybe they'll put them in cave and leave them there, you know, for like, well, who knows, who knows how long, and so you've got to think what's in the cave.

Speaker 6:          01:52:52       Caves are dark man. I don't know if you've ever been in one, but like they're dark and they're really dark and so not only is there whatever there is in the cave and you don't know what the hell is in the cave. There's whatever you imagine might be in the cave. And so when you're in that cave and you're alone, you, you're confronting the devils and demons and monsters of your own imagination, you know, and so then you have a chance to perhaps deal with that and overcome it. And that's perhaps part of the initiation ceremony, you know, and that's part of growing up because you have to learn how to face the things that terrify and upset you and, and re cast them and put them back together. We talked a little bit about this idea of the pre cosmo Gona chaos that, um, that, uh, Eliana refers to an end.

Speaker 6:          01:53:38       That's the stuff out of which order is produced at the beginning of time and it's also the stuff out of which you constantly reproduce order and the unions, the psychoanalysts, especially the really deep psychoanalysts like young Freud was a more surface psychoanalyst and that's not an insult. There's some things that Freud figured out there is absolutely amazing. He was a precursor to young for sure for young. The Hero's journey was the journey inside the unconscious and that would be perhaps in some sense that the, the willingness to face everything terrible that's happened to you and to think it through and to articulate it and to come to grips perhaps with your own capacity for malevolence. That was a really important part of union ideas. That the first step towards individuation, which is the manifestation of your full self, let's say, was the discovery of your shadow and your shadow is the part of you that will do terrible things under the right circumstances.

Speaker 6:          01:54:34       And maybe even without that much provocation. And you know, and it's a terrifying part of you to come into contact with because it sort of, it sort of the way that you're specifically attached to the archetype of evil now it's like that's a good way of thinking about it. And you know, modern people, they don't really think much about the bunch of both the idea of good and evil, but that's because they're, most of them are so damn naive, you can just barely even comprehend it. You know, if you read any history, if you really read it like, and you, and you don't come away with the idea that evil exists. It's like you're just reading the wrong kind of history. You know, it's just unbelievable what people can do to each other. And we're so imaginative, you know, and one of the things I figured out about people, the reason that we're, we have the knowledge of good and evil, let's say, is that because we're self conscious and we know about ourselves, we know about our own vulnerability, right?

Speaker 6:          01:55:27       You know what hurts you. You really know what hurts you way more than an animal notes. And so, and you're also creative and so once you know what hurts you, man, you can really hurt someone else and you can do it in such a creative way. You can draw it out, you can make it excruciating. You can take people apart physically and psychologically and you can keep them say even right on the edge of death so that you can keep doing that endlessly. And you know that happens a hell of a lot more than you think. It happens. It happens a lot and so well. And you think, well, you know, that doesn't involve me. It's like, Oh yes it does, man. That's the problem because you know you're human and that's the sort of things that human beings are capable of or not. I'm not saying you're all, it's all probable that you do that ever or or that, but I'm saying that, you know, you gotta take that into account when you're looking at the world and you think about all the perpetrators out there.

Speaker 6:          01:56:21       It's like, it's not like there's perpetrators and their victims. That isn't how it works. It doesn't work that way at all. And so the horrors of humanity as well as the noble elements of humanity are all elements of your central being and for young, and this is the terrible thing for using the pathway to higher wisdom was through the terrible portal of while you could say hell for that matter. Really. And so who wants to do that? Man? It's like no, you know, like maybe you're resentful about something. Well you probably are because like everybody's resentful about something you know, and resentment is just vicious emotion. It's really useful. It's really useful because if you're resentful about something, it either means that you should grow the hell up and accept the responsibility and quit sniveling around and whining or it means that someone actually is oppressing you and, and pushing on you too hard and bullying you and demeaning you and you have something to say or do that you're not saying or doing and no wonder you're not saying or doing it because you know it can be really dangerous to say things or do them to free yourself from, from being oppressed.

Speaker 6:          01:57:31       You can get it a lot of trouble in the short term. For doing it so it's easier just to not say anything sort of day after day in the short term you protect yourself but just crushes you. And then the resentment comes up and resentment. Man, that can just get so out of hand. You know, it starts with resentment and then it starts. It goes to the desire for revenge. You know, because you'll play nasty little tricks on the person that's oppressing you at any chance. You'll talk about them behind their back and if they want you to do something, you'll do it badly. Or you'll do it grudgingly. Or you'll do a half rate job and you'll set up little traps and you know, so it puts you in a poisonous space. And then if that, if you really start to dwell on that, say in your basement for three or four years about just exactly how terrible the world is and how that's focused on you and how everyone's rejected you.

Speaker 6:          01:58:17       And how you get to this point where you're thinking that, you know, existence itself is a kind of poisonous endeavor. And that the best thing for you to do is go out there and do as much, create as much mayhem as you possibly can, and if you really get to a dark place, you think I'm going to create as much mayhem as I possibly can by targeting the most innocent thing I can possibly imagine. And then you end up shooting kids in Connecticut and that's how you get there. And so that's a bad road man. There's dark things down there, but you can go there and people do and they go through the whole of resentment and resentment can tell you you've got something to say. You bloody well better say it. You've gotta free yourself from what's oppressing you. You have to stand up for that because otherwise you become oppressed.

Speaker 6:          01:59:06       And then once you're oppressed, that's just not so good. And so like in your marriage and your relationships, you gotta tell people what you're thinking. You don't have to assume you're right. That's a whole different story because you're not because you're, you know, ignorant and you're biased and you know, so you're not right, but you can stumble towards Europe, this expression of yourself and then you can listen to the other person and hope that they tell you some way that you're stupid. That's useful so you can be a little less stupid in the future because that wouldn't that be good. And so you know, you go after the unknown. You don't protect what you know. You already know what you know. You go after what you don't know. That's why you have to talk to people you don't agree with. That's why you have to talk to your enemies because they're going to tell you things you don't know.

Speaker 6:          01:59:57       You could even listen to them. It's possibly know a thing or two you don't know, but people don't like that. You know, they just talked to people who think the same way and then they just stay stupid. And so that's. And that's not good because if you're not wise, the world will wall up you. It'll flatten you and, and far more than it has to. And then you'll be bitter and resentful and you'll be part of that force, that wall ups instead of the forest that fights against that. So while, so you go after the dragon and that's what, that's what this guy is doing. He's going after the dragon hint. It's threatening the society because it always does chaos. What's outside of order always threatens order. Always, always. And so you have to step forward, you know, in this manner, voluntarily and, and, and go after that when it's still manageable.

Speaker 6:          02:00:47       Right? And that's the case in your own life too. So you know, if you're, if you've had a proclivity to be bullied in the past, you know, and you want to get out of that, what you have to do is you have to make yourself awake to the, to the, to the, to the, what would you say to the, to the initial stages of that sort of bullying emerging in your life. Again, that sort of domination. And you have to step forward against it when it's still in its developing stages. Because maybe you can just not have it happen. That would be better. And so you have to be ready to speak what you have to say more or less on a moment's notice. You, you can't be impulsive about, you know, like if you and I are talking and you make a mistake or I make a mistake, even if it's bothers one or the other of us, we should just write it off because it's like one encounter, what the hell, you know, maybe we had a bad night's sleep or something, you know, so you've got to be a little forgiving.

Speaker 6:          02:01:42       But if it happens twice then you know you should be a little awake and you should remember both times. And then if it happens a third time, it's like that's when you, that's when you act and you say, look, we talked and this happened. And I thought yeah, whatever. And then you did it again and then you just did it again. Well then the person who is basically like, what are they going to do? You know? No, well maybe they might argue with you, but you kind of got them and you're generally. If you just point that out to people just like that, just that you noticed and are willing to say something about it, they'll back the hell off. They'll often apologize and sometimes you even make them a little more conscious, which is like, hey, that's not such a bad idea. That's what all this means.

Speaker 6:          02:02:25       And so this caught this chaos idea. It's so for union, it was the unconscious, right? It was the contents of your unconscious and so that might be the unknown past that threatening past that you have never dealt with might be the threatening future. It might be too threatening present, but you realized as his, as he got older that that the unconscious was also the world when you think, and so the chaos is not only your unconscious mind which meets the unknown, but it's actually the unknown itself mingled together and you think, well, what the hell does that? That's why the dragon is a land creature in an error creature. It's matter and spirit at the same time, and this sort of gets us into constructivism because the constructivists think that basically what happens is that you encountered those elements of the world that don't fit into your theory and out of those new elements you make the world through your perceptions and you make yourself by incorporating the information and transforming yourself and that's how piaget explains the development of a child.

Speaker 6:          02:03:23       If the child starts out with some reflexes, basic reflexes and manifesting the reflex is produces results in the world, and then the child has to reorganize its perceptions to take into account the transformations and so then it, it gets a little more sophisticated and then it can do a few more things and then it can manifest more changes in the world and then it modern. It attracts them and modifies its perceptions and actions to account for them and it just keeps doing that and that's how the child boots itself up like a computer does. It's a very cool idea. And so from from the Piagetian stance, so it's constructive. The stance you could think of the world as a latent pool of information, it's something like that with a structure obviously, that you can interact with with your little fingers in your body and your mind and your eyes and your mouth and you make changes happen and you track them and you've modeled them and you build your skills and as you continue to do that in the safety of your house initially under the care of your parents who, who fill in where you're ignorant, you, you, you just emerge more and more competent and confident and ready to move ahead.

Speaker 6:          02:04:30       So that's, that's how the constructivist idea works. And so, so there's kind of a chaos id at the bottom of that, which is that out of which you emerge and the world emerges at the same time because you know you don't see reality. Not at all. You see almost like an animated version of reality. You know, like when I look at you, I just see the front of you. I just see the outside of the US EU at this height. I don't see any of your internal structure. I don't see the back part of you at all. I don't see your family. I don't see your history. I don't see your future. You know, I just see this slice of you. You're so complicated. I just see this little like oversimplified slice of you right now and I think that's the reality and it's, it's, it's sort of the reality, the way that the simpsons, a simpsons character is you.

Speaker 6:          02:05:19       It's like it's sort of like you and it's enough so that you can watch the story, but the real you man, God only knows what that is and that's a union idea. You know that the real you is something that radically transcends your perception of yourself or your conception of yourself and that you get to that hire you at least in part by going into the darkest place. And so it's a hell of an idea, man. It's really. But it's the old idea of initiation. It's as old as time that idea and there's something to it. And we definitely recreate it. And psychotherapy like this isn't an airy theory. It's quite the contrary because what you do and as a psychologist always, always a behaviorist say that the most, the most logical clinical type of psychologist or behaviorist is that an initiatory Sharma and even though he or she doesn't know it because what they do is they say, okay, well let's take a look at your life.

Speaker 6:          02:06:15       Like, okay, you got a bunch of problems and they're like massive dragons and you're just like, you're not going anywhere with those problems here. Just cowering in the corner. And what the behavior therapist does is cut them, cut that dragon into those little dwarfs until the doors are small enough so that you can really kick the hell out of them and so and that by the way they do that is they take the problem and they decompose it into elements that are small enough that you have a reasonable probability of mastering them. So you take the problem apart into intuit's micro problems. Careful, careful analytic process and then you think, okay, well how could we progress a little bit this week? And some of that is to face to practice facing things you're afraid of. So like if your agoraphobic and you can't get on an elevator, you can't get on a taxi and you can't stand up to your husband, and I'm saying husband, because most agoraphobic are women, most of them are middle aged women and most of them were too dependent for most of their life.

Speaker 6:          02:07:12       So that's a monster. It's like society, husband, elevator, taxi, subway. It's a monster and it's that place you will not go and that's because you feel this high and everything else looks this big. And so and partly that's because you've run away and when you run away from something it grows and chases you. Which is, well, it's exactly what happens to a prey animal man. If you go in the woods and you find a bear, especially at Grizzly, while you're in real trouble, if it's a grizzly. But if it's a black bear, you know, generally speaking, if you stand your ground and make a hell of a lot of noise, that thing, we'll leave you alone. But if you run well, what's it supposed to think? It eats things that run from it. So that's exactly where that idea came to come from. You turn tail and run and then the thing that you're afraid of is really a monster and it's gonna get you and eat you.

Speaker 6:          02:08:03       It's like, well that's true psychologically as well and the same circuits that we use to when we were, you know, out in the forest, even even in trees, the same circuits that we used to parse up the world. Then into safe territory and place where the predators loom is the way we parse up the world now, which is safe territory and the place where the predators loom. It's just become abstracted way up, abstracted way up. So. But it's the same damn circuits. We know this like the same circuits you use to forage for information. Just dopaminergic circuit is the circuit that squirrels used to forage for nuts and you think, well why? Well it's because there's no difference between information and food. Like you trade information for food all the time. That's what you're doing when you're working, especially if you're working on a computer.

Speaker 6:          02:08:53       So the idea that there's, there's an equation between information and food. It's like, well, obviously obviously there's an equation between them, so of course you'd use the same circuits and I mean the damn squirrel has to remember where the nuts are and so for him information is food. Even so in what happened to human beings is that we started thinking, Hey, maybe it's better to go after information than it is to go after food because going after inflammation produces more food than just going after food. And so that was a pretty damn smart idea. So we're still doing that. So anyways, this is what you're supposed to be doing. And so, and this is what behavior therapists do, they decompose your problems. What are you afraid of? Well, okay, you're afraid of everything. Well, let's get something specific you're afraid of. Well, I'm afraid of an elevator.

Speaker 6:          02:09:41       Okay. An elevator. So I have a client, she's afraid of elevators. The elevator door opened. She goes, that's a tube. And I thought, oh wow. I thought it was an elevator, but for you it's not a bloody elevator. It's death. And so that's what you're afraid of. It's worse than that. You're afraid of being trapped inside there in the dark alone, alone, not knowing if anyone is going to rescue you, stuck there with your damn imagination freaking out. It's like, and if that's not, and then maybe you have a heart attack because you're so terrified and you die. It's like, you know, so that's the elevator. Well, it's no bloody wonder. No one's going to get into something like that. And then maybe underneath that is your distrust in the mechanisms of society, right? Because you know a normal person that was weird creatures, they'll get an elevator. What the hell? They don't care. And partly it's because they have an implicit belief. Even if the thing stops, somebody will come along and rescue them and usually you don't even think about it, right? It's like, wow, what the hell? It's an elevator. It's like

Speaker 6:          02:10:43       the danger is invisible to you

Speaker 6:          02:10:46       and it's partly because you implicitly trust the structure and so maybe you go into the unconscious presuppositions of the person who is terrified of the elevator in the subways and you find out they have a real problem with trusting authority. That's partly why they don't get along with her husband, why they'd never been able to stand up for themselves, so then you say, okay, well you're afraid of the damn elevator, but it's not an elevator. It's a tomb and the tomb is partly you and partly it's partly the elevator and partly your unconscious mind and so well, what can you handle? Can you go and look at an elevator from 10 feet away? It's like, yes. Okay. How about nine feet away? Yes. Five feet. Yes. Four feet? No. Okay. No problem. Four and a half feet. We're going to go from that elevator and we're going to look at the damn thing until you're bored of it because that's what we're trying to.

Speaker 6:          02:11:33       You should be board of the elevator because then you're not afraid of it. Obviously. It's like it's an elevator. You just don't notice it. Right? All of these things around here that you don't notice. I'd take you out of here to ask you what color the walls are. You haven't gotten any idea. You know, I, I suspect for most of you there's not a chance you'd be able to identify the gender of the person who's sitting next to you unless you know them. It's like you just don't remember anything and why should you? Everything works like you don't have to pay attention to it. It's like,

Speaker 6:          02:12:05       does that stay up? Yeah, it's still off. Yeah. Still up. Still up. It was like, really? No, you know, you get bored of that real quick and so then you just ignore it and. But the agoraphobic has had that veil of ignorance torn away and what they see behind it is mortal threat and so that's really what you're helping them deal with. And so this week there are four and a half feet from the elevator. Next week they're a foot from the elevator and the week after that, the horrible gates of hell open and they look inside and they don't run. And so, hey, they're tougher than they thought they were. And that's what you're teaching them. Actually. You're not teaching them that the world isn't dangerous because that's a stupid thing to teach someone bloody right. The world is dangerous. It's terrifying and sometimes people under a realize that and the veil lifts and they see horror everywhere.

Speaker 6:          02:12:55       They see that and then they think, well, I'm just a little rabbit. I'm over here in the corner. I can't move. I'm petrified. And then they can't move. They hide it home. They cower at home because everything has become a predatory domain and so what you teach them is you're not as much of a rabbit as you think, and part of that is that you help them grow some teeth so that they can go home and have that fight with their husband that they should have had 25 years ago and it happens very frequently with agoraphobic clients that you get them so they can go on the damn elevator and they can go on the subway and they can take a taxi. Maybe they learned to drive, wow. That get some upon me and then there are a little tougher and so then they can stand up from the for themselves and they go back and like their husband might not be very happy with any of this really.

Speaker 6:          02:13:43       It depends on what sort of guy he is. You know, if he's a real tyrant, he might be just perfectly happy that he's married to someone who was afraid of her own shadow because then she won't ever leave and so that's a nasty little story and believe me, it's not uncommon. So she gets tougher by facing what she fears and what she finds out is there's a hell of a lot more to her than she thought. And that's really what happens when you do behavior therapy with someone who's agoraphobic. It isn't really that they get less afraid. It's that they get braver. That's way different. It's because brave is alert and able to cope. Naive is there's no danger. It's like hell yeah, right. There's no danger. Jesus. What a stupid theory that is. So anyways, that's what all this is. That's, that's the story man.

Speaker 6:          02:14:30       And it's a. it's a major story. It's the story of human transformation and growth. It's the evolved evolution of mankind. It's like it's a major story and we've been working on the damn thing for like God only knows how long, you know. Snakes and primates, coevolved and our vision are sharp, Sharp, sharp vision seems to have been an evolutionary adaptation forced on us by the presence of predatory snakes and we're talking tens of millions of years ago and human beings have unbelievably sharp eyesight. The only thing that can see us as birds of prey and they have like an eagle, a bald eagle has eyes as big as ours, and it has to phobias that phobia is the central part of the vision. So an eagle is all eyes man, and so, but human beings, we're kind of like that too. And like half our brain is devoted to visual processing.

Speaker 6:          02:15:24       We have acute vision in Madagascar where there are primates with no predatory snakes. They're lemurs. They can't see worth a damn. And I'm an anthropologist named Lynn. Isabelle did a comprehensive study worldwide trying to account for the acuity of primate vision. And what she found was that the more predatory snakes in the vicinity, the sharper the eyesight of the primates, and so we have a really sharp eyesight, so that means a lot of us were eaten by snakes and none of your ancestors, fortunately because otherwise you wouldn't be here, but a lot of those who fell by the wayside were snake snack and you know, when you're little and living in a tree, a snake is no damn joke. And even now with lots of people get bitten by snakes and people are phobic of snakes at quite a rate. And some of that actually seems innate.

Speaker 6:          02:16:11       There's arguments about cycling between psychologists about this, but even the ones who don't accept the fact that it's innate, except the fact that you can make someone afraid of a snake by conditioning just like that, we're trying to make them afraid of a flower by conditioning is really, really hard. So we're at least at minimum prepared to be afraid of snakes minimum. And I believe it's. I don't, I believe that fear is actually innate, although you can learn to control it. So anyways, so that's that story and like what a story man, so amazing, amazing story. You see the Dan of the dragon here is littered with skulls and bones. That's what that is. So the, the thing is no joke, it's like look the hell out and that's this, you know, and look it up on the top right hand corner there. You know, that's from Peter Pan, right?

Speaker 6:          02:16:59       All you remember, Captain Hook, we talked about him already. He's a tyrant and he's a tyrant because he's afraid of death and that's all he sees in life. And so it makes them cruel and bitter and death has already taken part of it, right? That's why he has a hook and that damn crocodile's chasing him, tick, tick, tick, tick all the time. And of course that's the same situation. You're all in, man. There's a crocodile with a clock in its stomach chasing you and it could easily turn you into a tyrant. It can turn you into a tyrant or a cowering victim or a hero. Those are the options fundamentally. So that's the Gorgon looking at her own, the Medusa, looking at her own reflection, you know, mother nature with a head full of snakes, you know, a terrifying vision and that's actually to some degree in archetype that men get confused with women and you know, that's the witchy part of women and that's the part that's attractive, attractive, attractive, but rejecting, rejecting, rejecting.

Speaker 6:          02:17:51       It's so many men are petrified by women. They won't approach them at all. They have no idea how to talk to them. They're just petrified into immobility and that's way more common than you think. And so that breeds resentment. Like you wouldn't believe, you know, you'll hear the guy who shot up like, um, Dawson College. It's like, what the hell do you think motivated him? It's like he, he, that's what he saw and it was because as well he was, my opinion is he was too goddamn useless to be attractive to anyone. And so that's a hell of a place to be in. You know, it's, that's the problem too. If you're chronically rejected by people, it's often because of your own insufficiencies, you know, whether that's cowardice or lack of social skills or whatever it is. It's like you can't just brush it off as, oh, well, you know, no one likes me, but really I'm okay.

Speaker 6:          02:18:39       It's like, no, no, wrong. If everyone rejects you, there's probably something wrong and it's probably deep and difficult and it's gonna be horrible to fix. And so it's, this isn't a trivial problem. It's not a trivial problem at all. And so, you know, that's mother nature for men too, because from the sexual selection point of view, if they, if they're not selected as a mate, nature has taken them out of the game. Right? And so, you know, people don't really like that. They're not that happy without. And so by getting all whiny about it and then getting violent is like, that's just not all. Not really very helpful. Although it's very common. So this is Lynn, Isabelle, and evolutionary arms race between early snakes and mammals triggered the development of improved and large brain in primates. A radical new theory suggests these are old representations.

Speaker 6:          02:19:32       I really liked this one. This is. I don't remember. I think it's Greek, but it doesn't exactly look Greek. It might be older. It doesn't matter. Anyways. You see it's the same thing. Same ideas as as Graham's dream, right? It's like there's this thing that exists, this, this multi-headed snake, and it's got this infinity problem. It's everywhere. That's that little circle down there, and the problem is, well, what do you do with it? You cut off one head, seven more. Grow. That's the eternal problem of life. And the problem is they're there. There is the category of problems in life and it ain't going anywhere. And so the question is, can you deal with the whole category at the same time? That's the thing. That's how to be in the world is to deal with that category all at the same time. And so how did, how did human beings, what did they come up with as a solution?

Speaker 6:          02:20:21       And that's so cool too, because the solution they come up with not only was the heroism that allows you to approach what you're terrified by and what you find offensive and to learn from it, but also the idea of sacrifice and that was played out by cultures everywhere, including human sacrifice. And you think, what the hell was up with those crazy bastard so long ago? They were sacrificing to God's all the time. What kind of clueless behavior was that? Burned something and please God burned something valuable and please God. It's like, what was with that? What were they thinking? Well, they weren't stupid. Those people, if they were stupid, we wouldn't be here. They were not stupid. And believe me, they lived under a lot harsher conditions than we do. So those were some tough people, man. You know, back then you'd last about 15 minutes.

Speaker 6:          02:21:09       So you don't want to be thinking of your ancestors as stupid, like there's no real evidence that we're much different cognitively than we were 150,000 years ago. So anyways, sacrifice. What does that mean? Sacrifice? Well, it's a discovery man. It's the discovery of the future. It's like the future is actually the place where there is threat and it's always gonna be there. So what do you do? You make sacrifices in the present so that the future is better, right? Everyone does that. That's what you're doing right now. That's what you're doing here. That's what your parents are doing. When they pay money to send you to university, they think let you can bargain with reality. It's amazing. You can bargain with reality. You can forestall gratification now and it'll pay off it at it, at a place in time that doesn't even exist yet. It's like, who wouldn't believe that?

Speaker 6:          02:22:03       It's like that's a miracle that that occurs and it's not like people just figured that overnight, you know, we were champs for Christ's sake. Like how are we going to come up with an idea like that? While it's like, well we thought about it for 7 million years and you know, we got to the point where we could kind of act it out, but we didn't know what we were doing, but it was a emerge. It's like a dream. It was so the terror of the future is a dream and the solution to the terror, the dream of the terror of the future is another dream and, and it, it comes out in mythology and in fantasy and in drama where you act out the sacrifice and then it's a step on the way to full understanding. So we can say sacrifice now instead of doing it, you know, although we still do it, it's just not concretized like it used to be.

Speaker 6:          02:22:51       We do it abstractly and we all have faith that it will work, you know, and we also set up our society so that it'll work. And one thing about, you know, I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a variety of reasons, partly because I think it's an, it's an extreme form of cowardice. But anyways, apart from that, no, no, no, no. There's minimal ways that you can set up a society that will work. And so one of them is that this society has to be set up so that your sacrifices will pay off or you won't work and then the society will die. And so it has to make promises. People have to make promises to one another, and that's what money is. Money is a promise that your sacrifice will pay off in the future. That's what money is. And so if the society is stable, you can store up your work right now.

Speaker 6:          02:23:41       You can sacrifice your impulses and you can work and you can store up credit for the future and then you can make the future a better place. But society has to be stable enough to allow for that. Hyperinflation will do you in. So the promise that's implicit in the currency is the promise that what you're doing now will pay off in the future. And if people don't have that promise, then well we know what they do because in in gangs, for example, and say gangs in North America, the time horizon of the gang members shrinks rapidly because they don't really expect to be alive, pat much past 21. And so they get really impulsive and violent and like, why the hell not that's, that's what you do when, when the future doesn't matter, when it's not real, you default back to living in the moment and you take what you can get right now and no wonder because you don't know if you're going to be around in a, in a year and you get whatever you can. Well you can bloody well get it. And that's like anarchy that state. And so you don't want to live in. Some people like to live in that state because they're already wired for that, you know? And so they're, they're much more comfortable in those conditions. They're, they're kind of like warrior types, I would say in some sets. But you know, for most people that's just where that stress, we'll just do 10, you know, the stress of a life like that. So

Speaker 6:          02:25:03       that's a pretty horrible picture. The one on the right I think, and you know, it's creepy picture and don't you think doesn't, it seems like a creepy picture to me. Yeah. And so that's quit silicone oil, if I remember correctly. He was an, he was an Aztec Dragon, God, and that's the eye of horus. By what? By the way, this little thing here, and I'm that. See the Egyptians? They worshiped the I. Yeah. Well that's cool because it. Well, why did they worship the eye? Well, wake the hell up and look at the world. That's your salvation to do that. Pay Bloody attention, especially to the things you don't want to pay attention to and use your vision. Have some vision and you can use your vision to see into the future and that is your. That's your redemption. And the Egyptians, they didn't know how to say that, but they knew how to represent it and that's how they represented it.

Speaker 6:          02:25:52       Like the pupil on that as completely open, completely dilated. And that's a god. As far as the Egyptians were concerned, it's horace. And I'll tell you a horror story at some point. So early primates develop a better eye for color, detail and movement and the ability to see in three dimensions, traits that are important for detecting threats at close range. Humans are descended from these same primates. Alright, so now the initiation way, when you go into psychotherapy or when you make any supreme moral effort, which is roughly the same thing, you have to confront that which you do not know. Now I mentioned the cat called Primo cosmo going to chaos and the idea that at the end of [inaudible] life, he sort of thought of the unconscious and the world as the same and you think, what the hell does that mean? But here's what it means.

Speaker 6:          02:26:39       So let's say you're in a longterm intimate relationship and you get betrayed. Okay? So what is it that you see when you see your partner at the moment, you know of the betrayal? Well, you see the pre cosmogony chaos and here's why. Well it rattles your unconscious up because you don't know anything anymore. You don't know what the past was, right? You don't know what it was and it's supposed to be real and all of a sudden you don't know what it was. And so you come up with wild ideas about what it might have been and what it represented, and then you don't know what the future is going to be anymore. So then your fantasy fills that space and you don't know who the hell you're looking at. That's for sure. And you don't know much about human beings and you certainly don't know anything about yourself.

Speaker 6:          02:27:25       And so all of a sudden, not only is everything in chaos inside your mind, but everything is in chaos in your world. And it actually is. And there's no telling the difference between those two things. You know. And so then you're just sheer shattered. And so then you go talk to a therapist for like two years and you think, what happened? What was the reality? And the reality is because who knows what the reality was like. But as far as you're concerned, the reality is I better represent this properly in my head. I better figure out who I was, who that person was, what we did together, and what it meant. Because I do not want this to happen again. And so you're healed when you get to the point where you've grasped the bloody moral of the story, what went wrong and how can I not have that happen again?

Speaker 6:          02:28:16       Because that's the purpose of learning, right? That's the purpose of memory. It's to prepare you for the future and so you have to pull out of that massive chaos, a functional representation that increases your wisdom so that you're not this naive target. The next time you enter into a relationship, so at least you can have another relationship without being so traumatized that you know you, you're done and you know it can take people years to talk that through because this landscape of potential opens up when when they're betrayed, it's like anything could have been the truth. Well you to sort through that, you have to wander through all that mess and it's really painful and emotional as well. You have to sort through all that mess to come out with the new you, right? The renewed you and so

Speaker 6:          02:29:08       well this is a representation of it. This is how people act this out. By whatever method he may have been designated. The Shaman is recognized as such as only after having received two methods of instruction. The first is ecstatic dreams. Trances envisions. The second is traditional shamonic techniques, names and functions of the spirit, mythology and genealogy of the clan, and the secret language. Well, one of the things that happens, this happens to you even if, if you encounter something terrible like could be trail. What happens is that you have to take a journey into the domain of morality essentially, which is, well, how did I act and how did that person to act and how should have they acted and how should have I acted, and so, and that's part of your cultural structure. And so that's the idea of rescuing the dead father from the depths. Right? And that's what we'll show you some examples of that. So

Speaker 6:          02:30:02       this is a critical issue with regards to the shamanic transformation, is that people go through these terrible, terrible experiences, often drug induced by the way, with regards to the sharp, and they usually use psychedelic chemicals of one form or another, often mushrooms. But uh, but they've come up with some very strange concoctions like Iowasca down in the Amazon and Iowasca has an amazing substance. It's made out of the bark of one thing and another plant whose name I don't remember that hardly even grow in the same place and that has to be cooked together in a special way and no one has any idea how the damn Amazonians figured that out. It looks impossible. And if you ask them, they say, well, the plants told us how to do it, which was western people don't find very helpful, but the Germans are perfectly healthy, happy with that. That description in Iowasca takes them apart and it does that in part because it's effects the serotonergic system very, very powerfully, like all psychedelics do and it transports them to another world and that's how they interpret it. And, and, and,

Speaker 6:          02:31:04       and what we know about psychedelics, you can put it in a thimble and then throw the thimble away. We know nothing about psychedelics. There's new experiments going on at Johns Hopkins, for example, with Psilocybin, which is part of this active chemical in magic mushrooms. Same structure. Basically as LSD and masculine and all the real psychedelics have basically the same structure except the one that's derived from m Anita area, which is called muscular enoch acid and it's a. it's its own weird thing that no one knows anything about. Anyways. They have profound neurochemical effects in very small doses and I'm the research group at Johns Hopkins has given Psilocybin to research subjects, you know, purified been because they started the new experimentation with psychedelics and that's been banned for like 40 years because psychedelics were so terrifying to our culture that we just put them away and it's like, oh no, we're not going there.

Speaker 6:          02:31:54       And so even from a research perspective and even though some of the psychedelics look very promising for the treatment of disorders like alcoholism and they recently used psilocybin to help people stop smoking down at Johns Hopkins and I think they had an 80 percent success rate, which is just like, that's just absolutely mind boggling and so. But if you give people psilocybin and they have a mystical experience, which is very common among people who take these sorts of chemicals, then their personality transforms permanently such that one year later they're one standard deviation, higher in openness and openness is the creativity dimension and that seems to be a permanent transformation. And so that's really remarkable. And about 80 percent of the people who undergo the Johns Hopkins Experiments report that the experience is like one of the two or three most important things they've ever. That's never ever happened to them.

Speaker 6:          02:32:45       And so. Well that's, that's something, you know, it's like. And then there's this guy named Rick straussman down at, I think it was at the University of Texas and he did experimentation with DMT, dmt, dimethyltryptamine I remember if I remember correctly, is the active ingredient in Iowasca and you produce it in your brain and it's in plants. It's like a very common chemical. But DMT is a weird hallucinogen because it has an extraordinary short mechanism of action. It's like, and people who take it report that they're blasted out of their body, like out of a cannon. And then they go out somewhere and encounter beings of various sorts and then 10 minutes later they're back and virtually everyone reports that, which is really strange. And, and so strassman was giving people dmt intravenously so that the trip would last longer. He could, this was all, all, you know, nih funded, uh, experimentation all cleared with the relevant ethics boards all conducted within the last 10 years.

Speaker 6:          02:33:43       And he basically quit doing it because he was a pretty straight scientists, you know, who he was measuring heart rate and pulse and all that sort of thing, trying to look at the physiology. And then the people he was giving these chemicals to kept coming back and telling him these, these crazy stories. And uh, well it just, it was too much for him, you know, and no wonder, you know, because they all said the same thing. And he'd say, well, that was a dream. And they'd say no. And it was the most real thing that ever happened to me. And he'd say, well, you know, it's an architectural experience. And they'd say, no, no, no. That was no archetipal experience. I went somewhere else. And I saw things and I'm back and like, I don't care what you think and like who the hell knows?

Speaker 6:          02:34:21       Right? Because it's all subjective. But, but the weird thing about it is that everyone's reporting the same thing. How the hell do you account for that? And then the shaman, you know, when they take these psychedelic chemicals, they basically say the same thing. They say, well first of all, it more or less killed me. That's this. No, I dissolved to skeleton. And then I climbed a tree that Unites Heaven and earth and I went into the realm of the gods and they gave me some information and I'm back. It's like, okay, well, you know, we don't really know what to make of that. And we. And certainly that's what len describes when he describes the MNEMONIC is romantic procession, not the shamanic initiation. There's dissolution to a skeleton first. And then like a death is symbolic death or experienced as an actual death and then bang up into the realm of the gods and then they come back.

Speaker 6:          02:35:12       It's a very old idea. And that's a medieval representation of the tunnel that people travel through at the end of their life to, you know, to find the light, which is a very common near death experience report. And people don't have any idea what the hell to do with those reports except say, well, it's the paroxysms of the dying brain, which you'd expect to be a hell of a lot more random in my opinion. And the idea is there's a rebirth after that and you know, here this is the Scandinavian representation of that tree that unites Earth with heaven. And so there's the Scandinavian representation. It has a snake snakes down here eating it. And then that's the Amazonian representation. It's like, how the hell do you account for that? I mean, those, those pictures are so similar that it's just, it's beyond belief. Well, you know, we lived in trees for a long time, a long, long, long, long time, millions of years, and there were lots of snakes around them.

Speaker 6:          02:36:09       And so the idea that reality is that tree that's surrounded by a snake that's in us, man, it's down there, it's deep. And there's something about it that's true, not true, like we normally think of truth, but truth true in an entirely different manner. So. And all. That's pretty damn strange. We'll stop with this. My son drew this when he was seven years old. Blew me away man. I thought it was so cool. So I had it laminated. And so here is what it is on the right hand side, that's the order. It's like the Yin Yang thing that's ordered left side chaos, right? And those are all mushroom houses, which I thought was amazing. And then there's this river that runs right down the middle, like the line for order and chaos. And then there's this tree that goes up to heaven and that's having up there.

Speaker 6:          02:36:55       It's like there St Peter, there's the pearly gates, there's the cloud. It's like it's. He never went to church, you know, it's like what the hell? And then there's a little bug there that goes up and down from heaven to earth. And that was him. I thought he had a very organized psyche. That kid, he was a very, very stable kid and still is. And he drew that and I thought, Jesus, that's just bloody well, unbelievable. And I still think that when I look at it, and that's a great example of an archetype. And so we'll see you Tuesday.
