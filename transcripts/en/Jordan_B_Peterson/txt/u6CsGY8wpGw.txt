Speaker 1:          00:03          Hello everyone. I've got lots of questions here. And so welcome to the first live question and answer youtube session that I'm hosting. So I'm going to get right into it and answer some questions. There's lots coming up on the screen here. Um, Mac one three five, seven one nine seven, nine asks, what does it mean people don't have ideas, ideas have people.

Speaker 2:          00:32          Are we okay? Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34          Cause I've got an area here. Sorry about that. We're going to, you're going to hear some technical talk during this because we don't exactly know what we're doing yet. Okay. So what does it mean people don't have ideas, ideas have people. I learned that mostly from young. In fact, I think that's virtually a direct quote from Carl Jung. One of the things I learned from young was that it's perfectly reasonable to think of ideas as something that's living as, as a, as something that's, that's a lot. But an idea is something that's alive. And I think the reason for that is that the beings that have ideas and so that's us. People are alive and we're trying to use our cognitive ability to further our living. And so we create ideas that, and, and the, the purpose of those ideas is to have them played out in embodiment to have the Mac that acted out because otherwise did not have any utility. And so

Speaker 1:          01:41          we conjure up ideas, let's say originally, but they take on a life of their own over time. And as they take on a life of their own, their capacity to dominate someone increases to the point where the idea is arguably more powerful than the person. No. So if you look at religious ideas, for example, maybe you could think of what happened with regards to Islam and that, you know, end up in the latter part of the first Christian Millennium, a set of ideas exploded out of one source and, and swept through a vast population. The same thing happened with Christianity. In fact, the same thing is happening with Christianity right now in China, China, in, in, in China. Christianity is spreading faster than it did in the Roman times. And definitely something we already noticed cause our timeframe is small compared to thousands and thousands of years. But ideas have their own goal and their own perception and their own way of interacting with the world. And it's, it's always possible for them to possess people.

Speaker 3:          03:02          Why do we feel exposed and vulnerable when we know and do what we really like? Your words that Zell H, well lots of times people hide behind a shelf even at cost to them because if the shell gets criticized and it's not really that relevant because it doesn't have any direct bearing on them. And so if you're not showing your true self, so to speak to the world and what you're showing is something essentially this false or just constructed and that gets criticized, well you can always comfort yourself with the idea that it's not really you that's under attack. So it doesn't wound to the same degree. Now, and I mean that's partly why people protect themselves with falsehoods and ideologies and, and

Speaker 3:          03:57          it's an attempt to shield their genuine vulnerability from assault by the world. But the problem is is that if you don't allow that vulnerability to manifest itself, then the probability that you're actually ever going to get what you really like or even discover what it is is zero. So by protecting yourself to that degree, you end up losing, certainly losing it, what it is that you're most trying to protect. I mean, I don't want to be cavalier about that because it's understandable that people attempt to shield their vulnerability because the vulnerability isn't just felt, it's real and people are fragile and you know, we're subject to the terrible forces of nature, enter the terrible forces of culture. So we put all sorts of masks in front of ourselves so that our exposure is limited. People even do that to themselves to some degree. If you're front is false enough, then it's also false to you. And I suppose people do that to some degree to protect themselves against their own self criticisms.

Speaker 3:          05:11          David Guido says, how can high school teachers best promote virtue, cultivate morality, and tackle the meaning crisis in the face of an increasingly chaotic, violent, and dehumanized future? Well, I would say it isn't obvious to me that the future is increasingly chaotic, violent, and dehumanized, that the past was pretty rough. Now the future is definitely ill defined. We don't know what's going to happen and I think maybe that's more true in in a general sense than it ever has been in the history of mankind. But I, I don't necessarily think that there's reasons to be particularly pessimistic. However, the first part of the question I think is, is well worth addressing. How can high school teachers best promote virtue, cultivate, cultivate morality, and tackle the meaning crisis?

Speaker 3:          06:02          Well, I think the best way that people in general promote virtue and cultivate morality is by promoting virtue and cultivating morality within their own light. But I think that in order to do that for yourself and then also in order to transmit that information to your students, you have to understand that morality isn't a sec of injunctions, of the nature of don't ever do anything impulsive that you like, which is generally how Morrell he's put forth. You know, what you think about morality is something that a puritanical person might preach. And that it has to do mostly with self control and self constraint. I, I think that that's a very shallow,

Speaker 3:          06:47          that's a very shell shallow vision of morality. I think the way that you convince people to act morally if that's something that you're interested in doing is to meditate on the utility of the truth because I think the highest form of morality is following the truth. So you might say, well, why would you bother following? What's true and answer to that I think is quite straight forward. If you follow what's false, then you're going to end up somewhere that you weren't planning to go and the probability that that's going to be good is low. Me following what's false, it's like attempting to use the wrong map for, for for the territory that you occupy. And if your eyes are opening and you pay attention, then the probability that you'll be able to maneuver around the terrible, sharp obstacles that will emerge in front of you is that much higher.

Speaker 3:          07:41          And so when you were having a serious discussion about morality with people, there's a, there's a couple of points that you'd make to begin with. It's like, and these were fundamental points. One would be do you want things to be better or do you want things to be worse? And you might assume that people are going to automatically answered that. They'd rather have things better, but that's not so self evident because to make things better, it usually requires that you adopt a tremendous amount of responsibility and that's effortful and difficult and frightening and, and the buck sort of stops with you, which is also part of what makes it terrifying. But if you do want things to be better and you have your mind stream and oriented in that direction, then

Speaker 3:          08:33          the truth is your best possible guide because it'll help you get to that point. So I think one of the things that people who talk about morality failed to understand is that it's not abstract, it's practical. Morality is precisely what's proved to be most practical, the longest possible span of time. Sort of like the, the moral act is what's best, all things considered. And part of the reason that it's necessary for people to follow conventional rules is because convention is part of the wisdom of mankind. And the wisdom of mankind has basically said, you know, all things considered, here's a pathway that you can follow that is going to work out in principle best for you. And so, you know, one of the, one of the considerations there, speaking in terms of convention is, you know, the standard path through life, say in western culture has been to grow up to form an intimate relationship of some stability to do something productive than other people approve of.

Speaker 3:          09:44          And, and, and we'll trade with you for, to raise children and to establish yourself in a community. And the reason that that's conventional morality is because that's not such a bad deal compared to most of the alternatives. And if you can pull all those things off properly, then there's a reasonable chance that you'll at least have a life that isn't completely full of unbearable suffering with nothing positive in it. But there's also the, there's also a reasonable possibility that you'll have a good life. And so then you might want to try to do that correctly. Why Act Morally? Why Act in a virtuous manner? Because it's in your interest and it's in every once in else, everyone else's interest as well. And so that seems like a good deal. Now it will mean that you'll have to put off certain forms of impulsive pleasure. But the problem often with impulsive pleasure is that well you, you, you have pleasure at haste and you repented leisure.

Speaker 3:          10:44          And so part of what standard morality is trying to do is to inform you about how you might act in the present so that the present is acceptable. But so the tomorrow is also good and next week is also good and next month is also good and next year is also good for you and for your family and for your community, for this broad swath of humanity. And partly what you ask people, you ask high school students is, well they want to be part of that or did they want to do something else? And if they want to do something else, maybe they want to make things worse while they should think that through, because that's just not a very good plan, you know, unless your goal is to make the world a more miserable place. And you know, often people's goals are precisely. Dot. Alex fiander asked, is mindfulness really beneficial or is it just a trend? Man, mostly it's a trend. Um, the problem with mindfulness as far as I'm concerned, is that it's, it's, it's a, it's a word that's like a giant box. You can put anything you want in it and claim that that's not only what it is, but that's what it does. And so I'm, I'm, you know, I would be very hesitant to make a blanket statement such, you know, like no one practicing mindfulness or teaching mindfulness is producing any benefit for their students. But yeah, I think mostly it's a, it's a fat. So

Speaker 3:          12:15          how can disney produced an architectural masterpiece in the mid nineties lion king and then turn around and create propaganda in the new millennium froze. That's why Sam Colette, God, that's a good question. But there's an even better question that goes along with it. It's like not only could did isn't he turned around and create propaganda in the new millennium because I do believe exactly that that's what frozen is, but if I remember correctly, I think that that's the highest grossing animated movie now that's ever been made, so it's not only that they created propaganda, it's the people are extraordinarily hungry for it. Why would that be? Well, one of the ideological motifs in frozen is that you know, the classic idea that the sleeping beauty needs a prince to awaken her is observed and old fashioned and that there are alternative ways of traveling through life that don't require the subjugation that that particular story might appear to entail. I think that's really naive beyond belief because a story like sleeping beauty where the feminine is waiting for the masculine to awaken.

Speaker 3:          13:41          It's true. It's just as true for men as it is for women. It's not about men and women. Precisely. It is to some degree. It's more about the masculine and the feminine and the feminine part of a man, which is the part that enables him to have a relationship with a woman at all, is awoken by the archetypal masculine qualities of clarity of mind. For example, just as much as the females femininity is awoken by masculine clarity of mind. And you can read those old stories and sleeping beauty in all likelihood. It's a very little story at multiple levels simultaneously.

Speaker 2:          14:22          So,

Speaker 3:          14:23          but I, I think that people want the propaganda because it tells them that what they already think is correct

Speaker 2:          14:30          and

Speaker 3:          14:32          that all the old wisdom or much of the old list them, it can just be dispensed with and people can conduct your lives in any manner that they want. Well, that doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          14:42          So

Speaker 3:          14:46          Julian 10 says, you have said that to study history is to study oneself and one will be much more grounded and strong if they do. So will you please more talk on this, please talk more on this.

Speaker 3:          15:01          Well, you know, it's easy for people to think, let's say you're 30 years old. It's easy for you to think that you're actually 30 years old, but you're not. You're in many ways, at least at one level of analysis, you're three and a half billion years old because that's approximately how long the genetic structure that has given rise to you, at least in part has existed. And you're the consequences of this massive, massively extensive evolutionary process extending back billions of years. It's conditioned every aspect of you. And so you're a very, very ancient creature from a biological perspective. And if you don't view yourself across that entire span of time, so to speak, you have the wrong idea about what it means to be a human being. And then on the cultural end of things, while you're deeply shaped and

Speaker 3:          16:03          and inhibited and offered opportunity by the entire history of human cultural endeavor, which is also interacted in the causal manner with, with the emergence of our biology across time. And if you don't understand history, then you don't understand who you are because you're a product of history. Everything you think someone else already thought, every word that you use, someone else came up with. And so and now youth person thinks for example, that the thoughts that they have or their thoughts, but the probability that you're going to have a thought that's original is extraordinarily low. And so just to understand your own thought process, you need to be deeply, you understand your own thought process far more deeply. If you are an astute student of history, you also understand the problems that confront you in the world. I mean, you're born into the world in a particular historical configuration.

Speaker 3:          17:04          That's an architectural truth. You know, your spirit is born into the world when the world is a certain specific way. And that certain specific way is also a consequence of vast patterns of processes that have laid themselves out on a historical timeframe. I mean, just a simple example. I mean a lot of the um, interpersonal complexities that young people face say in their, in their intimate relationships are a direct consequence of the birth control pill. I mean, that's only been around for 50 years. So it's not deep history, but it certainly, it certainly history. And if you don't understand that the birth control burst in on humanity like app, like an atomic

Speaker 1:          17:50          bomb, maybe like a hydrogen bomb, you don't understand what it is that's driving your own interpersonal problems. So there's no difference between studying history and studying psychology. And there's, there's no difference between studying history and psychology and, and trying to understand who you are and what you should do histories about you. It's not about the world or it's about the world and you, and if you can't see the sense in it, then you're not approaching it properly. Or You have bad teachers where you don't know how to read or something like that because history is unbearably interesting. And so I suppose that's another marker that you can use to determine whether or not your attitude towards studying history is correct. If you're not fascinated and horrified by it, almost beyond belief, then you're not studying history properly. And I think if you were studying it properly, you'd never ask why you should study it. It would, it would be so evident, so obvious that it was necessary. Why did humans enjoy sad stories? That's Lx yonder.

Speaker 1:          19:04          Well, I don't know if they actually enjoyed them, although I think you could make a case that they do in sometimes. Maybe someone's watching a story that's, that's somewhat sentimental that'll make them tear up. And you might say that that's an element of being sad. But I would say that's more an element of being compassionate and participating in this fictional way in, in the love and the intimacy that human beings are capable of. So you can do that by proxy and that can certainly produce sentimental emotions and, and nostalgic emotions. And those can be associated with tiers. But you could go deeper than that and saying, well, people will watch tragic stories. And that's certainly the case mean any shakespearian play virtually is, is tragic in many regards. And I think part of the reason that people are, are compelled to do that is because we're compelled to understand the tragedies of our life. And so to see that tragedy laid out on a stage, which means that it's distilled and amplified in some sense, is to simultaneously engage in the problem of wrestling with what it means to exist in a tragic world. And any information you can get about that is going to be well worth the momentary negative emotion that you might experience while you're engaged in the play.

Speaker 1:          20:27          So people like sad stories because life is often sad and we have to figure out how to deal with that and stories can tell you how to deal with it well and how to deal with it badly. And uh, that can be absurdly informative.

Speaker 3:          20:52          If Christianity has much historical wisdom to offer, why is it so derided in the academy? Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Why Ryan Ross? Well, I think that people generally think of Christianity as science for stupid people. It's something like that, you know, and it's often reduced to its more fundamentalist manifestations. So you know that the straw man version of Christianity is fundamentalist protestantism of the sword that makes the case that the Bible is literally true and that the cosmos is roughly several thousand years old. Well, it's easy to, it's easy to make fun of that. I'm not sure it's so why is to make fun of it can mean people generally have reasons for what they believe and sometimes it's fear and, and narrow mindedness and ignorance. But sometimes what might appear to be fear, fear and narrow mindedness and ignorance is actually the attempt to preserve something of extraordinary, extraordinary value. The value of which has not been fully articulated.

Speaker 3:          22:25          I guess partly I see the, so there's the, there's the, there's the ability for people to generate the straw man version of Christianity and then just feel intelligent by comparing their old knowledge to that. And you know, that's pretty weak I would say. I think Marxism contributes to it a lot. I mean, I think that the universities and our intellectual life in general is still saturated with Marxist in new Marxists presuppositions. And I really think that's a terrible thing. I really don't think that that's any better than having our intellectual landscape populated by neo fascist ideas. I don't see it from a historical perspective that there's any reason whatsoever to assume that neo Marxist ideas are any more morally appropriate than neofascist ideas. Yeah. And I think a lot of what drives them, the Neo Marxist analysis of Christianity is,

Speaker 3:          23:27          some of it's, some of it's simple mindedness mean the marxists tend to reduce everything to power or to economics. And I mean, power and economics are important, but to reduce everything to that is, is to reduce everything to any one thing is a mark of a weak mind. I mean, most problems multivariant problems, they're not univariate problems. I think there's a hatred for the responsibility that genuine Christianity lays upon a person. Because after an architectural level, I mean if you just, if you, if you just speak about this psychologically, you don't set, for example, the soul is naturally Christian. It's a hell of a thing to say. But he had his reasons for saying that. And part of what he was saying was that, or what do you believe in, and Aldous Huxley talked about this a bit too, is that there are elements of Christianity that have Tiquan conceptualization as far as it can go. And that's what makes an architectural so, so I can give you an example of that. So there's a presupposition in Christianity speaking psychologically that

Speaker 3:          24:40          human beings make progress by making sacrifices. That's a good one. You see this act it out to begin to, to begin with, to some degree in the old testament where the sacrifices that people make are, are genuine, archaic sacrifices. If they take something that they're, that they believe has value, perhaps a prize animal and burden at didn't offer it to God. And the reason that it's burned as far as I've been able to tell us, because the archaic conception of the world was that the world was a flat disc. And on top of that disc was a ball and the ball was the sky, roughly speaking. And then outside the ball, that's where the gods existed. And I think our cake people believe that for the same reason that we feel are when we look up in the night sky, we don't, you don't want to make the mistake that just because people didn't know some of the things we know now that they were stupid. They looked up at the night sky or the day sky and felt awe and, and, and part of the intuition that came along with that, or was that

Speaker 1:          25:42          while they were looking at the night sky with a day start there looking into the infinite, and that's a lie very tightly with divinity. So there's those ideas going in the background. Well, if you burn something and offer it up to God, the smoke rises and God can detect the quality of your sacrifice and you, you might think, well that's again, that's pretty,

Speaker 2:          26:01          yeah,

Speaker 1:          26:02          simple minded, but it's not, it's the dramatic representation of an unbelievably profound idea. And the profound idea is that sometimes in order to make things go properly, you have to let go of something that you deeply love or deeply want to do. And what it means, what it means to sacrifice is to let something go in the present so that the future can be better or to let something go personally so that other people can have it better. And there's no difference between the idea of sacrifice and the discovery of the future. As soon as you discovered the future, one of the things you realize is that you have to sacrifice things in the present so that the future manifests itself in a more acceptable manner. So then you think, well, that's also an amazing discovery. Here's the discovery human beings made. If we change our behavior in the present, better things could happen in the future.

Speaker 1:          26:57          Well, no other animal really has ever discovered that. Okay. So that's very tightly linked into the idea of sacrifice. And so he might say, well, you have to sacrifice something of value. And so sometimes I ask my students, a lot of them are second or children of immigrants. You know, what did your parents sacrifice so that you can go to university? And I mean, everyone understands that question. The students immediately tell me of, you know, the things that their parents have done. They moved from some foreign country. They spent 18 hours a day working their selves to the fingers, to the bone at a laundromat or a dry cleaner so that their students could assume that their children could have a richer and fuller life. They're sacrificing. And the sacrifices based on it's based on faith and the faith in, it's essentially a form of religious faith, but we don't have to get into that moment. But the fundamental driving idea is that

Speaker 1:          27:51          the reality is can be positively shaped by sacrifice. Well, that's an amazing idea. Well, so then you might say, well, okay, the higher quality, the sacrifice, the more profound, the positive effect on the future to reasonable proposition. And so then you might say, what's the most valuable possible sacrifice and announcer that is long enviously yourself? So then you can say, well, that means that the ultimate moral junction, the ultimate moral injunction is to sacrifice yourself in a manner that makes the future better love. That's the central idea of Christianity. The central idea, like the central figure, mythological figure at the core of Christianity is the person who voluntarily sacrifices themself to the benevolent will of God. Well, if you have any sense, you're terrified of that idea. And especially if you're, if you're, I would say if you're a rationalistic intellectual or rationalizing intellectual, I mean, who? Who the hell wants to believe that? That that's your moral obligation is to sacrifice yourself for the best. Well, God, you don't know what that means. I mean the archetypal stories, it means that you end up crucified.

Speaker 2:          29:07          Well,

Speaker 1:          29:11          there's lots of reasons to be not very happy, both that idea, but then you say, well, is the fact that Christian and Christianity is derided in the academy a good thing or a bad thing? Mostly it's a terrible thing. You know, it's not like Christianity can't use some criticism, although I think, you know, nature in many ways, nature took care of that for us.

Speaker 2:          29:35          But

Speaker 1:          29:36          mostly I think what we're doing in the academy is running as fast as we can from the responsibility of bearing our culture and we're diversifying it. And we were using any number of appalling rationalizations and ideological maneuvers to try to not only make that acceptable personally, but to proselytize about it to others. You know, the, the more, I wouldn't say cynical maybe of what the more cynical part of me sometimes thinks that the universities now these students more harm than good, especially on the humanities because they take students at a very formative period of their life when they're all in their belief systems and their ability to identify strongly with life are already somebody questioned because they exist in a culture that speak badly fractured and they take those kids and they, you know, they expose them to ideas that are absolutely destructive and it's not about having anything against ideas like that.

Speaker 1:          30:35          Reading Nicha for example is org or reading dusty Yefsky. I mean that can be a very destructive act but the purpose of each is writing and Dostoyevsky's writing. It's not to destroy, it's to remove detritus so that something new can spring forth. And I'm sorry, I just don't really see that happening in the universities. I think there are too cynical and I think that there's also a strong streak of serious anti humanity among moderate intellectuals and that's been the case for at least a hundred years. You hear people saying, you know, like, I think this was a statement from the club of Rome, the people who are so concerned about population explosion back in the mid 1960s that the world would be better off if there were fewer people on it or maybe that there were no people on it. Well, man,

Speaker 1:          31:24          you can't say anything that's more appalling than that. You know, if you said the planet would be better off if there were fewer black people on it, it's like, well no one's going to put up with that. Or the planet would be better off if there were fewer European colonizers on it. Well, you might be able to get away with that a little bit more, but probably not. But as long as your sentiments expand, extend to humanity as a whole, it's perfectly reasonable for you to say something like that. And that's the most horrific thing you could possibly say. I mean, the kids who go into high schools and shoot them up and call them body kids, and that's certainly what they believe. The planet would be a lot better off if there were fewer people on it. Maybe we'll take a few steps in that direction. So Bob Smith says, nice jacket. Thank you Paul. Appreciate that. All right. Can you explain each just general philosophy and some of his most famous ideas? He's really hard to comprehend. Nature's general philosophy. I probably can't do that. I've been putting together with my students here, right? I've been starting to plan a seminar on existentialism and which would focus a lot on Nietzsche and Dostoevsky. I think each just so damn complicated that you can't really do that. I don't think you can explain niches. General Philosophy. First of all, it wasn't really a systematizer. He, he, he, uh, was skeptical of systematizer. It's very difficult to distill someone who's not a systematizer into, you know, a few general principles. The thing is with, with, with some of the greatest thinkers,

Speaker 1:          33:18          you actually have to read what they wrote. You have to read the original writings because the, the brilliance is encapsulated in the original writings and they can't be condensed. So, so, let's see. Can I do any better than that? Can I explain each his general philosophy? Truth serves life. That's a good one. And I guess we could unpack that a little bit. To me, that's a good example of exactly what I need you to. So staggeringly brilliant. One of the things he presumes when he makes a statement like that is that a human being is in

Speaker 1:          33:57          an existential situation that's characterized by the necessity of determining what he or she will actually accept as truth. You know, you might say, well, truth is something you can prove and that's how you know it's true. But unfortunately it's not that simple because you have to decide what criteria you're going to accept. There's proof and there's an act of faith in that. And there's an enabling were that argument seems to be lacking. And this is the famous is ot conundrum that David Hume described is, okay, well let's say that you use science to lay out a very detailed description of the nature of the objective world. Well, that still doesn't mean that you know how to act in that world. And that's a big problem. It might be a fundamental problem if the fundamental problem of people isn't what is the nature of the objective world thought? How is it that you should conduct yourself while you're alive? Well, neat you to believe that the fundamental question was how you should conduct yourself while you're alive. How should you act? And then I would say that's the fundamental question of meaning and science can inform you, but it can't really solve that problem for you. And that's a problem. And then science also has this other terrible attribute. Some sense, which is that

Speaker 1:          35:28          because science can't solve the problem of how you should act in the world,

Speaker 2:          35:35          it

Speaker 1:          35:35          impels people towards conclusion that there is no answer to the question, how should you act in the world? And so that way that opens up a door to nihilism and I was, is, is, is it's destructive. It, it does not facilitate life. In fact, it has the opposite effect. It takes the spirit of the people, it takes the motivation out of people, it makes them bitter, it makes them resentful, it makes them hateful. It's not a good thing. Also niches, primarily concerned in some sense with how to act, and part of the reason that he decomposes Christianity to the degree that he does this because he believed that Christianity was a very, very serious attempt to answer the question, how should you act? And he also believed that it had become fatally flawed for a variety of reasons, at least in its typical societally socially instantiated forms.

Speaker 1:          36:35          So he took it upon himself to subject it to a criticism. But I've always thought I've Nicha. It's a terrible image, but I've always thought Nietzsche has like a magnet in a wound. It's like what he's doing is clearing away dead and diseased tissues so that something else can live and it's a terrible thing to watch. It's a terrible thing to apprehend and it's, it's a terribly destructive thing to involve yourself in these niches. He said he philosophize with the hammer and that's certainly true, but he was trying to clear the path for something new and that that's something new. He was trying to formulate with his consumption such as like this, the, the superman that the next version of human beings so to speak. And he thought of them as people who would create their own values

Speaker 1:          37:27          and if that would be the way forward, oh, is the wreckage of Christianity, let's say. Oh, I think Nisha was wrong about that. And I say that with all due respect, believe me, and I say a cautiously and I don't think it's an original idea of my own, that nature was wrong. And I think the reason that he was wrong, just because people don't create value, say discover them or maybe they cocreate them, but you can't create values by conjuring them out of nonexistence. You could say if you were scientifically minded, that values are in some sense, arbitrary. And then if you believe that values are arbitrary, you might then believe that people could create them. Oh, there's nothing but values aren't arbitrary. And most of the time people discover them and maybe they cocreate the, and one of the reasons that I so have been so attracted to use thinking is because young is in many ways a Nietzschean, a student of nature, also a student of Freud, but more primarily a student of nature and s lifelong endeavor

Speaker 3:          38:36          was to understand what the way forward might be given the situation that needs you to describe and the situation that needs you to described in some sense was that Christianity laid so much emphasis on truth that it ended up undermining its own axiomatic presuppositions. And so then you thought following it needs you well, okay, in principle we have to create new values. But that that's partly why you even got so interested in the unconscious because one of the things he found particular in his analysis of the collective unconscious that was that the values that Nietzsche thought people should create were actually lying dormant in well in our imagination. That's one way of thinking about it because that's a good way of thinking about the collective unconscious and that it was a return to the deepest that the way forward in terms of the generation of new value was, was a return to the deepest recesses of human existence and a rediscovery of what was actually there. I touched on that a little bit today when I was talking about the necessity for sacrifice, like there's an archetypal idea that the savior, the Messiah is, is by definition the person who was willing to sacrifice him or herself for the ultimate good, whatever that happens to be and if that's the appropriate pathway forward. Well that's, that's an art degree teak of Christianity and I, and I think that you almost right. I think he's correct. That's a terrible thing to say because I mean yoga is such a radical thinker that it's, it's,

Speaker 3:          40:15          it's funny because yoga is subject to a lot of criticism. I mean, I read Richard [inaudible] book on Nisha, I think it was called the area in Christ and nowell basically who I think was a very is or was, I'm very resentful person. Um, I think he did a hatchet job on you. He, he the cover of his book made Yo look like it was a Nazi. I mean how cheap cheap shot that is. But you know, he accused yoga basically fomenting a cult and I read no book and it just made me laugh because what you was actually up to is so much worse so to speak. Then merely starting a cult. It's like accusing and ax murder of,

Speaker 2:          40:54          of, of uh, of what

Speaker 3:          40:59          annoying, annoying his pet cat. You know, it's that the differences that extensive, the sorts of things that Ewan was actually messing around with are so complicated and terrible compared to just building a little cult that, you know, it's absolutely clear that Noah had no idea what he was talking about. He only said it like nature. Like Dostoevsky is that terrifying person. And I think part of the reason that you don't use not well regarded in the academy and also my Christianity is subject to such continual rationalist and criticism is because people open up and take one look at what he's doing and either just don't get it at all or they get a little bit of it. It scares them so badly. They think there's no damn way I'm going there and, and I can really understand that. I think, I think anybody with any sense would be very, very careful about trying to figure out what Dean was talking about. It is cognitive behavioral, a sorry here

Speaker 3:          42:11          I missed that. Sorry about that. It's a good idea to believe in something. Healthy delusions like Karma or life after death. That's Danny Wall socket. Well there is a whole line of social psychology that was very popular about 15 years ago. In fact, the most cited social psychological paper ever written was about the necessity of positive illusions. You know, the basic hypothesis was life was so tragic and dismal that unless you bolstered yourself against it with, you know, defensible optimists and I suppose if you were being charitable or just positive illusions lies is what I think are that life would actually be a tolerable. And I think that's unbelievably nihilistic and vicious philosophy. I think the fact that that was actually seriously put forward by, by a generation of social psychologists as a medication for the modern disease of meaning, it is an absolute indictment of the entire field. Um, no, there's nothing about illusions that are healthy, but that doesn't mean that cynicism and despair are forms of truth or that nihilism is a form of truth. There's no such thing as healthy delusions.

Speaker 3:          43:28          No. You know, any wall song consent, it's like Karma. Well, I didn't know Karma is a healthy delusion and I'm not so sure about, I mean there's some elements of Karma that I think are extremely interesting from a psychological perspective and we can scrap the incarnation element of it because I, well for obviously at least for the sake of simplicity, but I believe in Karma. I think that no one gets away with anything ever. I think every single thing you do that is the moral cause in the moral thing is an attempt to work the structure of reality. Everything you do that's immoral, comes back to haunt you. And it generally comes back in multiply form. Now that doesn't mean you'll be able to drive the costs of connections. Like you might've done something immoral who knows five years ago and that produced like a crack in the structure of your being and like it's five years later and all sorts of things are falling into that crack. And you have no idea that that initial act was what produced this know cascading consequences events. But that doesn't mean it didn't.

Speaker 2:          44:34          So

Speaker 3:          44:36          what did [inaudible] mean by revolt in the myth of Sisyphus? What are some ways to revolt without being destructive or should one simply be a good app? Thank you. Well that's 19 k Mitch. Well the first thing I should say, how bad is it not those so simple to be a good aunt. Like I think being a good aunt is better than just being a chaotic. And, and useless aunt. And so you should probably go from chaotic and useless and two good. And that's a process of maturation. That's what happens when you're, you know, you move from being a child to an adolescent, to a young adult. You adopt the strictures and responsibilities of your culture to discipline yourself. Now, if you stop at the point where you're a good aunt, while then I think, you know, that's not so good then, then you're, you're an Avatar of the pathologies of your culture as well as an Avatar of the virtues of your culture.

Speaker 3:          45:32          So, but you, you, it's fighting against mirror enculturation is, that's, that's not virtue, that's failure. That's just failure to mature. You know, that was actually one of Nietzsche's questions of conscience. Um, are you leading or are you just running away? Well, the answer that almost always is he running away. You might think you're leading, but the probability that you're leaving, especially if you haven't seriously considered the possibility that you're running away, it's like really? What's the, what's the chances if you, if you really think about us, not that easy lead and it's pretty easy to run away. So if you're not doing what other people are doing, you're probably running away. And you might say, well that's pretty rough. It's like fair enough. You know, if you've got some absolute, the unique destiny that you have to manifest more power to you.

Speaker 2:          46:21          Um, but

Speaker 3:          46:26          most of the time what I see are people who think they have a unique destiny and really what they're doing is wandering off the beat batch into some thorn written ditch where things are not going to be good for them.

Speaker 2:          46:38          So

Speaker 3:          46:40          what are some ways to revolt without being distracted?

Speaker 2:          46:43          Revolt against what? That'd be the question.

Speaker 3:          46:49          I mean, it's a very, you could try revolting against your lack of discipline. Like that's good. That's a war. That's a war. If you want a war, maybe you do because people need war. You know, I think it was William James who said that people need a moral equivalent to war. I think that's what [inaudible] was trying to discover, by the way, the moral equivalent to war, and I think he did discover it as well. And that's tied up with the idea of sacrifice. If you want to revoke, you should revolt against your own pathology and inadequacy and uselessness and resentment and cruelty and blindness and yeah, you could have a war against, you could revolt against that. That gives you something to do. Pete, Professor Mra, people are often quite smart. Why did they have this strong tendency towards atheism? Oh, well, you know people who are, have smart, good atheistic right away because you know, it's obvious who really believe in God. You believe in an old man and this guy, you already think the world's least 7,000 years old. It's like, do you really believe Christ turned wine into water? You know, no one who wasn't foolish would believe that. While that's the statement of someone who's,

Speaker 3:          48:02          I guess who's smart enough to start to notice something about what people believe, but you know, they're 10 steps along out 50,000 mile journey. So, and then the other thing, I already mentioned this about atheism, people like to think that the reason their atheistic is because they're clear headed and rational. It's like, well first of all, know, probably they're not. Because how often do you meet someone who's clear headed and rational? Like being psychoanalytically minded? I'm always way more likely to look for the dark reason that someone is doing something rather than the light reason. You know, the reason that's moving them towards the light because it's hard to move towards the light. And so I would say most of the time people are atheistic. Well, it's kind of, it's fashionable in some silicon said fashion way to Vr to revolt if you're rational and if you're kind of an intellectual.

Speaker 3:          48:54          Um, but also you can just dispense with responsibility if you're atheistic. And I think that's 90% of the reason that it's, especially in the modern world, that's why people are proponents of atheism. You know, or they have some particular hatred for the church. I think Richard Dawkins has a particular hatred for the church. I would, I would, I would, I've thought about this many times. I would swear that something happened to him when he was a kid that wasn't good and that the church was involved because he has such an animus against the church. It's that, that it, it, it possesses him. There's a reason for that. All right, so let's see here.

Speaker 3:          49:38          That's, can you explain why the conventional wisdom about each and people are so at odds with your ideas about each of people. But yeah, that's Harold. Boom. I can explain that. People like to think they're smart and they like, and the easiest way to think you're smart in many ways is to think that other people aren't. And so we think, well, the people who came before us all these thousands of centuries, you know, they just didn't know what we knew. Well, there are cultures didn't have the same degree of staggering technological capacity that our skin, but that didn't mean that they were stupid. I mean you throw the average person back into ancient Athens, they're not gonna last very long. It's lack of respect. And you know, that is a definite hallmark of water culture is that you can hardly even tell. You know, you can hardly even say, well being respectful. It sounds like you're from 19

Speaker 1:          50:28          be respectful. Well if you're not, if you don't want to be nihilistic, you better be respectful because

Speaker 2:          50:39          yeah,

Speaker 1:          50:40          being nihilistic and having respect for nothing are exactly the same thing.

Speaker 1:          50:45          So you could start by having some respect for your ancestors and try and figure out what the hell they were talking about. He read the Old Testament for example. It's a very weird book. It's a very, very, very, very weird book. Lots of people wrote it, lots of people and it did. It got sequenced together and turned into this volume for, for reasons that we just can't understand. It's our collective work of the human imagination and people read it. So simple. It's such a simple minded way. They read it like fundamentalist, like simple minded. Fundamentalist Protestants. Think about science. No, the fundamentalist Protestants think the Bible is literally true. Science is literally true. Doris, the Bible is science. Well, you know, no, the people who wrote the Bible word scientist, that's just not how it works. But then the, the, the, like the modern critics of religious thinking of traditional religious thinking, they're just, they're the same.

Speaker 1:          51:43          They do the same thing except backwards. They say, no, no, no, religion was science. It's just bad sides. And so, you know, we don't have pay any attention to it. Well, it's not science, it's something else. It's ethics, it's morality, it's drama, it's all of that and dramas about how to live and religious drama is, it's a definitional issue. There's nothing deeper than religious drama. And the reason for that is that depth defines what's religious. And like I know this firsthand hardly because in my clinical practice, like I often see people who are in terrible, terrible, terrible trouble and often that trouble is ethical and if the trouble they're in is bad enough, there's no other language to conceptualize it in. Isn't religious because the religious language comes into its own. When you're dealing with problems. Normally we have life and death, but literally of Heaven and Hell and you know, modern people think, well there's no such thing as heaven and there's no such thing as hell. It's like, okay fine, there's no such thing as heaven, let's accept that. But if you think there's no such thing as hell, like I can't see how someone who's educated would ever dare to make that claim.

Speaker 2:          53:03          Like

Speaker 1:          53:04          after everything that happened to us in the 20th century, I can't see that someone could ever say that there's no such thing as hell without being terrified that a bolt of lightning would obliterate them on the spot.

Speaker 1:          53:17          No. Hell is real. And if you want to talk about use religious language and if you want to figure out how to get away from hell, you use religious language. And that's what religious language is for. So you know the, the, that's actually understandable. Now I would say if, if it, if you want to learn about this, you can, you can read nature, you can read Dostoyevsky you can read young. It's hard. You can read young student, Eric Normand, Eric Norman was a genius. Like I wanted this information is there waiting for people to, to begin to understand it. But it's hard slog again. And part of the problem is is that you get to hell way before you get to have, you know, and one of the things youngest sometimes conceptualized as a new age thinker, I think that's absurd. I think it's, it's, it's, it's the platelet observe, one of his fundamental propositions is that if you follow a meaningful and truthful path that will take you to the worst place you can imagine. And then possibly having gone there, the journey uphill, you know, towards the light can begin in earnest.

Speaker 2:          54:34          Well,

Speaker 1:          54:41          who wants that? Well, no one, if they have any sense, but you know, young also made another statement which, which really taught me to the bone when I first understood it, he said, yeah, anything you don't thoroughly understand, you act out in the world as fate.

Speaker 1:          54:58          And so one of the, one of the lessons I took away from that is then, you know, if you don't want hell to manifest itself in the world, then you better understand your role in producing it. And I would say that's actually the primary religious injunction. And I would also say that that's a big part of the reason why belief systems such as Christianity. I'm talking mostly about Christianity because that's what I'm most familiar with. But, and also because it's, it's definitely out the fin on the foundation of Western civilization actually quite a fan of Western civilization. I mean, the fundamental moral injunction is in Christianity or one of them. I mean they're all tangled together, I guess to some degree it's like you want to constrain hell within yourself. Well, that's no joke man.

Speaker 2:          55:49          I mean,

Speaker 1:          55:51          you know, one of what, another thing I learned from Yoga and from Nietzsche was that if you, if you, if you look at the sorts of things that happen, saying now she Germany or, or, or in the Soviet Union or in Mao's China or that are still happening around the world where they're systematic torture and persecution of millions and millions of people, where, where the entire state was devoted towards making things as bad as they can possibly be and then making them even worse after that is that people played a role in that and they were people like you. And that means that people like you play a role in that. And so then the question is what's your role and is that the game that you want to be playing? Well, that's a serious question because it is people like you who were responsible for that. And it means that to the degree that you're a person and you don't want that to happen anymore, you have to sort that out within yourself. So I can, I can explain it. I think I'll close with this another deeply religious idea. There's another idea. This is an archetypal idea about the image of the savior, the Messiah. The Messiah is the person who takes the sins of the world onto himself. That's a classic archetypal idea. It's like what does that mean?

Speaker 1:          57:15          It means that you look for the motivations that drove Hitler in yourself because they were there and that's what it means to take the sins of the world onto yourself. It means that you have to view yourself as the perpetrator of archetypical evil. You know, one of the things you said for example, what's that? If you, if you take a small moral failing that a person manifests and you dig into that

Speaker 1:          57:48          as deeply as you can, you end up in the center of health, like the roots of that unethical behavior go all the way down to the, to the, to the archetype and in my experience, docs being true. That's, that's right. That's why people want to have conversations about this sort of thing. Can you see it happening in, in, in intimate relationships all the time where there are things that the two people who were involved in the relationship, we'll just not talk about why it's cause they don't want to go there. And where is it that they don't want to go? They don't want to get to the bottom of things. Well, no wonder because you know, that's an archetypal idea to hell is a pit. It's at the bottom of things. It's like, yeah, that is where it is and you have to go there. If you want a straight things out, it's like who the hell wants to do that? Well, the alternative is that it plays itself out in the world and we've seen that and that doesn't look like a good idea to me.

Speaker 1:          58:49          Well, I guess we should probably end there because I'm getting fuzzy minded then stuff. That's always a good time to stop. So thank you very much for tuning in and if this seems to have been successful, kind of had a slow start as far as I was concerned. I was kind of muddled headed to begin with. But, uh, you know, maybe we'll edit all that out anyways, I'm thinking about doing this on a regular basis, so, you know, let me know what you think and, and, uh, we'll see how many people watch it and we'll see what happens. And thanks to all my Iras because I've learned some research assistants here who already helping me out with this. So a, mastering the technology and figuring out what to do with youtube. So thank you very much for tuning in and, uh, hopefully I'll see you again. Ciao.
