Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi, this is an invitation to Dutch citizens and their leaders alike. I'm coming to Holland next week for two reasons, apart from the fact that I love Holland and I'm always looking for an excuse to go there. First on January 17th from 10:00 AM to 7:30 PM. I'm going to talk to corporate and other organizational leaders in Amsterdam in a session entitled envisioning the future at the warehouse by wicked grounds in Amsterdam. Details of the session can be found in the description of this video as can information about tickets which are still available. I'm going to begin the day with a lecture on the psychology of motivation and emotion. I want to discuss deeply from the symbolic level all the way down to the level of of neuroscience, how it is that vision and motivation and the regulation of emotion or deeply entwined in that the vision that we set for ourselves defines the framework within which we operate in the world, perceive the world and react emotionally to the world.

Speaker 1:          01:06          I want to help everyone who comes to the session understand exactly what that means in the most modern and uptodate psychological manner possible, and so all lecture for about 90 minutes about that, perhaps a bit longer after that, participants will have the opportunity to complete the future authoring program or at least to begin the future authoring program, which is an online reading program that I designed with my colleagues that enables people to deeply conceptualize their lives three to five years down the road and to make a plan, let's say, to maximize the quality of their life. You began the future authoring program which is available publicly by the way, at cell faltering Dotcom. You begin the future authoring program by considering the most important dimensions of your life, family, friends, intimate relationships, ambitions for the future from an economic perspective, use of time outside of work and the regulation of temptations like drug and alcohol use, and imagine yourself three to five years down the road.

Speaker 1:          02:11          If you are living the life that would be optimal for you most meaningful and productive life. Then you're asked to contemplate each of those dimensions to decide how you would optimize your life, specifically along those dimensions, then to write for 15 minutes about what your life could be like in three to five years if you were really taking care of yourself like someone that you cared for. Then to write for 20 minutes about what your life would be like if your bad habits and and inadequacies and characterological flaws, got the upper hand and lead you into the ground. Then to write out a detailed plan for the attainment of your goals, your the, the realization of your vision, including writing about why it would be good for you to undertake this adventure, let's say, and also why it would be good for your family and the broader community, so to fully articulate a plan that will comprise the contents of that day.

Speaker 1:          03:10          Details about the event can be found in the description of this video as well as a timeline for the day and information about where you can pick, pick up tickets which are still available. The second event on January 19th is hosted by a Dutch organization. Netherland. Say Leo, they've organized what they hope will be the beginning of a serious national conversation about Dutch and European identity as well as immigration policy. I'm going to begin the event which will involve 2000 people and the number of well known speakers from a variety of backgrounds. I'll start with a 45 minute discussion on the psychology of identity and concentrate more specifically on on Europe. Where are we in Europe? Broadly speaking, how did we get here? What have we done right and wrong? Where are we going and why and how should each of us conduct ourselves so we get there.

Speaker 1:          04:06          How should each of us conduct ourselves so that are stable and productive? Society state, stable, productive and free, and don't fall prey to the temptations of radicalism either on the left or the right. I hope to initiate a process of deep thought during this meeting, the organizer. So we're hoping to generate 25 recommendations as a consequence of this meeting for the future of Dutch and I suppose more broadly European and Western society and there are still some tickets available to this event. So I'll also provide the information about that in the description of this video. So thank you very much. I hope to see you there if you're interested, and that's all I have to say about that. Bye Bye.
