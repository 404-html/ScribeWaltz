Speaker 1:          00:00:00       All right,

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       so if there's anybody, is there anybody here who's new?

Speaker 1:          00:00:15       So everybody knows where to find the website. Okay, well that's good to know. Someone doesn't. Who is that saying? No.

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       Ah, there you are. Just look up my name on Google and you'll find my website and then you can find the course. Okay. And all the readings and so forth are there. Unfortunately some of the links were outdated and if you tried to get ahold of a Ta, you probably got a hold of last year's tea, but because I didn't update all the links blindly, so anyways, that's fixed, I hope. And with any luck the website is fully functional. So. All right, so last time I was trying to give you a brief introduction to, to a way of looking at symbolic representations. And maybe I should tell you a little bit about symbolic representations. First. Um, it's a bit confusing because Freud was in some sense the first of the modern psychologist to talk about symbolism. And Freud believed that symbols were often used by the unconscious to represent things that the conscious mind did not want to become conscious of. So in some sense, Freud believed that the things that you repressed were things that you knew and understood but didn't want to attend to or believe or understand or integrate or developer or even allowed to exist. And so the unconscious was reduced to

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       using subterfuge in some sense to get its point across. Now it's a powerful argument. It's one we're going to return to when we talk about Freud, but I don't think it's right. I think, I think, I think young's explanation of symbols is, is, is better. I think it's right. Although there may be times when Freud's correct, but I think that would be a subset of the times when symbolism is used. Um, imagine that there are different forms of knowledge first. And it's important to understand. It's important to recognize that before you can really think about something like the use of symbolism, the unconscious, the use of symbolism by the unconscious. I mean, first of all, there's the form of knowledge that everyone knows as knowledge, which is articulated knowledge, right? And so articulated knowledges, often factual or it can be procedural because you can tell someone how to do something but and everyone thinks of and and then there's knowledge about facts of various forms which which may or may not be true, but that's really irrelevant that and that's often this sort of knowledge that you learn in a classroom.

Speaker 2:          00:03:08       Procedural knowledge is a different issue because you can learn that by doing or by imitating and it and even in science, which is a, which is a process and an an a method as well as a body of knowledge. Even in science, a lot of the knowledge isn't explicit and articulated. It's actually procedural. This is something Thomas Kuhn talked about, for example, in his famous book on scientific revolutions, which because partly when you're a graduate student for example, or to a lesser degree and undergraduate, it's, it's more relevant when you actually start practicing science. A lot of the knowledge that you bring to bear on the, on, on the subject is actually implicit. You can't really. You can't really explain it. And so some examples of that might be like learning how to look through a microscope, which turns out to be a very difficult thing.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       You have to practice for many hours before you get good at looking through a microscope or maybe if you're a radiologist you have to read x rays or fm rise of that sort of thing. You can build up a body of knowledge that makes you a perceptual expert, but he can't really get that kind of knowledge without practice. You know, it's sort of like learning how to play the piano, say, or learning how to walk or, or any complex act of perception or action is seldom fully articulated. And so, so that's another kind of knowledge you might call that embodied knowledge and there is a memory for them that goes along with that, which is procedural memory, right? And a lot of what you know is procedural memory. And then there's another kind of knowledge which is I suppose, autobiographical. And that's often referred to as say episodic memory and autobiographical knowledge would be your memory of yourself as an actor in the world. You know. So I suspect for many of you, well let's find out for how many this is true. When you remember an episode in the past or when your mind is wandering and episodes of the past come up, how would you describe the forum in which they emerge? Are they like hot for how many people are they? Like little movies.

Speaker 2:          00:05:11       Okay. Is there anyone for whom that's not true?

Speaker 2:          00:05:15       Yeah. Okay. So, so when you think about the past or when the past comes to mind, in what form does it come to mind? Stills. Stills. Okay. But it's still images. Is there anybody? Okay. Okay, fine, fine. There's also knowledge about the past that semantic knowledge articulated knowledge and that would be factual knowledge about what you did in the past, but that seems to be. That seems to be a more thoroughly processed form of memory because in some sense what you've done, if you're extracting out articulated knowledge from past experiences is that you have to, you have to pull out the gist. You reduce it, you know, it's sort of like imagine that you have a conversation with someone and last two hours and someone says, well, what did you about? Why you don't repeat the entire conversation verbatim, right? You do some weird job of compressing the information into something like a summary and you do that more or less automatically, you know, it's quite a remarkable process actually because you get the gist or you get the point, whatever the point is, it's not like it's that easy to extract from a conversation and that's another form of knowledge that you can, that you can formulate.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       But then there's sort of borderline forms of knowledge, you know, and those are the ones that seem to be expressed as far as I can tell in something that's more like symbolic representation. So, um, we talked last time a little bit about a parent say apparent acting the role of a father. So the parent is embodying whatever father means and the child is prepared for that because children generally have a father. And of course children are prepared to interact with men like they're prepared to interact with women. They understand men and they understand women and a lot of that knowledge comes like hardwired in, so the child might be observing the farther across multiple context, trying to understand precisely who this creature is, but then also learning how to embody that in so far as she might be learning how to interact with males or he might be learning how to imitate a male.

Speaker 2:          00:07:13       Of course there's some of that that's going on with both genders and then a lot of what summarized in the in the acting out in the pretending also seems to be like just because when a child imitates his father and is pretending to be a father, for example, he isn't on just duplicating exactly what he seen, what he's doing. In some sense, you might think of as extracting out the commonalities of behavior across different contexts that the farther manifests in order to get a handle on the spirit of the father. And then it's the spirit of the father in some sense that the child's trying to embody. And that would be whatever makes a father different from a man. And so you know, you can certainly. I'm sure you know perfectly well when you go home to visit your parents or when you interact with them on a day to day basis when your father is being a father and when he's just being a man, there'd be voice tone and, and, and, and stance and gays and, and all sorts of like articulated phrases that you're familiar with that are part of the role of father and you could see other people's fathers acting like fathers to now it seems to be that a lot of symbolic representation has to do with the extraction of the just.

Speaker 2:          00:08:25       It's like exactly what is, it's a categorization process is exactly what it is that these various behaviors have in common and what they have, if they're embodied behaviors. What they have in common is something like a spirit. So I think it was hegel who talked about the spirit of the times and you knew how, uh, if you look at photographs that are like 20 years old, all of a sudden they're dated, you know, for awhile, photographs look like they're current. Then all of a sudden, poof, they're dated. And you think, how in the world did people think they were normal when they were dressed like that? You know, and there there are are frequently occurrences in culture where there's an emergence of a style that seems consistent across the entire culture. Like the art deco movement was like that. And what seems to be the case in those situations is that there are novel ideas being generated, but everyone is imitating everyone else as rapidly as they possibly can because they're communicating in an articulated way in.

Speaker 2:          00:09:18       They're copying each other and out of that you get something like a spirit or ethos of the time. And so a lot of what symbolism is trying to do is to extract out commonalities across context and often commonalities that you really don't understand, like their categories. They're, they're almost like pre categories or their levels of representation that are trying to represent something that's actually too complex for you to articulate. So for example, many of you will act out being a mother, being a father when you have children, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you could fully articulate the knowledge that you have about what it is to be a mother or father, and so you have the knowledge because you can act it out and it's somewhat it you, you actually, you have some form of representation of the knowledge too because you can understand that when it happens, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you can fully articulate it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:10       So you could say for example, that you have an image of what a mother is and the image wouldn't be just a still, it would be maybe a sequence of stills or something like that, but it's more like a pattern of behavior, your image of the pattern of behavior that characterizes a given role. And so. So that's a good way to think about symbols, I think. And that was sort of the union way of thinking about them. You unbelief that assemble was nature's attempt nature within, you say nature's attempt to express a relatively unknown idea in the clearest possible manner. Even though that wasn't necessarily clear and well, we use symbols all the time for that sort of purpose. You see them all the time when you go to movies, for example, movies are full of symbolism. I was just interpreting the dream of one of my clients the other day and he dreamt that he was following a spirit around in the basement of a house that was like a maze and the spirit kept disappearing and reappearing and he gathered some people around him that was sort of like a, I would say, a social network because he's been working on developing a social network and as that social network are developed, he felt more and more confident to search out this spirit and to chase it around the basement.

Speaker 2:          00:11:20       Finally, the spirit manifested itself a ghost. It was a blue ghost, ghostly thing. It came out of a box that was in one of the basement rooms that had a toilet seat on it, so it was like a toilet that was on a. It was like a toilet that was on a box, which is just what I said, and then the, the, the spirit disappeared down into the toilet and he looked in there along with some other people and there was a huge, massive maze like structure of many, many rooms underneath and I thought, well that's actually quite a common representation and dreams, but does that remind anyone of anything? Anything that's not unbelievably pathological.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       It's like this. It's like the story in the second part of Harry Potter, right? Do you remember that? So you have morning myrtle. She inhabits the bathroom. She's always diving into toilets and don't they find the, the understructure of hogwarts by going through that bathroom in, into the, into the subterranean elements. Yeah. So, so that's a good that, that realm of symbolism is something like underneath this is exactly what the case is with the second Harry Potter stories that underneath the edifice of culture, and that would be hard word sit. In that particular story, there is a subterranean realm, and in that subterranean realm learn things that can paralyze you. If you look at them. That's the [inaudible]. Now, what do you think happens if a rabbit sees a Fox, what does it do?

Speaker 2:          00:12:51       It phrases. Why are absolutely right? They had rabbit assumes that it's camouflaged and so as long as it doesn't move, then maybe there's some chance that the Predator won't see it, and so the idea that you turned to stone, when you look at something that's predatory and Reptilian, I've been. That's an old idea. You know, God only knows how old that is. It's probably about as old as mammals. I suspect it's something in the neighborhood of 60 million years old, maybe even older than that because it was at that point that our primitive ancestors were living in trees and being preyed upon by by snakes. Mostly because our ancestors back six, 2 billion years ago, got eaten by snakes quite a lot. They seem to have coevolved with us. In fact, there's some evidence from a woman named Lynn Isabelle, who's quite an interesting scholar that the reason that we can see so well is actually because we learned, we developed our vision to detect predatory reptiles, most particularly snakes, and the way she found that out.

Speaker 2:          00:13:50       It was by because human beings have amazing eyes. Hey, we can see like no other animal except for raptors, except for birds of prey. They can see better than us, but as far as primates go, man, we knock it out of the park. And mammals too. We've got amazing vision and what Isabelle did was look around the world to see, um, what predicted, how accurate the eyesight of primates. We're in different locales. And what she found was there's a powerful relationship with the presence of predatory snakes. That's an extraordinarily cool thing. And you know, it gives you some, it gives you some insight into the level of depth that might be involved in the analysis of the symbolic realm, you know, in the, in the Harry Potter, the Harry Potter story. The second, the second story is almost a precise duplicate of the story of St George. And if you look up St George on the net, if you Google St George, you'll see that St George is usually on a horse. And what he's doing is slaying a dragon. Usually it's not a very big dragon usually, but it's bigger than his horse. But it's particularly nasty looking and it comes out of a cave and he frees a virgin from its grasp. That's exactly what happens in Harry Potter, right? Because it's jenny that's down there. And remember Harry gets eaten by the are bitten by the bass list. Great. And it's kind of poisoned, right? And so he's going to die. And then what happens?

Speaker 2:          00:15:10       Yeah. Phoenix comes. And so what's a phoenix? It's, yeah, it's a symbol of death and rebirth. Exactly, exactly. And so what the story that Harry Potter story says is that if you're fighting a dragon, a snake, something terrible, something that will paralyze you if you look at it and you're doing that in order to redeem something that redeemed something from that encounter, because you often learn things when you do something that you're afraid of. In fact, almost all learning occurs in spite of fear, right? Because to, to learn something, you have to explore something new and that's usually something that's frightening. And so what that means is that if you're willing to face something that's frightening, you can garner something of value. Now I'd also meat. It also may well mean in the context of that story and you see this in the romance that underlies the first part of Harry Potter is that you know, the man who's capable of standing up to predatory reptiles is also the one who is most likely to attract women.

Speaker 2:          00:16:09       And I think that that's been a truth since God only knows when to. We have no idea, but human beings are definitely hunters, right? And men are bigger than women. And one of the things that that suggest is that you know, a lot of the predatory like activities that are characteristic human beings were undertaken by males and some usually males that hunt. But anyways, we can. We can put all that. We can put all that aside. Harry gets bitten by this Basler can. Part of the reason that this story shows that is because it wants to tell you, the story wants to tell you, so to speak, that the danger that you faced when you voluntarily confront something you're afraid of in order to learn is actually a danger. It's a real. You see it in example like that too in the avengers. Um, I don't remember the guy's name. He's the black guy with the patch over his eye. Who is that?

Speaker 2:          00:17:02       Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, that, that, that, the representation of the, of the one eyed hero is also quite common. And you see this, for example, in ancient Egyptian mythology, there's a god named horace who all talked to you about. In fact, I'm going to see. There's a picture of horace, actually horses. The God on the left there on the picture of the left, he's got a face like a, uh, like a falcon. And that's because Falcons can see. And the reason the Egyptians turned horse into a falcon is because horace is the eye. You've seen all seen the famous Egyptian I, horace can see one of the things he sees is evil and that actually he has an encounter with evil. And as a consequence, one of his eyes gets torn out. An idea there is that, you know, you have to face evil.

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       It will just like you have to confront fear. It's fear can paralyze you in. And the things that make you afraid can kill you and in a confrontation with evil, the same thing can happen is that it can be so overpowering and traumatic that it damages your consciousness and like these things are, these things are real. They are real. I mean that, that happened to a, what's the general's name? A Canadian general who was there during the Rwandan massacre. He developed post traumatic stress disorder and he entitled the book he wrote about the development of his posttraumatic stress disorder was called shake hands with the devil. And that's really what he meant because he, he met one of the guys who led the massacre, you know, and anyways, he never really recovered from that. He has posttraumatic stress disorder. And so these things are extraordinary.

Speaker 2:          00:18:32       Real. Now, back to the basilisk. Well, if you're going to confront something that's dangerous enough and informative enough to like virtually kill you and you're going to survive, what does that mean? It means that your capacity for death and renewal is what saves you. And so you know, giving you think, you think about this. Partly what it means is that like there you are, but you learn something, okay, well, once you learn something, you're not the same as you were before you learned it, right? There's a transformation, so that means you're the same as you are because you're still there, but you're also different and then you might also ask yourself, well, what do you give up when you learn something, and that's an interesting question because you very seldom learn something that's completely without precedent. Now if you do, that's really shocking January, but you generally don't.

Speaker 2:          00:19:27       What happens is that you already have a framework of evaluation that you're using to interpret the world and you know it's good enough to get you from place to place, but it's not 100 percent accurate and when you encounter something you didn't expect or something that's frightening so that you have to transform your knowledge. Generally what happens is you have to lose some of what you already presumed before you can learn something new. You know, it's like a prejudice or an oversimplification or an element of your ignorance has to be allowed to die before you can incorporate the information and then grow. And so you might say, well, death is the precondition for learning at least symbolically speaking, and that's exactly what the Phoenix is attempting to represent in the Harry Potter story. Now, who owns the Phoenix Dumbledore, right? And he's sort of God of hogwarts, so to speak.

Speaker 2:          00:20:15       You know, so. So the, the Phoenix stands in the same relationship to Dumbledore that Christ stands in relationship to God, the father in Christianity. It's exactly the same kind of idea. While it's not exactly the same obviously, but the underlying structure of the idea is very similar. And if you remember maybe what happens to Harry Potter at the very end of the, of the series, what, what, what process does he have to go through? He dies, right? And then he comes back to life, right? And he has to die and come back to life in order to defeat. It's pretty funny because you know, a lot of people especially fundamentalist in the US where all over Harry Potter for it's hypothetically Antichristian oh cultism. But you know, the fundamental story, I wouldn't say it's Christian exactly because it's actually older than Christianity itself, but the main themes in Harry Potter are like Christian symbolism in the main themes to a great degree.

Speaker 2:          00:21:11       You know, and it's funny because most of the time when you go see this sort of thing, how many of you watched all the Harry Potter movies? Yeah. Like what the hell's up with that? You know, this woman got people reading 700 page books and when they were 10 years old, I, I suspect a lot of you were those people, you know, so why were you so interested in that stuff? God's sake. It's about a magic orphan. What's wrong with you people, you know, magic orphans, you know, but for some reason why an orphan, well superman's an orphan to. And if you go on Wikipedia, it's kind of an interesting thing to do. Look up superhero orphans. It's like 500 of them, you know? And it's, that's a very comp goes along. It also goes along with the idea of having two sets of parents, which is also characteristic both of superman and of Harry Potter, right?

Speaker 2:          00:21:58       Because Harry has his daily day to day, you know, parents that aren't as real parents and then he has his heavenly parents who are as magic parents and you know, this representation here that I've got up in front of you and I was telling you a little bit about that in the last lecture you could say in some sense those are representations of your magic parents and so you can think about it this way. It's like you have a mother and a father and those are your local mothers and fathers and whether or not you get along with them or whether or not they were any good for you or whether you understand them or anything like that in some sense is irrelevant because they're not your real parents, your real parents or something. More like nature biology, the unknown. Something like that. And culture.

Speaker 2:          00:22:41       We kind of think of that as nature and nurture, you know, which is also a symbolic idea, and so one of the things that young thought Freud thought you couldn't be a man until your father died suddenly kind of an interesting idea and young said, yeah, but the death could be symbolic, and partly what he meant by that was that you know in so far as you're still the son of your father or the daughter of your father or the son of your mother or the daughter of your mother, you still haven't grown up. You haven't taken the projections, and those will be Friday and projections that make you subordinate to your parents because you might ask yourself, why the hell do you care what your parents think? You don't care what any random set of 50, 60 year old people think about you. Why do you care what your parents think?

Speaker 2:          00:23:24       Well, the reason for that I would say is because you're suffering or benefiting as a consequence of a projection. You project something onto your parents. It's like a quasi identity status and they're the people who know what's going on and they're, you know, they're entitled to evaluate you and maybe you're working to achieve things to impress them and make them happy. It's like, well, why them? Why them? You don't care what their parents, friends think. I don't imagine you probably don't really care what the parents of your friends think. So why do you care what your parents think? Well, understanding that is part of coming to understand the dynamics. Freud would say, of the personal unconscious because your relationship with your parents as part of your personal unconscious and young's idea was, well, you have to replace. It's interesting because Freud thought that the reason there were patriarchal religions was because people projected the figure of their father onto the cosmos in some sense.

Speaker 2:          00:24:23       They sort of personified the cosmos. You know, it's like God is an old man with a beard, which by the way isn't a stupid theory as it sounds like. But anyways. Um, so you know, Freud thought that religion sort of emerged out of the familial dynamic, but young thought that that wasn't exactly right because the religious symbols like say the one on the right there where you have God, the father was representing something like a metta father, you know the sum total of all fathers, which would be something like the Patriarchy and you need a representation of that because you are a child of culture and if you're not a child of culture, then you're an incomplete being and you also don't want to confuse your parents or your father. Let's say. I mean there's masculine and feminine elements in both parents, but for the sake of simplification, I'm going to lay it out the way I am laying. You know, you don't want to confuse your father with culture or history. It gives the embodiment of both those things, but he certainly doesn't embody it in total and your primary relationship in some sense, your personal relationship is to your father, but your primary existential relationship is actually to culture itself.

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       Now,

Speaker 2:          00:25:29       I can give you an example of that to a quick example. How many have you Seen Poor Pinocchio? Yeah, so anybody not. Well you, you should watch it. It's a great movie. It's a bit dated and in some of its bit preachy, but fundamentally they knocked it out of the park. So Pinocchio is this fake thing, right? He's like this artificial boys made by Japan, who's was a pretty good guy. What's Pinocchio trying to do? Right, right. Well hopefully that's part of what you're trying to do and hopefully that's a process that this class could conceivably further. So what is Pinocchio have to do in relationship to his father in order to become real?

Speaker 2:          00:26:14       He rescues him, right? What does he do? He goes down to the bottom of the ocean. Was He fine? They're a whale. Weirdly enough. And really weirdly enough, you know, I don't know what a puppet is doing on the bottom of the ocean looking for a whale, but apparently it swallowed his father, which also none of that makes any sense at all. You realize it makes no sense, but of course you're in there like following it and thinking, yeah, well I can. You know I can suspend disbelief. You know, it's just a puppet, wouldn't pop it and it's looking for his father at bottom of the ocean in a whale. Oil makes it doesn't make any sense at all, right? It makes no sense whatsoever, but it's a mythological motif and part of that motif. It's a death and rebirth motif that going down to the bottom of the ocean and being devoured by something and then coming back up, so that's a death and rebirth Motif, but even more importantly, the motif there suggests that you can't stop being a puppet Marionette, somebody else's pulling your strings.

Speaker 2:          00:27:07       Something else is pulling your strengths. You're a Marionette till you rescue your father from the bottom of the ocean, and what does that mean? Well, it means that you're a puppet of forces. You do not understand probably prevailing political attitudes or radiologists or something pathetic like that until you make the attempt to dive down into the depths and reclaim your identity with history as a phenomena. You know, because you might say, well why should you study history? It's like, well, history is you, you know, if you're, if you're not studying history with the understanding that you're studying yourself, then you don't know what the hell you're doing and you can't be a complete person because we're culture where cultural people were cultural creatures. You can't be a full person until you catalyze your identity with your culture and it's, it's like an existential obligation. So, and if you don't do it then you're going to feel all nihilistic and weak or you're going to be old totalitarian and self righteous and oppressive and you know, maybe genocidal and deadly.

Speaker 2:          00:28:08       So it's, it's not something that you can just brush off, you have to do it. It's part of an initiation motif by the way, which we're also going to talk about. So. So that's some, it's hard to talk about symbolism and you'll notice, especially in the first part of the lecture, is that my lectures are, well, I like to think about them as impressionist. And there's a reason for this. Like I started reading young about 30 years ago, I would say, and I pretty much read everything he wrote, which is an awful lot and it's very difficult to read you because there's not precisely a linear narrative, but the reason for that is that it's very difficult to construct a linear narrative about information that's been primarily transmitted in images and so in order to to impart the knowledge, you have to give people like some pictures of the whole picture.

Speaker 2:          00:29:00       It's almost like like laying them out in space in a sense and so that if you get enough of those little sub pictures, the whole thing will click into focus and you'll think, Aha, I get that. But wandering through it in a linear manner is extraordinarily difficult. In fact, I don't think it's possible. I also think that's why the kind of information that's embodied in symbols is generally not transmitted as linear articulated knowledge. You can't transmit it that way. And so it remains in forums like this. You look at those pictures, you know, so think about those pictures for a minute. Okay. Is the picture on the left? So that's ancient Egypt, ancient Egypt law lasted for longer than Western, said if you don't include Egypt as part of Western civilization, it's certainly lasted longer than what we generally consider Western civilization. It lasted for thousands and thousands of years.

Speaker 2:          00:29:51       Right? And those images are representations of the fundamental assumptions of Egyptian culture. And so those images had foundational power for eons, for thousands and thousands of years. You know, when you can just look at them and nothing happens to you, you, you know, you look at them like they're photographs or, or blow our flat images, but they had the kind of motive power that drove an entire culture for thousands and thousands of years. You know, they had more motive power than communist ideology for example, which only managed to motivate people for about 50 years and you know, but it's certainly possible that they had more motive power than Christian ideas which have only been around for roughly 2000 years. You know. So when you're looking at something like that, you're looking at something with power and the idea that you know that that symbolic representations or religious represented representations are, what do you call a unsophisticated empirical theories, like that's an idiotic theory, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:30:51       No, I don't think that anybody who's educated should be, should be proposing such a thing after more than 100 years of psychoanalytic and anthropological investigation. It's just not a tenable theory anymore. So. So what are the other people up to? Well, let's look. Let's look at the left hand side. I can tell you a little bit about what the Egyptians were trying to figure out. So on the right hand side of the picture, you have isis, okay? And now isis is goddess of the underworld and she's also a goddess of chaos. And so she's the goddess of the place that you go when things fall apart around you. And it's worthwhile thinking of that as a domain. And you know what that's like. So okay, so a dream falls apart or revision falls apart, or you get dumped by someone you love or you get betrayed or you fail.

Speaker 2:          00:31:37       Or maybe you just have, you know, maybe you have a, Ah, maybe you have clinical depression or you're hyper anxious, or you know, you have some negative emotion pathology. Well, that's a state of being right. You can think about it as a place and that place is the underworld. The underworld is where you go when things fall apart. And the representation for the Egyptians of the underworld was primarily isis. She was the persona find figure that represented the domain that was underneath normative knowledge and the reason she was female. It's very complicated and I'd really, like I said last time, I really don't have time to explain it in depth unfortunately, but part of the reason that the underworld is given feminine qualities. There's, there's lots of reasons, but one of them is, is that that kind of the defining feature of the feminine is that from which new forms emerge, that's almost, that's almost like there's other ways of defining female, but that's our feminine.

Speaker 2:          00:32:34       But that's a pretty good one. It's pretty universal one. And the unknown is feminine because the unknown is the place from which all new forms emerge. Right? So when you interact with the unknown on a voluntary basis, which can be symbolized sexually, which often happened with Freud's thinking and with his clients, you bring forth something new and so it's a terrifying place to descend into. It can be hellish because hale is actually like the worst suburb of the unknown and I'm sure some of you have been there too, so, or maybe you're there now or maybe you know, people who were there. So it's a very, very rough place to visit, especially if you do it accidentally, but you, if you go there, especially accidentally, you might never come out. But if you do come out, maybe you've learned something, maybe you're new in some way. And that's another reason in some sense why the feminine is a symbolic representation of the unknown because there is a death and rebirth motif there. And birth has always associated with the feminine. So, um, can I remember the word?

Speaker 2:          00:33:46       No, I can't. The Baptismal Fountain Inn in Christian ceremony. So baptism ceremonies has a Latin word that is basically equivalent to uterus. So you can look that up if you want. I can't, unfortunately, I can't exactly remember the word, but it's the same idea. You're being plunged back into the feminine underpinnings of everything and then pulled back up and. Well, that's what a baptism is supposed to be. You're supposed to be born into this spirit instead of into matter. And that means that you've emerged as a, as a, um, articulated being that isn't merely a biological product. It's something like that. So, all right, so that's, that's isis. And Isis is the, the wife of Ho of ocirus or Cyrus who's in the middle, standing on a pillar there. He's the father and he's a pillar because culture is like the pillars that hold things up. And so in the Egyptian story or Cyrus was an old king and he was kind of willfully blind.

Speaker 2:          00:34:42       He didn't really know what was going on anymore and he didn't pay sufficient attention. And he had an evil brother by the way, whose name was seth and seth average eventually chops them up, wants to take over the kingdom and scattered them all over the kingdom. He can't kill him because he's a god and isis comes up from the underworld and fines. Those Cyrus's salice and makes herself pregnant and she gives birth to horace. Who's the guy on the left and horace is sort of like King Arthur were any number of orphans. He grows up or or like a lion and the lion king, Simba. Simba grows up basically outside of the damage kingdom, right? It's taken over by scar. It's exactly the same story. It's a really. It's exactly the same story and horace grows up outside the kingdom and when he grows up, he can really see horus.

Speaker 2:          00:35:32       That's why the symbol is the eye. He goes back and he can see evil. He's not blind like his father, which is the difference between you guys and dead culture, right? So your cultural organisms, but you're not dead. You can see and you can update yourself. So you're like the living embodiments of history and the living embodiments of history have to know what history is and incorporated into themselves, but also be awake enough to alternate where that alteration is necessary, especially when they're doing that to further their knowledge of the unknown and also to triumph over evil. So anyways, horace grows up outside, but like he can see he's different than, oh, Cyrus. Partly because he's young and he knows that his uncle is evil and he goes back and has a terrible fight with them. And during the fight, seth, his uncle terrorists out one of his eyes because it's no joke to confront evil.

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       It's no joke. It can damage your consciousness. Anyways, horse wins and he gets his id back and then he banishes seth to the Nether regions of the kingdom because he can't get rid of him either. You can't kill him. He's the potential for corruption in an institution is always there. So there's no permanently get rid of it. There's only controlling it from time to time anyways. So he gets his id back and then instead of putting it back in his head and be in king, which you'd expect them to do, he goes back down to the underworld and he finds his father there because his father chopped up is also a spirit who inhabits the underworld and he gives his father the eye and then the two of them go back and rule the kingdom together. I tell you, it's one of the world's most brilliant stories. It's a staggeringly brilliant story because it says

Speaker 2:          00:37:17       the act, that act of youth should be the guiding property of the state because the horace. So Cyrus combination was actually what the Pharaoh imitated when he was being a good feral. It's dynamic vision. That should be the guiding principle of the state, but it should be allied with tradition. It's brilliant. You know, it's one of the things that the radical revolutionaries of the 19 sixties never figured out. It's like, well, don't trust anybody over 30. Well that's a really stupid idea, especially since you're going to spend half two thirds of your life over 30 the hell good. Is that. So the idea is that you're supposed to embody your tradition, men be awake at the same time, and then if you do that, then you'd be a good ruler of, you know, of yourself, of your little family, and if you have an opportunity to, beyond that then of whatever organizations you have to be happened to be involved in, that's exactly what should be happening to you university. It's the whole point of going to university, you know, it's not a trade school. Not, not that there's anything wrong with trade schools, quite the contrary, but that's not what university is for. It's to turn you into creatures that aren't marionettes. And to do that you have to follow a mythological path or you can be chaotic and random. Those are or sub, like I said, subject to so many idiotic totalitarian ideology. But you know, I wouldn't it either of those paths because they're not going to get you very far for very long.

Speaker 2:          00:38:41       So that's the Egyptians. Brilliant. And it's not like they understood that story.

Speaker 2:          00:38:48       They told it. That's different. It's just like, can you think, well, how can you tell something you don't understand? It's just like you can watch Harry Potter and not have a clue what's going on. It's exactly the same thing. And part of it is, is that there are, you have levels of understanding that make you up, but you don't simultaneously understand. You can't articulate them. So you're a multi levered, multilevel creature and the part of you that's conscious and articulate is floating on a massive substructure that's neither conscious nor articulate, you know, that's in some sense striving to become conscious and articulate, but that can never be completely either of those things. So it's part of the pain of being half spirit and half matter.

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       And

Speaker 2:          00:39:36       so then on the right, you know, you have another set of symbols which are quite similar. Um, although, you know, they come about the story in a completely different way. So I told you a little bit about them before you have Mary at the top and she's regardless, she's, she's represented here is that which encloses everything, right? And so in that representation,

Speaker 2:          00:39:57       culture is the child of nature. That's one way of looking at the statute. There are many ways of looking at this statue. That's the other thing that's strange about symbolic representations because in some sense you can't exhaust them with words. There's always something more you can say about them and that's partly because they're, they're associated with everything. And so if something is associated with everything, then you can talk about it forever and you'll never run out of things to say there are inexhaustible. So, and you have God the father who we already talked about. And then if you notice in that image, I hope you can see that the figure is open and there's a crowd of people gathered around, right? And they're all looking at the central symbol, which is the crucifix. And you know, you might be thinking that, you know, billions of people over the last 2000 years have spent a substantial amount of time doing nothing but gazing at the crucifix. It's like why,

Speaker 2:          00:40:52       you know, in one answer as well, those people are all superstitious. They believe in stupid things like, you know, death and resurrection and you know the Virgin birth and all those things that make no empirical sense. It's like, yeah, well think again. You know, it's not a matter of simplistic belief. It's a matter of belief structures that are so profound that you can't articulate them. You don't know what they mean, and so to gaze on the figure of the dying and resurrecting hero is to understand that a huge part of what redeems you in life from evil and from the things that terrify you is your capacity to let go of things that are outmoded in dad and to revitalize them as a consequence of new learning. And that's the very soul. It's your very soul. It's a very. It's the, it's the living part of you.

Speaker 2:          00:41:38       And that's the part. The thing that's so interesting about this is according to the wisdom traditions of mankind, that's the part of your spirit that protects you against fear and pain. Because you might say, well, you know, if you don't want fear, you don't want pain. You should build a big wall around yourself and wrap yourself up in Styrofoam and sit right in the middle where nothing bad is ever going to happen to you, but you know, first of all, that's obviously ridiculous and second of all, you die of boredom in no time flat. If you did that, you cannot be protected from the things that frighten you and hurt you. But if you identify with the part of your being that has the capacity for transformation, then you're always. You're always. You're always the equal of what it is that's opposing you or maybe more than the equal of it so you can either depend on the walls that protect you from things.

Speaker 2:          00:42:29       And so those could be like actual walls or cultural walls or totalitarian beliefs are rigid thought patterns or anything like that. Or you can rely instead on the part of you that's voluntarily able to confront things that are frightening and painful and triumph. And the deepest story of, of humankind is that that's the part of us that's the most powerful. You know, weak as we are and subject as we are to all sorts of terrible things. What do you need for protection? That's what you need. You have to be willing to let go and come back and let go and come back and then you can stay dynamic through your, through the ups and downs of your life and makes you incredibly strong. And so, you know, one of the things that you could think about in relationship to this, and we'll talk about this more when we talk about Carl Rogers.

Speaker 2:          00:43:21       Rogers talked a lot about the importance of listening. You know, he said most people can't listen because what they want to do instead is imposed their viewpoint on the other person. Because if you listen to people, they're going to tell you all sorts of weird nonsense about their own lives and about what they think. And you know, some of it's gonna be. It'll say it'll set you back. You don't want to hear that. People have gone through that until I actually understand their opinions. If you can listen to them, well then you can open up an exchange of information and that can transform both of you and Rogers regarded that as an absolute necessity in the therapeutic context and even in the context of profound relationships. But he said, you know, most people won't do that because they want to cling to what they already have.

Speaker 2:          00:44:02       And so one of the things you can think of, and this is, this is worth thinking about for five years here. Here's something to think about. What's your friend? The things you know or the things you don't know. First of all, there's a lot more things you don't know. And second the things you don't know are the bar is the birthplace of all your new knowledge. And so if you make the things you don't know your friend, instead of the things that you know, well then you're always on a quest. In a sense, you're always looking for new information on the off chance that somebody that doesn't agree with you will tell you something. You couldn't figure it out on your own. It's a completely different way of looking at the world, so it's the antithesis of opinionated, so. Okay, so here's some you can think of these terms.

Speaker 2:          00:44:56       Let me give you an example. So I was just reading this research paper by one of the people in our department and he was looking at. He's found out that people are better than chance at determining sexual orientation when they look at cropped faces that are gray scaled with no hair for 50 to 100 milliseconds. That's pretty fast a, it's like you're not thinking about it at that speed. It takes you half a second to think about something maybe a little less, but 50 milliseconds to 100 milliseconds. Man, that's automatic processing. Okay, so he found that if you show people faces, then they can predict with better than chance levels of accurately accuracy what the sexual orientation of the person next. Now we don't know exactly how they do that, do that, but the other thing he found is that if you're exposed to say to a face that you judge as a homosexual, let's say, and then you're given a bunch of cognitive tasks where if you stare, if you use the articulated stereotypes of homosexual people, you'll perform better that you do perform better, so you see a face that you instantly categorize as homosexual.

Speaker 2:          00:46:09       Then you're given a cognitive test that you can do better at. If you rely on cognitive stereotypes and you do do better on it. So what that means is the brief perceptual exposure activates a whole complex of associated ideas and it's not exactly obvious why those things are associated it. You might say, well, what does it mean to be gay or for that matter? What does it mean to be straight? Well, it means a whole bunch of things and you probably couldn't tell me all of the things that it means in some of the. Some of them are things that you perceive rather than fake. No matter when you're exposed to that particular image. That entire complex of associations, which is like a map, the mapping of a personality, right? Because to be gay is to be a personality of a certain sort. It's to embody a certain mode of being and so you have a picture of that personality that's partly made out of all your cognitive assumptions and that can be activated at 50 milliseconds by exposure to just a black and white picture.

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       Okay, so that's like a complex. Just so you know, you'll hear about the idea of complex when you read, when you read you and a complex is a set of associated ideas that tend to take on embodied form and you might ask, well why would ideas tend to take on embodied form? And then answer to that is what the hell is an idea if it doesn't take on embodied form your embodied. So to say that it ideas useful and you make that judgment. By the way, when you find an idea interesting because like why is it interesting? You don't know. Which is also something that's really worth thinking about. Right? Because to be interested in something is to be in the grip of a particular mode of being and you don't have any voluntary control over that. Some things you find interesting and some things you don't and you know, you might say, well I'm going to concentrate on this boring thing as hard as I can because I have to master it.

Speaker 2:          00:48:01       Maybe after passing an exam or something, it's like good luck trying to get your unconscious to cooperate because usually it won't. You know, you'll be thinking about, oh God only knows what you'll be thinking about doing the dishes, vacuuming up under the bed, like anything not to concentrate on that particular boring piece of information. So back to the back to the complex and the idea that ideas are embodied. If an idea can't be embodied, you have to ask yourself if it has any utility because there's a trillion facts, right? I mean you could go, right, you can go on Google and write down facts until you died and then you still wouldn't have got anywhere near the whole number of facts there are. So then you might ask, well, what good are Fox? If there's an infinite number of them and the answered that is there actually not much good at all, unless you have a purpose for them and if you have a purpose for them, then the fact becomes embodied because you either use it to change your perception or you use it to guide your actions and that's when it becomes meaningful.

Speaker 2:          00:49:01       And so you might say in part that a complex is the tendency of a group of associated ideas to manifest themselves in something approximating a personality. And then that also gives you a real key to what the psychoanalysts were up to because as far as they're concerned, you're just chalked full of complexes. And you know, we, you know, you think about yourself is one thing which is foolish because you know, you're obviously, you're kind of like a loose collection of microorganisms, something like that. And there's a certain amount of unity because he moved the same way. And there's, you know, there's continuity of memory, but the representational space that you occupy, you know, what you can do with your body and what you can imagine, what you can think is, is very, very large and it's not necessarily coherent or consistent and it switches from moment to moment, you know, so you'll know that some of you undoubtedly have already experienced what it's like to be possessed by a particularly stupid idea.

Speaker 2:          00:49:57       You know, so maybe you've grown out of one or two of the stupid ideas that possessed you or maybe you're possessed by an attraction to someone you can't control or you can't control your eating behavior or you, you know, you're a pushover when it comes to interpersonal interactions because you're too agreeable or you fly off the handle and fight and you know, none of this is really under your control. And so all of those things that manifest themselves not only in your behaviors but in your perceptions, your perceptions of themselves, you know, they tend to take on embodied form and use you as the vehicle for their activity. So you know, when you're thinking about something like anger for example, think about how it works because it's quite peculiar. What must someone generally do? How much someone generally act if you're going to be angry at them, they have to be irritating, right?

Speaker 2:          00:50:55       You know they have to provoke you in some way. Well, the mere fact that you perceive what they're doing is irritating or provoking, doesn't ensure that anyone else would have thought about it as irritating, are provoking or that that's what they meant or that that's what's happening. And my point is, my point is it's very important to think about these complexes of ideas as subpersonalities because otherwise you really don't get what they're like. If you're angry, if you have a proclivity towards anger, especially if it's an unthinking proclivity. Anything that someone says might irritate you and it isn't like they say something and you think about it and then you get irritated. It's like you perceive the person as irritating. You know, maybe it's just the way they hold their mouth or something, it, it. It can be very, very subtle. And you might say, well, it's not me.

Speaker 2:          00:51:41       It's you, it's not that I'm irritated by you, it's the you're irritating and that you know that's a very difficult thing to settle because the reality is somewhere between the subjective and the objective, right? A lot of arguments that you'll have with people throughout your life are about exactly that. Am I, are you irritating or am I over sensitive? It's like, well, you know what? We're going to hash that out for a good long time before we figure it out, but the point is is that if you're possessed by an emotional state or a motivational state or an idea or some kind of complex, you'll see the world through its eyes and then the facts reveal themselves to you through the lens of that particular set of ideas. So it's very frightening idea because you know, we like to think of ourselves as masters of our own house, which is completely clueless because it's obvious if you watch yourself for like a month that you hardly ever do what you tell yourself to do, when you're liable to do all sorts of other things that you don't even want to do.

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       You know, because you say, well, I'm going to go to the gym three times a week and I'm not going to drink, you know, and maybe there's this person I'm not going to associate with and then you know, you don't go to the gym and you find that person and you go out and drink with them and you think, what the hell is going on? You know? Um, but it's, it's, it's you, you're not the sort of person that will do what you say. And so like, what sort of person are you? Well, that's a psychoanalytic question and it's a deep one because you're a peculiar thing and there's parts of you that are really, really, really old and you know, that sort of naive view, the naive young you that you think of yourself as is like a little piece of flotsam in an ocean of complexity.

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       And the ocean of complexity is you. And part of diving down into the depths is to start to understand what it means to be human and all right, whatever that means. It's the one thing you can say about it for sure is that it's bloody peculiar. So here are some associations have ideas that go along with these symbolic representations that I was describing. So the feminine is off the nature, and here's some associations. They're not necessary associations. There are common associations, so if you see these sorts of things, they would make a narrative sense. So for example, if you see an old and somewhat evil woman in an animated movie and she lives in the swamp, that makes sense. Now, why does it make sense? Well, I can't explain that at the moment, but. Well, it's partly because of the swamp is outside of the standard boat borders of civilization and it's also a place of death, decay and rebirth. So that's part of it. Anyways. Some associations nature, the is the unconscious. Why is the unconscious nature? Well, because you can't control it. It just manifests itself within you. That's the Friday and the. It's like dreams. They happen. You don't know what they mean. They just happen and so that's nature operating inside of you. The terrors of the darkness. Why? Well, remember when you were a little kid, you're three and you're afraid of the dark because kids at three are afraid of the dark. What's in the dark?

Speaker 2:          00:54:46       What are you looking for in your closet? Monsters, right? Where are the monsters?

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       Well, they're not in your closet. Hopefully so. But that's not to say that there couldn't be a monster in your closet and it's also not to say that when you look at your closet, when you're a little kid that you're looking at your closet, maybe you're looking at the darkness and then the question of whether or not there are monsters in the darkness gets a lot more complicated. I had a client once who was agoraphobic and she didn't like to take elevators, which is quite a common phenomena for people who are agoraphobic and so I was doing standard exposure which is voluntary exposure to the unknown, which is a prime curative process in psychotherapy. It's like find out what you're afraid of. It's interfering with your movement forward. Break it into small pieces and expose yourself to it. That works. So we go to the elevator and you know, I say, well how close can you get to the elevator without being nervous?

Speaker 2:          00:55:44       So she stands like 10 feet away. I said, okay, well stand there until your board and then go three steps forward so she could do that and you know, made her a little nervous. And then I said, well, I'll stand there until your board and make sure you're looking at the elevator and not avoiding it and then take another three steps forward and okay, we keep doing that until she's like at the elevator. So then I say, well here's the deal, we're just going to let the elevator doors open. You don't have to get on. We'll let them close and then that's it for, for today, you know. And I always tell people when I'm doing that sort of thing that I'm not going to trick them, you know, there's no tricks. It's like you don't have to do anything you don't want to do and I'm not going to play any games on you.

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       So okay, so the door's open and she goes, that's a tube and then it closes. And you think, well, was that an elevator or a tube? And you might think, well obviously it's an elevator. It's like things are not so obvious, you know, because there are many ways of perceiving something and a given entity can be a member of multiple categories at the same time and you say, okay, well yeah, the elevator's not a tube, but it's an enclosed dark place that contains the unknown and when you see an elevator you just see like a conveyance that moves you up and down. But that isn't what she saw. And you might say, well what she saw is wrong. It's like not exactly, but it's not functional, right? Decide if you want to take an elevator then perceiving it as your tomb is probably inappropriate, but the point is is that it has a lot of associations like it's.

Speaker 2:          00:57:16       It's a place of constriction and privation and isolation and separation. And so it has elements of their elements of its being that overlap with other things that are frightening and so agoraphobic are often afraid to have. Being in a subway, being a crowded in the subway, it's partly because they can't get out and make it to the hospital. So when closed places are crowded, places are places where they encountered their mortality because they get afraid they're going to die and then they can't get to the hospital. So you know, they come into a room like this and sit in the middle and they, you, you think, Hey, crowd of students, they think, ah, place of death. And it's like, well, you might say, well no, this is a crowd of students. And I might say, well, what are, how come you're so damn sure. It's not a place of death.

Speaker 2:          00:58:00       Like generally it isn't, but any of you could drop dead of a heart attack in the next five minutes. So why aren't you terrified out of your skulls? Because of that? And the answer to that is you don't know that's the answer because as far as I've been able to tell, most of the things agoraphobic or afraid of like that they might die at any moment actually happens to be true. And so the fact that they're afraid of that, it's like, yeah, no kidding. You're afraid of that. How are other people not afraid of it while that? That's a good question. So that's nature. That's nature. I can tell you another reason. I think why the feminine is nature. I don't know what you guys think about this, but I was pretty happy when I thought this up and it took me a long time. So. So if you think about the world in Darwinian terms, right? It's a struggle for survival and reproduction, which are basically the same thing. Survival is you, but reproduction is the survival of your genes. So it's a, it's a survival issue over very long spans of time. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:09       What do we call the selection mechanism,

Speaker 2:          00:59:13       right? Natural selection, right? It's nature. Who does the selection. Okay. So let me tell you something that makes female humans different than female chimps. I mean, there's lots of things that they do, but. So. But here, here's an important one. If you look at which male and a female in a chimp troop fathers, most of the offspring, it's the dominant male. But the reason for that isn't because the female chimps sort of flock around the dominant male. Now that happens in other species, but it doesn't happen with chimps. What happens is the dominant male chases all the subordinate males away and will interfere with any sexual behavior they manifest. They'll chase them away. The females though are perfectly happy to meet with a subordinate male if they're in heat and they get the opportunity. So they go into heat, which is something that doesn't happen with female humans.

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       And they really don't care who they meet with. Okay. Female humans are much different than that. They're picky. So there, there are really, they're choosy. It's a big deal. It's a big deal that they're choosing. So there's this famous psychology experiments you've probably heard about. These were undergraduate mail goes out and you know, asks random women if they'll go home and sleep with him, have sex with him, and you know, what are they, what happens? I mean generally they say get away from me, creep or something like that. Right? Are they certainly indicate no, but then they do the reverse experiment where they have a female undergraduate goal, you know, proposition essentially males and. Well, what happens then? Well, the males say yes much more often than the females to. Okay. I'm sure that doesn't come as a surprise to any of you and you know, part of the reason for that, who knows?

Speaker 2:          01:00:57       But part of the reason is that sex is much more dangerous proposition for women than it is for men because they have to bear the consequences. Literally if something, if the logically appropriate thing happens, which is they get pregnant. So at least in principle, women recognize that and you know, they're a bit more cautious, although there's more to it too because women also seem to evaluate men for their fitness. Now. So lots of men have no sexual partners and they have no children. That's not the case with women. Almost all women have one child or more and it's a rare woman indeed who cannot find a sexual partner. Now, Roy balmeister indicated, and you're going to have to think this through because it doesn't make sense on first encounter. You have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors, so what that essentially means is that the success rate, the average success rate for propagation for the typical woman is very high, and the average success rate for the typical man is very low, but some men are hyper procreative.

Speaker 2:          01:02:02       Okay? So men are subject to selection pressure and many of them fail. Here's a, here's an interesting statistic. I think this came from Dataclysm, which is a book that was recently written about one of those online dating sites. Um, the big one, can't remember its name, but he was looking at things like how the typical woman on the dating site rates the typical man. It's pretty funny because women are men actually rate women on a normal distribution. So the typical woman's scores at the 50th percentile and half of them are above average and half of them are below. What do you think the equivalent is for women rating men? And everyone laughs, especially the women. So what do you think it is? It's 85, 15, 85 percent of men are below average. Yeah, it's annoying. You know, unless you happen to be one of the 15 percent who isn't, you know, and those are the 15 percent of the guys who are having all these sexual encounters in a relatively sexually liberated environment to, okay, so why am I telling you all this? Women select men that makes them nature because nature is what select.

Speaker 2:          01:03:15       And so you know, you can say, well, it's only symbolic that women are nature. It's like, no, it's not just symbolic.

Speaker 2:          01:03:21       It's not just symbolic. You know, when the woman in some senses the gatekeeper to rep is not in some sense is the gatekeeper to reproductive success and you can't get more like nature than that. In fact, it's the very definition of nature. So as I said, there are lots of reasons why these symbolic representations are setup the way they are. All right? So that's the great mother nature, the Queen, the Matrix. The Matrix is something from which all things form same root word as matter, mother, all the same root word, the matriarch, the container, the Cornucopia, the object to be fertilized, the source of all things, the on the pregnant,

Speaker 2:          01:04:04       there are more parts of the association network, the strange, the emotional, the foreigner, the place of returning and rest, the deep, the valley, the Clef, the cave hell death and the grave, the moon ruler of the night, and the mysterious dark and matter in the earth. So those aren't necessarily associated with femininity, but they're typically associated with femininity from a symbolic perspective, you know, so like generally like a witch and a movie doesn't come riding out of the full bright sun at noon. Right? That just doesn't happen because it doesn't make sense. It's a dark thing. And so if you saw that occurring in the light and a movie, you'd think, you know, what the hell is going on here? That doesn't make sense. And the reason it doesn't make sense because it's, it violates the, it violates the complex and the symbolic complex. So who is there sort of. Those are sort of female, those are female denizens of the underworld and hell very pleasant creatures. It's like Medusa with the head of snakes, you know, and if you might, if you ask why would a woman have a head of snakes in reference to a man? And that's really simple. I bet there are men here who knew the answer to that.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       Come on Jesus. Think about it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:22       What emotion do you feel when you're going to approach someone you're very attracted to and there's an extremely high probability that she's going to tell you to disappear, right? Exactly. Absolutely. Because it's a real judgment, right? We're going to see a movie called crumb where you'll see this in great detail, but it's a real judgment. It's like the best judgment is, well, I don't mind your physical presence, but your genes should definitely not survive another generation. Right? And that's sort of generally translated into, I think we should just be friends, right? You know when you can blow that off and people do and you have to because it's part of being polite and civilized, but you know, let's make no mistake about it. There is no more fundamental judgment than that, so paralysis and there's no shortage of man. I mean, who are absolutely terrified of women.

Speaker 2:          01:06:15       I mean, I've had many of them in my practice. You know, I had one guy, he was so terrified of women. He couldn't even talk to them on the phone. It's more common than you think so, but it's generally manifested by men who do, who no one cares about. So it's generally irrelevant. So. Well, that's the guts of the case. It really is the case. I'm not kidding. They're low status man. You know, there are people that are generally regarded as losers and there isn't anybody who really gives a damn about what happens to them one way or another and there's a lot more men in that category. Then there are women. Women are in all sorts of, you know, social categories that caused the misery in distress. But that one seems to be predominantly male. One of the things I'm going to do when we talk about Freud is I'm going to show you this movie crumb, which I just told you about and hitch. It's actually, it's very rare thing because it shows you the world from the perspective of very intelligent mail losers and that's just not a perspective you ever see because it's the winners that tell the stories about their life. It's like, who the hell cares about the life of a loser? But this movie is about a loser who became a winner and you know, almost as an act of revenge. And it's great. Great, great, great. Thai examination of the eatable complex. Remarkable. So

Speaker 2:          01:07:33       those are Hindu representations of Kelly.

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       I can tell you a little bit about Kelly here in the middle. Representational use. So, um, she has eight legs, spider spiders spin a web. The web is fate, the web of fate traps. The unwary nature does that. She's in a web of fire. The, a little fire arch there, which is Amanda Carrillo. You can look that up if you want, is also made out of skulls. That's what's on the inside of it. So it's skulls on fire, roughly speaking. Um, her hair is on fire and she has a headdress of skulls. And uh, this guy she's standing on, she just gave birth to him, which is why her belly is hollow and she's eating his intestines. So, you know, and that's a daddy. You might think, well, why would something like that be a day it? And it's something like a wall. It's the sum total of all fears and you know, you might think, well, you don't believe in that sort of thing. It's like, yeah, you do, you just don't know. You do. Of course you do. You can't not believe in it. You know, you're the manner in which you allow it to be represented and what you do with those representations, that's a whole different matter. But you know, you're not watching vampire movies for nothing, right? You say, well, you don't believe in vampires. It's like,

Speaker 2:          01:08:57       that's actually not true. You believe in them enough to go watch them on movies. So like w, w, where are you going to define belief? Exactly. If someone comes up to you and says, do you believe in vampires? You know, you're going to say, well no. And then they'll ask you, well, would you spend like two hours this month watching them? And the answer would be yes. And so you might think, well, which is the better indicator of what you believe. Like what do you know about what you're like, who cares about your statements about yourself, you know, you think you have privileged access to what you're like. You don't. You've only been around for 18 years. You know when you inhabit this body that's been built up over 400 million years of life, something like that. It might be longer than that. So it is longer.

Speaker 2:          01:09:39       I mean that's when crustaceans emerged. Life itself is much older than that. So you know, the people who made this representation of Kelly, assuming they made it, which they really didn't cause it manifested itself in their imagination, which is a completely different thing. They're trying to come to terms with something pretty awful. Or you might say they're trying to come to terms with the category of all awful things. Or You could even be more sophisticated than that. And you could say they're trying to come to terms with the category of all awful things that also reveals new life. That's a terribly paradoxical thing because Kelly can be transformed into something positive. It's like, you know, logical people think, well, something can either be a, it can be a and not a at the same time. Right? That's a fundamental logical proposition. But then, so let's say you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, you don't, you can't hate them and love them at the same time. I mean half your life or three quarters of your life will be in that state. You know, families. It's like, what is it? Fifty slash 50 love and hate. What defines a familiar relationship might be intensity rather than, you know, whether it's love or hate, it's intense. And so you can certainly have a completely paradoxical relationship to yourself or to another person. And so part of what happens with these symbolic representations is that there

Speaker 2:          01:11:04       they're more accurate than mere logic because life is one of those life is composed of oppositions in conjunction and oppositions in conjunction simultaneously. So there's very little about it. It's logical at all, but that doesn't matter because you still have to deal with it. You have to deal with at a very fundamental level, so you could think of that, that that representation there as walk through it. Again,

Speaker 2:          01:11:41       let's take about things you should be afraid of. It's a funny category. Well, an animal wouldn't really have a category of things to be afraid of. What an animal would have, his specific things they're afraid of. Okay, and so then the animal would have to learn what do you do in the face of all those specific things that you're afraid of? So you know, maybe you, I don't know you, you climb a tree if it's. If you're a monkey on it to Jaguar maybe and you go under the underbrush. If you're a monkey on it's a predatory hawk, something like that. You've got these individual escape mechanisms that are tied to the specific stimulus, but then there's human beings who are capable of abstraction and so you might say, well, there's a class of things to be afraid of. It's those things that you should be afraid of.

Speaker 2:          01:12:23       Those are the things that go bump in the night, right? You're always exposed to them when you go to horror movies, especially if they're not the Gore type of horror movie. They're always hinting at something going on outside of your perceptual sphere and they frighten you because you don't know what's out there. And so the Blair witch project was a really good example of that because nothing ever happens in that movie, but it's, you know, it's, it's, it's frightening and not gory. So it's, it's kind of an interesting horror movie. It plays upon the fact that you do have a category of those things to which you should be those things about which you should be afraid. So it's a category frightening things and then and only something capable of abstraction could come up with the category of frightening things. And so Kelly is like an embodied representation of the category of frightening things.

Speaker 2:          01:13:12       And then you might ask yourself, well, once you come up with the concept of the category of frightening things, maybe you could come up with the concept of what to do in the face of frightening things, which is not the same as what do you do when you encounter a lion or what do you do when you encounter someone angry? It's a medical question, right? You could say, you may encounter a frightening thing. What's the thing? What you should do, what should you do about it? But then you could say, at a philosophical level, you will encounter elements of the category of all those things that can frighten and undermine you during your life. Is there something that you can do as a category that would help you deal with that? Well, the answer is yeah, there there are in fact, and that's a lot of what religious stories and symbolic stories are trying to propose to you is the solution to that. One is

Speaker 2:          01:14:07       approach it voluntarily, carefully, but voluntarily don't freeze and runaway explore. Instead, you expose yourself to risk, but you gain knowledge and you wouldn't have a cortex that you know is ridiculously disproportionate. If as a species we hadn't decided that exploration, trump's escape or freezing, it's like we explore that can make you the master of the situation so you can be the master of something like fire instead of just being terrified about. So in one of the things that's absolutely phenomenally fascinating, I think is that one of the things that the Hindus do in relationship to Kelly is offer sacrifices.

Speaker 2:          01:14:48       Say, well, why would you offer sacrifice to what you're afraid of? Well, it's because that is what you do. That's always what you do is you offer up sacrifices to the unknown in the hope that good things will happen to you. So in a sense, you know, you're faced with something terrible. The uncertain future that faces all of you write something you're afraid of. No doubt. I mean, how many of you are worried about your future? Yeah, why? You're all young. You're smart. You're relatively good looking. It's like, what the hell are you worried for? What are you worried about? Yeah, right in this classroom, right? Well maybe you're worried about what you're going to do or who you're gonna marry or what your job's going to be, or you know, your health or your family or there's a whole category of things to be worried about.

Speaker 2:          01:15:37       So then you think, well, you're worried about the future, so what are you doing in university? Well, I would say you're sacrificing your free time in the present to the cosmos, so to speak, in the hope that if you offer up that sacrifice properly, the future will smile on you. And that's another fundamental discovery of the human race. It's a big deal. That discovery. It's like, think about it this way, by changing what you cling to in the present, you can alter the future. Wow. You know, I don't know when we discovered that maybe when we first started to store food or something like that, but it's a mind boggling. It's mind boggling discovery, you know, it's, it's again, it's one of the prime discoveries of human beings.

Speaker 2:          01:16:23       So you represent the thing you're afraid of, then you think, okay, there's a class of things that I'm afraid of that are unknown. What can I do about? Well that's a really good question. It's a sophisticated and complicated question and we do know the answer to some of it. It's like approach cautiously, voluntarily when necessary, don't run. Especially if the thing that's in your way, if the thing that frightens you is opposing your movement towards a valued goal, do not freeze and runaway because the thing will grow if you do that and you'll shrink. So that's a bad strategy. So I'll just give you a bit of a preview about what I'm going to talk to you about the next time we meet. Oh yes. I want to talk to you a little bit about initiation rites and I touched on them in a little bit today when I was talking about things like rescuing the father from the depths. So, but Pinocchio does is essentially an initiation, right? And there are elements of that that are also embedded in the Harry Potter stories because for example, his descent into the unknown underneath the school and his encounter with the Phoenix are all parts of a very complex initiation. Right? Right. And he basically,

Speaker 2:          01:18:01       his adventures set him on a path that makes him the savior of his kingdom. That's fundamentally the entire story of Harry Potter.

Speaker 1:          01:18:11       There are,

Speaker 2:          01:18:13       there are ways of catalyzing that identity and some of them have to do with the fact that you're a multilevel creature. So this is a tough thing to grasp too. You know, when you look at someone you think, well that's what they look like, but you know, it's really not the case in, in very many important ways because they have molecular and micro sub structures that you can't see. You don't see the back of them, you don't see their family, you don't see the political systems that are embedded in and you don't see them across time. Right. So the thing that's there is way more complicated than the thing you see. And one of the ways of starting to pull your pull your conceptions past your senses is to understand that human being exists at multiple levels simultaneously and that part of psychologically expansion of psychological knowledge is to become aware of those levels and to in some sense of move up and down them so that you become conscious of them. And I would say in part the initiations that we're going to talk about

Speaker 1:          01:19:12       are, are

Speaker 2:          01:19:14       embodied dramatizations of the process and move of moving up and down the multiple levels of being a human being exists upon. And that the psychoanalytic process is a subset of that process. So the Freud, Ian's the unions, the people who are interested in symbolism and the unconscious and depth psychology. We're interested in expanding your conception of who you are, beyond what you can articulate. And then you have to ask yourself, well, do you believe that there's more to you than what you can articulate? And if the answer to that is yes, then you might think, well, is that worth exploring? And that's, that's really what we're doing for the next five lectures or so. So we'll see you next Tuesday. No Thursday.
