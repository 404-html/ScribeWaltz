Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       I'm talking today to clear layman who's, who's rich, needed a magazine online called Colette, which I think is become quite popular and quite successful in relatively short period of time and it's certainly a magazine that I've come to admire. It looks like it's staffed by real journalists and so we're going to talk today a little bit about how she's managed that and well in general and about what her, her aims and ambitions are. So I guess we might as well start. Claire, you could introduce yourself to my audience and, and tell, tell them who, who you are and how you managed this.

Speaker 3:          00:00:54       Okay. So, um, I am a former graduate student in psychology, but before I went back to graduate school I, uh, I was working, had a couple of different jobs. My first degree was in English, so I always wanted to be a teacher of literature. Stories had that aesthetic interest. I just had sort of a crisis in my graduate studies where I realized that wasn't for me and I wanted to pursue writing, but I knew there was nowhere that would publish the stuff that I wanted to write. And I thought, well, why don't I build my own platform? And in the back of my mind I knew that there were people that I knew, academics that I knew, um, who would also grab the opportunity to be published.

Speaker 2:          00:01:49       So what made you think that there was nobody there that would publish the sorts of things that you wanted to? Right.

Speaker 3:          00:01:55       Alright. So it's fairly simple. Um, I, I was working on an article about a psychologist called lead Justin, who he's a social psychologist who studies the accuracy of stereotypes. And so it's a, it was a long form, signed a article about a scientific topic but completely contradicts a left wing kind of narratives. And those two things don't find an easy home. So there's a lot of conservative places that, uh, published sort of conservative commentary, but it's often just about economics or some kind of partisan political battle. And it interested in sciences is not very deep. However, the place, the best places for scientific journalism such as the Guardian or wide or scientific American, they weren't going mia. Anything that contradicts very strong left wing narrative such as stereotype accuracy or the biology of sex differences, intelligence research. So there's these areas of the behavioral sciences that don't find a platform and I just wanted to create that platform and I also wanted to publish.

Speaker 3:          00:03:19       I'm not just scientific stuff, but a sort of classical liberal and any kind of commentary that doesn't indulge in these regressive postmodernist kind of narrative. I wanted to, to, to make it a free space for that. And some of my early, um, contribute is where one of my earliest contributed. This was a guy called Geoffrey Taylor who was an editor at the Atlantic and he wrote for places like the new republic, but they stopped publishing his pieces because he became critical of Islam and he wanted to write pieces that were critical of Islam and he couldn't get published even though he was this, um, you know, they'd publish his other work, but anything that he wanted to publish that was critical of Islam just wouldn't get past stitches. So publish it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:15       Sure. What you found was a implicit censorship in some sense. That's not the case. It's an exquisite censorship in many cases, so the stereotype literature is interesting because one of the things the so called stereotype researchers have failed to do is two distinct stereotype from heuristics. Yeah. People use low resolution representations of the world all the time too soon and it's absolutely vital that we do that we we cannot function without, without categorization and they. I know this was a problem with bondage sheets work and she did some of the early work on stereotyping and remember she did a talk at Harvard when I was teaching in Boston and she was taken to task by the audience who weren't all social psychologists for failing to distinguish between categorization and stereotyping and. But that's actually a really big problem. It's not a trivial issue with regards to the research and so yeah. I don't remember the name of the psychologist that you interview.

Speaker 3:          00:05:17       Yeah. So his name is Lee Justin. He's a psychologist at Rutgers University and I'm. Hey was one of the founders of the Heterodox Academy. Okay. Yeah, and he has a blog called rabble rouser at psychology today and I discovered that back in 2015. I think it was, and he had these amazing essays about how he has battled group thing, can left wing bias in his area of social social psychology and he's got these amazing anecdotes and stories about how science in his particular area has not been self correcting.

Speaker 2:          00:05:59       Yes. Well see psychology as being corrupt. Discipline for about 25 years as far as I can tell. And you know, you see that reflected in things like, um, the political work that's been done. So what's it called? Um, system justification, for example, social psychology that's being put forward by John Joseph, I remember correctly. He's a student of Missouri and bond and she on there, there's a, there's definitely an implicit left bias there because the notion fundamentally is that if you are justifying the current system in any way, which means that you know, you might have some element of patriotism in your thinking or believed that the system isn't just an oppressive patriarchy that are, that that actually constitutes something approximating a political pathology. So it's, it's really pernicious because it's, it's, it's built into the terminology rather than being an explicit part of the theory. And you know, the other thing that I noticed too that that was very interesting to me, it took me decades to figure this out, was that there was people have been studying the authoritarian personality basically since the end of World War Two.

Speaker 2:          00:07:10       Right. And there's the authoritarian personality scale that Adorno, if I remember correctly, it's the theater or donor developed and you know, for a long time I was trying to figure out why in the world there wasn't the equivalent on the left. You know, it's really, I mean, I hate to speak in conspiratorial terms, but it's essentially a conspiratorial movement that that's deeply embedded within social psychology to deny the existence of authoritarian authoritarian tendencies on the left wing. No one's managing good authoritarian left weighing scale. And it's partly because it's partly because of the tremendous denial post world war two that anything like leftist authoritarianism could exist and really took me a long time to sort that out. I couldn't, I couldn't understand why that glaring absence existed. And we've been trying to rectify that in my lab and trying to do that in a politically neutral way. You know, by doing a large scale, a factor analysis of collections, of political beliefs so that we can look at it from a relatively objective perspective without trying to drive home some eight priority political belief. So, so you said you had a crisis in some sense when you were in graduate school at pursuing psychology and what did that consist of?

Speaker 3:          00:08:32       Uh, there were lots of factors going on and I had some issues with the course. I was doing forensic psychology and I found um, the way it was run a little bit flexible and authoritarian and I'm a mother so I had, I had my son needs now for, but at the time was just the baby and I needed a lot of flexibility and they couldn't accommodate me. And um, I just, I just felt there was, I could offer more through writing and through communication of scientific ideas. Then being a practicing psychologist. I mean, I don't want to get into the full backstory of what happened in my course, but, um, I, I have have very cynical feelings towards universities in general. I, I'm, yeah, I went, I went back to graduate school at. I ha. I thought that I thought that, you know, considering all of the rhetoric, uh, um, around, you know, helping, helping women and helping people pursue their creative. I thought that there would be some flexibility for a young mother, but there really wasn't an um, but that, that was not the only issue though, other issues. But yeah, it's said it's, I don't know if I really wanted.

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       Yeah, but you don't want it. I was just what exactly it was that put you on this alternative path. And so how long have you been running quill out?

Speaker 3:          00:10:14       Since November 2015.

Speaker 2:          00:10:17       Okay. So it's pretty new. Yeah. So what did you tell us how you did that and how you've got, how you've attracted writers and how you've grown and, and I'd like to know everything about it, including whatever it is that you're doing for a monetization strategy because the fact that you've been able to launch a new, what would you call it? A new domain, a new enterprise devoted to journalism. This really quite surprising because, I mean it's, you bailed out of psychology into journalism and I got out of the fire into the frying pan because that's not exactly something that you'd consider if you had a business proposal and presented that to someone who said, well, I'm going to start a new site devoted towards journalism, you know, I think you'd be laughed out of the venture capitalist's office because it's so. It's so difficult to monetize journalism now. So. So tell me a little bit about how you, how you got this all going?

Speaker 3:          00:11:17       Well, I was just brainstorming with my husband one night domain names, so I knew that to start a website, uh, I needed an original domain name and we were just brainstorming and I didn't know where that came from, but it just came into my head and we looked that up and that was available. So I bought the domain name. I was running my own blog. So I transferred my own log over to this new domain and put all of my old essays. Are Penn, played around with what the website would look like for about two weeks. I was playing around with these statistics and I'm not a developer so I had to use sort of a website template out of the box, so the aesthetics were really important to me and I knew that if I was going to do something had to look really good and so I was playing around with that and then I put the word out through social media that I was going to launch a site and would anyone like to contribute and I happened to have some context in my social network who had essays up their sleeves.

Speaker 3:          00:12:27       My two first contributors were a Brian Boutwell who is a criminologist at St Louis University and Jamie, who's an excellent writer based in London and Brian. He started. His first essay was about being a criminologist who studies biology and about being shunned by his field and he. I didn't realize he was such a brilliant writer before I started writing. For me it just, it was just pure luck that he happened to be such brilliant rider. The second essay that he published something like 100,000 views in just a few weeks, so we immediately sort of exploded and that was just due to the quality of the contributors that I had straight away would be relatable for the first is the first one was on chrome, biosocial criminology. The second one was on behavioral genetics and the essay was about how parenting might not shape your personality as much as you think it does, uh, because he, he and he was explaining the data from twin studies and um, it was just such a well written and counterintuitive kind of essay just exploded. So I mean lots of people disagreed with it. Um, but it, it, it made a huge impact. And I'm. Jake go to

Speaker 2:          00:14:02       the heart of the conflict between the social constructionist and the biologists. Yeah, I know that's a new word that sort of emerged. I don't know if it's specific to Canada or north, but the word is biological essentialist. Then that seems to be like a social justice warrior code for Fascist as far as I can tell. And you know, biological essentialist seems to be anyone who believes that there's any degree of biological influence on any element of human character whatsoever. And you know, last year I was concerned because of what was happening in Canada that being a biologist was eventually going to be illegal in some sense, which I actually believe it is technically a certain provisions of our law because it's PLC 16, that audio post last year, which was passed nationally, has written social constructionism into the law. So our law now, now, it was predicated on the idea that their relationship between biological sex, gender expression, gender identity and sexual proclivity, which are all to this independent factors are in fact technically independent.

Speaker 2:          00:15:12       That there is no causal relationship between them. And which is palpably absurd notion because the, the correlation between them, you know, make biological males almost always have a male gender identity. They almost always act and dress like males and they're almost always hidden. Sexual. It's the correlations across the levels are almost all or, or exceed point nine five across all of the levels. And yet the law. Now it's technically the case that you have to treat those as independent and, and that and that, uh, suggesting that they're not like, I can't, I can't say that it's tantamount to hate speech, but I would say that it's close to that and the, I don't know if you've seen the sort of ridiculous animations that have been used, animated drawings, like the ginger, the genderbread person or the gender Unicorn.

Speaker 3:          00:16:07       Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have.

Speaker 2:          00:16:10       Yeah. And so those are being pushed forward very hard in institutions all across Canada, elementary schools, junior high schools, the military, the police, you name it, where there's this tremendous emphasis on the social construction of identity and it's as if a social constructionists have taken to the law to enforce what they cannot prove scientifically what they failed to prove scientific or what's even being disproved scientifically would be a more accurate way of thinking about it. Then the fact that there was an all out assault on, on biology by the left is unbelievably ominous in my estimation.

Speaker 3:          00:16:46       Yeah, I agree. Just two things on that. We've got an article coming out on quizlet written by two evolutionary psychologists on the false dichotomy between sex and gender and they give it some historical context. So the fault, that false dichotomy I think started with Moonee. Yes, exactly. And it's, and then it was weaponized by feminists to deny biology entered, denied sex differences basically. Um, so that's a very strange thing for feminists to do it. One of

Speaker 2:          00:17:27       the things that James Damore has just pointed out lately, he's the guy that wrote that memo for Google, is that the problem with denying the sex differences is that you automatically make the argument that if there are sex differences, essentially they're making the argument that the female differences or something like inferior because why would you object to their existence? And the Moore's memo was actually quite careful because he said, well we should take a look at these differences and if we want to maximize the economic utility of women, which seems to be a reasonable thing to do, then we should actually have a serious discussion about what the differences are and see if we can set up our institution so that we can take advantage of the, of the difference in perspective and orientation, but the two sexes might bring to bear on the, on the workplace and on, on economic issues in general. And you don't use that happening because people are starting to sort themselves out into occupations bisects essentially and you know, the longterm social consequences of that aren't obvious and we don't know how to balance that. But it's, it doesn't, it isn't necessarily the case that it's a bad thing.

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       Yeah. And my position has always been that women have probably more to lose when sex differences are denied. I think because of women's biological clock and the fact that we bear much more of a burden when it comes to child bearing and child weary. If you denied that, you know, women pay a huge price, if, if you denied the fact that what women go through that to bear children, like firstly I think we need to separate mothers out from women. There's, there's sort of a completion when we talk about things like the gender gap where there's a lot of the rhetoric implies that all women are discriminated against. The women who pay a penalty, our mothers and we need to talk about that more and we, we shouldn't minimize the, the work and the sacrifice and, and the, the, the, the costs and the Nag that we've been pouring into that. And I think when we deny sex differences, we sort of, we, we do, we minimize and we sort of dismiss everything that women do that is female normative, such as caring and, and, and working for others and sacrificing pay for their children. And you know, all of these things.

Speaker 2:          00:20:13       Right? Well, no, I had a baby a month ago. We were talking to her last night. She's trying to finish up her degree. She's also had some health problems that have interfered with that. You know, she was talking to us last night about and she looked tired, she had bags under her eyes. I mean, she's very happy to have the baby and it's going very well and all of that, but the first year after you have a baby, you're basically done. You don't get it, you don't get any sleep. You're absolutely overwhelmed, especially for the first six months with a new incident, big, especially if you're a first time mother because like, what the hell do you know, taking care of this incredibly complicated thing and it produces all sorts of biochemical changes and it's really hard on your body and there's a long recovery period and you're much more dependent on your familial structure than you were before.

Speaker 2:          00:21:01       And yeah, the I like, I mean, it's crazy that we even have to have this conversation, but I like your distinction between women and mothers and you know, there's one of the problems that I've had with classic feminism, if you could use that term, is that there's absolutely no respect built into it for the maternal role. And I really think that that's, that's appalling on a variety of levels, including appalling for men because one of the things I've experienced is that I've had a pretty intense career. I would say I've been very fortunate in that manner. I've had a lot of, some meal you'll support and support from my wife for that and you know, we kind of parsed our life up in a relatively traditional manner because she was quite interested in having children by the time we got together. And um, I was perfectly willing to go along with the artist if I could also continue what might my career pursuits, which were also necessary for our financial stability.

Speaker 2:          00:21:58       But for me, like the domestic realm has been an incredibly meaningful part of my life. Like I, I, I'm really happy in my marriage and blast I would say in my marriage. And I loved having kids. And, and for me, my home has always been a refuge from, from the insanity of the world in some sense. And I think our society is, it's so crazily skewed towards public performance. Let's say that we've denied the utility of the domestic sphere and that really is terrible for women because especially with regards to kids because that is their, that is the role that they dominate, let's say, or, or Dominique did they contribute most mightily to, let's put it that way. And it's almost as if our society regards that as kind of an emphasis innominate, you know, and I think it's crazy. I think it makes people miserable

Speaker 3:          00:22:55       and I understand why the early feminists sort of downplayed the domestic sphere because they, they were trapped in the domestic sphere and they wanted opportunities and I'm a. I'm one of those women who would have been an early feminist probably because I crave intellectual stimulation and I would have been, if I'd never had an opportunity to have a career, I would have been bored and that kind of thing. But now in 2017 I can go and get a job as a psychologist that can run a website and you know, I can do everything that a man can, but I'm still biologically a female. And so when it comes to having kids, a cost is on me and the women in my life, for example, um, my, my own mother who super and comes and helps with the children, I see how we, we don't keep that status and prestige anymore. And it's, it's just this a male normative sphere where you can monetize something or something, like you said, public performance. We can, we afford that status and prestige. But this invisible caring work that women are so good at and some women are exceptional that it's supported. No prestige whatsoever. It was Austin,

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       you know, I noticed with kids, for example, even though our little kids were very well behaved, that she was treated, she wasn't treated well in, in the public sphere, she wasn't treated well in restaurants. I think people were afraid. I think that was part of it in some sense. You know, they were afraid that if she showed up in a public place with children that there would be disruption of one form or another. So, but it was certainly the case that I would say she received the opposite of respect. And you know my look deeply into architect will symbolism and the function that it plays, and of course one of the divine images that sits at the bottom of western culture, not only western culture, is the image of the divine mother and the mother of the savior of humanity, which is an archetypal idea because every baby has the possibility of growing up to be a redemptive figure.

Speaker 2:          00:25:04       Now that's. That's the reason that that's an archetypal figures because any society that doesn't worship that so to speak doesn't give it a a very high value will nourish the fact of the declining, the catastrophic declining birth rate in the West is a real example of our willful blindness towards that sacred image and it's a big problem and it is the case that I think if, if the, if the feminists we're actually working on behalf of femininity, which is essentially what they claim, that they would be working a hell of a lot harder to elevate the status of mothers. You know, women. I think that's a really good distinction that you're drawing, even though it seems rather self evident. It's not. And you're not the same once you become a mother, you're a different sort of person. And I also think women who don't have children or rather intimidated and afraid of that, and that's perfectly understandable because it isn't radical transformation. But I would also say, and I've thought this for years, that you don't actually become mature. You don't actually become an adult until you have children. And I know that that's a statement that irritates the hell out of people, but it's, it's something that I stand by it. You're not an adult until someone else matters more than you do.

Speaker 3:          00:26:19       And, and you know what it is to set, to make real sacrifices.

Speaker 2:          00:26:25       Yes, exactly. Well, and especially as a mother, you sacrifice yourself as the person of prime importance and, and, and you know, you, you do it, I suppose happily in some sense because generally you fall in love with your baby relatively rapidly. And thank God for that because there are lots of, um, you know, I was recounting the story of my daughter and she is trying to, she was planning to take a course in biology online this, this semester in order to move towards the completion of her degree. And we told her last night, she said she was overwhelmed when we went and talked to her last night and we told her just to leave it be because first year is so intense that you're, you're completely overwhelmed by it and it's necessary because you want to get your baby off to a good start and get that relationship functioning properly.

Speaker 3:          00:27:16       Yeah, exactly. And that's one of the issues I had with my master's degree. I couldn't bring myself to do a thesis because I wasn't going to have the energy or the motivation to do it. Instead I created a website which is, which also requires a lot of energy, but it's um, it's sort of self generative because people write articles, they send them in. All I have to do is I'm a little bit of editing and then posted it online and it's not, it's not quite as uh, is it absorbing as, as writing a thesis which I wouldn't be able to do at this time.

Speaker 2:          00:27:57       So. So what are the things that I've been studying and thinking about is high achievement in, among, among people in general, and this is also something that I don't think is given any serious consideration in our discussion of the differences between the, between the sexes. So you know, the, the number of people who are extremely high achieving in any field is very low. Right? And that depends on the per preto principle essentially. And that's that that works itself out mathematically so that the square root of the number of people in if domain do half the work. So if you have 100 scientists working in a particular subfield, then 10 of them will publish half the articles. And if you look at that tiny percentage of people who were hyper productive, they're almost all men. Yeah. So like in universities, the median number of publications for men and women is very close, but the high publishers are all mad and the reason for that is because in order to be in that category, not only do you have to be extraordinarily smart and extraordinarily conscientious, but associated with that conscientiousness, you have to be able to devote something like 60 to 80 hours a week of solid attention to your job because otherwise people will out compete you.

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       Right? So it's these extremely focused and narrow people. More obsessive. That's exactly right. They're absolutely obsessed with what they're doing and they're quite rare and that they're also the mystery that needs to be solved because you know the fact that most people want to have a balanced life and that most people aren't absolutely obsessed with the single issue to the exclusion of all else is actually normally with behavior and quite understanding. You can this extreme a personality, let's say, and it's certainly not something that I'm criticizing, but it's not the common law. And I do believe that it's a far more difficult thing for women to manage because once you're responsible for someone else, like you are primarily responsible for small children, then it's extraordinarily difficult to concentrate like that to the exclusion of all else. And you know, I've seen a couple of women that I've had professional relationships with.

Speaker 2:          00:30:06       Usually I usually worked in the capacity of something like an executive coach in my clinical practice who kind of manage that. But they're so they're so stretched, you know, they, they, they were concerned with the number of seconds that they have to microwave their fruit, you know, they're hyper, hyper organized and it's an even then it's very difficult for them to manage because they're juggling know four or five impossible things at the same time and often also guilt ridden because they're not to feel that they're not paying enough attention to their children. Generally they are and they make very good role models, but it's a hell of a thing to expect of someone who also has a maternal role. It isn't obvious that it's even that it's even possible. And that's another thing we can't have a serious conversation about because there's all sorts of lies I would say about how it's the glass ceiling or were male models of success that are stopping women from succeeding at that high level. And that isn't right. What, what stops people from succeeding at that high level is it's virtually impossible to begin with and all you need more impediment and then you can't manage it.

Speaker 3:          00:31:19       Yeah, that's right. Can we. Parlier has said that feminism has never acknowledged the, the guilt that women feel when they all work, when they have children and they are working and they pursue their careers. And you know, I, I've seen it at work places where I've worked where women are high achieving, high achieving, they've got their phds and they're working full time and they are racked with guilt. And I don't think that happens to men nearly to the same degree. I

Speaker 2:          00:31:54       don't think it happens to me really at all. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it hasn't been to my observation that it happens to man, it happens to women all the time, like all the time. Like I've, I've done an awful lot of coaching with high achieving women. I did that for about 10 years and you know, these were women who were pretty much outstanding and in multiple dimensions, you know, and, but, but what would also, this was mostly in the field of law and so most of them are in their early thirties and not only were they racked with guilt if they have children and we're spending as much time as they wanted with them, but they were also wracked with guilt when they did spend time with your children because then they weren't spending enough time on their career and basically screwed both ways and it. And it wasn't merely

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       a matter of let's say high negative emotional sensitivity, you know, because that is a biological difference between men and women. Although I would say some of the women that I coached were quite feminine and we're more prone to anxiety. Then might've been good for them. But it was merely a response to what's essentially an impossible situation and like, and it's also not something that there's an easy answer to, I mean what I would recommend to them was that they outsource all of the domestic duties they could possibly manage and most of the successful women did that. They had nannies, they outsourced everything they could, including their laundry and like they, they try to rid themselves of any domestic duties that could be parceled out to a third party. And that's a pretty, that's necessary. It's not optional if you want to pursue a career at a higher level but also requires a pretty high standard of living to be able to pull that off because it's not like childcare of any quality is extremely expensive and it's very difficult to bring that cost down because with young children you need a very high ratio of caregiver to child, like three to one, four to one.

Speaker 2:          00:33:48       So if you have someone who's even vaguely qualified and you pay them, say $40,000 a year, which is pretty low, double that for overhead. So that's 80,000. So just the bare minimum cost of, of the highest quality of croissant, institutional care for children is easily $20,000 per child per year and there's no easy way of forcing that costs down. You can. The arithmetic is very straightforward. So it's a major societal problem and it isn't clear that at an end, what's unfortunate is that we're not having serious conversations about this because we pretend that the barriers are what the consequences of something like patriarchal oppression or, or straightforward, um, prejudice against women. And that's just simply not the case.

Speaker 3:          00:34:34       The irony is that to make things easier for professional middle class professional women, you need more working class women who can do cleaning and nannying work. So if you get to, to make life easier, you need a, a cohort of lowly paid women, which I don't think would help the gender gap, if that makes sense. To have two tiers as well. That's another highly paid women and men.

Speaker 2:          00:35:04       That's exactly right. That's another under discussed, under discussed topic, which is that you, you ended up transferring the primary, let's say, maternal burden, domestic burden onto generally. Well, they're generally a ethnic minority people that's very, very common and I mean it's not necessarily a bad bargain for them. I'm given their comparative options, let's say. But it's very difficult to pay someone who's doing domestic work enough so that they can, a reasonable standard of living because, well, partly because it's just so expensive to do so. So it's, it's an intransigent problem to say the least. And it would be nice if we could actually have a serious and compassionate discussion about it. And I think the compassion part, um, is to actually take a harsh look at the, at, at, at such factors as the biological clock, which certainly make women's lives much more complicated up until their, let's say till their forties. Now. It seems to me that men might have more complicated lives in the latter part of their life because of course we die about eight years earlier in our health problems or are more extreme and all of that. But I think that men's situation in life is somewhat simpler than women, certainly up to the age of about 40. And, and it's unfortunate that, that we can't address that squarely and start to figure out what to do about it. Not that it's a simple thing because it's certainly not

Speaker 3:          00:36:40       well, some places do better than others. I think in, I think it's in Holland or the. Yeah. I think in some of the Scandinavian countries there are many women work part time and that's found to be quite productive for their economy and women are happy working part time. So, um, you know, I think some societies are a little bit more progressive in answering some of these questions. However, this, there's still this. I don't know if any Western culture is, has, has many honest conversations about biological sex differences. I don't, we don't have it in Australia. It doesn't seem like you have it in Canada or America. I don't know if it happens in the Scandinavian countries.

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       I don't see any evidence that it does. I mean, the Scandinavians are always concerned that there's over representation of men in, in the stem fields, for example, especially in engineering, even though we're thinking that doubt is pretty clear that the idea that men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people is pretty robust finding and the differences aren't small either. I mean, and the biological difference, let her choose be quite, I think quite productive because basically what it's indicated is that there doesn't seem to be really much difference in men and women with regards to intellectual ability. The mean Iq is it's pretty much dead on exactly the same. Now there is a little debate about whether the standard deviation is the same with some evidence suggesting that men have a flatter standard deviation, so there's more hyper geniuses and there's more men who are intellectually impaired, certainly more men who were intellectually impaired on the learning disability end of this distribution for example. But and you know, even small differences in standard deviation can make huge differences out at the ends of the table. So. But I would say the evidence for that is mixed. It's not conclusive evidence for difference in personality I think is absolutely conclusive and the evidence for difference in interest is even more conclusive to the effect. Sizes are really large

Speaker 3:          00:38:52       and what is really interesting is how the sex differences in personality become larger in ginger, egalitarian countries.

Speaker 2:          00:39:03       Yes, that's scandalous is what that is because it's announced disproof of the social constructionist theory and it's very solid science despite the. I mean that's some of the material that changed to more referred to in his memo and it's very solid science. From a social science perspective. It's. I would say it's at the point where it's not in controvertible precisely, but it's about as close as you get in the social sciences.

Speaker 3:          00:39:28       Yeah. Yeah. David Schmidt was the lead author on that study, I believe on the finding that personality differences increase in Gender Galitary in countries and I think what's. What I find interesting is he's finding that women become more neurotic and more anxious in more free, you know, gender egalitarian or or countries that have more freedom. I think that's really interesting in it and it speaks to some it. It suggests that there must be some kind of biological underpinning for anxiety in women, a sex difference in anxiety.

Speaker 2:          00:40:11       Well, we we should never assume that freedom is something that brings security because freedom opens unexpensive domain up in front of you and that's full of opportunity, but but if we think about that as novelty or or the unexpected or unexplored territory, then know your primary response to unexplored territory, especially if the territory is vast, is initially paralysis and fear and even in in in the mythology the hero, which is the archetypal story of the confrontation with the unexplored. It's very, very common for the hero to take flight at the first, at the first appearance of the, of the, let's say, of the dragon of chaos. That's good way of thinking about it architecturally because that, that expanse is very. It's, it's, it's unsettled in the technical sense and that's where the monsters are, and so we should never make the assumption that more freedom means more happiness and know the literature on happiness is quite interesting because it's actually not a literature on happiness.

Speaker 2:          00:41:17       It's a literature on the absence of anxiety because it isn't that people want to be happy, it's that they don't want to be miserable and anxious because those are technically separate systems. One governance, let's say extroversion, that's the approach, positive system than the other, uh, governs. I'm freezing you pray, pray like freezing. And then retreat. It's mostly what we want to do is keep the prey like response and the retreat systems under control because they're unbearable when they're activated and so, and there's just no reason at all to assume either that freedom or even economic advantage is associated with wellbeing. No, there's no evidence that people in industrialized countries are happier than people in non industrialized countries, even though their standard of living is much higher and they live much longer and they're more disease free. And I think a big part of the problem is that it takes a tremendous amount of sacrifice in work, it's future oriented in order to keep the society with a high standard of living functioning.

Speaker 2:          00:42:25       And so you're constantly sacrificing the pleasures of the moment to the security of the future. And that's a, that's a major moral and emotional load even though the reasons for it are obvious. But that doesn't simply boil down to something like freedom from anxiety or happiness, you know. And if you have a high pressure job, well you have a high pressure job, you have responsibilities and if you screw up major things happened with major consequences and that's, that's also a tremendous burden even though you can be well paid for it. Like you know, we studied some, some workers in a factory in Wisconsin and we were doing testing that would help identify promising workers who could be streamed into a management role. And you know, we found about a third of them didn't want to take the tests. And when we investigated that, the reason was, well they wanted to work nine to five in a bounded manner.

Speaker 2:          00:43:27       So then they went home at night at 5:00, they were done their damn job and they could have their life and you know, the thing about professional level jobs is that complex jobs, managerial jobs, complex administrative jobs or jobs in science or any of the professions is that you're never not working. Yeah. So if you add to that the complexity of the family, then you know, you've got things to worry about that are significant or the time. And so if you're also higher insulin sensitivity to negative emotion, that's very stressful and, and genuinely so, and that's, well that's the price you pay and it's not a trivial price. So back to Queensland for a minute, can you tell me a little bit about its reach and scope and about it's monetization if you don't have to get into the details but people might be interested in trying to figure out how you manage that.

Speaker 3:          00:44:24       Okay. So for the first year that I was running it, it was self funded. I wasn't collecting any revenue through advertising or patronage. It was just, um, I funded it myself, but my costs were very low. It doesn't cost a whole lot to run a website. I had minimal infrastructure at the time. I now have a more robust infrastructure which costs more. I pay professional freelance writers fee, but academics who work for me because they were already salaried, I, we, you know, they did some pro bono writing and that was fine. Uh, so for the first year I, I bootstrapped it in, in, and I funded it myself and then last year I set up a patrion page and for a while I was um, getting enough, just enough to cover costs and a little bit to pay writers. And then I put advertising on the website and I was earning a little, little bit through that.

Speaker 3:          00:45:35       But the earnings are quite modest and my patronage has recently been bumped up because we published quite a popular article about the Google memo before James was set. I had reached out to for scientists when evolutionary psychologist, Jeffrey Miller lead, Justin, the social psychologist, Deborah. So the Canadian six Rasha and David Schmidt, who is the author of that I'm famous study and I got them to write a couple of paragraphs on what they thought about the Google memo and I've published that just as the news broke that he was quiet and so that kind of went viral and site crashed. And so we got a lot of attention for that in our patronage. Has since doubled for that article was published. We were getting around between 10 and 15 to 20,000 visitors a day, uh, and now it's between 15 and $30,000 a day. So we get quite a lot of traffic and I could be making more money through advertising.

Speaker 3:          00:46:53       But the problem with advertising, you said it slows down the webpage and there's this trade off between having a website that looks nice and is reasonably fast and one that is just loaded with ugly ads any slow and clunky. And so I've decided that I'm just going to focus on the patronage business model and get rid of the ads and, and just focus on pleasing the patrons. And, and I think patronage is the better model to go with anyway because you don't have to worry about how many clicks or views an article gets. Just have to focus on the quality and patrons will reward you for quality, not for, you know, how many people. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2:          00:47:41       Yeah. The other advantage to patronage is that you're a lot more immune from political pressure and demonetization, which is increasingly a big deal. I mean obviously advertisers have the right to advertise wherever they want, but certainly on youtube that's become an emergent. There's many problems on youtube including censorship from within youtube itself and the construction of these like artificial intelligence, social justice parts that they're producing like mad. But the demonetization issue is a real problem for anybody that wants to maintain any sort of journalistic independence. And I know lots of people like Dave Rubin, for example, the speed hit really hard by demonetization. So the patronage model seems to be a really. Seems to be a really good one. How, how much revenue are you generating with patron at the moment, if you don't mind me asking?

Speaker 3:          00:48:32       Uh, 3000 us a month.

Speaker 2:          00:48:36       Okay, so with any luck it'll continue to grow. We'll definitely put a link to the, to your patron accountant in the description of this, of this interview, and I would certainly encourage people who are watching to to support Claire Because Colette is really quite a remarkable accomplishment and it's exactly the kind of journalism. It's reminds me kind of what the Atlantic monthly used to be like before it took a nosedive into political correctness over the last I think about five years. It's something that seems to be afflicting so many journalistic sources or even see it as something that's characterizing the economist, which was a magazine that seemed pretty independent of that sort of thing for quite a while

Speaker 3:          00:49:13       and the new republic used to be at a great best unit of classical liberalism and I'm just defense. So Western civilization and now it's. It's the most regressive postmodernist. I mean the new republic is unreadable. I don't know if you're familiar with that magazine.

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       I'm not as familiar with it as the other ones that I listed, but I've noticed the same thing so. Well, you know, the other thing that's interesting, this is part of the reason that I'm so concerned with the pathology of the universities is because it seems to me, this sounds conspiratorial, but I'm afraid I'm still going to discuss it to the really serious, postmodern new Marxists. Disciplines like women's studies, for example. They're very, very good at producing activists who are very, very good at occupying mid-level bureaucratic positions and dominating relevant institution. So for example, one of the things that's happened in in the province I live in in Ontario this month, is that the Ontario Law Society has now made it mandatory for lawyers to come out with a statement on diversity and equity. So they have to do that part of their practice and they basically have to admit to white privilege Andy and systemic racism within the profession.

Speaker 2:          00:50:35       Despite the fact that their own damn data indicate, for example, that Asians are overrepresented in the legal profession. Which I know that the whole idea is if you have a theory and then you have a data point that invalidates the theory, that's a reliable data point, then your theory is wrong. And the fact that the white dominated legal profession actually promotes Asians at a rate that exceeds what you would expect by a population and that was just absolutely invalidates the idea of systemic racism, but it doesn't matter because the law society's been taken over by a small coterie of extraordinarily dedicated postmodern activists and the, the amount they care for facts zero since they don't even believe in the existence of factories. So

Speaker 3:          00:51:20       we've had, we've had the same thing happened to the law society in Australia. Um, my husband's a lawyer and he brought home the Law Society magazine. And on the front cover was an article about unconscious bias training and how it's going to be mandatory for all lawyers in Australia. I sent off a couple of emails to psychologists I know who do research in this area. And one got back to me saying there is no data there. There are no Meta analysis and there are no randomized controlled trials that show that unconscious bias training has any effect after a couple of hours. Like it might have an initial effect on people when they're doing a pencil and paper survey. But after a couple of hours, that's all gone and there's no long term effect on any measurable outcomes in the workplace. So there's no shortcuts. It's a complete scam. Yeah, yeah. Stem

Speaker 2:          00:52:25       and it is based on, on the, you know, the implicit association test of course, which is being pushed by people who have a very explicit radical left when you gender by the way because measurement, but now she is known quite well for that. It's been absolutely misused. Like the relationship between so-called implicit bias and and categorization isn't well understood. We don't understand the relationship between implicit bias and the kind of in group preference that makes you love your own family, for example, as opposed to, you know, equally distributing your care across the entire expanse of 7 billion people, 7 billion people that make up the human race, which of course you just simply can't do that. Behavioral effects of that implicit a s a categorization, let's call it rather than bias, aren't well understood and there's no evidence whatsoever that unconscious bias retraining programs do anything that's positive whatsoever. And yet it's being pushed especially and being made mandatory. It all sorts of levels of corporations and like, I can't understand why the lawyers, for example, put up with this. It's like they're being accused. There'll be, there'll be accused of guilt before innocence, which is all a bunch of racists. They're being accused in the most appalling way because they're saying, well, it's. It's even unconscious. They're going after the know the, their targets, unconscious perceptions, which is so totalitarian that it. If it isn't even something that the bloody associates could have thought out.

Speaker 3:          00:53:55       Legal profession as far as I'm aware, relies on the reasonable person standard and the practitioners. So lawyers and judges are supposed to be free of bias. I mean I, I mean they're not. If you, if your, if you are in trouble with the law and you go to a lawyer, he's biased toward or she's biased towards you, but if, if you, if the legal professionals are now saying that their lawyers are inherently racist and sexist, I mean that undermines the entire profession.

Speaker 2:          00:54:34       Well, I would also say that that's actually the reason that this is being done is to undermine the entire profession. Because the Meta story behind the postmodern and Neo Marxist activists is that everything about Western civilization is corrupt and oppressive and should be taken down to. It's stripped down to its roots and rebuilt, and so the fact that the implicit messages, while you can't trust the legal profession, is no problem for the people who are doing that because that's exactly what they think. They think the entire editors of Western law is nothing but a oppressive patriarchal construction, which is so appallingly backwards that it's almost beyond comprehension. I mean, I suppose compared to their utopians you, it's an oppressive structure, but compared to every other system in the world, it operates like a charm.

Speaker 3:          00:55:22       I think that's. I think that's the view of the, the postmodernists and the activist, but I think that I think there are sensible people who aren't familiar with postmodernism that go along with this stuff and I see corporations and people, you know, the legal society is implementing this unconscious bias training. I think. I think a lot of it has to do with mitigating the risk of lawsuits and then if they do get a lawsuit, for example, if someone wants to see a female employee, whether it was to sue them for gender discrimination in the workplace, they can say, oh, well we've, we've had this bias training. We're trying to do the right thing. For example, Google have been google, now I have a class action lawsuit against them. Uh, a handful of female employees are suing them for Jenna discriminate. They're saying that there is systematic gender discrimination because they were paid less and some male engineers that were hired at the same time that they were and were promoted more quickly. And so I think, I think a lot of this, these policies are, uh, companies and corporations just trying to cover their backside when it comes to threaten legal action.

Speaker 2:          00:56:43       No, no, I think that's right. I think that's driven than the United States by legislation like title nine because that's held over, especially in educational institutions, which is primarily applies that's held over their heads, like the sword of Damocles and, and it's been tremendously damaging. But the problem is for the corporations is that they're, they're chasing away a small table and letting a way bigger devil in at the same time. And so as a short term solution, it's, it's somewhat acceptable. But by participating in these mandatory unconscious bias retraining processes, they do two things. The first thing they do is admit their guilt, right? Practically pragmatically speaking, and that's a big mistake. It's a massive mistake to let someone accused you of unconscious systematic racism and bias and then to allow yourself to be retrained because you're basically admitting guilt. And I can't see that that's going to put them on a stronger legal ground moving forward.

Speaker 2:          00:57:44       Because by saying what we need this training, you're admitting that the problem exists at precisely the level that it's being diagnosed. And you know, my experience especially with say with large law firms is that they're so goddamn desperate for talent that they do everything they possibly can say to retain their women over backwards and tie themselves into knots. Because if you have a female high performing team, male lawyer who's also capable of generating revenue in those people are incredibly valuable. And that, that doesn't mean that there isn't conflict between the men and women in the law firms at an individual level because the other thing that you see happening in high achieving professions among high achieving people is that there were very, very competitive. And I've certainly seen like I've had many women in my, uh, in my coaching practice, let's say who were under constant stress from the men in their immediate environment wouldn't cooperate with them.

Speaker 2:          00:58:43       You know, and my point always was, look, it's not surprising that these men aren't cooperating with you. You're a threat, you're very good at what you do. And they're, they're not only trying to be good lawyers, they're trying to win and you are actually doing the winning. And so they're not going to help you in the objection of the women generally who were agreeable. Women say no. So more on the feminine end of the spectrum was, well, we're all on the same team, same team. We should be pulling together. It's like, well, that isn't exactly how competitive men work. Is that partly they're conscientious, which is the primary characteristic of a high achieving lawyers as well as high verbal intelligence, but they also tend to be very disagreeable, especially if they're litigators and obviously they're disagreeable because they wouldn't be litigators otherwise just scribbled. Men are competitive and they want to win.

Speaker 2:          00:59:36       And it's another thing that we will talk about the camp talk about is how in the world men are supposed to compete with women because men don't know how to compete with women. Winning is, is preferable to losing let's say, but it also tends to make you into something of a bully. And that's a big problem in competitive environments because the competition is actually part of what drives the productivity. That's right. So it's, it's also on an Nada, not a straightforward thing to sort out at all. And, and I don't know exactly what we're going to do about that, but um, so some of what's regarded as say, prejudice against women. Some of that can be nearly attributed to the fact that men are competitive and they, they treat each other harshly as well. It's not as if it's limited to there. In fact, I, I know perfectly well that it's essentially mitigated in the case of women. Men are harsher with each other than they are with women even though they can be perfectly plenty horse with women. So, but it's part of the, it's part of what's accepted as normative in, in, in primarily male situations show.

Speaker 3:          01:00:47       Sure. And the, it's a, it's a different kind of middling or you know, the, the, the casual insults. I mean that it's not taken as offensive often email only groups. It's, it's almost a way of bonding. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:01:06       It's also part of the mutual testing that goes on because one of the things you want to find out from a new work crew member, let's say, and I really saw this when I was working in, in working class situations, is you, you really, uh, um, harass the hell out of them for a couple of weeks. You know, put them down, give them nicknames, make fun of them. And a huge part of the reason you're doing that is to see if they have the kind of emotional and psychological integrity that would indicate that they could take a joke, they can give a take, they can stand some competition and that they're not going to, they're not going to shirk and they're not going to fail in a crisis and men are good at doing that with each other and it's harder to do that with women. It isn't obvious exactly how you should do that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:51       And I mean it can be managed, but it's not. It's definitely not the same thing. It's a thing. And yeah, I mean I think part of the reason too that men are bailing out of so many university disciplines is because they also don't know how to manage the environment when it becomes female dominated, they're not exactly sure what the rules of engagement are. Like I respect my, my, my attitude is something like no holds barred and let the devil take the hindmost. Right. It's something like that. And I can be as harsh and blunt and straightforward as I want to be in a situation like that and then, but the rules aren't the same when dealing with women and it isn't exactly that. I know what the rules are, I just know that they're not the same and that's quite confusing, you know, like my TV appearances, one of my producers is always cautioned me about panels that are mixed sense and, and, and he said it's very bad for him on television to, to be on the attack in a mixed sex panel because you come across as a bully.

Speaker 3:          01:03:01       Yeah. And, and, and,

Speaker 2:          01:03:04       and fair enough, I understand that, but I also don't know what to do about it because it seems like, like pulling my punches so to speak seems like seems necessary but also oddly inappropriate.

Speaker 3:          01:03:18       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       It puts me at a loss. I'm not, I'm not exactly sure how to manage it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:24       Yeah. Well, you know, it's one of those, it's one of the situations where there's a lot of variation among women and um, any, any. If you don't know anything more about a person other than the fact that they're a woman, you don't know if they're on the sort of male typical, they're more masculine or they're on the highly agreeable, you know, feminine, you, you don't know anything about their personality, so you don't know if they're going to be able to handle that given. Take. One thing that I find really interesting is that we know, we know quite a lot about male competition, but we don't. We haven't studied female competition a great deal. I know that some evolutionary psychologists have been studying it like an capital, but you know, women compete with each other as well and women have their own forms of aggression. But it's all, it's, it's very. It's not spoken about much white culture. Well, we don't even in the workplace, women compete with each other. And um, and, and I think that's it. You know, we're, you know, women might come up against hostile or hyper competitive men, but women come up against other women as well. And, and it could be the case that a younger women and not what one speculation or hypothesis that I've had is that younger women don't always find it easier to work with older women because there is competition there and hostility. No,

Speaker 2:          01:04:56       there is evidence that women are happier with male bosses than with female bosses. And your, your observation about us not understanding the competitive landscape is spot on. We don't understand the male dominance hierarchies very well because females, females in the workplace or in a female dominant Turkey and the male hierarchy and the rules are not the same. And there's certainly, there's a, there's a kind of sexual attractiveness tension between older women and younger women. That's, that, that doesn't play the same way with men and and it, it puts a strange dynamic into the workplace and it's certainly by no means evidence, evidence self evident that women are women's best friends in the workplace either. So these are all things that we don't understand well and are afraid to address. And I'm very curious about the female dominance hierarchy because it's not predicated on the same presumptions as the male dominance hurricane.

Speaker 2:          01:05:52       I had a friend of mine who's a very, a very insightful person and he was talking about, um, the mode of dress that's characteristic of repressive Islam, you know, and one of his hypothesis was that it was a way that the older women exercise control over the sexual attractiveness of the younger women. And then it's actually not primarily a phenomena that's associated with male dominance of women at all. I think that's a really interesting hypothesis and highly credible because young women have a tremendous amount of sexual power and, and that needs to be, well, that's a, let's call it a complicating factor. We could at least get along. We can at least get away with that. It's a massively complicating factor and we also don't know the degree to which women use sexual attractiveness in the workplace as a, as a motive, achieving dominance and power.

Speaker 2:          01:06:41       And you know, one of the things I've thought about for example, is, um, and I'm not suggesting that this is something that should be done, but you know, truly a Gal, a society that was truly aiming at removing sex bias from the workplace might ban makeup. Because it's not, it's not self evident to me that that's, that's appropriate from a, from a technical perspective in the workplace because it mixes sexual attractiveness with functionality in a way that, well, in a way that at least is complex now. I wouldn't ever say that we should go so far as to ban makeup in the workplace, but there's a point to be made there, which is that we haven't separated out the politics from the sexual politics and that's a major, major problem. And, and, and partly because we can't have real discussions about it. Generally speaking, it's something that stays unaddressed.

Speaker 2:          01:07:33       And so, so I'm going to stop, I think. Yes. Uh, I'm very happy that you agreed to talk with me today. I'm, I'm a great admirer of your website. I think Colette has done a remarkable job. I hope we get a chance to talk again. I'm certainly going to encourage all the people who are watching and listening to contribute to your patron account because I really believed that support for that is going to be in everyone's best interest, let's put it that way. And so, um, thanks very much for the conversation and I hope that we get a chance to talk again in the relatively near future and I'll let you know when this is up and all of that. Okay. Right. Thanks. Nice talking to you. Alright.
