Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01          Hi everyone. Back on February 20th I announced that I was going to go to 12 different cities in North America and talk about my new book, 12 rules for life and a variety of other things, and so we arranged theaters and put those tickets up for sale and they've proved very popular. I did the first one this week on Sunday in New York at the beacon theater to an audience of about 3000 people and it seemed to go very well. The consequence of that is that I'm now announcing another 20 cities and this is the video to make that announcement. I'm also appearing as a guest with several other speakers, including Matt Dillahunty, Sam Harris, a number of times, and also Sam Harrison, Douglas Murray, and so the announcements for those who will be included in the description of this video as well. All these talks are going to occur from may through June, and I'll just list the cities.

Speaker 2:          01:01          You can get the cities and the dates below. Toronto, Washington, Chicago, Detroit, Denver, San Francisco, Seattle, London, Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, and Houston, Dallas, Austin, and Phoenix. Rick Jeevak, Washington and Richmond. Charlotte, Nashville and Atlanta, Louisville, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Seattle, and Vancouver. That's twice with Sam Harris, Portland, Sacramento, and San Diego, Long Beach, thousand oaks, and finally Dublin with Sam Harris and Douglas Murray. I've done about 10 of these talks already. Three in London, one announced her damn one in La, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, and New York. I've really looked forward to them and it's a real privilege to be able to speak about important issues pertaining to psychological development with an enthusiastic and involved crowd. And I hope that the lectures are useful and, and that there is useful for the people that I'm speaking with as they are engaging and worthwhile for me. So if you'd like to buy a ticket, then I'd like to see you there. And I look forward to seeing you in your hometown in May and June. So thanks very much for your continued support. I hope we get a chance to have a meaningful and productive evening in the very near future.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Bye. Bye.
