Speaker 1:          00:02          All right. So I'm sitting here with, with Dr. Jordan Peterson. We were going to talk about the weird overlap between our books. There's a sort of metal fiction aspect of it because Jordan had written the rules for, it was a Cora entry, right? It started to rules in Ancora. That's right. 42 roles got pared down. So there's going to be like 19 sequels, right? Keep rolling them out. And um, and I thought they were amazing. And so I was writing or fanatics, I was writing the first book in the series and an orphan acts. My main character is an assassin and he has these sorts of 10 commandments that are the operational rules for an assassin. And I wanted something to offset that, uh, for a kid who's in his life who lives downstairs from him, who's being raised as a good human instead of as an assassin.

Speaker 1:          00:46          And I wanted a set of rules that were kind of counterbalance that. And at the time I was reading Jordan's, uh, rules that he listed. And so I sort of use those as a counterbalance is sort of a positive masculinity to use to use the horrible phrase, the weld trodden term, but to actually show how somebody might be raised properly instead of as an international assassin. And at the time, you know, you were a mirror professor at u Toronto, I thought what could possibly be controversial about this? Yeah. Right. And so, so that's how it sort of,

Speaker 2:          01:16          yeah, well it was fun to see, you know, when you create something like those rules, I wrote them for Quora and I had written like 50 Quora answers and some of them got disproportionately popular, which is exactly what you'd expect because some things get disproportionately popular and, and the core rules attracted a lot of attention by core standards or by the standards of what I was writing on Quora. And then you would pick, you picked him up and I thought it's one of the things that's very interesting about doing something creatively is that you sort of launch it. Like you launch a note in a bottle on the ocean and you have no idea where it's going to end up. And so that was the first interesting manifestation of those rules outside of the Kora containers, so to speak. And then of course, part of our discussion about the rules also led to their encapsulation in 12 rules for life. And that was much later. And it's been interesting to see how that overlap has developed as well.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Well it's also weird to see what connects, like, it's so funny with, with orphan acts when I was first adapting. And the big thing with that is that my character kind of interacts. He's an archetypal character, like a Jack reacher Jason Bourne, but lives in the real world with you and me. You know, so it's like he's not, you never see James Bond go home.

Speaker 2:          02:30          Just what an architectural character should do. Right. It should exist in abstraction and also be embedded in the real world.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Yeah. But usually you have like the high plains drifter who's like all feeding his horse and like moving on to the next town. So I thought it'd be so fun to have them like interacting with the annoying Jewish woman who lives upstairs and having an awkward confrontation with the woman who lives downstairs who has chemistry with. So it's an archetypal character wrestled into the real world.

Speaker 2:          02:53          That's what the Spiderman people did really well. The marvel when exactly ended Spiderman

Speaker 1:          02:57          that extraordinarily well. He has to like re stitch is Costa. But no one thought about that, you know, and he's like late for school and all those problems. Exactly, exactly. So that was, that was sort of the motif. Um,

Speaker 2:          03:09          well that is also the problem of, of it's, it's a more complex psychological problem of, of integrating the archetipal with the real world because there's an element of everyone's psyche that's, that's transpersonal. That's archetipal right? Because to some degree you should manifest the mythological hero in your life, but the critical issue there is in your life, right? Because your life is like your life is like the, the bottle that, or the lamp that the genie is in. It's like the genie is God for all intents and purposes, but it's in this little tiny container. It's like, well that's what you're like because you have this archetipal element to your personality, which is your capacity for heroic endeavor, but it's all constrained by the hypothetical or the trivialities of your life. And you have to have to mediate between those.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Well, and that's the weird thing. Like you were saying, one of the things when you write is you don't always know what's going to connect. Right? You never knew that those rules would become, you know, number one bestselling book everywhere in the world. What was so interesting is there's this one scene at the opening of orphan acts where he's in the elevator and he's got a cut on his arm. We don't know what it's from, and he has to fake to kind of pass as a real person among all the people. And he's kind of covering it up. But he's got suppressors and he used the SOC as a tourniquet. So he's missing a sock and he's kind of trying to pass his secret identity among other people that seen connected unbelievably with readers with. And it would, it would be like the last scene that I would have thought. And when I adapted the book initially for Bradley Cooper as a feature, and I remember I was like, well if I have Bradley Cooper, let me open with some big action is show off offy thing. And both his production company and the head of the studio were like, we need the elevator saying like this elevator scene became the iconic thing. Of course. Cause it does what you're talking.

Speaker 2:          04:53          There shouldn't be some music playing in the back of the exactly. Like there is. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:57          So from Ipanema there's something awful if you get caught between the mirror and in New York City. Right, right. But it's weird because I never would've thought that would be the thing. So the stuff that you send out,

Speaker 2:          05:08          do you have any idea why that was so attractive to people?

Speaker 1:          05:10          Well, I think it's exactly, the thing that we were talking about is like you don't see James Bond in that circumstance. It's so it's like this archetype guy has a mission, is a knife cut that he tourniquets is armed with. And then he's in the elevator that you and I have been in and everyone's nagging him that he's missed the Hoa meeting, the Homeowner's association meeting where they're voting on like the new carpeting in the lobby and he's just trying to get out of it and he's covering. So there's this wish fulfillment fantasy aspect to it, but it's almost like our own lives and like everyone knows what it's like to be dealing with annoyances and logistics, but then he gets to go back to his life is like a super secret assassin who helps the helper.

Speaker 2:          05:48          Well, there's another element of it too, I would say, which is that, that, that, that scene and, and that, that context also suggests that one of the ways that you, one of the things that you have to do in order to put up with those mundane daily elements of life is also to have your adventure along with you. Right. So, and I mean, one of the things that I've been talking to my audiences about continually is that you need to have a meaning in your life that's of sufficient grandier let's say, or a sufficient power so that the petty sufferings of life become not only justifiable, but acceptable in the broader context and so, and sufficient risk and sufficient risk. Because while that and that, and that's what puts the adventure into it, right? It's like in the elevator scene, it's, it's not only that everyone can relate to the mundane, it's also that everyone can see that what transcends the mundane is also fundamentally necessary because otherwise you are nothing but a collection of trivialities and, and life has so much suffering that if you're just a collection of trivialities, you're not going to be able to bear it.

Speaker 2:          06:53          So you need your heroic adventure, which is what's animating you. Literally Anima is the soul, right? That's what Adam a means. So that's literally animating you while you have to put up with being trapped in this little tiny fire.

Speaker 1:          07:06          I thought about this a lot when I was writing Batman. I wrote Batman for two years for DC and I was fascinated by the sort of seesaw tilt between perfection and intimacy, which is so Batman, you know, he doesn't have a magic ring, he can't fly. He just represents the pinnacle of human discipline and achievement. It's because his parents died when he was young, right? He's alone in Wayne Manor. There's, Robin always dies, there's always a Robin and he dies. He's a playboy. He doesn't have anyone intimate. And if there's no one in your life, you can maintain perfection. But the more you inch into intimacy, a dog, a spouse, a partner, children, the more that you get this sort of conflict and complication that starts to take over and detract from that version of perfection. So it's like you can be perfect without intimacy, but then you're not perfect cause you have no intimacy. And so the more that you integrated, it's almost like the more that you're accepting the realities of life.

Speaker 2:          07:55          And there's also, I think it's also one of the things that's interesting in the Batman reference because one of the things you see in the Batman Joker dynamic, especially the one with Heath Heath Ledger, was the joker was always pushing at Batman because of the evil of his perfections. Like you're this far away from me. And that perfectionistic drive, there's something totalitarian and single minded about it, right? And then it's the encapsulation of that in intimacy that that humanizes it and produce it sane. Right? And so, so that unit, dimensional perfection can go very, very badly when it goes. And to be contextually constrained like that is actually like a definition of sanity. It's something that young talked about when he was commenting on nature and people liked nature. I said he believed that nature would have been able to maintain his sanity for much longer, assuming no physiological degeneration had he been able to incorporate himself within a profession and a family. That's your nailed them to the earth and inhale way stilts down. And that's right. That's exactly right.

Speaker 1:          08:52          So I thought we'd just talk briefly about the editing process for 12 roles. It was a lot of fun because I got to read it all early, which was, which was fun. So I had it featured in the orphan x books like two years before it came out. Right. Which is why I always like to remind you that I'm mostly responsible for your six hours.

Speaker 2:          09:09          I do appreciate that a lot. Well, I sent all the chapters to Greg. I had an editor at Penguin, Craig Piot, who was very, very helpful. So I had two editors really, and other people commenting on it. But I sent each chapter to Greg and he would just shred them. He's really, really good at that and well and very comical. And so he'd just be absolutely brutal. It is criticisms, but it was also also always extremely funny. Yeah. Well, and then I was also absolutely staggered by how rapidly you could do that and, and to point to what was working in, to tell me what was working. And so that was exceptionally helpful in your very, very skilled at that. So, so there's the compliment you're gonna get from me.

Speaker 1:          09:45          No, it was, it was, it was very helpful. Now the insult first you lead, you softened me up with a compliment and now you know, but I think what was helpful is, so, I mean I took three courses from you as an undergraduate. So it's like we've been swimming in the same waters for a long time. So it was really interesting for me to see, you know, through the process. Um, you know, I have a, I have a sense that goes kind of all the way down of the ideas you're running with going back to before maps of meaning, right? Going back to the source book articles and stuff, you lectured amount. So it was really fun to see them take hold and move from the abstract into the ever more accessible. And

Speaker 2:          10:19          the setback was useful too because you're, you're, you've developed this intense skill in, in producing commercial widely, publicly accessible fiction and, and you have a sense of what works in terms of narrative flow. And that was very useful to have that perspective on the way the, the, the stories were laid out in, in each of the rules to make them, to give them that narrative punch, which is necessary to add an additional dimension of, what would you say? Quality to the writing.

Speaker 1:          10:49          It's helpful. I'm glad, but it's, it's good working with someone with like, your learning curve was like this. So it was like the first one that we went through, you know, if there was something that has the speed with which you can sort of implement some white new information and, and reflect that in writing is unbelievable. That's fun. Or there's a benefit of being sort of experienced in multiple dominant Tarik is I think because there's so many things that you've done at such a high level that when you add a new one, the learning curve is like this. So it was also really fun because it's like, you know,

Speaker 2:          11:19          well, we'll have a chance to do it again. Yeah. All right. Expect when I write the next book because there may be an extension of 12 rules for life, I presume. So it's fun bumping into you here cause we just bumped into each other at the studio today.

Speaker 1:          11:31          Yeah, halfway around the world and one studio apart. But so that's great. So we'll work on the next one and I'll work on the next orphaned acts and we'll go from there.

Speaker 2:          11:39          All right, good to see you, man.
