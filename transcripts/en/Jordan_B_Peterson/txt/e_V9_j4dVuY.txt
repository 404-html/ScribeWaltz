Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. Looks like everything is in order. Hello everyone. I'm here with, uh, Dr. Jordan Peterson and um, a lot of you probably know of him and he's been making quite the bus. Uh, hi Jordan. Thank you so much for, for joining me on this chat. I'm really excited to talk to get, um, to get to the topics at hand. How are you doing today? Good. Yeah. Well that's good. Um, I know you told me that there were some very specific things that you'd like to kind of talk to, uh, talk with me about today because we don't have much time. I just want to kind of jump right into it. So, um, you wanted to talk a bit about postmodernism and their view on categories. Um, did you want to just,

Speaker 2:          00:58          I'd be trying to, obviously this discussion about pronouns is attracting a tremendous amount of attention and it's attracted a tremendous amount of tension for complex reasons that it's not an obvious wise boy. Everyone would focus on it for such a long period of time. It's been about 40 days now, but 130 print articles. And I would say maybe upwards of 3 million people have been watching the goings on online. Um, and we haven't even counted the number of youtube videos and that sort of thing that would be generated as a consequence of it. And the two demonstrations at the University of Toronto and the exchange of letters, it's, it's been absurdly, absurdly controversial and that means that there's something going on that people really haven't put their finger on. And I'd be thinking about it at multiple levels of analysis. And there's one very deep level of analysis that I don't think anyone has addressed.

Speaker 2:          01:51          And I would think about it as a, as a cognitive level of analysis. And it has to do with the nature of categorization itself. So I remember a long while back, I read a paper on why human beings have two hemispheres, right hemisphere and the left hemisphere, roughly speaking, the left hemisphere. And this is very roughly speaking, the left slash linguistic hemisphere attempts to impose predictable structure on the world. Simplifying it. It's not exactly an ideological simplification. It's more like a practical simplification because the world is so complex that unless you chunk it into categories, it overwhelms you. And so you have to chunk it into categories. And those categories aren't exactly descriptions of things or objects. They're more like tools for operating in the world. And then the right hemisphere keeps track of anomalies and exceptions and tries to build those slowly into the category system so that it doesn't blow the category system.

Speaker 2:          02:50          And so there was an example of this that that researcher named Goldberg offered. He had trained a neural network to recognize images of fish and the same neural network to recognize images of birds. But when he showed it a penguin, then it blew the category structure so that all fish became birds and all birds became fish. Now the postmodernists like Derrida claimed that category structures were primarily tools of power and oppression, which, which to me is an absurd claim because that's not their primary use, even though that may be one of their consequences and one of their own occasionally uses. And he became very, very concerned about who the category systems marginalized and what the consequence of that was for them. And that got tangled in, in a, in a sense, into the Marxist identity politics routine because the Marxist identity politics, people picked up the idea of the excluded and marginalized and sort of transform them into the equivalent of Marx's oppressed working class and then started to agitate for them.

Speaker 2:          03:56          And the Democrats in the United States, for example, transformed their focus from working class, uh, uh, concern say to identity politics concerns. And there's been some notion that that was part of the resurgence of Marxism as a, as a new ideological doctrine. Anyways, it's a really fundamental problem. The pro, the pro categories exclude. But then if you include the excluded in the category, you blow the category structure. Now this is partly why the right wing Christians, for example, were so opposed to the idea of homosexual marriage. So what, what happened? What's happening very rapidly is that because of the binary category has been, uh, let's call, let's say, violated. That's one way of thinking about it. You get an explosion of chaotic identities. And so it's gone from say two to the proposed, I suppose three, which, which would have been what the formulators of the legislation, I think we're hoping for to say 31 in New York and 70 online.

Speaker 2:          04:59          And then there's this additional explosion which is, which has being promoted by people who, who aren't really concerned so much with the categories of gender identity but with other categories like human versus non human identity. And so those are the people that have been come known as other kids or even trans abled, right? Who are, who are claiming but on the same logical gout grounds. That's the problem. It's on the same logical grounds is they're claiming a non categorical identity that transcends the human. And if it's, if it's only subjective, then there's no, and you already agree with the first step. There's no way of logically agreeing with the second step. And so it's a really interesting example of the, of how say binary categories maintain order. And then if you violate them to include those who are excluded, what you produce is and up swelling of, of, of unmanageable chaos, which seems to be the state where, so one of the things I wanted to you is, I think this is happening, this is happening on two fronts. It's happened with the, with the requests of gay people to be included in, in, in, in, in marriage, and now now what's happened as a consequence of the request of transgendered people to be included in, although flipping the gender category. So this is especially true with the non-gender non so-called nonbinary gender types. And so I just wondered what you think about all that.

Speaker 1:          06:26          Wow. There's so much. Um, so I've been thinking about this a lot. Maybe not an insider in the same kind of uses the same words, but very much along the same lines. Uh, I, I think it's interesting that you talk about categories. One could look at it also as not just that, the violation or the changing of it, of it, um, the definition of a category, but the creation of entirely new category. Um, not just male, female, but now in tiny new category. Um, which not necessarily, um, threatens male and female, but it threatens the dichotomy as you said, the binary. Um, and uh, I find it interesting because I can't, personally I don't, I can't see how there is any third agenda because

Speaker 3:          07:16          okay.

Speaker 1:          07:17          There is nothing more than male and female. I mean, where, where does this come from? There's nothing more than male, female and male.

Speaker 2:          07:26          That's exactly, that's right. Well that's exactly the problem of the category is that once you're outside that then your anywhere as far as I can tell,

Speaker 1:          07:36          and if you can create an identity out of math thing based out of nothing in reality, then you're basically claiming the status of a Danny Guide and

Speaker 2:          07:45          doesn't make sense. In fact, the other kids are consciously claiming the status of Demi gods because they, they, they proclaim that they are such creatures as Alps or ferris or, or orcs or whatever, whatever their imagination conscious up. But you know that that's the other thing too, is that in the, in bill see 16, there's actually an assault on the concept of reality because identity is technically unmoored from its biological, some straight. And so that means it's unmoored from the objective and as soon as it's on board from the objective, then it's subjective. And in principle can be anything. So I mean in, here's the problem for, so with the classically transgendered people, and I presume that you would fit into that category, the argument isn't so much about the category of gender. The argument is about which category you're going to be in. That what that seems to do is immediately opened the door or has opened the door to, I would say a philosophical assault on the concept of gender itself. With that culminated, for example, in Dr Nicholas maps, um, claim on TV Ospi agenda when he was debating me that there were no biological differences between men and women and that that's what the science over the last four decades has claimed a remarkable, remarkable claims.

Speaker 1:          09:06          Basically, it's not correct that there is such a thing as biological sex. And I'm a historian of medicine. I can unpack that for you at great length if you want. But in the interest of time I won't. So that's a very popular misconceptions. So essentially when in my transgender studies classes, what we're doing is looking at actual research and identifying ways that current social issues related to trans people or things that are associated with trans, such as free speech arguments and claims. Uh, how that connects to the way that people are thinking. And the way that research has been framed, the history is there were some of the other pronouns

Speaker 2:          09:41          and then the dissolution of identity into this unbelievable chaos that that even appears to transcend that, that the dimensions of, of species. I got an article today from, from a viewer in England who sent me the transcripts, I believe it was of the German philosophers talk, who claimed that our recognition of the biological sex of animals is nothing but an artificial imposition of our arbitrary ideological construct, which is exactly what you'd, you'd claim if you, if you, if you decided that the underlying biology was irrelevant. This is why I think the evolutionary biologists are next in the sights of the social justice warriors.

Speaker 1:          10:26          Absolutely. I think there is a degree to which even a traditional, uh, transgender be pulled do still maybe not assault, but certainly threatened, uh, the, the, uh, the category of male and female. Suddenly, I, I tried to argue for why I, why we need to consider a definition of woman that maybe include someone like me. I don't demand it. I just argue for it. Um, but then there's the other thing that I, the other matter that you seem to talk about more, which is the inclusion of a new categories such as non binary and what that means to the mat, the, the meaning of gender. But I think including a trans woman into the category of woman, uh, maybe not equally, but similarly, uh, threatened, uh, um, the definition of gender. Um, in a similar way, maybe not assault. Um,

Speaker 2:          11:20          it definitely destabilizes it. And, and the question is what exactly should be done about that? Because you know there's been a claimable say western philosopher since I really think since the beginning of the philosophical tradition that the basis of civilization itself, the structural basis is, is roughly speaking the nuclear family. And another thing I think that's come under assault, and this is certainly something that was picked up by the cross to Christian fundamentalists early, was that the dissolution of these categories, structures also to destabilize the nuclear family. And the problem with that is we don't exactly know what the consequences of that will be. We do know the scientific literature is quite clear on this as far as I'm concerned, children who are raised in intact families with two biological parents do far better on every, or pretty much everything that's measured. And so now of course the problem with the family, and you can see this reflected in say Kathleen wins new legislation on, I think it's called the old families are equal.

Speaker 2:          12:21          That's the bill, is that if any arrangement whatsoever between people can be family, then there's no such thing as family anymore. And if there's no such thing as family, well then we don't know what will happen. And the problem too is that it seems to me that it's in the interest of people who are non, who do not fit easily into categories to not destabilize the main culture too badly. And there's a reason for that is the main culture right now is actually pretty tolerant. If you'd be stabilized at culture enough, it, it will become rapidly intolerant. And then the first thing that happens is those who are identifiably different are the first targets of an intolerant culture. So it seems to me that it's incumbent on the lbgt, et Cetera community. If they want to request inclusion, then they also have to figure out how that can be done in a way that doesn't destabilize the entire category structure because it it risks doing that. So now you had some arguments about why the category of woman should be expanded to include people like you. Now obviously you're doing everything in your power to present yourself to the world in a manner that makes you easily categorizable.

Speaker 1:          13:33          Absolutely. And I guess I don't necessarily even think of it that way. You know, I don't think, uh, I want to be seen as woman. So I'm going to do all these things to be viewed as woman. Um, I do all these things because I am a woman. Um, I do all these things just because it comes naturally to me. And the end product happens to be, uh, a subject that in people's minds is easily register a ball.

Speaker 2:          14:02          Well that's also, I would say that's an act of politeness on your part, you know, so, so one of the things people concluded when I first made my videos is that I wouldn't use he or she to to, uh, refer to, I'll say someone like yourself who wants to be referred to as she. And my attitude about that was never that. But having thought through it further, I also realized that my natural behavioral proclivity, and I think that most people is to refer to someone by the protein chro pronoun that addresses their appearance because it's, it's a, it's a pronoun use is actually rather casual, right? You do it unthinkingly in automatically. And you address a person in keeping with the manner in which they manifest themselves. And, and you're doing that, you're saying that that's also a, or maybe even primarily a manifestation of an inner drive, but obviously the, the manner in which that inner drive is manifest itself is also socially, it's part of a social negotiation.

Speaker 2:          15:04          Of course. That's probably my argument for choosing a definition of women that includes me, uh, because for the sake of communication it just seems, makes sense. Language is what we use to communicate with one another. We don't want to corrupt it. The better we communicate the real world to on and not that the Beta we use language and I think there would actually be more confusion if people refer to me as he on sa and stuff. So part of your cases that is actually no way of addressing you. That doesn't produce some confusion. And so using she is the simplest, which is less confused. Okay. Okay. That's an interesting argument. Okay. So what would you say if I said you could make a case that your mere existence is a threat to categorical order? And so I could say that your duty as a consequence, despite the potential violation of your own sense of self, would be to what?

Speaker 2:          16:04          To deny your own inner impulses and conform because not doing so I understand that that comes at a personal cost. And I'm not trying to minimize that cost. And I'm also not saying that you should do this, but I think you can make a case that it's like, it's like the social obligation of someone who doesn't fit into a fundamental category too tricky one man to fit in regardless because it's so threatening not to. No, I mean you could make the same case about artists. That's the problem, right? You could make the same case about anyone but doesn't fit in and often people who don't fit in our necessary. So it's a very tricky thing to think through. Well, I'd like to come back to the argument for a usefulness of language, uh, like how useful is the definition of women, you know, for the most part, using a definition of lemon, someone who was on with xx chromosomes and, and you now can give birth. And you know, all of those things that's very useful because it describes the vast majority of cases that you will find in real world.

Speaker 2:          17:11          And it facilitates certain kinds of interactions. I mean, so I don't see that it's necessarily conflicting. Two can set it in a given situation. We saw him and he was not born biologically female to consider the use of a different definition of women if it's Camina communicatively useful. And that way we don't have to, we don't have to threaten categories because we were still committed to. Okay. Um, okay, so let, so let me ask you some questions about that. So let's assume that your point is well taken then I might say, if you're born a man and you wish to be treated as a woman, what are the minimal obligations that you have to undertake in order to be granted that, let's say privilege? You know, because the way this is framed, right, the way it's been framed and discussions with me so far is that it's a matter of respect to you, someone's pronouns.

Speaker 2:          18:07          And I think that's nonsense because when I see people on the street and I referred to them as he or she, it has nothing to do with respect. It's just, it's just the most casual of communication in camps. And so, so I don't buy the respect thing, but let's say you're making a case that the most straight forward thing is to include you or, or people that are in the same position as you. So what do you think your obligations are? Your responsibilities are to the social compact, but say in order to be given that I got to saint privilege, it's something like that because it's okay.

Speaker 1:          18:42          Privilege is fine with me. I think that, um, considering that my answer to that question would be to be regarded as the gender that you identify eyes common sensically within your culture. Maybe. Maybe that's your obligation.

Speaker 2:          19:00          Yeah, I'm okay. Well that seems to be at least reasonable because at least then you don't make it any more awkward for people to interact with you than it has to be. I was talking to an artist the other day named Jonathan Patio and we were talking about the issue of, of non categorical identity and he, he was talking to me about um, mythological stories of the welcoming of strangers. There's a very strong tradition of hospitality in most cultures and if a stranger shows up here to welcome them into your house, but they're supposed to behave when they're in your house so they're not supposed to steal all your vaccine. Right. And rape your women and so forth. Right, exactly. So there's an obligation on both sides. Right?

Speaker 1:          19:41          Like what, like what Gavin McInnes said about trans, who transitioned from male to female. You said that you're not, if you're going to go to Japan and you're going to go live in Japan, do you need to like speak their language to communicate with them, adopt our costumes, take your shoes off when you enter the enter the house were referred by their last name, all these things. That's just what you do. That's what a stranger does if they don't want to be considered a stranger anymore.

Speaker 2:          20:06          Right, exactly. Exactly that. Yeah. Something. Well, so it seems to me that there needs to be a discussion about responsibilities. If, if the excluded other wants to be included. The way to be included isn't to blow apart the category structure. It's to make faculty behaves nicely when you're welcomed into the house. It's something like that. Okay, so I've got a more, a more vicious question to ask you. I would say this is a rough one man.

Speaker 1:          20:31          Like caught like the, the, the majority of his live stream of, because then a transphobic, transphobic by probably every trend, the majority of trans people. I love it. I think this is

Speaker 2:          20:44          such good comments. Okay, so here's, now here's another problem. One of the things that I've been thinking through the last couple of weeks is the idea of discrimination because discrimination and judgment and categorization aren't that easy to tell apart and you have to be discriminating or you'll do anything all the time. Do you have to mcallen? But you have to exclude. Now, one of the things that's very characteristic about seeing the sexual behavior among human beings is it's very exclusionary. So, for example, among chimpanzees, the females are promiscuous meters. Now the dominant males have more offspring, but that's because they chase the subordinate males away from the females when they're in estrous, when they're in heat, the females that are in heat, they'll meet with any male. The dominant males chase away the subordinate males, so they get more offspring. But it has nothing to do with female, let's say preference.

Speaker 2:          21:36          Human beings are very strange in this regard, and this is maybe why we're so different from chimpanzees, even though we share a common ancestor. And one of the big differences is that human females are very, very choosy sexually. And so this is why, for example, you have twice as many female ancestors as mail APP ancestors. And it's a hard thing to think about conceptually, but basically it means that on average, every, you'd get that outcome. If on average, every female produced two offspring and every male only produced one. Now that would mean some males produce far more than one and some produced zero. So there's differential sexual success in males and females in human beings. It's because of female sexual selectivities. So this is what females choose before they choose men who are across or above them. In dominance hierarchies, they tend to choose for health.

Speaker 2:          22:28          They tend to choose for appearance. They tend to choose for productivity that's manifested often in status and so forth. And so what that means is that a minority of males are found very sexually attractive and the majority of males not. So my point is is that one of the most fundamental rights that say feminists want to retain is the right to absolute sexual choice in their partners. But they don't understand that that's based on exactly the forms of discrimination that they're always arguing against. So because you generally, people sleep with someone up their own race, they sleep with someone of their own religion roughly the same age. They generally go after healthy people. They generally go after attractive people. And so every single dimension of discrimination that you can possibly imagine governs sexual choice. If you completely eradicate the justification for discrimination, which I would also say is the same justification for freedom of association, you also blow out the element of sexual choice. No. The question I wanted to ask you is, considering you as a potential sexual partner is going to be distressing to the majority of people. Is that acceptable? Yes. Why?

Speaker 2:          23:41          Because, um, I'm an anomaly. It's just not something people comfortable with.

Speaker 1:          23:46          Uh, the fact that I was born a different way than I am now, even if they are attracted to me, it makes my dating life a bit harder. But I mean I'm a huge proponent of discrimination. I think that's 100% within people's rights. Uh, I would never call us on transphobic because they don't want to seek with me because I was born one way and that's their preference as their prerogative. It's 100% people's right to discriminate.

Speaker 2:          24:13          So do you think that there's any ways, obviously you saw to this through a lot, like the part of the problem here is that distinguishing that from forbidden forms of discrimination is very, very difficult conceptually. Like it's not obvious why it's okay to discriminate against someone sexually. This happened in brave new world in Huxley's novel where any form of sexual discrimination was regarded as socially inappropriate, such that if someone asks you to have sex with them, it was your moral obligation, not only to do it, but to be happy about the basic hypothesis was, or the basic slogan was everyone belongs to everyone else. That's the final limit of the absence of discrimination. So, but why do you think that discrimination of that sword is okay?

Speaker 1:          24:54          I believe in equality and lack of discrimination, equal treatment under the law. That is kind of where it ends for me. Very much free market. And my thinking, um,

Speaker 2:          25:04          well the free market example's an interesting one because maybe the reasons and that it's okay for other people to discriminate is because we want to retain the right for ourselves to discriminate because mate, maybe it's something like you're willing to have people reject you as a potential sexual partner as long as you're also allowed the privilege to reject other people as opposed to it.

Speaker 1:          25:26          I'll take that type things on both, uh, the, the whole transgender people in Washington's thing. I believed when that was going on. It's kind of died down now. But I believe when that was going on that's the state shouldn't be saying, uh, trans people aren't allowed in, in, in the washroom of their choosing or shouldn't I, I was like, that's up to the business owners to make that decision. Is this a, a business down the road of restaurant that wouldn't let me, you know, use the washroom, the female washroom, so be it. I'll just go to a different restaurant and that's why I'm so, I'm very free market thinking and I, I, I think discrimination is something that needs to, the right to discriminate is something that needs to be protected at all costs.

Speaker 2:          26:10          It certainly seems to have to be protected to some degree. I think the sexual choice conundrum, I mean there were horrors on both sides of it, right? The first horror is, well, if you obliterate sexual discrimination, then you have to allow yourself to, to be the sexual target of whoever when ever that seems like pretty bad solution. And it's certainly not one that I think particularly women would rapidly accept. And that's such an assault individuals agency, right? Right. It's the ultimate assault on an individual's agency, but the problem is is to maintain that right to choice is to also maintain the right to discriminate and then putting the boundaries on what you're allowed to discriminate against is very, very tricky. Like I think we've gone far too far in in the, in the antidiscrimination direction. It's very difficult for people on campuses now to aggregate themselves in gender uniform groups. And I'm not sure that's a good idea. I like, it seems to me that men should be allowed to hang around with men if they want to and that women should be allowed to hang around with women when they want to and that actually that right might be necessary for the proper development of masculinity and femininity. What one final thing, this is another horrible thing that no one ever talks about.

Speaker 2:          27:24          The data suggests that men who are homosexual have a very large number of sexual partners, and that makes sense to me because men tend not to say no to sexual opportunities. And so my man with man, it's like no one says no. So there's lots of sexual activity. Well, so one of the things I'm curious about is if marriage is expanded on any other grounds merely than the legal grounds, which I think aren't sufficient to even maintain marriage as an, as an institution, if marriage is expanded to include same sex couples, say what are the obligations of the same sex couples once they're actually married? So does that mean that that, and I know the literature on this, that the suggestion is that most male homosexuals who get married don't give up. They're promiscuous ways. Well, it seems to me that if you don't give up your permissionless ways, then you're actually not playing the game of marriage. And that's why it's one of the discussions about responsibility that I don't think has been had in public land. If you want to be part of the game, then in principle you also have to follow the rules. So that doesn't mean everyone who's heterosexual who's managed.

Speaker 1:          28:41          You absolutely obliterate the very fundamental building blocks of a society and a culture. That's what happens when, uh, when you, when you violent, very important categories like marriage,

Speaker 2:          28:53          right? That's right. You know, we don't know what the fundamentals, we don't really understand the fundamentals. I mean people, people have need philosophical claims. I would say gender identity is a fundamental. Children learn that very early and marriage is a fundamental and the nuclear family is a fundamental and you know, we, we have no idea how many of those fundamentals can be challenged before the whole bloody thing shakes and falls down and it, unless you wanted to shake and fall down. All right, so good. Well that was good. So maybe we're going to do this again

Speaker 1:          29:23          everyone, everyone please check the link below to register for the right to offend conference. Uh, on November 19th. Um, it's going to be Greg, we'll be talking about some of the topics surrounding a political correctness, free speech and so on. And uh, I wanted to have this live stream because a Dr. Peterson wasn't able to, wouldn't be able to make it in person for that conference. So I just wanted to use this time to promote it. Thank you so much, Dr. Peterson. All right. All right. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye Bye.
