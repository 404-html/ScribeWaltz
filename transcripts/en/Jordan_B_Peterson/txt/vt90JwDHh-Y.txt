Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay, so you know how I been telling you guys about the hierarchical model, you know where the motor actions on the bottom and then higher order abstract conceptions at the top so you can be a good person if you're a good parent, you don't know how to take care of your children. If you can keep your house orderly and productivity. If you can make dinner, if you can set a table and so on, all the way decomposed all the way down to motor actions, right? So it brings you from the level of abstract to the level of concrete. Okay, so now think about this, so keep that in your mind first. Now the second thing you want to keep in your mind is the kind of models that we were talking about a little bit last week. So they're the, their expectancy models that were derived from vinegar, Nova and soca law and so forth and, and, and really, you know, finalized in some sense by great.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Now, what those models say fundamentally is that if you're moving towards a target, a conservatory target, which would be specified by hypothalamic or other underlying motivational systems or some combination of those, sometimes it can be a higher order goal. Then anything that occurs while you're proceeding towards that goal, that indicates that you're going to get it or move closer to it, produces positive emotion. Okay? And that's mediated by the hypothalamic exploratory, paused, have an effect circuit that runs through the nucleus accumbens, and it basically runs on dopamine. Okay? So that's positive emotion. Roughly speaking, it's positive emotion in relationship to incentive reward. What happens if you attain the goal, which is the consumer story. Reward is it satisfies you, and that's also a form of reward, but it's not associated with as much positive emotion, it's more associated with the lack of necessity to do that anymore, you know, so you're done with that and that can be satisfying and it does seem to be motivated mediated by Serotonin, which is basically a satiating agent among its other properties.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       Okay? So that's on the positive emotion end of things. Um, briefly, an incentive reward is also equivalent to a conditioned reward in classical behavior theory, so that's actually something you should probably know, but all talk about it a bit more because you kind of need, you need to know how behavior is theory developed across time because behaviors, theory has been incredibly instill is incredibly influential in neuroscience, especially in the real neuroscience, which is almost always done with animals. So, so that's one of the positive emotion in. Now let's go to the negative emotion. And so now you're proceeding towards a goal and something gets in your way. Um, you're walking across the carpet to go to work and you step on a dog bone, you know, and that's maybe a little painful, but we'll keep that apart from this discussion for a moment. It constitutes an impediment to your progress forward, or maybe your kid left, uh, you know, like a piece of furniture in the hallway, that's a better example.

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       So it's a bit of an obstacle and when you look at that, then that's going to produce negative emotion. And the negative emotion is because there's an obstacle in your path. Now you might say, how much negative emotion should you experienced when you encounter an obstacle? And that's something that I don't remember if I got, if I assigned you guys the entropy paper that I wrote with Jacob Hersch and Raymond Martin, but anyways, we, we took a long time to figure out how you might calibrate how upset you should get when something negative happens. And what we realized fundamentally was that it was proportional to the place in the hierarchy where your goals were disrupted. You know, so if you just have to make a minor course correction by walking around, the amount of upset you should get is basically proportional to the amount of extra energy that you have to expand correcting your course.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       And so a minor obstacle is just going to, you know, produce a little bit of arousal and stress. Whereas if you go out to try to start your car and it won't start well, then that's gonna make you more upset, experience more negative emotion. You know? And if, if you read that you're, the business you work in has just collapsed because of the CEO was a crook. And now it's bankrupt, that's going to cause you even more distressed. And the distress, roughly speaking, should be proportional to the level of the hierarchy in your expectancy network or desire network more accurately. That's disrupted by the occurrence. Okay? So in that, that makes sense. It's solid. And then, um, you know, then there's the special case of things you don't know about, you know, so, and, and often when something gets in your way, the problem with what gets in your way is you actually can't compute how much time and energy it's going to take you to fix it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       And so it's very hard to calibrate how much negative emotion you're going to feel under those circumstances, right? Like the, for example, how anxious should you get if your car quits working while they answered that is you don't know. And because maybe it'll never work again, you know, and then it would depend on, well, you know, do you have enough money to replace it? And how much trouble will you run into practically speaking, if you use that money to replace it. And then it might also depend on, um, your baseline levels of neuroticism because what a neuroticism neuroticism is, it's the negative emotion factor in the big five. What neuroticism is, is a, it's a, it's a, it's a role of the genetic dice which says that your body should output x amount of physiological energy or preparation for energy in response to x amount of disruption.

Speaker 1:          00:06:12       And X varies, right? So imagine that. Imagine you're calibrated for a dangerous environment. So on average, the evolutionary design dice has designed your genetic system so that you're much more reactive to a normal list or punishing things, anomalous or threatening things more accurately punishing as well than the typical person might be. Now, you might say, well, is that right? Is that wrong? Is there something wrong with that? It's like there's nothing wrong with that at all. If it turns out that on average, the environment tends to be much more dangerous than the typical human environment. You know, now it might be kind of rough on you, especially if you have a nervous system that's high in neuroticism when you're actually not at that much risk, roughly speaking. Then there'd be a mismatch between the genetic roll of the dice and the average safety of the environment.

Speaker 1:          00:07:03       And you know, modern environments are pretty safe. So we all worry about being anxious, which is funny because we're anxious about being anxious and the reason we can afford to be anxious about being anxious is because we actually don't experience that many punishments compared to what we might have experienced 120 years ago. You know, when the average daily income incorrect to dollars for people in North America was under a dollar a day, you know, that was hard. So okay, so anyways, your neuroticism is one of the things that that helps determine how much upset you should experience per unit of uncertainty or threat. Okay. Another thing is your status among other people. So you might think, well, what else should determine how anxious you get when something you don't want happens? And you might say, well, your competence and your competence, roughly speaking should be how good on average are you compared to other people at dealing with problems when they arise.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       And so competence is actually one of the more, um, what would you say? Cognitive elements of what you might call self esteem, you know, if it turns out that you're pretty good at problem solving or it turns out that you actually have a very wide network of social resources, which basically boils down to the same thing, right? It doesn't really matter if you can solve a problem, if you know someone who can solve the problem. So social network and intrinsic computational resources are comparable phenomena. And if you turn out to be a good problem solver, then on average you should be less upset when something is upsetting than someone who isn't a good problem solver.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       Okay? So that makes sense. I presumed now here's something I've been thinking for a long time and there's a lot of debate about this and the relevant literature. The terror management people, for example, they claim that people get anxious because they're afraid of death. Um, you know, at a psychological level, it's lurking at the back of their minds all the time. It's an existential problem and I suppose that's because death is one of those threats that threatens you right at the very top of your hierarchy, right? Good person and dead person don't go well together. So death threatens the entire hierarchy. And so it's very anxiety provoking. That seems quite reasonable as a proposition. Now the other thing that happens in the terror management theorists, theories which are, which are variants of the Freud Freud in theories, is that there's a further claim made, which is that

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       belief systems protect you against death anxiety. Now this is a complicated claim. Partly it, it, it is extracted from Freud's observation that religious systems are protective against death anxiety. He actually thought they were neurotic protections against dense, that they have anxiety. So it was sort of like, like a primitive faith in the ability of the father roughly speaking to solve the problem and protect you. So he thought it was a projection of the infant tile world onto the broader world and powerful critique. I think sometimes it's true and the death anxiety people, the terror management people who basically developed their theories from a book by the book's called the denial of death. I'll remember the author in a moment

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       anyways. It doesn't matter. The theory was broadened out to to propose that your belief systems as such, I provided you with that protection and then there was a bit of a variation of that theory, which was your vision of yourself as an illusory climber upon value hierarchy also protected you now exactly how it protected you. It was never really explained, and I'm not taking issue with Becker. Ernest Becker, Becker, who wrote the book. Becker is a smart guy. It's a great book. It's dangerously wrong, but it's. But it's a great book. Well, lots of great books. You know, they, they're, they're wrong and an extraordinarily interesting way and that makes them. That can make them a great book.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       I think Becker's wrong because he assumes that are all everything we do to cope with death. Anxiety is actually an illusion and I think that's a terrible thing. Terrible idea. It's extraordinarily dangerous idea and I also don't believe it's true for reasons I'll talk to you about later anyways, you can sort of see that, so then we can lay that on top of the expectations theory in some sense, right? Because basically what the expectancy theory people do do like gray is they assume, okay, novelty itself is both threatening and incentive rewarding. So it's threatening because God only knows what might happen to you if you run into something novel and it's. It has an incentive reward element because if you dig around in the novelty, you never know what sort of treasure you might bring to the surface and so people have an ambivalent relationship with novelty and I think you can actually understand how that ambivalent relationship works. If you think about the hierarchy again, so here's the, here's the rough proposition. If an enormously emerges at the lowest level, the highest resolution level, then it's sort of interesting. You know, so a baby might be playing with a fork and you know, find out that the forte makes a tinging noise when he hits it on the table. Now that doesn't terrify the baby.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       It's funny though, you know when you see babies on youtube now go absolutely pick it, absolutely terrified if their mothers sneezes or sometimes if she laughs, you know, so anyways, but whatever for if the baby's sort of mastered a fork, then the fact that it makes a ticking noise is gonna make them curious and that's an incentive reward phenomena more than frightened, you know, it's going to depend to some degree on the baby's level of neuroticism. And it might also depend on how close the baby is to the mother because it actually turns out that maternal proximity proximity more dilates the expression of negative emotion and children and touch really does that by the way, which is quite cool. And that's that strict site that's direct physical physiology touches calming and it's also analgesic, which is quite cool. So it quells pain. So okay, so anyways, the baby is making this ticking noise and he finds that quite interesting because it never happened before. And so he's curious enough about it to replicate it, to do it again and he's under the control of his psychomotor approach systems. And they mediate exploration as well, positive promotion, but

Speaker 1:          00:13:57       you know, it's a great big dog comes bounding in, well the dog has teeth and it's big and it, you know, maybe it's got a deep bark and all that. So it's associated with, with unexpected movement power and predatory features. Like you know, lots of babies, let's say toddlers will run and hide behind their mother that's a little bit more novelty than they can really tolerate. And so you might think that whether you find something positive or negative when it's a normal plus, depends on how high up in the hierarchy the threat apparently exists. Okay? Now here's another corollary.

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       Let's assume that before you build your map of the world, which you could think about as a map of expectancy or you think about as a map of desire or of how to fulfill desire. Or You could think about it as a map of how to organize your body and your thoughts in the world so that when you express that in the world, the world delivers you what it wants. And I think that's the most accurate terminology. Okay. The, the, the, the idea there is that as you build up and differentiate this map, you bring the, uh, normally under control because you reduce it from God only knows what it is to something you can either use or ignore and that regulates your nervous system chronically. So the a priori phenomena is novelty and that would be equivalent to the phenomenologists thing that shines forth.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       Same idea, completely different derivation, and then you build a model that inhibits it, and the rule is the mortal inhibits it as if when you act out the model, it delivers what you want it to deliver, which is kind of a form of pragmatism from a philosophical perspective. So you understand that. So then the next proposition is that model inhibits anxiety. Okay? Now you can see that that idea is akin to the idea that your culture inhibits death anxiety. Although I would say it's a more delineated model and it explains, it better be part of the problem with a death anxiety idea is that first of all, your culture is not in your head. Right? Where's your culture and your beliefs there? It's around you. Yeah, yeah, so a big part of the culture, the culture is the fact that you're all sitting there, you know, basically clones of each other doing exactly the same thing in this room at exactly the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       That's the damn culture and it means that you can all ignore each other and concentrate on something else. And so the culture is all like it's the floor beneath your feet. It's the ceiling over your head. It's the car you drive to work. It's, you know, it's the traffic light system that pretty much everybody attends to. So in some sense the matches, the culture is actually the match between the technologies and and webs of comprehension that the individuals use in the world and the world. It's the match. It's not the phenomena itself and it's certainly not only what you believe in your head, which is a little too much on the psychoanalytic and it doesn't take into account the pragmatics of culture, which are the things we act out and the technological phenomena that exist and the whole web of game, like structures. Those are all embedded in.

Speaker 1:          00:17:32       So that would be a of an idea, right? All this stuff's organized and very much high order games and as long as it works the way you think will work in the world. So that keeps your anxiety under control because there's no mismatch, but even better, not only are you not afraid of death at every moment, but yeah, actually don't die, which is even better than not being afraid of death, right? Because you're not freezing to death in here and there's no insurrection and the probability that you're going to get run over on the way home. It's pretty damn low as long as you follow the rules. And so we should never remember that. Culture is culture is not only represented in the interior space, it's not only beliefs, its actions, and we should also remember very, very carefully that it's distributed in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       Okay? So back to the match mismatch idea. So you've got this map of how your of what effects your behaviors are going to have in the world when you implement them, and sometimes that match works, in which case you're pretty happy because that's an incentive reward. You're moving towards your goal and it's happening. Not only that, and this is a secondary thing that the behaviorists could never get a handle on because they didn't use hierarchical representations in this way. One of the advantages, I mean, imagine that you're trying to pick someone up and it's going pretty well. Well, there's two sources of reward there. One is it's going pretty well. The second is you're the sort of person who in this situation can implement a strategy that's going well, right? So not only is it a signal that you're making progress, it's a signal that the structure that you're using to guide your actions and your perceptions while you're making progress is working so it validates the whole damn theory and you know that will echo through your entire hierarchy of presupposition.

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       It's especially true. I used an amazing scenario because you know those are particularly relevant to self esteem, let's say, which is a word that no one should ever be allowed to use, but will. It's a word that we'll use in this situation on the less so and it's hard to tell exactly what's being reinforced or reward. Reward is feeling good. Reinforcement is how the structures that you're using to perceive and approach what you're perceiving and approaching are asked to grow. Okay, so most of the time if, if something happens that's rewarding, what that means is the structures that you have been using to bring about that outcome are actually cold. To grow a bit, gets stronger and Dopa means seems to do that as well as making you feel good and sometimes I wonder, it's not exactly this because you can separate reward and reinforcement, but sometimes I wonder if the goodness of feeling isn't associated with the thriving and flourishing of neural tissue. You know, it's like it's an invitation to grow instead of die because if you're being punished and threatened all the time, then the systems that are leading you to be in those situations do get extinguished. Fundamentally. They get starved of what gives them life and they wither away or are inhibited. I don't think that's very pleasant.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Okay, so you got your map and you got the world and you're acting out this map and hopefully the match between your map of the world is such that the Mac matches the world and if it doesn't, you get into normally and then the anomaly can be of different sizes proportionate to the hierarchy and then your emotional response is proportionate to where the anomaly seems to rest in the hierarchy as well. Subject to your own neuroticism, say, and your own competence, which we could think of as somewhat separate phenomena. Okay. So then you can say the reason that people don't like other people who are foreigners say or different ethnicity or who have different belief systems is because they appeared to challenge the integrity of that map. And so because their belief systems and the way they act first of all aren't very well mapped by the map.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       So you don't know what the hell those people are up to, you know, and the differences may be much smaller than you think. But what do you know? You don't know? Um, plus if their belief systems come with them, which they will, that has an indeterminant effect on the structure, the map, and it also has an indeterminant effect on your position within the map. And so then those theories, and it's a part of that is the theory that I developed in the book called maps of meaning that theory proposes at least in part that the reason that people cling to their belief systems the way they do is because of their belief systems are disrupted at a high level, low resolution level. Just that the, you know, level of action or way the hell up the hierarchy in terms of the definition of the good or what constitutes a redeemed person or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       Then that brings out tremendous disruption and then you'd expect to phenomena from that. You'd expect that people would be afraid say a foreigners are a strange ideas, but also that they'd be kind of interested in them. And I think generally our interactions with people who aren't like us generally or we think aren't like us, whatever take place at a level where it's more curiosity than fear. I mean, that would be almost the definition of a of a sustainable tolerant society, right? Everything around you is functioning well enough so that if someone comes along who's different in belief or action, they're not gonna. You're not gonna. Assume they're there a fatal threat to the integrity of your hierarchy and fall apart because of terror and curiosity. Mostly tear. Okay, so now you can vary that theory a bit and you can say,

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       wait a minute. Maybe it's not just anxiety that gets inhibited when your belief systems are structured to some degree, maybe it's more primordial. Maybe what happens is that it's more akin to the generalized stress response, which seems to be a more primordial and global reaction to threat or anomaly, and the generalized stress response basically occurs or seems to occur when the hippocampus. So the hippocampus, the map seems to be associated with the hippocampus in some way. Now the hippocampus is also the part of the brain that takes what you're observing and transforms Osho show short term attention and transforms it into medium to longterm memory. So first of all, the hippocampus keeps track of what it is that you're seeing and then it stores it there for awhile and then later it integrates it into the generalized map and so then the hippocampus seems to sort of stay at that nexus of the map which is likely represented cortically to a large degree and what's actually going on in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       So for example, grades hypothesis, roughly speaking is you're watching what goes on in the world and the map is telling you what's supposed to happen and then when something else happens, the hippocampus detects that that's a mismatch and then somehow it makes you afraid. Now here's how it seems to make you afraid. This I don't think was really laid out well until vinegar. Dova discovered it when she was really old. I mean she was doing most of her work in the early sixties, but she laid this out. I think it was in the early two thousands. What she showed was that, okay, so you have this part in the bottom of your, of your nervous system way, the hell down there called the reticular activating system. And it's old, old, and it's the thing upon which your sleep wake cycles dependent, so and your consciousness without your particular activating system is down.

Speaker 1:          00:25:38       It's like you're unplugged. So if you have a car accident way back here, if you have a car accident and your head twists enough to shear off the neural projections from the reticular activating system, you're in a permanent and irreversible coma. It was pretty interesting a because it means your consciousness depends on something that's not new. Like you're relatively new, like your cortical cap, but something that's so damn old that it was there before your whole brain. So that's pretty weird. Anyways, what vinegar Dover proposed was that the hippocampus, the hippocampus decides that's what's what's going on. Roughly matches what you expect or what you want, which is more accurate than it tells the reticular activating system not to be in a panic. And then the reticular activating system controlled. We're going to assume it's on all the time, except when it's told to be off.

Speaker 1:          00:26:33       The hippocampus says you can more or less stay off right now because everything's going according to plan. And then all of a sudden, poof, things don't go according to plan. The hippocampus tells, the reticular re releases the reticular activating system from inhibition and then the reticular activating system wakes up all your sub cortical circuits and that stress and so wake up would mean get afraid, but it would also mean prepared to get the hell out of there. So prepare to panic and then it might also mean ready other motivational systems, just in case they might be useful. And then that also means shut off your immune system because who the hell cares about that? If you're being chased by a tiger, you know and pull all the sugar out of your blood because you bloody well are going to need the energy. And so it's an emergency preparedness state.

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       So then you could say that when you encounter in a normally what happens is that your body generates an emergency preparation state and the magnitude of that is proportional to your perception of where the threat of what level the threat corresponds to in your map. Okay, got it. Is that makes sense. Okay. So there's something wrong with that theory and that's very annoying because it's a really good theory and, and people have been coming at it from all sorts of angles and it sort of matches the phenomenological ideas that actually matches heidegger's thinking quite nicely and that it was derived as far as I can tell virtually independently of heidegger. And it goes along well with the neuroscience of anxiety and motivation in general. Like it's a vicious theory. But here's the problem. So for a long time people debated about who the hell was authoritarian,

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       you know, because you could say after the Second World War, most people assumed that all the damn authoritarians were on the right way. Right? They were the fascists. And so you could say that's an exaggeration of conservatism. Get all that seems kind of reasonable. But then people pointed out later, well, yeah, but let's not forget about the radical left wingers because by the time they become communist dictators, they seem pretty damn old press of an intolerant to. Alright. So I would say we don't understand what happens when political systems get too far in any direction, but there are models which are in development that basically indicate that

Speaker 1:          00:29:08       imagine this is agreeable list and this is disagreeableness, okay, and you can think about them as a continuum, but let's not do that. Let's twist them. So they form a circle, all right? And then we'll say, well, how agreeable should you be? Well, if you're disagreeable and this disagreeable things are going pretty well for you. It's a nice place to be. But if you're this agreeable, well then you turn into Freud's devouring mother, right? You're so damn easy to get along with it. It's okay. You just do everything for your child. Absolutely everything forever. And by that doing that, you undermine their capabilities and they, they remain locked in the eatables situation. So that's like too much mercy and pity. Or You could be like the tyrannical father, like the crumb brother's father who was like completely disagreeable and extraordinarily punitive. But the thing is it ends up in the same place. It, they both ended up in a variation of hell. And so these models seem to seem to promote the idea that if you run any virtue too far, it turns into a vice and all the vices have more common in each other with each other than they do with everything else, with anything else. So bad things are lumped together more because they're bad than they are by what variant of bad they happen to be. And we kind of know that because if, you know, when we developed the big five,

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       when people develop the big five because it wasn't me, they had, they threw out all the, uh, evaluative words. That was the idea. They threw out all the evaluative boards like good and evil disappeared. So anything that seemed to have a moral overtone was arbitrarily thrown out. Now there was actually some statistical reasons for that. And the statistical reason is, is if you just leave the good, you know, the, the adjectives that represent someone as good or the adjectives that represent someone as evil. If you leave those in the damn analysis, then you get one whopping factor, which is something like good versus evil. And that's not that helpful. Maybe anyways, so you throw all those things out so they don't distort your, your analysis, and then that's when you get the five factors revealing themselves. So, but if you throw the pejorative items back in, then you get this whopping single dimension.

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       Now one of the things you should think about that, especially those of you who are going to be researchers, is the fact that the evaluative words were thrown out of the big five adjective pool before the big five were derived, makes the correlation between the big five factors and psychopathology much weaker than it would otherwise be. Right? Because with psychopathology, you know, a lot of it can't be described without roughly good versus evil. You know, it depends on the cycle, pathological condition, but if you're describing like what murderous pedophilia, you know, it's hard to use adjectives that aren't loading pretty hard on the negative end of the adjective distribution. You know, when that's the case with most personality disorders, you know, because there seems to be an element of misbehavior and many of them. And so the big five isn't correlated all that strongly with most measures of say, personality disorders, but that's partly because all the words that weren't correlate were thrown out before the analysis was done. And so that's something you really, really need to know. Okay, so back one step, because I said that there's a. That there's a problem with the theory that I presented to you.

Speaker 1:          00:32:48       Here's the problem.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       We're going to assume for the time being, the easiest place to localize authoritarianism is on the right hand end of the spectrum. Okay, so we're going to think about fascism. Roughly. Speak in. I think that totalitarian governments tend towards fascism whether they're left or right wing, but how to sort that out hasn't been established yet. We don't exactly know what makes left wing authoritarian is like right wing authoritarian. Something does, but we don't know. So I'm going to ignore that for a moment and I'm going to concentrate on the right wing, on the right wing side of the spectrum, the conservative side of the spectrum. Now we know some things about conservatives. They don't like foreigners that much. They're pretty tradition heavy. They tend to frown on non normal forms of sexual interaction or even on many normal forms of sexual interaction. They may not even be that happy about fun, you know, so you could say the conservative is basically trying to destabilize society so that there isn't a lot that's unpredictable that's going to go on or that's going to go on in the future and so they're trying to maintain stability and you can give them some credit for that because it's the match between your expectations and the way the world lays itself out that basically inhibit your stress response.

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       So stability, man,

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       it's something you probably can't appreciate until you've had it's complete absence, you know, while the liberals, you know, their, their position is. Yeah, yeah. Stability. The problem is stability gets old unless you keep updating it. So you know you can't be, you can't clamp too hard down on change because if you do then the system gets stale and outdated and the stability goes away anyway. So you go out to allow some change and some exploration and some growth. And then the battle is between the people who wants to ability and the people who want change and neither of them is right. It's the argument. That's right, right. They got to keep arguing about it because whether we should be more stable or more plastic, roughly speaking depends on the context and the time. And so that's something to think about too because a lot of you are going, most of your left wingers because you're open,

Speaker 1:          00:35:02       you're open and that's a very big marker of the proclivity towards left wing thinking. And so you're all going to be thinking that the left wingers are right, but, but it's, it's a primitive attitude if your scientific. Because really what seems to happen is that both attitudes are right and they're both adapted to slightly different evolutionary conditions. So there are variants of the damn big five, those political beliefs. So liberal people are high in openness and low in conscientiousness. Whereas right wing people are low in openness and high in conscientiousness. And there's implications to that. One is liberal start the companies for example, but conservatives run them. So

Speaker 1:          00:35:46       art artists settled territory and make real estate values rise. They're very open people, but then the conservatives swoop in and monetize it, which is kinda hard on artists, but my point is is that there's a dynamic between these two positions that has to be maintained dynamically in order for the system to survive because you need to stabilize the damn thing so it doesn't fall apart, but you have to keep it adapted to continual change. And the only way you can figure out how much of that should be done on either side is to keep talking to the people that you don't like because it's the only way to figure it out. So some people pull this way and some people pull the other way and we hope that the middle of the polling basically matches the line of optimal progression. So that's a much better way of thinking about democracy. Okay? Now, so back to the problem. Now the problem is if you take this damn model and you think about conservatives, you're gonna think those people should be higher in neuroticism. Like if that, if their defining characteristic is inability to tolerate it normally or one of their defining characteristics, then you'd think, well, they should be more timid. On average. They should have more depression, they should be more anxious, they should have more negative emotion in general, so you'd. You'd think you'd see some reflection of that in neuroticism, but you don't

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       at all. In fact, liberals seemed to be a little more neurotic than conservatives, so and in fact the most neurotic people seem to be male liberals, so you think, well, maybe you could salvage the old theory because you could say, well, the damn conservatives are so protected by the radiology that they mask their underlying neuroticism so well that it actually reverses, but if you're stupid theory can predict the reverse of what it should predict, then it's not a very good theory and so you couldn't do that, but you know you're pushing your luck at that point. It's better to think, hm, something screwy here. Something's not right. Even though it's also conservatives score higher in in wellbeing measures of wellbeing, which is basically extroversion, minus neuroticism, something like that. With maybe a bit of conscientiousness thrown in and they're conscientious behavior does tend to make their life turn out more stable across time so they're less likely conscientious.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       People, for example, are less likely to get divorced. So it's hard to reconcile the fact that those damn conservatives keep insisting that they're not neurotic with the theories that predict well they have to be because the reason they're so rigid, especially if you've cranked their beliefs over to the right is because they're afraid of foreigners, new ideas and you know, all the sorts of things that right wingers are hypothetically afraid of, but they're not. And they actually seem to be like, like I said, they report that they're happier. You know, when you could say, well, it's naive, happiness and all that, but you can't say those things after you make the finding. Right? Because you're explaining it away. You have to predict the damn thing. You can backfill your theory later. Now, however, conservatives are higher than conscientiousness. So you're saying, so what? What the hell does that have to do with emotional regulation? You know, when you could say, well, they make more. They are there, their lives are more stable, so the external manifestations of the society that they encompass themselves in are more stable, so there's not as much normally. Okay, that's possible. However now and that's, that's possible. And it may be even, it's part of it.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       About seven years ago, I did some work with one of my students, call Indian. He did a lot of this. Um, I had recognized by that time that

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       the psychometric that the big five needed to be psychometrically differentiated or maybe more than it was because at that point that the stage was basically, there were the big five that usually measured by an instrument called the neo or the neo pii or the Neil Pei revised. You've got your five factors and then each of them were broken down into what they called facet. So they were sub sections of the each trait. But the problem with the damn facets as they weren't empirically derived, you know, the factors were derived from factor analysis. It's just more or less arbitrary statistics or at least objective statistics. But then the facets where like a guess. And we thought, well, you know, you can't rely on statistical reasoning to formulate the major part of the theory. Then just gas sat the higher resolution detail, so calling factor analyzed our data set called the Ip Ip, which is the international pool of that's item pool in international

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       ip Ip, I don't remember what it stands for. A guy named Lou Goldberg put it up online and he was one of the founders of the big five theory, the adjective form of the Big Five theory, so Colin factor and analyze that very carefully and what he found in a differentiated factor analysis was that you could take each of the big five and you could break them weirdly enough into two. So each of the big five had to. So extroversion had enthusiasm and assertiveness and then neuroticism had withdrawal and volatility and actually there's some evidence showing that those actually have different neurological underpinnings was quite cool. Agreeableness factors out into politeness and compassion and liberals are higher on compassion. That's the bleeding heart. Liberal and Conservatives are higher on politeness. If you mangled the two together, you don't get any difference in agreeableness between the political dimensions, but if you separate them, then the liberals are compassionate and the Conservatives are polite and we think that politeness may be the more conforming end of agreeableness, you know, so. All right, Nan, openness. This is a good one.

Speaker 1:          00:41:56       Roughly speaking, openness seems to fragment into openness to experience and intellect and openness to experience predicts whether you're going to take the humanities versus the sciences and it's the factor that's most strongly associated with artistic creativity and aesthetic sensibility and philosophy, philosophical idiation and entrepreneurial ability because entrepreneurs load with the bloody artists, which is pretty hard on your basic conservative capitalists, right? Because they'd rather. It wasn't that way, but it does turn out that that's. That's how it works out and then conscientiousness fragments into industriousness, which we do not understand at all really. We just don't have no idea what that trait is like. Why do people work hard towards their goals? We can't find a single bloody laboratory task that industrious people do better than non industrious people. Despite the fact that industriousness is an excellent predictor of longterm life outcomes, it's like, what the hell?

Speaker 1:          00:43:00       You know, we can't boil that down to a task in the lab. We've had people do things like count ends, ends, ams, and use in many, many sentences a count the use Jesus. You'd think that that would be something that an industrious conservative could get right into, you know, but no, there's no effect whatsoever. We can find some things that industrious and conscientious people do worse. So we have lab tests where they do worse. It's like that's something but. But anyways, it's a great mystery and I've been trying to crack that for like six years with no success at all. We keep getting industrious people to do things and they seem just as useless as non industrious people even though we know that's not true. It's a very good predictor of academic grades, by the way. Conscientiousness, and I'm sure it's the industrious component. It's just about as powerful as Iq. Oh yeah. Openness, creativity and ICU. Intellect is roughly icu except the intellect measure of. It's kind of bad because if I asked you how smart you are on a scale from one to seven, you'll tell me and that will correlate with your Iq, but Iq measures way more accurate than how smart you think you are.

Speaker 1:          00:44:13       So that's a. that's a cool division. That's very useful division. Okay, but on now on the conscientious and we've got orderliness and industrious now turns out that the conservatives are more orderly than the liberals.

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       Not more industrious. Now that's now you think, Ooh, that's kind of cool because one of the things you might say about the Germans for example, is that they are orderly and you could certainly say that about Hitler because he was damn orderly and orderly. People we know conscientiousness is associated with anti immigration attitudes and, and you know, a moral stance against non normative forms of sexual behavior and, but conscientious people all, she'll wash their hands more and their standards of hygiene are better and they are healthier. So that's kind of interesting. You know, that's, that's an unsettling lake because there's these positive things that are associated with orderliness that, you know, are obviously positive. But then there's these other things that seem to be associated with stigma or stigmatism and, and uh, what, what, uh, you know, strong Ingroup, outgroup divisions and derogation of the outgroup and all the things that you might see going extraordinarily pathologically in something like genocidal fascism, for example.

Speaker 1:          00:45:36       Now, when I was starting to sort this out, I was reading Hitler's spontaneous talks at the dinner table which were recorded over about a three year period. And one of the things I came to realize was that he didn't really see him afraid of Jews and Gypsies. He seemed disgusted by them and contemptuous of them, which is not the same thing [inaudible] discussed. It doesn't load on neuroticism or not very much. It loads on orderliness. And so that was a weird surprise because we thought all the damn negative emotions clumped together in neuroticism. And that was that and the problem, but discussed which, which hadn't been studied very much load zone orderliness. So then we thought hot, we've got the biological basis of half of conscientiousness. The biological basis is disgust, sensitivity.

Speaker 1:          00:46:29       That hasn't been published yet. Okay. So I was thinking about that and then Hitler washed his hands a lot. He bathed four times a day and he was also a real worshiper of willpower and orderly. People have strong willpower is one of the things about anorexic people you know, they're often anorexics are kind of strange because they tend to be like high achieving women. Fundamentally. They're usually smart and they're usually very, very dedicated and industrious. But the other thing is they're orderly. And so what seems to happen with the. I told you this before with the anorexics is the disgust system goes off the wires and it's too much happens with obsessive compulsive disorder too, which is usually classified as an anxiety disorder but really doesn't seem to be one. Maybe it's also an anxiety disorder, but mostly what people with ocd hate is to be contaminated.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       So I had to know CD client once who she had lost her husband and her children and everything and she in the hospital and she'd actually gone so far as to build like a pseudo airlock on her house so that her children and her husband would have to decontaminate themselves before they entered the house, you know, so. And that was too much for her marriage to sustain. And whenever she was walking down the hall at the hospital and the guys, the janitors walked by, she flattened herself up against the wall, you know, and then she'd run off and wash your hands. And if you're really OCD is really out of control, you wash your hands until the skin is raw basically. Or until you run out of soap, which you try running out of soap. When you're using a bar of soap, you have to wash your hands a lot or you shower until you run out of hot water.

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       You can't stop. And so you're never cleaned enough. And the, I was doing exposure therapy with her, which means you have to sort of make the person make contact with what they don't want to make contact with and you do it step wise, like you just don't throw them into a garbage can, you know, you have to get them to agree to, to what degree they're willing to expose themselves. And so this is what I could get her to do if I took a garbage can that was new. And I took a garbage bag that was new and I put them over there and I gave her a pool cue. She would touch the new garbage can with the new garbage bag, with the pool cue. That was the best she could do. And even then, like I was talking to her perfectly normal appearing person, you know, in, in many respects touch whack.

Speaker 1:          00:48:57       Like she's, she's going to that sake and she's going to wash your hands right now and you're supposed to do re response prevention, which is why you don't get to wash your hands. And so that turns out to be a very awkward thing to do in the middle of a psychiatric ward because I was standing there in the door trying not to let her get to the bathroom and she was wanting to get to the bathroom. So all the other psychiatric patients came up and you know, they started accusing me of basically being an authoritarian and interfering with her rights and it's wall. It's a weird thing, a, because, you know, was she given me permission five minutes before when she was in the normal state of mind and now she was retracting it. So who the hell did I ever contract with? And the answer is her now, because you can't sell yourself into slavery roughly speaking, you don't have that. Right? So maybe I was interfering with their rights, you know, it's a tricky thing because while she was hospitalized, so obviously something had gone wrong, but anyways, you get the picture. So it gives you an example of how powerful contamination concern can be. Okay. Now then there was a paper published in Plos one awhile back

Speaker 1:          00:50:08       looking at the prevalence of infectious diseases in route in countries around the world and then in provinces within countries, and then they measured the authoritarian attitudes using an authoritarian attitudes scale logically enough and what they found was the higher the prevalence of infectious diseases in the geographical locale, the more authoritarian people were locally in their individual political attitudes and the correlation wasn't point two, which is the general correlation between a personality trait and some phenomena. Point two, point three, if you're really lucky, point five, if it's ICU with that's the best he ever get. It was like point seven. It's like, wow, that's unbelievable. It's something to do with contamination and infection transmission, and so then I was thinking this is really annoying because this whole expectation theory, it's beautiful. It's. It works at a neurological level. It works at neuro psychological level. You can understand it pharmacologically, it makes conceptual sense. You can see that it unites theories that were derived from all sorts of different places. If it has all the classic elements of a beautiful theory and and it's wrong, and so then I thought, all right, what the hell, its orderliness and discussed what is going on there, and the sticking point was I could understand

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       how your brain could calculate how upset it should get when you hit an anomaly by referring to this hierarchy. That took me a long time to figure that out, like 10 years probably to map that out and I thought, okay, and then you know how neurotic you are and how high in esteem you're held by your, by your, the people around you. That's fine. But then what does disgust do about that?

Speaker 1:          00:51:53       Disgust doesn't seem to undo your damn belief system. You know, like you can encounter something disgusting and you know, you, you may be revolted by it. It's a very, very physiological sensation, right? Maybe I'll even throw up if it's, if it's bad enough and maybe you'll be shocked to the point where you're damn near traumatized, you know, and that's disgust related trauma, which we don't really understand, but you're not going to give up your damn beliefs. Not Most of the time it doesn't seem to represent a direct challenge to the validity of your, like Islam faith or Islamic faith or something like that. So what the hell is going on? So then I was talking to one of my graduates, there's graduate students this morning, we're trying to sort this out. And I was thinking, okay, what would happen? Here's an experiment we're thinking about running. So you, you tell me what you think about this. So

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       we thought we would take people have a different range of appearance, you know, from really not so beautiful too, quite attractive and different, different races and different ethnicities. And then we would announce the ethnicity, you know, Jewish Bang, we'd show them a picture black, show them a picture Caucasian Bank, show them a picture and the pictures would vary in attractiveness. But then what we're gonna do is we're going to morph them with snakes and rats. So then you, because you can take a morphing program, right? And you could, I could make you like 10 percent snake our percent wrapped. You've seen that movies all the time. And so then the question would be, would you be more likely a to see an unattractive person as a rat or a snake? And B, would you be more likely to see a person who isn't a member of your ethnic and racial group as a rat or a snake?

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       Ha. Now that's interesting because the thing to do with rats and snakes is get rid of them. Right? And that's a problem. So, and then we thought we would also measure how orderly people were to see if that mediated, the degree to which they were willing to perceive and be in place at perception. Fundamentally whether this person was rat or snake. Like we've got some other experience experiments that are of the same sort device. So I think that's a great experiment. I'm really curious. And then we'd have people rate them. It's like how afraid are you of this person? How happy does this person make you know how, how, how, how contemptuous are you have this person, how disgusted are you by this person? You know, a whole emotional response scale. And hopefully what we would find is the orderly people were more contemptuous and disgusted but not more afraid by the morphed faces and they would be more likely to categorize them as rat and snake, like especially if they were from a different ethnic group or race. So it's a scary experiment, but it would allow us to distinguish between fear and, and, and contempt. And then I was thinking, well still why do the hell do you care?

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       Why is the disgusting so important? What the hell does it have to do with you? And then I was remembering maybe, I don't know, maybe this game doesn't even exist anymore because the world has changed, but I bet it does.

Speaker 1:          00:55:15       When I was a little kid in like grade one, we used to play this game in school and the game was, I think on the simpsons they call it cooties, but we called it flees. And so we'd play this recess and some person would have fleas and then they would chase you around and they touched you. And then you had fleas and everyone ran away from you. And the game often start, sometimes it was just spontaneous, but often the game could take a vicious twist and one of the lower status kids in the room would get, you know, accused of having fleas and that just wouldn't be, wouldn't be just a game that'd be a source of taunting and exclusion. So how many of you can remember games like that? Okay. Okay, good, good. So that shows all this political correctness hasn't done a goddamn thing to how children behave, you know, and actually that's a relief to me. So. Okay, so then you think what the hell's going on there? And the first thing that's going out is that the kids are playing out the idea of contamination, right? So let's say your contempt dibble and disgusting, you know, so maybe you, you have syphilis because you're a, what do you call your, uh, your, your, your dissolute and they botched and you know, it's gone to the final stage and it's just horrific.

Speaker 1:          00:56:32       So anybody who is going to look at you is going to have a reaction like this. They're, you know, they're gonna want to look away. Okay? So then I was thinking,

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       what happens if you touch someone like that? No, no, no. Think about it. Now, think about it for a minute. Well, first of all, in a place where there's lots of infectious diseases, what happens is then you die. So that's not a good thing you know, or if you're near anything corrupt like a carcass that has been rotting, you don't get to eat it because then you die like you gotta be sensitive to discussed because otherwise you'll run into contamination and the contamination will kill you. The question is how contagious is contamination? And I think that's the issue. So now you've put yourself in this position, so you're on a dating site and you find someone, and this might even be more powerful initially for women than for men because I don't know if you know this, but women rank 85 percent of men as below average in attractiveness.

Speaker 1:          00:57:30       Now men get the revenge. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to make a case that women are more demanded when it comes to men than men are. When it comes to women. It's just they're demented in different ways. So. So then you think it's interesting because I've watched my daughter go through tinder, you know, it's sort of painful. It's like, nope, nope, don't, don't, don't. Nope. Nope, nope. And you know, she's, she's Kinda, she kinda thinks it's funny and I suppose it is, but it's cruel as hell, right? If all these poor we easily guys, they're just getting sorted into the, you should not be in the damn meeting pool pile. Right? Right. And that's a fundamental judgment. You should not be in the meeting pool. Like if you're off on a genocidal spree, that's exactly what you're trying to do. You're trying to prevent that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:14       So, you know, I'm not saying my daughter's got genocidal tendencies, although she probably does because she is human by the way. So. Alright. So now let's say that you've categorized some person in there as you know, you're not going to respond to their damn email and you know, you've put them down as a one out of 10, you know, so no, no. And then someone says you have to go out with that person. You have to act. Ask that person out and then you think, well, how are you going to react to that, that idea? Well, the first thing is I think you're going to be angry at the person who's going to force you to do that. It's going to be anger and then the second thing is how are you going to feel when you bring that person into public with you, around your friends? Okay, how are you going to feel? And the answer to that is you're going to feel disgusted and ashamed and the reason for that is because it's. It's, it's contaminating, it's catching, and so then that puts the damn theories together and this is why

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       if I forced you to go out with someone that's low status and will say low attractiveness, we'll put the whole package together, low attractiveness, low socioeconomic status, no real hope for the future, and really unlikable. We can put all those sorts of things together and you're going to think no way, and then you bring that person out on a date with all your friends and they think, what the hell is up with you? And so maybe you're an eight, roughly speaking, and then you get to go visit five land for awhile. Okay, now what happens to you? Now? This is where it gets tricky. So we know

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       that you liked the lobster. Have a counter way down in the bottom of your brain that's really, really old. It's pre-cognitive. It's even pre emotional. It's way down there. Our reticular activating level. And what it does is scan the world to figure out where you are in the hierarchy and it actually matters because if you're low, then you die or you're stressed or your children die. You know, and you, you're, everything's worrisome to you because you're barely clinging onto the edge of existence and you will only take impulsive pleasures because that's the longest span that you can count on having pleasures over and it's rough at the bottom and you get low status mates if you get any at all and it's not good. So you actually do not want to be there. And there's a reason for that. Whereas at the cop, it's like, yes, you know, you get preferential access to everything, everything. So it's better to be there and you can say what you want about egalitarianism and there's lots of arguments to be held on both sides, but given a choice you will go up rather than down.

Speaker 1:          01:01:14       So let's say you associate with someone who's contaminated and it knocks your status down. Now how does it do that? Well, it might do it a variety of ways. You feel bad about yourself. So that would be low self esteem. So that means the part of your brain that's evaluating you as a high status competent being is now doubtful about whether you actually fit that description. And then there's all your peers because they're judging you like mad. And what they're basically doing is status evaluation. Are you like a lowly, a crumb brother who's absolutely outside the meeting hierarchy completely? Or are you like Mr Vampire billionaire, who's the, you know, the, the, uh, dawn linen vampire billionaire who's at the pinnacle of generic female literary pornography. So that's basically the, the hierarchy. So the problem is is that if you take a dominance, hit your serotonin level, fall, what that does is increase your negative emotion and decrease your positive emotion and increase the probability that when anything abnormal is so curves that you're going to have a generalized stress response. So that's the connection between the damn theories. If you're associated with the disgusting your status falls. And that's what these stabilizes the belief hierarchy. It's not a direct effect on belief.

Speaker 1:          01:02:53       And that puts the problem in a completely different light in many ways. It's like, what? What the hell are you supposed to do about that? Exactly. Because it looks like there's no denying the fact that the top of the bottom or top of the dominant Turkey's a better place. Oh, I got to put one more twist in that.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       So you know, the, the terror management theories and they're like basically say that it's your belief system, it stabilizes your emotions. And then you know, I vary that a bit and said, well, wait a minute. It's your expectation, desire, hierarchy and the match between that in the world that stabilizes your emotions. And that's partly because it does, because you're not freezing to death or overheated or starving, but also because you can sit in a room like this with all the other conformance to feel like no one's going to, you know, stand up screaming and become murderous, which is a really good thing. So,

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       but here's a twist. The twist would be the degree to which the expectancy desire map regulates your emotions and your general response. Your general stress response is proportionate to your position in the dominance hierarchy, right? So it's more dilated by the degree of success that you have and that's an important sale because it means the, the integrity of your theory about the world works better as well as that theory of the world is in fact working well for you, which means you're near the top of the dominance hierarchy. And then it really regulates your emotions as it should because the environment is less dangerous for you. It's not psychological man. If you're hiring the dominance hierarchy, even in Canada and you have someone who's sick in your family, they get to see the doctor a lot, long time before someone who has a low Iq and no social connections and it's not just corruption, you know, there's an element of that who, you know, it's just successful conscientious people who are open.

Speaker 1:          01:05:01       They have access to all sorts of strategies and plans and ways of figuring out, figuring things out that people who are at the bottom of the dominant Turkey, they just can't even muster. Plus they're way more likely to be taken seriously when they go see a doctor because they're articulate, you know, so it's a big deal. Okay, so then we're saying the degree to which your theory protects you from the world and your theory and its incarnation in the actual world is proportional to where you are in the dominance hierarchy. And so what that means is that if you ever associate with anything or anyone that lowers your status, you forfeit the protection of the associate cultural confines. And the best way to do that is to associate yourself with someone who is disgusting or contemptible. Now the next problem. So I think I was thrilled about that this morning. I tell you, because I've been trying to figure this out for like six years. I was thinking, how the hell do these things tied together? And I think, I don't think that's absolutely right, but I think it's, it's pushing towards something that's right. But then the problem that comes out of that is what do you do about it?

Speaker 1:          01:06:10       You know, it's one, it's a real bind, isn't it? Because you're just not going to get rid of the damn hierarchies. It's not even clear that you should, partly because you know, you can be cynical like a postmodernist and you can say, well hierarchies are just based on power, which is, that's such a stupid theory that it's just painful. Some hierarchies are based on power, but lot of them are based on competence, right? In a functioning society it's like, who do you want to do your brain surgery? You know, do you want to have the person who really knows how to do brain surgery or do you want some person who's just, you know, sort of they're doing it as an amateur in, in the back alley, you know, so you're going to assume that there's a bloody hierarchy and that it's based on competence and that you're going to peel from the top and so they're going to be more powerful obviously because they're at the top of the hierarchy.

Speaker 1:          01:06:58       But you're going to be pretty damn thrilled about that when you're looking for competence, which you often are. And to think about all that is power. It's like, you know, really like live in the world. Some of its power, but lots of it isn't so. So if it's our proclivity to arrange ourselves in dominance hierarchies and our dislike of our associated anything that looks contaminated in a disgusting sort of way, and the reason that, that, that'll lower are visible status in her own eyes and in the eyes of other people. How the hell do you get people to be tolerant?

Speaker 1:          01:07:38       You know? And the thing is, you're not tolerant and for all the talk about egalitarianism, I can tell you the egalitarian thing to do is to date the next person who asks you and you're not going to do that and no bloody wonder. So that's a big. And you can talk around that all you want, but you know, we know if you're going to be a biologist about this sort of thing, which is useful. I don't think you should only view people through biological lenses because our biological lenses aren't very sophisticated, but you know it's pretty damn hard to argue with the idea that you're concerned roughly speaking with two things and one is or not you survive. And the other is whether or not your progeny survive and thrive. You know when you can just boil that down to the desire to have healthy, competent, beautiful, attractive, successful children.

Speaker 1:          01:08:28       It's like, is that a vice or a virtue? Well, if you can't make that egalitarianism, like good luck with the rest of it. It's like smoke and mirrors. As far as I can tell, you might be able to alleviate suffering at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy, although even that's much more difficult than you think because you know, if you pump resources from the top to the bottom, what happens is the resources fly right up to the top again, you know, it's almost, it's like it's like pumping water up hill. It's bad analogy because it's backwards, but you're fighting against a very, very powerful tendency for resources to aggregate themselves into single locations. And I'll talk to you a lot about that when we get to intelligence because it's a, it's like a bloody natural law. It's really hard to fight against it. And it's like that inequality is characteristic of all societies. Even egalitarian societies. It's really hard to get rid of it and you're not going to get rid of it in the sexual world. That's for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       So you know, I thought about, I thought about, and we've talked a lot about in this class, in the sections on phenomenology and existentialism and you know, this idea that there's something redemptive about living in truth, you know, and that that seems to protect people against the worst elements of rigid and judgmental dominance hierarchies. And I think I think discussed can even get more out of hand when you get arrogant and superior, you know, and you're looking down on the contemptible from a High Place of narcissism. And so maybe part of living in truth helps you not fall prey to that. What narcissistic, judgmental tendency, and that'll keep some of this under control, but how to deal with the underlying problem of, of disgust, sensitivity.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       What are you going to be? Not Orderly. That's not helpful. You know, now you know, one thing that you might think about is that compassion, which is part of agreeableness might moderate the judgmental tendency of orderliness. They're not opposites, right? Because they're on different dimensions and that's kind of one of the liberal ideas. Even though liberals are mostly high in openness and low in orderliness, they're also higher in compassion than conservatives. Conservatives, liberals debate a lot about the role of compassion because the Conservatives think you're just being a new mother, you know, and the Liberals think, well, you're just being a totalitarian father and both of those things can and are true, but it seems to me that there's something about compassion that that might serve at least to some degree as an antidote for the pathological elements of orderliness, which include, by the way, conservatives, especially the ordinary ones are also much more judgemental. So if you present to them someone who's committed a moral crime, like careless prostitution, say they will and you ask them how long that person should be in prison, then the orderly person will say that they should be in prison longer than the person who's disorderly. And

Speaker 1:          01:11:42       so then I guess the question is can compassion mediate that without it falling into like the hellish Friday Anita Pool pit now? Anyways, that's about as far as I've got with that. So. So I thought I'd tell you that because I think it's worth knowing and because I was too excited about it. Not too so. So we'll see you on Thursday.
