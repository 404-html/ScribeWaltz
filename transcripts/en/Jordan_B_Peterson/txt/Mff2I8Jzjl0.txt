Speaker 1:          00:00:15       Okay, so I'm talking today with Dr Michael Shermer and darker Schermer is among other things the publisher of skeptic magazine, but more importantly for our purposes today, he is also the author of this book, New Book and were heaven on Earth. We're going to talk about this today in some detail and so I'm going to turn this over to Dr Sherman who's going to tell you some things about himself and then we're going to have a discussion, is going to outline this book and then we're going to have a discussion about well, why he wrote it and what it contains and what the implications are and all of that. So over to you Michael Jordan.

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       Thank you for having me on the show. It's. Well, the book is kind of an extension of my previous work. Most of my books when I write them, they kind of push off from the previous book, so going all the way back to my first book, white people believe were things which was about the supernatural and paranormal and and all that. Then then that led to how we believe, which was white people believe in God, and then if you don't believe in the supernatural and you don't believe in a deity, what about morality? So I wrote two books on math and science of good and evil and the moral, our last book, uh, so then, you know, kind of covering all the big subjects, uh, from a skeptical, scientific perspective. The afterlife is obviously a huge one and I haven't really dealt with that too much in my previous books.

Speaker 2:          00:01:33       And you know, now that I'm in my sixties, I guess you could say I'm cramming for the final thinking about these big issues. This is not something that I obsess about it. I'm not terrorized by death like, like some people are, but I think it's a super interesting subject because it's obviously a part of the human condition. It's something people do think about. And apparently we're the only species that can do this. Although I have a chapter in heavens on earth, on animals that grieve clearly. Quite a few mammals do grieve and they have some sense of loss, death and grief, you know, for fellow group members or family members that die, but it's not clear that they understand that their moral. Um, and then I, you know, I had covered the possibility that neanderthals were self aware of their mortality because of grave goods that have been found, although that's hard to fossil fossil fossilization of bots is difficult to interpret, but it seems reasonable that they had some sense of that.

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       But in any case, uh, so I, I deal with the, you know, the, the monotheisms versions of the afterlife, Heaven and mortality, a Judaism, Christianity, Islam that mainly because you sort of have to. Although mine's a science book and those are sort of low hanging fruit that atheists have already kind of picked that. So I don't spend a lot of time on that. I'm focused more on scientific attempts to achieve and mortality and science. So actually start with what does it seem like a scientist, Deepak Chopra, worldview of sort of western Buddhism that, that there is the idea of birth, death and afterlife. Life before life is all kind of meaningless because it's all consciousness in a deep box worldview as he puts it, a, you know, consciousness is the ontological primitive. You can't get underneath it a, you know, the scientific attempt to explain it by material means will always fail because that's not where consciousness wise anyway. So I, um, thanks to my wife actually delved into his world view, Deepak and I have class for 20 years and I've called his worldview woo and pseudoscience and, and you know, we've been kind of at odds at each other. So as it changes,

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       he's sort of the main, you might say, intellectual force. I don't think it's unreasonable to say the main intellectual force behind the new age movement or associated with the new age movement. Is that right?

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       Yeah, certainly one of the most prominent ones. He's got a huge following. He goes on Oprah and talks about these things and Dr Oz or whoever and you know, he has a lot of following. So, um, so my wife and I actually went down to his center or center in Carlsbad, California and spent some time there. I get, we delved into meditation and Yoga and the tea and the chanting and all that stuff just to kind of see what it's all about. And uh, you know, I think there's something there in terms of behavioral change that is how it affects your body and your mind and your thinking. And I could definitely see something to that and um, and, but, but also the difficult part that, that feedback and I have had is the same problem that most scientists have with a new age beliefs but not just that, but, but of non western traditions that, what Deepak calls the eastern wisdom traditions that it's the language, the difficulty of language.

Speaker 2:          00:04:48       We have to use words to communicate, um, and the words you use matter at some level. You have to be able to be talking on the same level with words. So when Deepak says, you know, the ontological primitive or consciousness is the womb of creation, you know, these are, it sounds sort of metaphorical. And he means something very specific by that. If you can't get at that, then you're wasting your time talking. So I'm Deepak and I have kind of become friends and we were constantly communicating just to try to see if we can find some ground where we're talking on the same plane. And so I think I've a learned a lot from him in that, in that sense. And so my chapters devoted to him on that and the general eastern wisdom traditions, you know that when you die, because I always ask them, well where do you go?

Speaker 2:          00:05:34       And he says the wrong question. I mean, you've just returned to where you were before, you know, because when people ask me, well, what do you think happens after you die? My standard kind of quip is the same thing. You go to the same place you were before you were born. What are you talking about? I wasn't anywhere before I was born. Right? And you'll be nowhere after you die, but for Deepak, time and consciousness kind of overrides the concept of time at the beginning of your consciousness just returns to where it was and that the physical body and brain is just a temporary instantiation of consciousness into physical be. But it just goes back to some other place and, and near as I can figure, we don't have the words to even conceive of what that means. Uh, that is the western language, the way scientists talk. I can't really capture what he's talking about in that sense. And so that's why I think we kind of hit an epistemological wall there where you have to actually get into introspection, meditation, and that the deeper parts of that tradition that I've never been able to really get into personally. So I can't say I understand it, although I kind of see where he's coming from in that regard.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       So, so let me ask you some questions about that. So the first might have to do with this idea of the ontological primacy of consciousness. Say now, one of the things I've learned from studying mythology is that the mythological worldview, first of all, I think the mythological worldview conceptualizes the world as a place to act rather than as a place of things. So it's sort of like Steven g dot j Dot Gould's idea of two magistarium don't overlap. There's a moral magistarium materialist magistarium say, but it's been striking to me, looking at the architect will foundations of mythological thinking that in the in the scientific worldview, there seemed to be two fundamental causal elements. You could say nature and nurture, something like that or biology and society, and then technically sophisticated western academics argue about the relative contribution of each to any given a existential phenomena. But in the mythological worldview, there's always three actors.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       There's nature usually personified as female or experienced as female because personified isn't quite the right word. There's culture, but there's also the individual and the individual seems to be the same thing as the conscious actor and that would be the hero, the dragon slaying hero say, and there's that. There is a kind of primacy given to that. So in the oldest creation myths, you always see this interplay between the mother, often mother earth and the father that the sky and then the hero who separates the two and somehow brings and perversely in some sense, although being their product clearly as the offspring is also the thing that gives rise to them mouth the same. At the same time, and it seems to be something that's in keeping in some sense with our lived experiences that we confront the social world obviously, and our beneficiaries and victims of it, and we confront the natural world in the same manner, but we also seem to be a gentek actors and without us as a Gentek actor is the idea that there's a reality, seems to, it seems to be full of paradoxical holes like reality without a conscious actor.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       And I think that's the sort of statement that, that generates the thinking that you've referred to as characteristic of, of Deepak Chopra and the people who, who make those sorts of claims. So, I mean, what, what's your, what's your take on, on consciousness and its role in being.

Speaker 2:          00:09:18       Well, the one hand, it's everything because it's what I tell what I tell Deepak, what I write about in that chapter is that, um, you're familiar with the anthropic principle. So I call this the, that the week consciousness principle that without consciousness, without consciousness, nothing exists. You know, this is one of the points that he makes for me. And you personally, if we're dead or we're not conscious, the world doesn't exist for our brains, it's gone. Nothing. There's nothing, uh, but, but he goes further than that. He says, this is what I call the strong consciousness principle, that, that consciousness has required. Our consciousness is required for material things to exist. And so there I have a discussion of what a Donald Hoffman, the cognitive scientists at UC Irvine calls is, um, uh, the interface perception theory. Uh, I dunno if you're familiar with this, but his analogy is like your laptop screen here and you'd have these icons on the screen, like the little trashcan icon looks like a trash can.

Speaker 2:          00:10:21       But of course there's no trash. Get the open, the open your laptop. There's no trash can. And there, you know, these are just kind of icons that represent something that we think of as a trash can. And, um, you know, this is, gets to the problem of, you know, what it's like to be a bat, a famous thought experiment, you know, if like bolted on some, some huge years. And I and I had an echolocation system and the neural processes to process that information and so on. I would have some sense of what it's like to be a vet, but it had everything on to actually be a bet that I would just be a bat and I wouldn't even be, I wouldn't even know I was a human wondering what it's like to be a bad. Okay. So at some level we can't actually know, um, you know, what it's like to be something else. And so you, again, with Deepak and I and these kinds of traditions like that, we hit this system logical wall of language. It's difficult to say what you mean by certain things.

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       Yes. Especially when you get down to the fundamentals of things. Well, it's pretty clear that the things that. So let. Let's look at that user interface idea. So obviously what happens when you're looking at a computer screen is that the complexity of the screen is reduced to a set of icons that can serve as tools. Right? And I think that that's a reasonable way of thinking about how we look at the world. Is

Speaker 2:          00:11:37       Theory is that natural selection didn't select our brains to, to record an accurate representation of reality, like a scientific model will attempts to get ever closer to what reality is really like no natural selection just wants us to escape predators. It doesn't matter what they look like, what the icon in your brain of breads that spraying or whatever, as long as you survive, that's all that matters. So this is why we're so easily deceived by illusions and magic tricks and things like that that, you know, our brains aren't really wired to, to, to represent reality as it really is, whatever that means. And

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       Yeah, you can say that without human consciousness, the iconic reality that we inhabit would not exist. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:12:19       Okay. Slightly is that is I told them. So let's say, you know, what's it like to be adults in it? I don't know. Okay. So some kind of echolocation system. So, and his point is, well, they're, you know, sharks are dangerous. So, uh, his, they avoid charts. But the question is what does a shark look like in a Dolphin's brain versus what it looks like in our brain? Um, it's probably quite different and I really have no idea what a shark looks like, two adults, but I do know this, there really are shirts and they really have sharp things on one end and a tail and the other and they're eating machines and you should avoid them. So yeah, that's awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       So that's actually a weakness of the icon claim I would say because it looks to me like here's the twist on it,

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       what we see in our conscious experience, our functional icons, but they were also low resolution representations of the things that are actually there. And I don't think that computer icons are low resolution representations of the things that are there. They're just functional icons. I might be wrong about that because because it's hard to to conjure up that analysis on the fly. But the trash can, for example, on your desktop is actually, it's actually a low resolution representations of an actual trashcan, not a computer trash even though it functions the same way. So I like the icon idea, but I think it misses some element of the actual relationship between the perception and the reality. We definitely see in low resolution, which is why we can stand animated pictures like say the simpsons, you know, where, where everything is one extremely low resolution, but that makes no functional difference to us whatsoever and we definitely see and hear in low resolution, but the resolution like what we see or something like instead of icons, they're more like thumbnails that are functional. That's a good analogy. And then. Well I like it because the thumbnail thumbnail actually is an unbiased sampling of the actual

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       object, right? Because a photograph is relatively unbiased sample of an object and you can compress it, you can, you can, you can tell it and what you're doing is blurring out distinctions between, you're blurring out distinctions between different aspects of it without, without losing the relationship between the parks. It's something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:46       That's right. And all. And, and in a way much of science operates at a metaphorical level that string, you know, have you ever seen a string theory documentary that didn't have violence featured in it? You know that, that the compute, that brain is like a computer. It's like a dual processor. It's like quantum information, you know, we can't because we have to talk and we have to transfer the literal meaning of metaphors to move something from here to there in the original Greek. So, you know, we're trying to capture some idea that's really hard to get that buy something. We're very familiar with some part of the problem. We had two that addresses some of the issues you've dealt with, with, uh, with some of your recent conversations with people as we're operating at different levels. So with Deepak, for example, pounds me with articles about quantum physics, so you don't.

Speaker 2:          00:15:38       Material stuff is really just energy. Atoms are mostly empty space and so forth. And you know, this, this table is actually mostly empty space. This is all true, but we don't live at the quantum level at the federal level where I'm sitting in a chair and I'm not passing through it because at that, at this level, you know, it's not the same as the quantum level. And I think making that distinction, um, you know, helps clarify a lot of things. So like when you talk about the truth to be found in a biblical stories are, or literary stories like dusty Eskie or, or Shakespeare or whatever, and a material scientist says, well, no, I mean something different by truth. It's not that one of you is right, the other's wrong. It's just that these are different levels or different ways of talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       Think about them as different tool kits. You know that. That's right. Different toolkits. That's right. Yeah. Classic American pragmatist is that I think of these things as tools. There's a scientific tool kit and there's a, there's a tool kit for action in the world and they overlap, but they're not the same.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       So for example, I call this, um, elvis error, alvie singer, that character in woody Allen's film. I'm Annie Hall. And there's that funny scene where there's a flashback that where he's in childhood and he's refused to do his homework and he's depressed and his mother takes him to the doctor or psychiatrist, whoever he is. And okay, what, what, why are you depressed? Alberice is because I found out that the universe is expanding. So what? Because if the universe is expanding and then eventually it's all gonna blow up and nothing means anything. Other names, Adam? We live in Brooklyn. Brooklyn's not expanding hallmark.

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       That's a nice observation I think too because. So. Okay. Let's go back to the conceptualization issue. So one of the things that we've agreed on, and I don't want to lose track of that thread because I think it's useful is that we do see an iconic reality and the icons have practical utility, but they also bear some one to one correspondence with the thing in itself and it's low resolution is a nice way of thinking about. So they're low resolution icons with functional utility. Now the question would be, so then that makes clear is that without human consciousness all that disappears. Okay. Then the question is partly what is there outside of that functional iconic representation and so that would be the old question of the thing in itself and you could say, and I think you could say with some justification that the thing in itself is in potential something that collapses across time and space so that it's everything and nothing at the same time, which is I guess that's an eastern claim.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       That's one way of thinking about it. It's a Dallas claim and I like it because the problem with the or one of the issues that, and this is associated with the idea of Brooklyn. It's not only does lb lb or lv lv. Not only does healthy live in Brooklyn, he lives in Brooklyn now, right? And so it's spatially located and temporarily located and so his mother's objection is, well, don't pick a reference point that makes everything right now irrelevant, which I. which is really good practical psychological advice because one of the things that leads people down the path of nihilism is this claim that this observation that you can pick a time frame of analysis that makes your current action useless. Who's going to care in a million years?

Speaker 2:          00:19:14       Right? So that argues it, you know, without God, without some sort of external source for morality and meaning nothing, nothing we do matters because in $15, million years, you know, the heat death of the universe or whatever, we don't live 15 billion years from now, we live now here. And what we do does matter, uh, you know, so thesis would argue, you know, the theodicy problem without God, there's no right or wrong, whatever Stalin did or Hitler did is perfectly fine because of the heat death of the universe. No, it's not fine because the people that are suffering in the Gulag archipelago or in the gas chambers at Auschwitz, they're not thinking about 15 billion years from now, they're living right here and right now the torture is really doing wrong by these standards. So again, the level at which we're talking about is everything. And this is why in the heavens on earth I, I'm concerned about the obsession with the people obsessing too much about the afterlife. Not just religious people, but scientists. So what I call it at the afterlife or atheist, this is the core of my book, is really about all the cryonics people in the transhumanists and the singular Tarion's and the extropians and the, and the people that are gonna Upload your mind into a computer and turn it off. You know, ray Kurzweil and all these guys, you know, they're, they're almost gurus when you go to these conferences, you know, it's like we get to live forever. We are the generation that gets to live for

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       some of them think they're the, they're the generation that's going to instantiate the daily in the form of computational entity as well.

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       That's right. I mean, Kurzweil even as a funny line about that, is there a god? Well, if there's going to be pretty soon, as soon as we hit the singularity singularity assignments and it reminds me of what I was religious. You know, I used to be an evangelical. I went to Pepperdine University, which is a Church of Christ school. I was really into it and uh, and going to church and all that stuff, and I, I go to the singularity summit. I was like, wow, I'm back in church. Here's Ray Kurzweil grew up there telling us we are the first generation that will live forever and you know, operate a gray, this radical life extension. The scientist, you know, he, he's on record saying the first person to live a thousand years is born now. Is this alive now?

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       Right? So there's two elements to the heaven issue that we can discuss them. And one is the belief in the existence of heaven and the other is the positing of heaven as an Ame. Yes, those are interestingly related. So from my perspective from. So one of the things as far as I'd been able to tell, one of the things that allows us to transform the reality that's too complicated to perceive into these functional low resolution icon. So let's say is the name have to aim right and you have to aim with your eyes. In fact, we're also extraordinarily good at detecting how other people aim with their eyes. So the question is always, well, where should you a? And then the answer to that archetype, I would say biologically for that matter, is that you should aim up because why the hell would you aim down?

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       Down is hell, right down is where the suffering is, down is where the malevolence is, so you aim up and architecturally op is heaven. And so one of the things that I can't, it seems to me that there's some possibility that it was impossible for human beings to discover the future, which is something that we seem to have done. Maybe that was prefrontal extension ended. That was the expansion of the prefrontal cortex and its deep wiring with the visual cortex that actually enabled us to foresee the future. Something like that. I don't know if you can foresee the future without, without stumbling upon the idea of heaven at the same time because having that sense becomes the best possible future and you're aiming at, you're aiming at a better future and because you're ending out a better future, you're kind of compelled to also conceptualize, at least in principle, like the platonic ideal of the future. And so then that future potential starts to become a kind of a reality, something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:23:25       Yeah. I think that's a super good point. My, again, my concern about obsessing too much about the next life is you're going to miss out on this life, which is where you live right now. Uh, but, but that's different from aiming at it. I mean, my, I wrote a book on moral progress, the moral arc, you know, aiming for incremental improvements in civil rights, health and longevity and, and, and ridding ourselves of disease and war. These are all admirable goals and we should keep doing that aiming for something. And I do like the metaphor of it is, maybe it's because we're a social hierarchical species.

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       Yeah. Well, I think that's why the pyramids. I believe that. I think that's what the pyramids represent with her, with her gold cap, right? It's

Speaker 2:          00:24:08       right. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:24:10       and the Washington monument is the same thing, right?

Speaker 2:          00:24:13       Or The pyramid of hierarchy of needs and so on. At the end of my chapter on, on a model theisms versions of Heaven, I float the idea. I probably won't be accepted by evangelicals and fundamentalists, but that was, you know, when Jesus talked about the kingdom is within, you mentioned this, not as not as often as I would've liked, but I think he's referring to the fact that heaven is within us in the sense that we should be aiming to improve ourselves. And you know, that Christians have an atheist of conflicted over this passage where he says, uh, you know, Matthew Sixteen, Twenty six, I say unto you, there are some standing here which will not taste death until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and, you know, of course atheist, ha, he's still not here. Uh, but, but what if he meant something else that happened is not a place to go, but a way to be here. And now I'm

Speaker 1:          00:25:06       very, I'm very, what would you call? I'm not so viewpoint that I think is very much worth pursuing. I would also. But I also think there's something deeply strange about that too, because I think that if a psychological state becomes profound enough, it starts to become a social state. And so I would say that that, that Kingdom of God that's within, which is something tolstoy wrote a lot about, by the way, that was a book that he wrote, a book called the Kingdom of God is within us and that profoundly influenced Mahatma Gandhi by the way, and they had lengthy correspondence which was part of the reason that Gandhi became an unknown. Use nonviolent resistance, right in his fight against the English. It's was quite interesting, but I think that there is. There is there. It's something like this. Maybe when you go to a concert, it's a great concert and you're having a very profound psychological experience of unity and harmony, which of course is what you get into concert, but if the experience is profound enough psychologically and individually, it also starts to encompass and envelop the people around you.

Speaker 1:          00:26:13       And so I think the Kingdom of God that Christ was talking about with something like this is why I like jumped piaget so much. It's something like the pig and equilibrated state where things are working out really well for you when you're deeply immersed in a meaningful experience. But at the same time, that meeting is structured so that it's maximally beneficial for the people who are immediately around you and for the people who are distantly related to you. And so everything stacks up and some that's some. That's something like the idea of the ladder to have under the stairway to heaven today. Everything stacking up properly. And then there's a. see, I think when people experience that, and this is where the metaphysics touches the material. I think that when people. Yes, exactly that precisely dot yes, precisely that.

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       Well, did you notice that the demons are upside down going down, right? Which is exactly right. That's exactly the right way to conceptualize it. So I think that when people have an experience of that stacking of meaning, that they also have an intimation of immortality that goes along with that, that's embodied. And that that's partly why the metaphysical speculations about the reality of the Kingdom of Heaven, there'll be merged because it's not just conceptual right there. There is embodied experience and people report the same thing when they have transcendental experiences of various sorts and those. And we know from a scientific perspective that those can be very reliably induced with the use of agents like psilocybin and you know, I've been really fascinated by what's been happening at Johns Hopkins Hospital with the Psilocybin experimenters because one of the most recent things they showed was that if you take people dying of cancer and you give them psilocybin and they have a mystical experience, which is something like an experience of the Kingdom of God on earth, but also eternally at the same time that they lose their fear of death or that at least it's much modified. You know, that's a hell of a finding. That's really. You can't just, you can't just walk away from that easily because that's a hell of a thing to, to treat.

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       Well, I have a chapter on that in heavens on earth, on near death experiences. Um, and so, but we're talking about two different things. Um, you know, the, the transitioning from life to death in the most pain free or anxiety reduced state is more progress, you know, medical progress, psychological progress or whatever. And I'm all for Psilocybin, does it or whatever. Then great, we should do that, but there's a lot of people that claim more than that, that this is opening the doors of perception into another world. It's actually out there and that those of us who have not taken acid, we just simply can't know. So now we now we get at this question of truth. You know, it's one of my columns and scientific American and I recently wrote called what is truth anyway? I mean when I say like I prefer dark, dark chocolate and you prefer milk chocolate, you know, there is no truth.

Speaker 2:          00:29:10       That is to be discovered. Years is true for you mind street for me or I say stairway to heaven is the greatest rock song of all time and you say, no, no, freebird is better than stairway to heaven. And we argue about that, but there's no, there's no experiment we're going to run. And so as we start to move along these lines, like when Deepak Chopra tells me meditation works, okay, so if it works for you or it doesn't work for me, okay, those are still in that state of internal truths. But what we want to know in sciences doesn't work for everybody, or 67 percent of people that do an hour of meditation a day under these conditions have reduced stress hormones and blood pressure and so on, in some measurable way that's different than just an internal state. So, um, when we're talking about, again, just working on Torque for striving to better ourselves or some kind of heaven, if you mean just, you know, metaphorically so that I can better myself. That's different than there's an actual place you can go to a that's going to be there after we die. And so I think this is where scientists go on way.

Speaker 1:          00:30:16       You also start messing about with the idea of place in a way that, that that's the problem with having discussions about fundamental realities and know when you said another thing that Christ said was the Kingdom of Heaven is spread upon Earth. But men do not see it and that's, that's something that's akin to the idea of the Kingdom of God is within you, although it's. It's a strange twist on it because it also adds an element of externality or physicality to it and an element of immediacy. Not something that's forestalled into the future, but I wonder, see, in my wild or moments of speculation, I have this notion that if things stack up properly, so imagine that you're immersed in a very deeply meaningful experience and and it's, it's operating. It's indicating that harmony has been established between multiple levels of being simultaneously. I wonder if that can. I wonder if that can put you in a place that's profound enough or deep enough so that the structure of time and space, it still starts to warp around that. I mean, I know that that's A. I can't formulate that well, but there's something. There's something about it that seems to me to be correct about that because people have intimations of immortality and they have intimations of, of, of heavenly and hellish abodes as well, and they're not, they're not. They're not the simple kind of irrational, even rational fundamentalist beliefs that often people talk about when they're discussing religious belief. There are more reflected in direct experience and it's not easy to make sense of them.

Speaker 2:          00:31:49       Well, when you delve into the literature on Judaism, Christianity and Islam and their versions of the afterlife and heaven, they're quite different and the Jews are far less obsessed with going some place after death. In fact, originally they had, they were going, no place at all. Show was just nothing. It was just he returned to where you were before you were alive, just no place, uh, and so, so that, that religion is far more focused on the here and now we have a moral duty to help people, the poor and so on now and to live better lives and more lives of dignity and honor and now and Christianity really started off more like that. Then kind of morphed over the centuries and particularly in fundamentalist and evangelicals in the 20th century toward this place we're to go after we die. Yeah. You kind of had the schism in Christianity today between the kind of the fundamentalists that are constantly talking about the afterlife and accepting Jesus and they're focused on missionary, working in diverting people versus say maybe the Rick Warren's of the world that want to put their money into a soup kitchens and helping the poor and, and, and, and Christians have a moral duty to help those in need and not so much focused on the next life.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       It's funny. Yeah, because there, there are real dangers associated with both those kinds of conceptualizations mean you alluded to one danger that was associated with, let's call those who are concerned more with the immediate present. And that's the, that's starting to manifest itself in these, in these, um, technological, immortal, immortalists. They're saying, well, we should transform the nature of being extraordinarily radically right here and now so that we have heaven in the mortality here. You think, well, what do we lose by doing that? You know, and that's a question that's worth asking because if we're trans human, then we lose being human. And it may be that we actually don't want to lose being human, even though being human means suffering and malevolent, something like that. It's a very hard question. But then the Christians, this is what we're. She went after the Christian since it's such an hour. He said, well, if you despise the current world and you leave everything to be rectified in the afterlife, then you just abandoned life itself and you're really traders to life. And so how, how does steer through those to shoot two shows, let's say is thing or to cliff's. That's a very difficult proposition.

Speaker 2:          00:34:17       Well, it's my message in the book to, to the military and the cryonics and transhumanism and so on is I'm glad you're working on this problem, you know, because, or don't you want to live to be a thousand years? And my response is look, just get me to 90 without cancer and 100 without Alzheimer's on 110 without being plugged into machines and lying in a bed. Because that's not a life. And so and so I'm glad people are working on like, what's the best diet? How much? What can we do to improve our memory and so on. That's all great and I'm glad and I'm glad Kurzweil is now the chief engineer of all Google. I mean he's got some resources to do something about this, but that this focus on living a thousand years, your first one, you may miss that little incremental things we can do, but also you're missing out now.

Speaker 2:          00:35:11       There's this fell on my right about in the book I'm on Ray Kurzweil. It's a little kind of biographical film of him. I'll transcendent man and he's constantly talking about, you know, living forever and so on and he's obsessed with his father. His father died when he was 51, father was 50 ones and and ray was kind of missed out having a father figure because the father was always working and Ray was a real entrepreneur achiever from his teenage years, so he was always working and the film kind of follows him around collecting everything he can about his father and he keeps it in the basement of his house and he wants to resurrect his father and a computer and it's like, Whoa, boy. Freud would have a field day with this guy, but there's something, there's something going on there. This sort of rose focus on.

Speaker 1:          00:35:58       I see this. This is strange dichotomy and attitude that you just described. Even characterizing use that in my own life because I'm very interested in technologies that stave off aging, dietary manipulations, and I have this machine in my basement that's intense pulse light, late intense pulse light machine that's unbelievable skin rejuvenator like it's an absolute miracle. This machine. And it'll take, it'll take sun damage from your skin completely. And, and force rejuvenation. It's like, it's like using photoshop on your skin. It's amazing. And, but, um, but, and so I think, well, isn't it interesting to do everything possible to prolong youth in life? But at the same time there's another part of me that's thinking, well, this is something I wrote about it in this new book that I'm publishing. I'm just thinking about socrates and his ability to accept his death. Knowing what socrates seems to have revealed in his acceptance of his death was that if you live your life properly, then you, you've maybe you've lived your life in some sense, you've exhausted it in some sense.

Speaker 1:          00:37:10       The question is if you, if you live the thousand years, well, what exactly what, what exactly would you do? You know, like, I've had kids and I loved having kids, but I wouldn't have them again. Like I wouldn't do that again, I don't think. And I have a grandchild and that's fine, but that's a new thing. Like I've had a career and I, as I get older, the idea of having 10 more careers seems. It's not like I'm not interested in it, but it doesn't grip me the same way that it would have, say 20 years ago. And so I wonder, like I wonder if it is the case that life is in some sense structured so that its finitude as necessary and not something that should be well casually transcended. Let's say.

Speaker 2:          00:37:58       Well, the transhumanists would respond to that, uh, that you're just used to this idea of only living 80, 90 years. And then you're done, uh, that we would adjust to that. Well, maybe

Speaker 1:          00:38:10       the question would be who would be the weed that would adjust to that?

Speaker 2:          00:38:16       Yes, he would no longer okay to get there. We would no longer be human there. The idea of the transhumanist singularitarian people is, is truly, you're not human anymore. We have brain, like the cochlear implant for hearing is a kind of brain transplant device. Well, they want to ramp that up and put in your cortex and you'd hit, sent centrally, have wikipedia in your brain and for instant access and, and that it would truly bring new meaning to what it means to be human.

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       You could also argue that that's a form of death because if you transform yourself so radically that you're unrecognizable, then what? Where's the continuity with what you once were? You know, this was one of the reasons I have some real sympathy for many reasons. I have many reasons for this, but one of them that I have very much sympathy for. The idea, the Christian idea, that's that's associated with the mortality of the resurrection of the body because the Christians insisted that this is not some sort of abstract lights like it's. It's not uploaded into a computer. It's not blowing out all of your limitations. Now you know, you might ask what the resurrected body would be and of course that's a particularity. That's a perfectly fine question, but it doesn't. It doesn't. It's that doesn't move you around. The fact that there was a question that was really to be grappled with there because what the Christians were trying to do was to have their taken either to in some sense and to say, look, there's some absolute utility to the limitation that is imposed upon you by a mortal frame. Right? That's the characteristic element of being human and that perhaps there's a way of having that in transcending it. At the same time. Now what that would look like is obviously vitamins,

Speaker 2:          00:40:00       deal with that and heavens on earth to have a chapter on the soul and post descartes. Christians became more doulas before that. They were more focused on the physical resurrection of the body. There are still some Christians today who think that they'll physically be resurrected, but most of them, most of them are journalists and it's just, it's just this kind of nonphysical thing that goes and, and be and is with God and Jesus and so on. Uh, but, but, you know, they actually debate this question of identity. The problem with identity. He said, well, if you're physically resurrected in heaven, what's, what's there? How old are you get? And some of them actually have an answer. You're 30, you know, that's like the ideal age physically, I suppose mentally and also Jesus was 30 and it's maybe okay. So, but, but then the question is, is an, I asked this question for the mindup loaders, the transhumanist, it's like there is no fixed, first of all, all your cells in your. And almost all of the atoms in your body are recycled about every decade or so. So there is no defined physical self of you. You know, the thesis ship, you replace all the wood and the ship, we still call it,

Speaker 1:          00:41:13       of structure. That was Schrodinger's Turret, right? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:41:16       yeah. Yeah. So, okay. So it's the pattern of information that is your memories, your memory cells, memory cells. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. That's better. But at what age? You know, because I have memories now that I didn't have when I was 30, so what happens if I'm resurrected at age 30, whereas all the memories of my last. I'm 63 now, so as 33 years of memories, I want those too. And so does the. Okay. You can have all those memories but wait, the memories I have now at 63 of when I was 30 are very different than the memories when I was 30 of what I was like at that time. And so there is no fixed set of memories even that represents you because those are constantly edited and changed and it. And it's like, okay, now I understand when I had that 10 years as a bike racer in the 19 eighties, I, you know, I was just sort of going through and doing my thing and now I see in context what that meant for my life.

Speaker 2:          00:42:09       But I didn't know it at the time. That's true for everything we do. That's why I was laughing. People write memoirs in their twenties or thirties. It's like, how can you write a memoir? You don't have no idea what you're doing now is going to be in 30 years. And so in religious. So both, both scientific attempts at immortality or the afterlife or whatever. And religious, they have the same problem. Uh, you know, what is up there that's been resurrected because there is no fixed self. It's a constantly dynamic changing system. And then there's one more problem. That idea with the point of view, self appeal of these cells. You know, there's, you and I looking out through your eyes and Jordan go to sleep tonight. You wake up tomorrow morning and you're groggy for a few minutes, but, but your, your point of view returns and you know, the singularity people, they think, well, we'll copy all your memories and put them in a computer and then we'll turn it on and you'll wake up and you'll, you'll be looking out through the little camera hold.

Speaker 2:          00:42:59       They're like Johnny Depp in transcendence. And you'll be in there. No, I don't think so. Why would your point of view all of a sudden leap from your current body into the computer in the same sense that instead of sacrificing your brain and slicing it up and scanning, this is the current thoughts scanning every synapse. What if in a hundred years from now, we had a sophisticated MRI machine that could scan your brain and scan every single synapse and reproduce it, and we had a computer big enough with Moore's law doubling and so on. It would be enough to just reproduced your entire connectome and turned it on you, you, Jordan Peterson. He's still standing there right next to the computer and they turn it on. You're not all of a sudden on computer. Well, there's other problems with that too, is that, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       if I remember correctly, you have more neurons in your autonomic nervous system then you have in your central nervous system.

Speaker 2:          00:43:56       Well, the brain isn't in your head, not just your brain. No. So you haven't extended buddy, so you to the chronic biotics people, they love up the head. We're just going to clone your butt. Okay. This is getting too complicated. You really need the whole body. Yes. Well that's.

Speaker 1:          00:44:13       That's the physical resurrection issue is that the idea that, and I think that you put your finger on the flaw in, in the, in the, in the, in the new way more tap in the new immortality crowd. You know, they think if they really are Cartesians, they think of your consciousness is something that's. Well, they're confused about it in some because they think of it as a kind of soul, which would be a pattern and that pattern is only instantiated in the brain. It's like, oh, physiologically that's just not the case. It's like, what about the hormones? What about. There's a lot of things going on in the brain that aren't easily reducible to synaptic patterns, especially when you consider also its connection with the body and you have to consider that. It's so good.

Speaker 2:          00:44:55       Even worse than that, because not only are we all of those things, we are also social beings and so there's all the interactions we have and have had with all the other people in our lives or neighbors or strangers or whatever, so you have all those binary digits that have to be captured of all the interactions going back in your whole life, not just your life, but all of the social, cultural, political, economic forces that have been grinding along for centuries that shape who we are and the kind of world we live in. You know, if you're going to create a virtual reality, a holodeck that regrade saw that, you know, I mean this would be a huge computer. Essentially. It would be the universe is what you would need.

Speaker 1:          00:45:32       What we ended up with a map that's just as big as the territory. That's right. Yeah, that's right. It's a big problem. You wrote a book about that. That's going to fold it up. Where are you going to put it? That's the big

Speaker 2:          00:45:45       like that Steven Wright line about. I got a map of the United States. Actual size.

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       Yeah. It's really hard to fold up. Exactly. Exactly. So, oh, so let me ask you a couple more personal questions if you don't mind. Now you, you mentioned, um, briefly during our, during our conversation that you know, you, you, you were, you're from a pretty fundamentalist Christian background and you became a skeptic and you've been pursuing that with, with, with well adamantly, let's say for a very long time. So two questions is what, what put you on that path and what do you think your positive function as a skeptic is?

Speaker 2:          00:46:26       Yeah, so first of all, my family wasn't religious at all. They weren't antireligious to just wasn't a thing. I became interested in it in the early seventies when I was in high school, which was sort of the early development of the Evangelical Movement, the United States. So I called born again movement and there was no affiliation with any church or particular. We all recognize that organized religion was probably not great. So just sort of a one on one. It's just you and Jesus and the Bible, you and God and so on. And uh, that was that whole Jesus Christ superstar. Timing and all that, but I took this really seriously and I went to pepperdine and I took courses in the Old Testament and New Testament. I read everything cs Lewis wrote to the course in the writings of Cs Lewis, but I was into it then. You know, at pepperdine you're in the bubble of, you know, the Christian worldview is totally consistent. It's internally coherent, uh, until you're outside the bubble. So when I went to a secular university and to study experimental psychology, not only was that more of a grounding in the scientific method of understanding reality, but just for fun. I took courses in, first of all, I took courses in evolutionary theory. I was kind of a creationist. I remember sitting there thinking, Holy Shit, this stuff is real.

Speaker 2:          00:47:44       But then I took a course in anthropology and comparative mythology and that kind of opened up my eyes. So I sort of went through my Joseph Campbell stage and, and the myth of the hero. I read the hero of a thousand faces and all that. It's like, okay, this is, this is a different way of looking at things than, than pure scientific way, but it's also different from a lot of these religious traditions, you know, so that, that's sort of told me that the particular religion I was in a wrong to ask is that, is it right or wrong? It's just, it's a completely different thing and it just wasn't working for me anymore. So I enjoyed the scientific way of thinking about the world and I was surrounded by people that it's not that they were atheists in graduate school and after that it's like, remember, this is now the late seventies.

Speaker 2:          00:48:30       And then when I went to graduate school in the second time for my phd in history of science of late eighties, um, again, the whole eighth science, religion, atheist, atheism, that wasn't a thing. No one really talked about it. It wasn't like a big thing you have to decide. Say, are you at the eastern atheist? No one really talked about that. And so my focus is really on this science and understanding things. Now the problem with being a sort of an intellectual historian of science psychologists like I am, and you're interested in study in beliefs like I do. Um, and then also being a public intellectual is the publisher of skeptic magazine. And I write this column for scientific American every month I got to essentially debunk something or analyze something is it kind of puts you in this role of like, well, I got to say if this is right or wrong, this is true or false or, or something in between.

Speaker 2:          00:49:19       So I, I'm, I'm, I'm constantly on this kind of razor edge between, I just am curious observer of people's beliefs. And then on the other hand, I have actually have to pass judgment and writing every month. Well, is this one correct or not correct? Or something in between them. Um, and uh, some might, again, it's at that different levels. You know, sometimes I'm just talking about people's beliefs. Other Times I'm at, I'm actually kind of forced to say, well, I think this is probably true. We're probably not true. And, uh, and I think this is, you know, I listened to, I tried to listen to that first podcast you do with Sam, so difficult to get through again to me, you know, two hours, you were just talking past each other at different levels of Sam's laser focused on, you know, people behave, they act on certain beliefs and the obvious one flying planes into buildings is because you have a certain belief that leads to that, yes, that's true.

Speaker 2:          00:50:16       And it would be good if people didn't believe these things that lead them to do those kinds of violent acts. Uh, but there's a whole nother level you can talk about beliefs that have nothing to do with leading to violence or so on and so to. It just depends on what's your goal when you're talking about this particular thing right now. Uh, and, and, you know, so I, I'm good friends with Stephen Jay Gould and you know, I was sympathetic to his noma in the sense that the world's already to tribal. And so if we can calm everybody down, that's good. On the other hand, I do think science and reason Kennan form and maybe even in some cases determined human values and moral decisions, right and wrong and so on. I've written quite a bit about that too, and so again, that's sort of a different level of what you're talking about and what the goals are at that particular moment.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       Yeah, well, I mean the skeptic when, when, when I think of a skeptic, this is a strange leap of course, but there's a scene in revelation where Christ comes back and he comes back with a sword coming out of his mouth and that's where he divides the damn didn't save and that's a. that's also an image of the logos, right? The word that brings forth order out of chaos because hardly what you do as a skeptic. It isn't so much that you dam the untrue is that you rescued the truth and that's really necessary for people because we need to stand on a rock. And now one of the big problems I have with new age movement, and I've kind of started this technically looking at the way that creative people think because there are creative people who are critically minded and there are creative people who are not critically minded and non critically minded. Creativity seems more associated with mental illness and psychopathology or you have to be able to discriminate between what's worth saving and what isn't so to speak. And that's what a good skeptic does. Cause a skeptic isn't necessarily someone who says, oh, this is all false. A good skeptic is someone who says, oh look, there's a kernel of truth here, but it's deeply buried under layers and layers of, of rust and nonsense that needs to be burned away or polished away so that we can get to what's absolutely essential.

Speaker 2:          00:52:23       Yeah. So back to where you were saying before about striving upwards towards something that heaven up there, whatever that is. Um, you know, of course we don't want to go for utopia because there's no such place to get to and that causes catastrophes in history. So. But the idea of making the world a more rational place, this is a good goal and this is the kind of thing that we do at skeptic magazine. I know, what do we do? We promote science and reason and critical thinking. You write about critical thinking and this is what you do. Uh, so we're all working on that and that. And that's good. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:53:00       sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 2:          00:53:02       So when, um, when we talk about literature, for example, this return to the books of the Bible or dusty, see, or if we want to make our listeners' heads explode, Ian Rand and Atlas Shrug. Why have people by the tens of millions purchased her books? You know, literary critics say they're awful, they're terrible. Novels are not well written and her fingers are black and white. And her philosophy is wrong. Okay? But ask yourself, why do tens of millions of people love those books? And it's because she's doing something else. She's not trying to spread the world the way it actually is, but that the way it could be. And these are the things we've done wrong. Communism, socialism. Because she came out of that Russian background and so you know, her figures like John Golf, these are kind of ideal things to strive for.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       Yes, exactly. Yeah. Well that her fingers are archetypal heroes have a certain form.

Speaker 2:          00:53:56       If we could bring it back to some real world example. I just recently recently started following a Jocko willink. Now I'm never going to be Jocko willink, but you know, I got his book and I read one page a day and you know, it's kind of, it's sort of like, oh yeah, yeah, come on, you can get up at six in the morning and get out there on your bike riding with the guys. I don't want to do it. But then I see tacos page and he's good at it. Okay. So in a way it's not describing the world in a scientific way of it's, it's sending a different message, like you should strive to be this, even if you don't make it, just do it, do something. Anything. And that's a different sense of different goal.

Speaker 1:          00:54:36       Yeah, I think to that. Okay. So first of all, with regards to again round, I think the criticism leveled at her that her characters are too black and white is correct because I think that one of the things that distinguishes great literature from propaganda is that in great literature most of the conflict is within rather than between. Right? And so, and the problem with Ayn rand is all her good characters are the same good character and all her bad characters are the same bad character and, and there's no overlap between them. So there's a curiosity, there's an architectural purity, but that compromises its utility as literature. I would say

Speaker 2:          00:55:13       alternation makes his point in Gulag archipelago where he says, if, if only the world, we're simply black and white and we can take the bad people and, and isolate them somewhere. But the problem is, is you know, we all have darkness and evil

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       last line between good and evil runs down every heart that says famous sprays. And it was something he experienced very deeply and is also, it's also pride, primordial true

Speaker 2:          00:55:40       analyze literature. And this as well. There's a body of literature, evolutionary literary analysis in which, um, you know, Pete pinker writes about this at the end of the blank slate, which he talks about, you know, what these novels, these sophisticated novels in which the characters are rich and deep, you know, they, they have all these good characters and bad characters, characteristics and so on. And, uh, and we can, we can glean from that in a sense that the novelists were ahead of the cognitive. This is his point, the novelist. We're about a century ahead of excitement, give scientists, figuring out of human nature

Speaker 1:          00:56:16       or maybe a thousand years ahead,

Speaker 2:          00:56:20       modern literature anyway, you know, so we can, we can gain a lot from there and not just the rich emotional experience of reading a good novel, uh, but actually teasing out this is what some of these evolutionary literary people are trying to do. It's like there's certain themes that come up over and over and over again. Uh, it's not totally random. You know, unlike the postmodernists, there actually are a certain real meanings that the author intended.

Speaker 1:          00:56:46       See, I think the problem with the postmodernists technically speaking, and I thought a lot about this, is that they got their initial criticism right, which is that there's an infinite number of ways of interpreting a finite set of phenomena, but there isn't an, there isn't a, there isn't an infinite number of valid ways of interpreting a finite set of phenomena and that's where you get right back into the issue of circulation of the interpretation around these great underlying architectural themes that are built in, in large part right into our biology. I read a really interesting analysis of the, um, of the symbol of the dragon a while back, and I can't conjure up the name of the book unfortunately, but his hypothesis, which I thought was a very good one, was that a dragon is a Metta Predator. So it's the symbol for Predator and, but it's more than that.

Speaker 1:          00:57:39       But the Predator is tree snake bird. Because the fundamental predators have treatwell in primates were cats, snakes and birds. And so what it is, is an amalgam of all those things. And so it's real. Just like the category of creditor is real, even though snakes and cats are both in the category of Predator and no one says, well, there's no such thing as a Predator, and then you can add fire to that for a variety of reasons, not least being a being I'm sure that fire white belt, many of our ancestors as well, and then the additional twist, which is the dragons also hoard gold, so human beings, because we're not just prey. Animals learned that if we confronted the Metta Predator, we would gain as a consequence.

Speaker 2:          00:58:24       So there are certain channels down which good stories go based on our, our biological nature or evolved nature. It's not that it's completely deterministic in that sense. No, no.

Speaker 1:          00:58:34       It's variations on a theme I would say. Yeah, so that was interesting. There was an interesting article published, I think it was a nature a few months ago showing that it was very, very high resolution brain scan and so you know, there's the idea of course that in the cortex that neurons that fire together wire together and then we learned that the neurons are actually in cortical columns. So they actually have their structure, their unit structure, so they're not just randomly connecting with neurons everywhere in the brain, but what his scan showed was an underlying super highway of building connections so that the columns themselves could wire into the already existing super highways. So it was like there was an underlying architecture that was highly probable, was highly probable that it would manifest itself and I thought, well that looks like the neural architecture of something like an archetype

Speaker 2:          00:59:25       arguments for crown is that it would be really fun to come back and say a thousand years from now just to see what scientists or scholars or talking about like of how the brain works. You know, what, what's the metaphor they're using then that. And they'll look back on us and go, oh, they thought the brain is a computer. How are the time we come up with a fully material account of consciousness. Our notion of what constitutes material will have undergone substantial revision. So I do wonder if sometimes I toy with the idea of the mysterians dino and the mysterians. There's certain mysteries of the universe we will never solve. We just, because of the limitations that this structure of our brain and so God free will and determinism, the nature of consciousness, you know, there's a few of these core deep question. So my friend, the late great Martin Gardner called himself a Deist, you're probably familiar with the DSM.

Speaker 2:          01:00:22       It's kind of like, well, it's based on, uh, William James and, and, uh, uh, manual mumo pragmatist. It's sort of a pragmatist philosophy. So anyway, Martin Martin was his longtime column district, Scientific American, well, one of the founders of the modern skeptical movement. He was as skeptical as I am, maybe more on almost everything, but he believed in God and he believed in prayer and the afterlife and so on. Even though he would say to fellow skeptics, I'm, yes, I think the atheist have slightly better arguments than the theater just slightly, but you know, because you can't determine one way or the other for sure, whether there's a god or not with determinism, it's okay to just practically speaking, to just do whatever works for you. This is the pregnancies and things. So he said, he says, he prays. He believes that there is some kind of afterlife and that there's something out there, not an anthropomorphic God or anything like that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:16       So he called this fideism anyway, so I kind of respected that because he, he didn't make any truth claims like I can prove this or I'm sure I'm right. He said it's just true for me. And you know, that gets back to that question of what is true, what is truth anyway, if that's all you're saying, it's just true for me psychologically true works for me. It's really kind of the end of the conversation, but you know, so when I deal with creationists, I think the earth is 10,000 years old. Okay. So we have a problem. There is a conflict, you know, Steve Gould, non overlapping magisterial doesn't apply there. One side is wrong and one side is right when you're talking about say the age of the universe or the world, but if you say, look, this, this is what works for me. Having this particular, I'm not claiming I can prove it, it just works for me.

Speaker 2:          01:02:01       Really. Was there to say after that, it's kind of the end of the conversation and I do think sometimes that when we're talking about free will and determinism, you know, what do you mean by these words and how well the devil's always in the details in hit an epistemological while we keep kicking past. I'm a compatiblist. I think, you know, Dan Dennett, I'm not a philosopher, but now those kinds of arguments I think make more sense to me. In any case, I have what I call the behavioral compatible ism. That is whatever your position is intellectually on free will and determinism. It doesn't really matter because when you walk out the door, you're, uh, you, you believed you were making choices.

Speaker 1:          01:02:44       This is the argument that I tried to level at Sam Harris with regards to the metaphysical foundations of his ethics. It's like, it's the same sort of thing is, and I think Ben Shapiro just went after him on the same grounds, is that I don't care what you say about whether or not you're an atheist, atheist, you act like you're part of the Judeo Christian tradition. And so you think you don't believe, but I think you do, but we have different definitions of what the word believe means. So now I'm not saying that that's necessary the argument and all arguments, but it's one that needs to be taken seriously, especially by the more rationalistic atheists because they don't give the devil his due. Now you're in a different category because you went through the whole Christian thing in detail and you know, the, you know, the stories and you know, the mythology and you know, the psychology as well, you know, we've talked about Joseph Campbell and people like him. So, you know, that puts you in the, in the, in the realm of the, I would say, what would you say biblically and, and on, and a psychoanalytically informed.

Speaker 2:          01:03:44       Well, again, it depends what your goals are. What are you trying to do? I mean, people like Sam and Richard know they're laser focused on one particular thing and they're working at so good. Um, and I'm, I'm on board with that. Uh, I think know certain belief systems are dangerous. Uh, okay. So let it be good. If we could correct those, but I'm also interested in other aspects of beliefs and um, you know, that's, that's a slightly different goal. So for example, when I'm talking to Deepak, no, it's true. Quantum physics says what it says. Okay. But at some level I say, what's the actionable take home? Why not? Okay, so let's say the world is completely determined and you know, right down to the last synaptic connection that the particles, whatever. And I really have no choice. Yeah. But so what? I still have to choose to go to work tomorrow or as I tell Deepak, you know, my mortgage is still due next Tuesday. So even if none of this matters or, or it's all empty space or you know, it's all consciousness. So what act in the world in a way as if I'm making choices, as if I'm responsible for my actions because I am.

Speaker 1:          01:04:53       That's good. That's. Well, I would also say in relationship to that, there isn't any evidence to me that we've been able to determine how to build a functional society without building those axioms into the, into the substructure of the society, freewill and responsibility. Maybe they don't exist, but if we don't build societies that assume they exist, the society's become unstable unbelievably rapidly. And to me that's a kind of evidence they do exist.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       I mean even knowing the say game theoretic model of a tilting the incentives to get people to do this versus that, you know, a libertarian paternalism, Dick Taylor calls it, you know, so if you give people a choice architecture where you put the desert, you know, in the back and in the healthy fruit foods in the front or you have different kinds of structured menus to get to nudge people to choose healthier diets or better investment tools that companies, things like that. We're already doing these sorts of things as if we can, if not determined people, people's actions and choices, but at least shape them in a way. But, but even doing that, we're actively choosing to do that. So being self aware that I know that if I go shopping on an empty stomach, I'm very, I'm much more likely to buy unhealthy foods, cookies or ice cream or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:06:07       Then I would, if I went shopping on a full stomach, so I choose to alter my environment around me because I'm going to nudge myself in another direction. How is that not a kind of a choice and if you're a determinist to determine determinants, I would say. Um. Okay. Do you recognize say that the addict who is just totally hooked on heroin or acce coat on or something is different from Uni who are not addicted and yes, there's a difference. Okay. What's that difference? If it's all determinism, it's tumors all the way down or whatever. Um, what is the difference then between the addict and the addict is more determined? No, but I to good objection. That's what is that as a concept? Yeah. What does that mean? More determined, right? Exactly. Exactly. That's why I like Dan dead. It's idea of the degrees of freedom. You and I have more degrees of freedom that our dogs are dogs more than the cockroach, whatever. Um, there's just more variation and we have one additional

Speaker 1:          01:07:10       we're aware of in terms of time as well, you know, if you're, if you're driving, here's a nice way of thinking about the relationship between free will and determinism. Let's say you're driving down the road at 60 miles an hour. Where do you look? And the answer isn't right in front of the car because you've already run over the thing that's right in front of the car. So you look about a quarter of a mile down the road. And what that means is that you can start to sequence your deterministic auctions. And so there's this idea of a ballistic movement. So if I do this, let's see. So you see I didn't hit my hand when I came down like that. Now, the truth of the matter is, is that there isn't enough time. So when I released this movement quickly, there isn't enough time for the message to get from my hand to my brain and back to stop my hand as an element of free choice.

Speaker 1:          01:08:02       I have to plan and release the entire movement at once, including the stopping. That's ballistic. And so as soon as I implement that movement, there is no free will. It's like the space that have choice over has collapsed into a deterministic world, but I think what we do is we look out in the future far enough so that we can sequence our choices and they collapse into determinism as we implement something like that. And I think that works neurologically to. If you look at how, how, how action patterns actually manifest themselves in the brain, it does seem to be something akin to that. Don't make much out of the liberty limited experiments, for example,

Speaker 2:          01:08:41       well limited himself was a compatiblist he did not believe in, in, in complete determinism that wears a pink or put it this way in the blanks slate that you are part of the causal net of the universe, but you're part of it and you're making choices that further determined the universe, but they're still your choice so you are morally accountable for them. I do think the law has evolved nicely along these lines along the, um, sort of shades of grey or the to know the law if you intended to kill somebody versus doing it in an act of a rage because it was just on spur of the moment. You've got your spouse and you and you lose your temper. That's different from the. If we, we find out that for weeks you were plotting this to kill your spouse or whatever, you're going to get a different kind of penalty. And that matches, you know, neuroscience pretty well. Yeah, I think so. I think so. More or less control over. So again, more deterministic versus less deterministic. What are you talking about? You're talking about degrees of freedom. Determinist don't like the word freedom. Okay. Call it something else. You have more degrees of something, of options.

Speaker 1:          01:09:52       Well, whatever you end up with as a synonym eventually ends up meaning freedom.

Speaker 2:          01:09:56       Well, I think so. Yeah. The word I the word. I used the word. So,

Speaker 1:          01:10:01       so that's next return. I'm going to show your book again here, just so that everybody remembers it and I would like to say what were you. Let's end with this. What were you hoping or are you hoping to accomplish with this book? Apart from clarifying your own thoughts and communicating them? What, what? I mean, you, you, you've put this message into a bottle and you've launched it out there in the world. What do you, what are you hoping for?

Speaker 2:          01:10:24       Uh, really to everybody, both religious and nonreligious or scientists. The messages at really the here and now is what counts more than anything else. We don't, again, we live in Brooklyn, not in 15 billion years from now that, that, that, whether or not there's an afterlife, because clearly no one knows for sure. We don't live in the afterlife. We live in this life and, and so what you do really matters how you are in relation with other people and your environment really matters. It matters not just for the future but the immediate future. And even now, whatever that means to you. And uh, so, uh, again, I'm glad people are working on this and thinking about it. Um, and if we can improve society incrementally a little bit instead of aiming for utopia, aim for protopia.

Speaker 1:          01:11:12       Yep. Yeah, that's a great

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       thing. Incremental. And again, instead of aiming for the mortality or a thousand years, let's just aim for getting more people to 90 and 100 healthy and happy and living fulfilled lives. And I do talk about in the end about the last chapter, less pages in fact about the importance of aiming to live a purposeful, meaningful life. Not a happiness. You know, I've just to see the literature develop in positive psychology about happiness. I've read all the books, all great, but happiness in the sense of I'm going to plug into the morphine drip now. That's not what life is about. That isn't what gets people meaningful lives. It's doing things that don't make you happy, you know, like again, back to your workout every day. It's not fun. I'm not happy working out. Uh, and uh, or you know, I was a caretaker for my parents. Um, I had four parents, step parents and, and so two of them I was a caretaker. It wasn't fun at all. I didn't get joy, I wasn't enjoying it. It was a, you know, an uncomfortable experience, but it made me feel better about myself, about the world. Like this is what this is doing something more deeply meaningful. And, and so I think that that's where it counts actually working to make the world a better place, gives you a deeper, more fulfilled life.

Speaker 1:          01:12:31       That is an excellent place to end. So I think like, I think amen to that red light for no afterlife. We should improve what we have right in front of us. Exactly. Yep. And that's better than happiness. I agree. I agree completely. It's a much more profound orientation and it's a boat that will tap in a storm, so they see, hey, my pleasure. It was really nice talking with you. Hopefully we'll get a chance to talk again.

Speaker 2:          01:13:01       Your book comes out the 12 steps. We'll we'll talk about the 12 steps. Sounds like a fine plan yet, but I saw your show with Dave Rubin. I thought that was really good.

Speaker 1:          01:13:10       Thanks very much. Was very good talking with you. Alright. Right. Bye. Bye.
