Speaker 1:          00:03          We just launched support Peterson, research.com a crowdfunding campaign to pay for Professor Jordan Peterson is academic research. And then the first 24 hours we raised more than an entire year's worth of research funding for them. That's amazing. We did this because for the first time in his 20 year career, the government agency that hands out research grants rejected his funding proposal, which just coincidentally came after he made headlines for fighting against political correctness. Well what a poetic victory. We're getting him that funding after all and now he's more independent than ever.

Speaker 2:          00:40          Thanks very much for doing this. Hey, it's working in an extraordinarily well. I've been sitting here, I'm down in Boston, I'm going to do a talk at Harvard and a on political correctness and access compassion and free speech. And I've been sitting here watching the numbers climb and I think there's more than 1500 people who are supporting my research now. And we've gone past for first year of funding already and I guess we're going to try it for the second year. Um, it's remarkable. And, uh, well I, I, I don't know what to say except my graduate students are extraordinarily happy about this because it solves their problem. Then we'll continue our research and can just review that briefly. Um, the research is aimed first of all at improving the accuracy of the measurement of personality and we've done some of some of that already.

Speaker 2:          01:31          Freaking the big five down into 10 sub components. So for example, we've looked at the relationship, the subcomponents of conscientiousness and broken it down into industriousness and orderliness and associated with orderliness, with disgust, sensitivity and look its role in increasing the probability of conservative beliefs. And we've looked at trade agreeableness and compassionate in particular and examine its relationship to politically correct leaf because it has, it seems to play a very strong role in determining a proclivity for people to adopt politically correct for leafs. And we'll continue that and also continue doing the basic research into the development of programs like the self authoring suite. Uh, the future authoring portion of that has already been demonstrated to raise college students, grades five, about 25% decrease the dropout. And we've got 1200 high school students lined up to try a high school version of that in the fall.

Speaker 2:          02:28          And we're very much looking forward to seeing if we can duplicate our success with that. Anyways, it's quite remarkable. So, um, I'd like to thank everybody thoroughly for supporting this research and, and supporting me. I find it amazing that if this is possible even, and so, um, our way we go I guess, and once again thank you to, to you and to everyone that's supporting the research over to you as rough, we'll see how it goes over the next, I guess we're gonna run this for a month. We'll see how it goes over the month, next month. We've got lots of plans in the loud. So, um, I think we can put the money to very good use and use. That will be, what would you say? It's not only scientifically valid, but hopefully that will have a broad scale impact on practically speaking because as a clinical psychologist, I like to conduct research that's going to be abroad practical benefit as well as theoretical and scientific utility. So anyways, thanks again already.

Speaker 1:          03:30          It is amazing and thank you to all of you. All the net proceeds will be sent to Professor Peterson. And remember the perks, if you give $100 you'll receive a link to an exclusive video from him. $250 get you an invitation to a reception to meet him and his Grad students and a thousand dollar donor. Well, you'll actually get a bound copy of his research personally autographed. So let's go forward. Let's set our sights on the stretch goal of funding the second year of his recent, remember it was a five year application that it was rejected. So let's do what the politicians and the bureaucrats won't visit. www.support peterson, research.com support free speech and academic freedom. Go to support Peterson research.com.
