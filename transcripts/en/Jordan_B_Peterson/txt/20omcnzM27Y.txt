Speaker 1:          00:01          This is our first, uh, a hangout google hangout. I hope the first of many you are Jordan Peterson, that professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and I'm Wodek Szemberg a producer within the agenda, uh, at Tvo and today we are going to be speaking about a book that you are beginning to work on, right? It's your, it's your second book. Um, and tell us first a bit about, uh, uh, the first book that you written and how long it took you to write that one.

Speaker 2:          00:42          Well, I wrote a book called maps of meaning the architecture of beliefs back in. It was published in 1999 and now it took me 15 years to write and I wrote three hours a day basically for almost that whole time. So it took a long time and it's correspondingly difficult to read.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Obviously. Obviously you are not trying to spend 15 years writing a. The next one, the title was the book's title is 42 wide, 42.

Speaker 2:          01:18          Well, it was partly, um, what would, what do you call that? Um, well fluke isn't exactly the right word, but it's the only one I can think up at the moment. I started experimenting with a website called Quora. Quora is a relatively new site where anyone can post any question and anyone can post any answer. Um, and then the answers are voted on by the target population who's interested in the question. And so I wrote 45 or 50 answers to different questions and one of them was a list of rules for living. The question was, does anyone have a good list of rules for living? And so I thought I'd take a crack at that and I wrote 40, turned out that I wrote 41 rules for living and it became quite popular on Quora. It got something in the neighborhood or has accrued something in the neighborhood of 500 up folds, which puts it in the top.

Speaker 2:          02:15          One or two percent of all the thousands of answers that have been posted on quora. And lots of my other answers have nowhere near that kind of, you know, popular success. And then I was thinking about the list and I remembered that there was a book written by Adam so long while back called hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, Douglas Adams, and in that book a computer, a super computer in the future is asked the question, what's the answer to life, the universe and everything and the answer that the computer spits out after, if I remember correctly, several thousand years of computation was 42. And I believe the computer also comments that that is the correct answer, but that the people who are going to receive at aren't smart enough to understand it. So I thought, well, one more answer that gives me 42 and then that would be a funny, a bit of serendipity. That's the, that's the word I was looking for.

Speaker 1:          03:19          You remember which one was the second to rule that you came up with?

Speaker 2:          03:25          Wait, remember clones? No, I could find out but I don't remember.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Okay. Okay. So, so let me ask you this question. Why, why is it that a 10th amendments and not sufficient for us to live by and why? Why do we need a, a fresh list of rules that will guide our life's choices?

Speaker 2:          03:51          Well, the first thing is, is that if you, if you actually look in the Old Testament where the 10 commandments are listed, you'll find that there are far more than talent. The tanner, I suppose, what might be regarded as the most crucial rule. So even back when the 10 commandments were formulated, 10 rules wasn't it? But there's also something about the way people think that makes them quite happy about lists, numbered lists, you know, when you see this very frequently, the seven habits of successful people and, and so forth. Then once the list is numbered, it sort of tiny and it seems well organized and it's sort of a, did. It implies that it's comprehensible and somewhat comprehensive. And I mean, I think that was part of the attractiveness of this particular answer. So other than that, I can't really say, and I guess people are looking for simplicity, right? And 43 is quite a few, but

Speaker 1:          04:49          I must say, I must say that I was a bit taken aback by some of them, uh, by virtue of the fact that they seem to rather a lacking in, in, in, in, in importance, others say, seem to naturally possess a, as in be truthful. I mean, that's a great role that seems to, seems to have all the bells and whistles of, of, of truth to live by that here are some others which seem to not to be at the same caliber. And this is, these are the ones I want to talk to you about today. Uh, hopefully we'll get another chance to talk about this. We'll say they're on. So we will talk about the important of as quote unquote a. So here's one of them, uh, number 14, uh, try to make one room in your house as beautiful as possible.

Speaker 2:          05:46          Why is that important? Well, because if you want to improve things on a medium to large scale, let's say, so that would be important. It's really useful to doing so on a small scale. So you actually learn how to do it. And No, it isn't that easy to make a single room beautiful. It's, it's hard and it's hard. Plus it's the knowledge you generate doing that is also generalizable because fixing up one thing is a lot like fixing up another thing. There's a lot of commonality between the attempts to improve one thing and another thing and you can start locally like with the room and the first thing you find out is that it's not trivial to try to make a single room beautiful and that you learn an awful lot about beauty and you learn an awful lot about paying attention and you learn an awful lot about how you could make what you already have much better than it is merely by paying attention to it.

Speaker 2:          06:45          And you know, I shouldn't really say merely because paying attention to things, there's almost everything. And also you get to practice doing something that's hypothetically an improvement on something that's actually your own. You're not putting anyone else at any risk. And the benefits of that are also are also quite remarkable because then you have a space around you that's beautiful and you get to benefit from whatever it is that beauty is. Beauty is deep and people are afraid of it too, which is another thing that makes it difficult and challenging is I believe the favorite color that Canadians have. Canadians for decorator purposes is a beige and you know, there's a reason for that. And the reason is you can't go wrong with beige, but the problem with that is you can go right with it either. And so trying to make something beautiful demands that you step out of the ordinary and that's frightening and it's really useful to try to do. So

Speaker 1:          07:45          I've been, I've been to your home, it will not be a secret to those who, uh, familiar with you and the frequency with which you have been on, on the agenda and big ideas that we know each other quite well. Um, tell me which of your rooms in your house, so you deem to be the most beautiful one?

Speaker 2:          08:07          Well, I have a front room. It's a small room. Um, because I live in a quite a small place because I lived downtown, I have a front room which is a living room I suppose. Um, and it, it, it's about 12 by 12 and it's, it has a beautiful fireplace and a marble tiled and the cover, it's a gas fireplace. The cover is a cover that, okay. Was part of the original house before we redid it and it's made out of like a bronze tinted cast iron. And then in that room there are probably 15 paintings of different sizes. I'm ranging from like monumental, could, one of them's about seven by nine and then there's several others in there, believe it or not often or approximately that size. And there's this sculpture and um, and some paintings by a famous Mexican artists. And, and you know, you might think, well that's, that's would be prohibitively expensive to, to, for someone to attempt, but it's actually not because you can buy paintings at a very reasonable price if you learn how to find them. I find most of them on Ebay as it turns out. And I'd found some unbelievable paintings on Ebay. I've had to look a lot. I probably looked at, I tried to calculate it the other day. I've looked at two or 300 paintings a day for 10 years, so that's about $6,000 a months or about 75 to $100,000 a year. So that's a million paintings in a, in 10 years.

Speaker 1:          09:46          I'm curious, how long does it take you to know, to know where the painting is worthy of interest?

Speaker 2:          09:52          That's a good question. It could take as little as,

Speaker 3:          09:58          oh,

Speaker 2:          09:59          it's less than half a second. It's probably more like a fifth of a second. Probably. Most of them are so bad. It's just absolutely unbelievable and, but, but the, the ones that aren't, they kind of pop out and, and then I put them in a group a day. I opened a new tab and look and save it for later consideration and make a small, you know, I, I call, I told them very, very radically and so. But I mean it's really been very, it's been very interesting to try to do this not only to the, to the room, but to the whole house. And, and I mean I have 36 colors in my house and I had a friend of mine who's from Montreal, helped me initially. He's a portrait painter and he helped me initially pick the colors and you know, one of the questions is, well, what does that do when you do something like that?

Speaker 2:          10:53          And I mean one of the things that's been quite interesting is it always gives me an excuse to invite interesting people over to my house because I have something interesting to show them. And so it's made it easier for me too. It's been, it's made it easier for me to make certain kinds of social arrangements with people. I'm also, and this is something I thought about a lot when I had my kids, I mean they're often university now, but when they were little, you know, it struck me that it would be useful to have them surrounded by

Speaker 2:          11:26          productions of high quality because they, they tell you about production of high quality and artistic production tells you something like a painting for example of something. Most of the paintings, I have a relatively representational, although not all of them because there's lots of different dimensions of beauty, but a representational painting that's beautiful, have something normal because some of the paintings that I have are of working people. For example, what the patient tells you is, although you don't notice it because you don't have the time, you're surrounded by things that are worthy of great attention. And here's an example. Here's a portrait of a working man, maybe a coal miner that some artists who is talented spent 250 hours on just getting the face right. And so what that reminds you of, even though you don't know it when you look at it, is that everything that you glance at is worth 250 hours of study.

Speaker 2:          12:23          It's just you don't have the time and you forget about it because you have to, but the world is full of things that are absolutely remarkable, deeply remarkable. And what an artist does is tell you that all the time. And so when you have those things around you are, you have beautiful things around you. It's a constant reminder that behind the necessary shallowness of your perception is the kind of depth that you need to make contact with in order to sustain your faith in life and in humanity. It's not a trivial thing. It's a really important thing and you can see this. Just one more comment on this like although it's harder for conservative people to appreciate this because by temperament they're not as aesthetically I'm committed, I would say are interested. You know, one of the things we should remember is that Europe has become a magnet for tourists all over the world and it draws billions and billions of dollars a year of revenue from other countries because people come from all over to look at impractical, so to speak. Beautiful things. Well, it turns out they're not practical at all. They're so practical that you just. The fact that they're beautiful is probably an indication that they're more practical than anything else you could possibly imagine because your appreciation for beauty, beauty I think is probably it's a facility that you have of noting what's valuable beyond the mundane.

Speaker 1:          13:49          So John, let's move on. Let's continue with talking about things that are to be appreciated and will. Number 37 is pat. Sorry, pat kept when you encountered one on this treat, why? Why is that an essential

Speaker 2:          14:07          important part of, of, of, of, of a good life? Well, you know, it's, it's,

Speaker 2:          14:16          I suppose it's in the same category and I guess this is rather evident of stop and smell the roses, although obviously that's degenerated into something of a cliche, but I mean it's easy to become so obsessed with your particular goal that you don't notice what's around you when it's happening and a catcher, a good break from that as far as I'm concerned because they'll poke their little heads out and kind of take a look at you because they're interested in maybe having a momentary pleasurable interaction and there seems to be very little harm in doing it and it takes you out of your. It takes you out of one timeframe, which is often a goal oriented and practical timeframe which are obviously necessary timeframes and helps you concentrate on the moment and attending to the moment. Well, it's, it's analogous to the same thing. We just discussed with regards to surrounding yourself with beauty, it's hard for people to pay enough attention to the moment and when an opportunity presents itself to you where you could immerse yourself in something that's, that's of high quality for no cost. No, there's no, there's no downside to it. So well, a good rule of thumb is like engage in every opportunity you possibly have for peaceful pleasure. That's that as is of no cost to anyone and there's lots of opportunities like that around and people start noticing them like we're wired out. So we stopped noticing things that are working and there's a reason for that. It's practical, but the problem is, is that you forget about everything that surrounds you that's working really well in that and that is pleasurable.

Speaker 1:          16:03          Can, can you give me some other examples of a pleasurable activities that have that, uh, that quality that they take you out of? Well, the, the ordinary humdrum, the, uh, the purposeful pursuit of things.

Speaker 2:          16:18          Yeah. Well, I think hot showers are good example of that. I mean, think about a hot shower. It's like almost everyone in North America is so rich that they have a personal hot spring in their house. It's like, that's a good deal. That's such a good deal. It's, it's so impossible and so unlikely and people take it for granted. Although, well, yes and no because they sing in the shower and lots of people say they have their best ideas in the shower and it's like, it's really useful to remember when you're in the shower that hey, aren't you king of the universe with your hot spring inside your house and what a great deal that is. And lots of things are like that and we forget about them and it's, it's the curse of human beings to forget about things because we're kind of cognitively limited and we're always attending to problems and so you have to sort of stop yourself now and then and think, okay, well, wow, isn't it great that this works?

Speaker 2:          17:12          I also think the same thing about cars because I, I'm firmly convinced that if the automobile was invented today, there's no bloody way it would be illegal for people to drive. I mean, when we left, you know, at the risk of being sexist in ages, we let little old ladies pilot, you know, 3,500 pounds of hurdling metal down barrier lined highways with thousands and hundreds of other people around that could be run over and no one even notices that that's an absolute miracle, that that's, that, that, that you can do that and that it's not illegal. I just, every time I think that it just makes my jaw drop because it violates every principle of common sense you could possibly imagine. And plus it's so much fun and cars worked so well. They're so good. Like I have an old car, it's a, it's a Hyundai Sonata from 19, from 2004, you know, so it's getting to be an old car. The bloody thing is perfect, you know, it's got a top speed of about 140 miles an hour. It's smooth as silk has a great sound system and I can zoom around like a mad dog and the authorities are, don't bother themselves with that.

Speaker 1:          18:25          Yeah. Go on the record here and, and much support you in admiration of the fact that we have achieved as a, as a conscious realization, something, something on parallel which is, which is to allow individuals to, uh, drive potentially killing machines in a way in which in which, uh, the killing does not happen for the most part, does not happen and it happens. It's not intentional and that it somehow it does embody and amazing or that that fact of driving a mass suggests that we have, will be able to create a cartoon in which, uh, the principles of freedom and older able to exist in an amazing fashion.

Speaker 2:          19:15          It is, it's amazing. I mean, you know, that if we invented a new technology that killed as many people a year is audible, there's no, there's no way we disseminated. There isn't a chance, but for some reason automobiles have have sneaked through that and it even more amazing. They sneak through that so well that even totalitarian states can't stop them. And so the first thing your basic dictator does is buy a Mercedes. It's like he's screwed right off the bat as soon as he buys the Mercedes because what he's announcing is that personal mobility trumps everything and it's

Speaker 1:          19:53          only country in which the leadership has managed to maintain a, a control over who's allowed to drive or not North Korea,

Speaker 2:          20:06          sorry, Arabia bit too because they're not so thrilled about having their women drive, which is a sad commentary on Saudi Arabia.

Speaker 1:          20:14          Um, let us move on and, and I want to raise another rule that really surprised me. Rule number 37, 38 a do not bother children when they're skateboarding.

Speaker 2:          20:30          It's always been a source of amazement to me. The way that institutions, businesses, governments treat skateboarders. It's like, first of all, if you ever sit and watch a group of adolescent, if they're usually boys, not always skateboard, it's, you can't help but be struck with amazement about how brave they are. Like outside of the St George Building here, the kids will jump up on the metal railing that goes down on the steps, on the cement steps. They'll jump up on that with your skateboard and try to write it down. It's like they fall off, they fall off, right onto the cement and with the sharp edges and you know, they all, their friends laugh and they lay there and lose their breath and they gasp and Moan and then, you know, two minutes later they're up throwing it again. It's like, it's so brave and they're so good at it.

Speaker 2:          21:24          And, and it's harmless. Yeah, they might get hurt, but that's hardly the point, you know, I mean, you can't be encased in Styrofoam. It's a pathetic way live. And those kids are brave and they're trying to master something really difficult and all they get is grief. So for example, outside my, the building I work in here, there are some, some cement containers. They're quite long and they lined the street, there are trees in them and uh, the skateboarders like to jump up on them and, and of zip along the edge with their skateboard. And um, what the university has done about that is put all these metal, um, they're a little metal strips along the edge of the containers. So the skateboarders can't do that. And it just irritates me because first of all, the metal strips or as ugly as sin, they looked like they were put up by, by a totalitarian state.

Speaker 2:          22:18          And second, it's like, leave the damn kids alone. Let them play. That's what they're doing. They're playing and kids need to play. So and that skateboarders, they're not let them skate board. They're not drinking. They're not like they're not doing anything delinquent. They're out there trying to master their bodies and to be brave. And, and there's, I think that irritates people who won't do that. They look at those kids and there's the part of them that's, that's not right. Things. Oh, those little rats. It's like, no, they're not a little wrapped. They're brave. And what they're doing is remarkable. It's like gymnastics, except they're not on a nice rubber floor. They're on cement. They're brave.

Speaker 1:          23:01          What is the principle that the defendant here as there, is it important to have a correlation of bravery, of physical bravery, or is that it? The importance of understanding and accepting that that good good life involves a certain degree of risk.

Speaker 2:          23:21          I think it's the good life also requires a certain amount of ability to admire those people who take risks and plus they're not doing any harm. Now, you know, someone might object, well, what about liability? But my, my, my experience with liability is, is that as soon as someone talks about liability, you better be skeptical of their motives because they're using their liability argument to abdicate their responsibility for participating in the necessary dangers of a civilized state. The whole liability thing that's a, that's a weasel his way out as far as I'm concerned. So

Speaker 1:          24:03          is this the reason why you have the main point of this, uh, uh, and formulated to the rule of the way you have is, is it because you have a sense that, uh, that we increasingly subject to a kind of the cautionary principle that the seminar society is preoccupied with too much risk and, and, and that, and the counselors asked to be in ways which are, uh, not too risky.

Speaker 2:          24:31          Yeah, I think that's part of it. I also think, I think the other part of the two is that, you know, like I said, most of the time these skateboarders are boys and they're like adolescent boys state and I think that admiration for the sorts of things they're doing, which is a kind of, in a sense, it's reckless, reckless, masculine courage that's sorely lacking in our society. And you know, people might object at, that's my opinion. But I'll tell you, I talk about this a fair bit in my classes, like my class this week. I showed the students a couple of clips from the lion king when Simba, the lion king is growing up and trying to become braids. And um, you know, I have my students, the boys in particular, the young men coming up to me constantly saying that, you know, they, they just see no appreciation whatsoever for what used to be termed masculine virtues anywhere in society.

Speaker 2:          25:24          And they're like, they're, it's not good for the. I mean, that one of them wrote me a letter this week stating exactly that, you know, they're hurt by it and, and there's a resentment towards it. And I see it really expressed in that attitude towards skateboard. Is this like, what's wrong with those kids are fine. They're plus. Plus. The other thing I know is that play kids have to play. It's not playing isn't what, what do you call it? It's not of secondary importance. Human beings have a place circuit. It's, it's part of being a mammal. And one of the ways that human beings organize themselves at the highest level of moral virtue is through play. You know, when those kids, the kids that are skateboarding in their groups, you know, they're evaluating each other for courage and bravery and they're watching each other perform difficult physical app. So they're extending their limits and it's, you should be happy about that. And if you just sit down and watch them for 10 minutes, it's, it's like warranty. Like I said, it's like watching gymnastics. It's goal as far as I'm concerned, goes skateboarders.

Speaker 1:          26:35          Uh, Jordan, we have now a half an hour. I think this went very well for the first time out. I hope to be able to talk to you again. We have only managed to talk about the three other rules. They are 42 on a on an all, so we've got 39 to go. Plenty of material to talk about in the future, so thank you and until next time, great. Nice talking to you.
