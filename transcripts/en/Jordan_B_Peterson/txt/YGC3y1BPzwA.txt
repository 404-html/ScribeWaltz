Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01          So today I'm talking to two of my compatriots I suppose, um, in this ongoing discussion in Canada about, um, free speech issues, including compelled speech. And I met Jared Brown and Bruce Party jareds a practicing lawyer and Bruce is a professor at Queen's University in the law school there. And I met them both when we were, when we manifested a mutual interest last year and bill see 16, which we all regarded as, um, a piece of legislation that was infringing on the rights to free speech of Canadian individuals in a manner that hadn't been ever attempted before. Um, and more recently the Law Society of Upper Canada, soon to be known as the Law Society of Ontario has put forward a requirement for all of its members. So all of the lawyers in Ontario, uh, to produce a document, a principle that we all have been talking about, the three of us have been talking about that we regard as a another, but far more egregious example of compelled speech.

Speaker 2:          01:17          So I'm going to let jared introduce himself and say a little bit about who he is. He testified with me at the Canadian Senate last year. Bruce Party also testified at the Senate on Bill See 16, and Bruce was also the lawyer that I debated. He played devil's advocate at Queen's university at some of you watching this will be familiar with that video. So jared, I'll let you introduce yourself. And then Bruce and then Bruce Bruce recently wrote a column for the, now she'll post on this new requirement by the law society. And so we're going to let him begin the discussion proper onto you. Jared.

Speaker 3:          01:51          I'm a an everyday litigator. I'm a commercial litigator in Toronto. Uh, I've been practicing for about 15 years, um, doing increasingly more and more human rights tribunal work, um, things like that. Um, and obviously stepped into the breach on [inaudible]. And as far as I can tell, uh, I may have been the only practicing lawyer that actually spoke out against the legislation. Um, there were certainly a lot of lawyers, a including the Canadian bar association that were, uh, arraigned in favor of the legislation. But as far as I can tell, uh, boots on the ground, I think I was the only one. Um, so I've got a pretty benign practice, but, um, but certainly if a

Speaker 2:          02:32          taking up the fight if you will.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:35          Bruce.

Speaker 4:          02:38          Thanks Jordan. Uh, well this, this issue arose for me a couple of weeks ago when I received an email from the law society and all lawyers get these emails, uh, to do various things. But this was different because it announced a new requirement for this year. Uh, jared I think was aware of this developing, uh, before I was, but, but like many other lawyers in the province, this is supposed to the first indication that, uh, this new requirement existed and essentially email said, um, one of the things that said amongst others was that every licensed lawyer now is required to draft and submit what they are calling a statement of principles. And that statement is, is, uh, required to express your agreement and the value you place on inclusion, diversity and equality, and the fact that you will actively promote those values. And that's me just sprung off the screen as, uh, a, uh, an outrageous example of forced speech out, the same kind that we were talking about under [inaudible] 16.

Speaker 4:          03:55          But, but worse, uh, this one actually requires you to make a full fledged statement that will be subject to their approval in order to maintain your license. In other words, this is not a matter of it being suggested to you that you might ought to want to do this. This is a condition of your ability to practice law in the province of Ontario. So, uh, this district, me as a matter that, uh, needed to be aired publicly, I needed to be discussed amongst lawyers in the province because this is a slow march to a dark place, I think. And that's where it all began.

Speaker 2:          04:37          Yeah. Well, it was concerning to me when I encountered this. I mean, I'm the member of a college as well at college of psychologists. And my sense of this is that if the lawyers full and, and, and go along with this, the probability that this will be required of every professional in Ontario and then very rapidly, every profession in Canada is extremely high because if some lawyers who are, you know, relatively disagreeable bunch and who are very familiar with the law and with common law in general are willing to have their political beliefs dictated to them by their college, then the probability that the rest of us will be able to withstand that I think is extremely low. So a strong, a strong independent bar is always supposed to

Speaker 3:          05:22          be the defense or at least one line of defense against tyranny or against government overreach. And, and by, uh, having the lawyers under the guise of their regulatory body, um, being compelled to speak or, or share opinions, um, it's obviously something scary and I think it's something that lawyers should wake up to and they need to push back against compelled speech, which was obviously the issue on see 16, um, is a particularly nefarious, um, infringement and intrusion.

Speaker 2:          05:53          Yeah, well it's, I mean it's one thing to put restrictions on what people say. I mean I know you can't incite someone to crime for example. Um, but it's a completely different thing to require people to espouse a particular political stance, especially when the, when, when it's being reviewed by what's essentially an arbitrary committee and when the punishment is so as draconian as, as potentially losing your right to practice and that that's enforced as a mandatory, like the first step was to make that mandatory rather than as a suggestion.

Speaker 4:          06:29          So let's, let's just emphasize this point that the distinction between restrictions on speech, which, which are not with things and are debatable and so on. But this is a different category of question. This is compelled speech. This is a requirement that makes you say something you may not agree with. And uh, I mentioned it'll be at the column I statements from the Supreme Court of Canada and maybe I'll just read out one of those gyms too, just to make the point. Because even if the court has said explicitly that, uh, that this is, this is not on in a, in a free society, you're hear the words of the Supreme Court, uh, forcing someone to express opinions that they do not have is to tell Alterian and as such, alien to the tradition of free nations like Canada, even for the repression of the most serious crimes, which of course is not in Preston here. Yeah, I mean that was cool.

Speaker 3:          07:27          Sorry Jordan. That was, that was the cornerstone of not only the opinion piece that I, I put up on my website about [inaudible], but also in the cornerstone of the presentation that was made to the Senate is that this is a particularly egregious infringement on freedom of expression. Uh, you're having to mouth opinions and ideas that may not be your own and the government is forcing you to do it. And then obviously in this incidence, so you've got your regulatory body, which, uh, which holds your license, uh, in, in your ability to carry on the livelihood in the chosen profession that you're in. I'm telling you that you've got to start voicing these opinions.

Speaker 2:          08:03          So, jared, when we talked before too, one of the things that you pointed out, and Bruce, you had commented on this as well, is that, you know, the, the Law Society Administration theoretically did some background work before deciding that this was a necessity. And they produced a report essentially proclaiming that the, uh, the law, the people who are practicing law in Ontario are essentially racist in their orientation, which is why this is racist and perhaps misogynist as well, which is why this piece of administrative, let's call it law or requirements, has come into practice. But it isn't obvious that their own data support that conclusion. I mean, you can easily read what they wrote as pretty providing pretty compelling evidence that the legal profession, the demographics of the legal profession for what that's worth, you are transforming quite rapidly. And so, um, the thing that concerned me as well from a psychological perspective about this sort of thing is that lawyers who agree to participate in this process are basically admitting their racism and misogyny on a conscious and unconscious basis and thereby convicting themselves. Like they're, they're guilty to begin with. They, and they don't have an opportunity to prove their innocence. And by, by going along with these requirements, they're basically admitting through their action that the accusations that are being thrown at them both individually and as a collective are, are not only accurate but require immediate remediation.

Speaker 3:          09:39          Yeah, well, I mean the, the, uh, the rec or the requirement that's a being rolled out right now as the result of a, I think it's about a 58 page report that had 13 recommendations that were passed by convocation, which is the governing body of the law society. And the report itself, uh, was entitled strategies to address issues of systemic racism in the legal professions. I mean, that statement on its own is saying that our, our industry as well as the Law Society Organization itself is systemically racist. And, and clearly that's a to me, I mean it's uh, uh, a very bold statement and one that I think, um, requires some level of scrutiny. Um, you know, the, the group that came up with this report is an esteemed group. These are all highly respected, uh, well accomplished individuals. And, and you know, there, there is a body of data that they've produced as well as, um, some qualitative anecdotal stories as to some of the issues that are being faced by, uh, by what they call racialized licensees.

Speaker 3:          10:42          I mean, the data is something that a lot of people aren't going to look at, but I do encourage people to look at it and see what, what the basis on that finding that we're a systemically racist industry and, and obviously profession. Um, I encourage people to look at it, um, study the report. I can assure you that most, most lawyers won't 58 pages, uh, something that happened back in December. But it, there's, um, there's a lot of shocking, um, information in there and there's a obviously some shocking findings, but, um, yeah, no, it's, it's got me concerned because my, my industry has now been deemed racist by the body that governs it.

Speaker 2:          11:18          Yeah. Yeah. Well, one of the things that's really appalling about that and I think and also about the requirements for the statement of principles is that there's a pronounced ideological bent to them. Um, and the first is the idea of systemic racism because the way that you prove systemic racism is, is, uh, I would say, let's say call it questionable methodologically to say the least because the basic concept is that you divide the population up by racial, ethnic and sex based identification, which you can do in a very large number of ways by the way. And then you compare any organization, uh, to that population based division. And if the, the, uh, ratio of individuals categorized in the general population isn't the same as the ratio of individuals in that profession, then you can automatically make a case for systemic racism. And that's a very, very weak methodology. No credible scientist would regard that. And I would regard that as proof of anything. And worse, I can't imagine that any, any claim like that would stand up and something resembling a court of law if, if you know, if it was possible to take a group to court. Cause there's all sorts of reasons why there might be differential representation in a group

Speaker 4:          12:41          and that, and that is assuming that that's what the data shows. And in many respects that's actually what this data shows. So I take your point about the methodology but but even so, even if you like set that methodology, it's not crystal clear that that's what the numbers actually suggestion. Can I get back for a moment to your, to your implication point, I mean I agree that the requirements to make this statement in this context essentially put, be interpreted as though you were required to make a confession about what it is you've done wrongly in the past and what it is you will do now in the present to correct it as an individual. And there is also the, the the trouble that once you have written a statement so as to come to comply with the requirement, then you have on the record a statement of what it is that you believe and thereafter your future actions can be compared to that statement.

Speaker 4:          13:38          So as to show that you are not acting in co in compliance with what you have set you believe or that on one occasion or the other, you haven't been telling the truth. So some, some I've heard some lawyers say in response to this requirement that, oh well this is not a big deal because I'll just going to write the statement. They'll put it in a file, it'll sit in some corner of the law society computer. And, and who, who cares, it's no big deal, but it actually, it is a very big deal because they are hurting you towards both a certain way to think, a certain way to express yourself and I, and a certain restriction on your behavior and your expression in terms of how you, what, what you say you believe in the future about this kind of law and all kinds of other loans,

Speaker 3:          14:25          but also your subs. You're subscribing to this idea that the system is racist, that the, that the industry and the profession themselves are racist. And that to me that implies hopelessly corrupt. And I, and that shocks me and I don't think I, I want my industry, uh, advertising that unless of course, you know, we've got an issue here and, and it's not entirely clear to me from reading the report that we do. Um, but I, Jordan May have some comments

Speaker 2:          14:52          obviously about writing, writing a statement and the declaration and what that means, but I just find that, you know, having to affirm in a statement that, uh, our industry is, is hopelessly corrupt, is, um, it's not something I'm willing to do at this point. One of the things I've learned after over the last year is that apologizing or admitting guilt to ideologues is an unbelievably dangerous thing to do because all it's taken as, as Bruce Basically alluded to, is a statement of guilt. And you know, the other problem from a psychological perspective is that, and this, this is a very clear psychological literature on this. So, you know, if you have a particular set of philosophical positions, let's say principles, let's call them, and maybe your principles or something like excellence, meritocracy and honesty, which strike me as a better set of principles for lawyers than diversity, equity and inclusiveness.

Speaker 2:          15:46          Not that those aren't, you know, in in certain context and carefully defined. Also important. Um, if you write a statement of principle, especially one that's going to have to pass muster, then what will happen is you will bring your beliefs and your actions in line with that statement of principle. You'll do that unconsciously. And there's a bunch of reasons for that. And one reason is, is that you've now made a coherent and credible argument in favor of that set of principles. And you will find that convincing because articulating yourself in that manner actually changes your character. And the second is, is that it puts you in into a position that's, um, that's, that's often been described as cognitive dissonance, which is one of the most famous findings in, in psychology. And cognitive dissonance is the UN on a pleasant feeling that you get when you're holding two opposing beliefs, let's say at the same time.

Speaker 2:          16:44          And you notice that. And so the cognitive dissonance here would be, well, I'm just going to write this statement of principles. What difference does it make? But however, that is a statement of principles. And so it's, it's intrinsically dishonest and, and character damaging to craft a statement of Principles with which you do not agree. And so then you can either regard yourself as a coward and a liar or you bring your thinking in line with the statement of principles and that the latter thing is what people tend to do. And so, and then the idea that this is just going to sit in some musty, uh, file drawer. That's completely, that's completely naive in my estimation because basically what's happening, and I've seen this happening with the creep of ethics committees on university campuses, is that once you decide that you're guilty and that you're going to abide by a new set of principles, it now becomes incumbent on the law society as a matter of the intrinsic logic of the, of the movement to do things like check you out on a year to year basis to see how your attitude and behavior is. Uh,

Speaker 4:          17:50          actually in keeping with your statement of principles, it's not just going to hang there in the air, it's going to be enforced. And that is part of the transition I would say from the law society, regulating competence, regulating values. I mean it used to be at one point the last study was there to make sure that you had the skills to be able to practice law and as time has gone on there, there, there are overseeing is more and more in the area what it is that you sync and whether or not that thinking is appropriate. And one good comparison of this is the uh, the case involving the Trinity Western Law School of the, the uh, graduates of that law school. So this is a private law school that would be in bridge and they require all their, all their faculty and students to sign on to a pledge that had, contains certain values.

Speaker 4:          18:43          They promised not to do certain things like have premarital sex and, and uh, all kinds of other things. The law society on the basis, I think that it is inappropriate for an institution to impose values upon the people within it have said that they will not license graduates from the possible. Now you might agree or disagree with that perspective, but it is different critical now that what they have done is the same thing essentially except with a different set of values. They have indeed imposed instead of values on the people within their own institution. It's just that they haven't chosen different values, which means that their objection to turn to your question, it was not really at all about the position of the values. They just don't like the values that attorney Western chosen. Yeah. What, it's pretty ironic that the argument would be made that an organization doesn't have the right to impose its value.

Speaker 4:          19:42          So when it's on it's voluntary participants, which we should point out because you certainly don't have to go to Trinity Western or signed the agreement. There's lots of law schools you can go to where he's in this particular situation. You're basically, I mean to say that a gun is pointed to your head is too dramatic obviously, but it's no joke to be faced with it. With the threat of losing your license and also to have to undergo what would essentially be a bureaucratic inquisition and those are not pleasant. Those are seriously not pleasant if you, if you fail to comply. No. And there's other, there's other parts of this before we leave Trinity Western, can we just underline what you just said, which I think is very important, which is that that the law society is essentially an arm of the state. It has coercive power given to it by the state to license lawyers and it is the gatekeeper, so you have no choice. Whereas as, as you said, Jordan, the they association with Trinity Western is entirely voluntary. If you don't want to go to that school, you don't go to that school. And so it's, it's, it's, it's ironic in the extreme that

Speaker 2:          20:48          it is the law society, which is a, which has imposed such a requirement in circumstances that is much more objectionable than the Trinity Western situation. And it's quite, it's quite disconcerting to me to say the least to see that it's actually lawyers that are doing this and that have that and that and that they're not capable of seeing or unwilling to see for some reasons that I don't really understand why that this is an egregious assault on the rights of, of, well I would say of of lawyers in Ontario but also of individual citizens in Canada. It's like the fact that that, that it's lawyers that are involved in this is really, um, I find that much more terrifying in some sense than the unfounded or likely unfounded accusation that the entire, um, profession is racist, which are also, you know, now what are people who are to use the hated word racialized, which is also an ideological term supposed to conclude if all the lawyers in Ontario, um, just go along with this whole, they're really supposed to be able to go into a law firm and trust that their, um, their claims are going to be put forward with, with, with, with fairness and clarity and commitment.

Speaker 2:          22:08          If the whole society is already agreed and the lawyers go along with it, that it's an intrinsically racist association and how is that going to do anything but damage, racial and, and, and sex related. Um, what would you call them? Relationships in Canada. I just can't see that as anything, but you know, it's supposed to be something that brings us together with regards to, let's call it inclusiveness, but I can't see this as anything other than something that's going to be extraordinarily divisive.

Speaker 3:          22:38          Well, interesting. You were, you were raising the issue of, of why are lawyers going along with it or why aren't they recognizing the danger? Um, you know, there was some, some talk about this at the convocation meeting where, where these recommendations were passed. There were some dissenting voices and very, very well put dissenting voices. But um, you know, just within my own professional network, most lawyers don't know what's going on. They got the email. Um, they didn't think anything of it. We get a, you know, 12 of these things a month. It's just an additional requirement, another piece of paper. Now, interesting. What the law society has done when they pushed this requirement out is they also said, by the way, if you need some help completing this statement of declar, uh, statement of principles, we're going to provide two templates that would satisfy us. And of course, 98% of the, the lawyers that I practice with who are our he time grinds, what are they gonna do? They're gonna file it out of their template a or B, get on with their life. And, and so it's one of those things where you've got time pressed lawyers, uh, or, or licensees and you've got a bureaucracy adding a new law, a level of requirement to them, and they're just going to, to, um, go along to get, and

Speaker 2:          23:46          from what I can tell, when I do stop people and ask them about their statement of principles, that's the first time they've actually thought about it. Yeah, go ahead bruce. The fact that as a template, and you can choose between one or up to 10 points. Yeah, that doesn't make it less of a concern. It's actually more, I don't want to overstate this, but this is, it has a lot of similarities to mccarthyism. Yes. Cause I don't statement that you know I am not now nor have I ever been a member of the communist party that that was the templates in the McCarthy era. It's just a template. You have to say certain things and and look how meaningless it becomes in terms of actual substance. If it's a template and you just sign on, then they have literally put words in your mouth and that is the thing that cannot be allowed to happen.

Speaker 2:          24:40          I agree with that. And in a couple of ways. I mean the first thing is is that if they were committed to this in any deep sense, the last thing they would provide was a template because the idea that you can, you can require from people a statement of principles that's of such fundamental import that if it is not crafted properly, you lose your license. And yet that they could produce a template of principles that wouldn't see in some manner apply to everyone equally. It's just, it's absurd. Almost beyond comprehension. I mean, principals actually happened to be important, right? From a psychological perspective, your deepest principles are the axioms from which you generate not only your thoughts and your actions, but your perceptions, your emotional responses and your motivation. It's like there's virtually nothing more important from the perspective of psychological integrity then your principles and to think that those could be reduced to an externally produced template and that that could be imposed as a requirement.

Speaker 2:          25:39          So it would be easier for you is it's like it, it reminds me of the Soviet era where there were templates of guilt, you know, if you were accused of something, regardless of whether you were guilty or not, because that really wasn't very relevant, you'd be required to sign a template of guilt essentially. And that would well, and once you've done that well you were done. And so it's really quite, it's really quite amazing that that from a conceptual philosophical perspective that that sort of thing could even be considered for a moment as, as as acceptable. And it seems to me to be a way of sliding it in under the door. It, as jared pointed out, people are busy. And the other thing is, you know, when I made my first videos objecting to bill, see 16 last year, part of what motivated me was a comment by a colleague and about political correctness on campuses.

Speaker 2:          26:35          And he said, well, you know, the consequence of standing up against it from a personal perspective is extremely, and the probability that your opposition to it is going to have a broad scale. A social consequence is very low. And so the, the logical thing to do, especially if you're pressed for time and, and also if you want to not put your head up above the herd where it can be locked off is to a not notice because you're too busy. And B, because you're isolated as an individual in this circumstance facing a large group. Um, the easiest thing to do, especially when you're concerned with other things, is just to go along with it because you're isolated, right? You don't know if there's other people who, who, who might be feeling uneasy about this. And there's no real way of telling,

Speaker 3:          27:26          well, particularly in our profession, my understanding is that the majority of lawyers in the province of Ontario are generally practicing in a small firm environment, are sole practitioners. And so you're going to have a lot of people standing on an island on their own, in their own practice and they're not going to fully appreciate that this is an issue. Uh, what other people are thinking and they're absolutely going to think that they're putting their head above the heard. Um, so it, it, we have a unique, I think we have a unique industry in that regard.

Speaker 4:          27:52          Well, let's just make it this point at this moment in time, which is that all those lawyers who think that they may be sticking their head out all by themselves are actually not. Because you know, I have certainly heard from a good number of lawyers now who are all extremely concerned, shocked, alarmed at this. So the one thing that we want to overcome is the possible inclination to think that that any lawyer who is concerned about this is an army of one. And that in this situation is not the case. So there, there, there are possibilities here that if, if people do act upon their concerns and, and, uh, decline to comply with this requirement, that the change in this situation actually is a possibility.

Speaker 3:          28:45          Well, bruce, there's also the, the uh, the people that, uh, that we're servicing. I mean, in the private practice world, clients, the clients are going to watch this. They want to know what we're doing. I think they want their, their lawyers to stand up on their principles, if you will, and push back against something. And I think that there's something to be, to be said in terms of your differentiation in the marketplace, particularly in private practice, if you do exactly that. My clients were relying on me to be this bulwark against this type of thing. And I think a lot of lawyers should, uh, should take note of that. That, that there might be something here worth fighting for.

Speaker 4:          29:18          Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, really your, your lawyer credibility is at stake here. You can't stand up and protect herself. When your own fundamental rights are, are, are being threatened, then why should clients believe you have the ability to do so on their map?

Speaker 2:          29:35          No, the inclination to do so. You know, because by swollen we can just hook, line and sinker, let's say an exceeding to what's essentially an ideological demand. Um, then you also brand yourself as an Avatar of that particular radiology. And so that's another reason to not be trusted. You know, that there's the aspect of inability to stand up for yourself or unwillingness to, but then the two to come out as a, as an active agent for this, for this particular set of, of let's call them principles, which, and, and there's absolutely no reason to make the assumption that the whole, the new holy trinity of diversity, equity and inclusiveness constitutes the highest order of moral value. It's, in fact, I think it's an extraordinarily weak argument. If that's the case, there's, there's flaws in it at virtually every level of analysis. So, and it certainly runs contrary to the central themes of, of, of English common law, for example.

Speaker 4:          30:34          So we make note just for a moment, the fact that the law society is playing a little bit close to their chest in the sense that they have not spelled out what the penalty is going to be for those lawyers who declined to, to comply with this requirement. They've only sit and their materials that those lawyers who are not compliance will be advised of their obligations in writing, which of course leaves all the choices open to the law society.

Speaker 3:          31:04          Well, and that was discussed, uh, to some extent at the convocation meeting. There was concerns what happens, what is the recourse here and, and I, I'm left to speculate, but what your obligations are typically is to file what's called the Mendel member's annual report of which this is going to be a component of it by not filling out a portion of your member's annual report. I'm sure that you're going to face at a minimum what's called an administrative processor suspension. And it may even turn into something much larger than that. So, I mean, I'm speculating, but absolutely the Law Society did not make clear what's going to happen if, if somebody decides that they don't want to go along to get along.

Speaker 2:          31:44          Yeah. Well that's also rather troublesome in and of itself, you know, because it's, it's just not reasonable to, to specify a requirement and then leave the penalty undefined. And it smacks of political opportunism from my perspective because it means that the law society hasn't put itself on the line with regards to the degree to which they're going to be draconian about this and then can incrementally, um, introduced the penalties on a per person basis, which is where you would get the least amount of pushback too. Because if you're a professional and then the board goes after you like it's a horrifying experience and especially, you know, it puts your family livelihood and your reputation online and it's very expensive to deal with and time consuming and troublesome and an anxiety provoking and all of those things. So you have someone who's immediately put in a tremendous position of weakness in order to to say push back against this.

Speaker 3:          32:41          When the law society, it's all public as well. So I mean the, the, the role of the law society from what I understand is to protect the public from the big bad lawyers. That's why we are a self regulating industry. And one of the things that, uh, that the law society does is it has, it makes its disciplinary process public. So things like administrative suspensions or, or disciplinary action are things that would be known to the public. So you're out there potentially being tarred and feathered on this thing and people are going to know,

Speaker 2:          33:07          yeah, well and to streamline important for a professional to maintain a pristine reputation. And even the, what, what would you call it? Even the suggestion that you're known in accordance with even an administrative detail with regards to the law society is you can imagine that that's going to put doubt in the mind of anyone who called, knows you or doesn't know you. So that means the process is the punishment. And that's very much the case with these mid level organizations where it seems to me that proclivity for, uh, uh, more totalitarian view of the world is like leaping forward in leaps and or in leaps and bounds.

Speaker 4:          33:47          So, so, so we consider for a moment what we might suggest to all the lawyers who are concerned about this and don't want to go along with the requirement what it is that what we wouldn't suggest that they do. Jared, do you want to take them off?

Speaker 3:          34:03          Well, it seems to be you approach that in your article, the national post in, in a, in a pretty adept way. And that, and my first inclination is that is that you don't file, I mean, the act of filing in itself as we've already discussed is, is half of the admission of guilt, if you will. Um, and I mean, uh, I think that not filing sense sends a good, a good statement, but then, you know, you want to obviously let them know why you're not filing. So perhaps you have to send something that would let them, the law society, the regulator know why you're not filing. I mean those are the things that come to mind and you, you discuss them I think quite well.

Speaker 4:          34:36          So it's what I do too. For them to realize that you didn't just forget, you actually consciously decided that it wasn't a thing that you were going to do. I think that's a very good idea. Yes. I'm kind of short statement but not, I mean, I wouldn't be inclined to suggest that they should draft their own statement of principles that reflects what they actually think, uh, because then they are actually going three quarters of the way of what, of what they've been asked to do. I mean, there's no reason why, even if they've been says something that you believe that you should be filing it. Uh, because it's still forced speech. They're still requiring him to make that statement. So yes.

Speaker 3:          35:15          And it's not a, it's none of their business. And, and I mean, I thought about that myself. I thought maybe you do a google memo, you know, Demora more Google memo, but then I thought, no, you're, you're playing the game. You are, you are declaring your thoughts to, to the regulator. And I think that's reprehensible.

Speaker 2:          35:31          Yes, I agree. They don't have any right to the content of your thoughts, not unless you're to voluntarily put them forward. And that's definitely a difference. A very big difference between, well, the assessment of competence which has already taken place after you've passed the bar and you're in compliance with the, uh, with the regulatory boards requirements and the idea that they should have privileged access to your deepest principles is, I agree that's absolutely reprehensible. There's no excuse for it whatsoever. Whether you, whether you agree with the principles they want you to agree with or not and it's reprehensible.

Speaker 4:          36:06          Yes. Oh yes. Let's emphasize this point. Oh, this is, this is essentially a debate about whether or not those values are, are good or bad or desirable or undesirable. This is about the forced speech first and foremost. But the idea that you can be required to indicate how you feel about them and you agree with some, an endorsement zone, even if you do agree with them and endorse them, the idea that you must have to say so it is, is just not on it. It crosses a line into a dark place that that, uh, does not bode well for the future of freedom of speech in this country. Yes, the rules go ahead and drink

Speaker 2:          36:48          the rules of professional conduct for lawyers, um, already have a rule that requires us to act in accordance with the Human Rights Code and principles of, of uh, um, not to discriminate I guess is the word I'm using. And so clearly our actions are already governed by a code of conduct and, and, and by the legislation generally. So for them to, to request the statement of principles, it really is just asking you to the way you think. And so it's not like,

Speaker 4:          37:19          it's not like this is needed. It's like it's, it's the distinction between your obligation to comply with the law and to state that you agree with the law. Which again, going back to the Supreme Court of Canada is, is our, are two quite different things. I read again what the Supreme Court said on this question. Three court says this, however admirable the objectives and provisions of the law. Maybe no one is obliged to approve of them. Anyone. May criticize them and seek to have them amended or repealed, although complying with them so long as there are ineffective. So this is not a question of whether lawyers are subject to human rights code and antidiscrimination laws. That is, that is not the question here. The question is whether or not you are required to endorse them and say that you agree, which is quite a different thing.

Speaker 2:          38:14          The other thing that disturbs me about this, and I suppose this is a consequence of my experience with delving deeply into the history of places like the Soviet Union in its early stages of development is that there's a class based guilt phenomena that's, that's, that's lurking at the bottom of this too, which is also absolutely I would say terrifying. So let's just say for a moment, although I don't believe this, that there is systemic racism among lawyers defined the way that this sort of thing is defined. Um, but what this requirement, um, implies is that every single lawyer of that group is now guilty of that phenomena, merely sb and merely as a consequence of being a member of that class of people. And you know, there is something, the idea of class based guilt is, well first of all it's the basis for racism itself, right?

Speaker 2:          39:17          So, but it's, it's a terrifying proposition from the perspective of a informed Western individual because one of the bedrock, uh, uh, presuppositions, let's call it a principle of our legal structure, is that you're judged on your guilt or innocence as an individual, not as the member of a class. And believe me, that is not a road we want to walk down because there's, you know, each of us, it might be the members of six or seven different classes and if you look into the history, let's say of those classes, whatever they are, economic, professional, racial, gender based, whatever, the probability that sometime in the past, some members of our so called class did things that were morally reprehensible or illegal is 100% and if we're going to be judged on the basis of the actions taken by people that we didn't even know merely because we happen to be vaguely associated with that group, then we're all guilty of all sorts of terrible things all the time. And that puts us completely in the hands of people who want to make those guilt bay, those group guilt based accusations and that's, that's a very, very bad, it's almost impossible to overstress how bad an idea that is.

Speaker 4:          40:33          Yes, absolutely. I mean there, there is no one that you can't identify who in terms of group association and in terms of of lineage as well. I mean this is also a casting the net back into history to see if you know, which, which group did wrong to, to which group. But of course there, there is no one who doesn't have somewhere in their ancestral lineage, you know, wrongs done by somebody you related to, to some other person. And if, if that is the record is the criteria for guilt as you have said, then everybody is guilty and the whole thing starts to become silicon.

Speaker 2:          41:12          Yes. Well when everyone's guilty that means that the people who hold the right to punishment become all powerful.

Speaker 4:          41:18          Yes. And all discretionary to yes.

Speaker 2:          41:21          That, at least in Soviet Russia, they, they'd prime you up and torture you a bit before they had you swear your statement of a, of principles or your confession, if you will. So, okay. So here's another thing that I thought I might do is I'm going to put together an anonymous list. Um, so that lawyers who are willing to indicate their, um, objections to this requirement can sign up. And that way I can tweet and also stay in contact with you guys on a regular basis, how many signatories I've obtained and I won't make that public. I'll make sure that it's not crackable. And, um, that way it'll help people discover how many other people are also concerned about this and indicate to what degree there might be strength in numbers. And so I'll set that up very carefully and I'll put the link to that in the description of this video. And so I guess we've decided on three potential, um, modes of action and, uh, uh, jareds fundamental suggested, if I remember correctly, was to not file the statement of principle and also write a letter indicating precisely why. And I guess that would be,

Speaker 4:          42:40          well it might be most effective if you filed a piece of paper as your fitness but don't make it a statement just to say on the statement of principles that you object to filing if they can or principles or if they wish to call them. They're more than welcome to just to, just to send in a copy of the it from the National Post. Anything that, anything that indicates that you're not doing this, you haven't just forgotten, but there is a piece of paper that is filed in place of what they've asked for but it is not what they've asked for.

Speaker 2:          43:13          Okay, so that can be very straight forward. That means that it wouldn't necessarily be very time consuming. You could take, you can take the time to delineate why you're opposed to this or you could send to in Nicola more. You could just state that you're opposed to this.

Speaker 4:          43:28          Yeah, I don't think they should go to great lengths. I think it's very simple and they just say something like, this is forced speech and I choose not to comply or send to the column or something, something that that stands for. The proposition that I'm, I'm declining this request. And it can be very short. It does not have to be a full reason. Yeah. I objected to be justifiable.

Speaker 3:          43:56          Most lawyers know how to do that if they've been in a courtroom.

Speaker 2:          43:59          Yes, exactly. Yeah, that's right. It should be, it should be something they're quite accustomed to doing. And so, and then I'll put up this late for the last so that we can start to collect signatories and decide who, and let people know how many people are actually, let's call it philosophically and professionally opposed to this particular set of maneuvers.

Speaker 3:          44:20          And to be clear, we don't, I don't want to know anybody's politics. I don't want to know anything other than are they uncomfortable with the idea of being compelled to do something, uh, to speak something. And I mean, that's, that's important and going to be a lot of people who are concerned about anonymity. And I, I fully respect that. But, but they need to know that there is people out there that are like mindedly objecting to this.

Speaker 4:          44:42          Now, one question obviously that comes up about this and I don't, what do you want to speak to this, but I understand if there have been conversations between lots of various people about whether or not a legal action is a possibility, uh, on this, you'd do you want to just make some very general comments?

Speaker 3:          45:01          I think it's a, I mean it's, it, this may come to a head and I and I have had discussions with, with many people within my own professional network and I'm trying to expand that network and I've had it at least one person, um, very senior lawyer come forward and say, I'm prepared to challenge this. I'm prepared to be the person that takes the slings and arrows, uh, through a challenging process. And, and I mean, I imagine it would have to flow through the law society initially, but at some point you are entitled to, to Judicial Review of, of regulatory decisions. So it would get pushed out into the general court system at some point. Um, but yeah, absolutely it can if, if, if let's say what, there are people that are willing to, to go to the mat for this. And that's what I've been able to a, to discern just within my own network.

Speaker 1:          45:48          Okay.

Speaker 2:          45:48          Well that's reassuring.

Speaker 3:          45:52          Well, it's the way lawyers should be. We're supposed to be objectionable, aren't we?

Speaker 2:          45:57          Is we'll put that feature to good. The good news. Yes. Well that's exactly it. I would say from a temperamental perspective, lawyers are perfectly positioned to do that because they tend to be rather disagreeable and emotionally stable. And so we do the rest of us and I'm speaking as the member of another professional, uh, um, organization. We depend on you guys to be the bull work against any incursions into our essential rights. And if you guys fold and, and, and go along with this, then it's really not a good day for, for the English common law, that's for sure. And I think the English common law is one of the most remarkable achievements of civilization of world civilization. It's an absolute gift and evolved legal system. It works unbelievably well. And to, and to not object to serious challenges to it at a fundamental level means that we deserve whatever restrictions on our freedoms we accrue as a consequence of our cowardice.

Speaker 4:          46:58          And to let that happen when we're really just not paying attention would be the ultimate tragedy.

Speaker 1:          47:05          Okay.
