Speaker 1:          00:00:18       Thank you. So, um, I looked today and these lectures have now been watched by, they've been viewed a million times, so that's pretty amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:00:30       Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       Or they've been, they've been glanced at a million times that might, that's also possible. Alright. So, well let's get right into it. So last week, um, I think was mostly remarkable for the absolute dearth of content that was actually biblically related. So that was, um, I'm, I'll just recap what I laid out so that it sets the frame properly for what we're going to discuss tonight. And I presented you with an elaborated description of, of this diagram essentially, which I spent quite a lot of time formulating for probably about 25 years ago, I guess, which kind of accounts for its graphic primitiveness I suppose. Um, I was really pushing the limits of my four 86 computer to produce that I can tell you. So, and it's, it's, it's a, it's a description representation of the archetypical circumstances of life and, and the archetypical circumstances are the circumstances that are true under all conditions for all time.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       And so you can think about them as descriptively characteristic of the nature of human experience that's not exactly the same as the nature of reality, but because you can, you can divide reality into it's subjective and objective elements and there's utility in doing that, but these sorts of representations don't play that game that they consider human experience as constant constituted constitutive of reality, and that's how we experienced it. And so we'll just go with that. The idea basically is that we always exist inside a damaged structure and that structure is partly biological and it's. It's partly socio-cultural. It's partly what's been handed to us by our, by our ancestors, both practically in terms of infrastructure, but also psychologically in terms of the active learning content of our, of our psyches, and so that would include, for example, our ability to do utilize language and the words that we use and the phrases that we use and the mutual understanding that we developed as a consequence of interacting with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       Architecturally speaking, that structure is always. It's always dad didn't corrupt and the reason it's dead is because it was made by people who are dead and the reason it's corrupt is because things fall apart of their own accord and the fact that people don't aim properly, let's say speeds along that process of degeneration. And so what that means, and I think this is something worth knowing. Maybe I'll try standing back here and see if that problem goes away. Um, what that means is that young people always have a reason to be upset and cynical about the current state of affairs and, and it's that way forever. And, and so it's useful, I think, to consider such consideration search such conceptualizations as the, of the, as the patriarchy in that light because it's an archetypal truth that the social structure is corrupt and incomplete. And, and what that means is that it's something that you have to contend with every moment. It's some sense of your life. It's a, it's a permanent fact of existence. And to be upset that

Speaker 3:          00:04:22       the

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       structure is social structures or even the biological structures within which we live are incomplete and imperfect, is to not take that personally, that that's the worst part of it, to take that personnel personally is a misreading of the existential condition of humankind because it's always the case that what you have been given and what you live in is degenerate and corrupt and in need of repair.

Speaker 1:          00:04:52       And it's easier just to accept that because there's also a positive element and the pause development as well. You've been granted something rather than nothing and maybe you haven't been granted pure hell because especially in a culture like ours where many things actually functioned quite well. So there's room for gratitude there. Even if it's a broken machine, it's not one that's completely devastated and it's not absolutely hell bent on at every second on your misery and destruction. And it easily could be because many societies are like that. And so the fact that we happen to live in one that isn't corrupt beyond imagining is something to be eternally grateful for. While. So we live inside a damage structure and we also bear responsibility for that damage because we don't do everything we can to constantly repair it. And you might say, well that's actually one of the fundamental, you know, people say, well, what's the meaning of life? What they really mean is what's the positive meeting of light? Because as we've already discussed, the negative

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       meanings of life or more or less self evident, well, the positive meaning of life is to be found in noting the state of lack of repair, of the, of the walled city that you inhabit, and then sally being forced to do something about that, to repair the breaches and to fix up the walls and to make the structure that you inhabit as secure and as productive as it possibly can be.

Speaker 3:          00:06:25       And

Speaker 4:          00:06:27       there's no shortage of opportunities to do that. You can do that in your own mind. You can do that in your own room. You can do that in your own household, in your local community, you. And maybe if you get good at doing it at all those levels, then you can start to look beyond that. And so there's challenges. That's the thing that's kind of interesting about this insufficient structure is that it has a set of challenges built into it because of its insufficiency and perhaps even because of its corrupt nature that calls forth the potential response from you of heroic adventure and the heroic adventure is to man the barricades and repair the city. And you can always do that. It doesn't matter what what your personal circumstances are. There's always something that isn't right near you, isn't correct, isn't laid out properly, that you could just fix if you want it to. And one of the things that we're going to talk about tonight is the idea that

Speaker 4:          00:07:28       if you adopt the attitude, an attitude that's like that, that the rule that you should play is to make things better wherever you are. However you can. That what would actually happen would be that things would get better wherever you are in all sorts of ways. And that we've really, as a species you might say, or maybe even as singular individuals we've, we've explored that rarely. It isn't something that's put forth as a proposition that often. And it's quite surprising to me and you know, I had an interesting experience the other day I went to the Gig, I go there because I have food allergies and they're very careful with people who have food allergies. And the waiter took me to the table and he said that he had been watching my lectures and that's a very common experience and he was happy about that and he said that he'd had two promotions out the keg in the last four months because he'd been watching my lectures and like I really found that in affecting experience because, you know, you might say, well, he's working as a waiter at the keg and there's nothing particularly heroic about that.

Speaker 4:          00:08:32       And, and I disagree with that actually because I don't care where you're located, you can do a hell of a job. And I mean that literally at whatever job you have, you can, you can take whatever job you have and you can make it a real nice little piece of absolute misery. Or you can do. You can act like a civilized human being. And notice that no matter where you are, there's a, there's a richness and a complexity that's completely inexhaustible, right at hand, and then you can take that seriously and you can say, well, I happened to be a waiter at the keg and perhaps that's not what I expected. And, and he's a young guy and perhaps that isn't where I want to end up, but it's not nothing, it's a rich environment and I can make it a lot better if I want to.

Speaker 4:          00:09:17       I can get along properly with my coworkers and not gossip behind their back and I can treat my customers properly and if an opportunity comes my way I can take it and I can see what happens. And so he said that's what he had started doing and that things were working out much better for him. He was in a much better job than he was three months ago in three months. That's nothing, right? I mean that's a nice trajectory. It's an uphill trajectory and that's what you want really an uphill trajectory is actually even better than being somewhere good as far as I'm concerned because one of the things that really makes your life meaningful is the clear realization that you're headed somewhere better than you are now. And then it's even better if you also understand that there's a direct causal relationship between the things that you're doing and the steepness of that inclined.

Speaker 4:          00:10:03       And so I get a lot of letters from people like that and they're more, most frequently young men, although not always. And they say, well, you know, I've been listening to these lectures and I decided that I'm going to try to take responsibility for my life. And so I'm, I've started to stop doing all the stupid things that I know that, uh, that are stupid that I know I shouldn't be doing. And I've started doing some of the things that aren't stupid that I know I should be doing, which seems pretty obvious really if you think about it. But it obvious though it may be that isn't necessarily what people do. And then they write and say, you can't believe what difference that makes. And they're thrilled about it. And so I'm thrilled about it when I get letters like that because I really don't experience anything as better than a letter like that or a message like that because it's so good to see things that aren't so good, replaced by something better.

Speaker 4:          00:10:53       And I really do think it's an open question. I truly believe it's an open question. To what degree we could make things better if that's what we actually aimed at doing. You know, in some of the stories that we've, we've covered already that story of Cain and Abel in particular is really an analysis of that problem which is so remarkable that it occurs so, so early in this document. It's such a, such a foundational story. And it basically says, well, there's two modes of being in the world, right? There's one where you adopt the responsibility for living properly, for being properly and you make the sacrifices necessary for doing that. And then everything will flourish properly. And the other one is a pathway of resentment and bitterness and rejection and murder. And genocide, and that just seems exactly right to me. And so if the positive path beckons, if you can actually see what it is, if you can, if you can lower yourself enough to see what it is.

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       Young Carl young set, once that modern people didn't see God because they didn't look low enough. So phrase I really, really like because people denigrate the opportunities that are right in front of them and there's no reason to do that because what's right in front of you is the majesty of being. That's what's right in front of you. It's inexhaustibly complex and full of potential. And there's no reason to assume that wherever you happen to be isn't as good as starting place as anywhere else. Now, you know, I know some people have terrible, terrible lives. They're in situations that are absolutely unbearable and, but I also do know that even situations like that can be made a hell of a lot worse by the bat, by, by, by the worst kind of attitude. That's for sure. So, so anyways, so that's where you are, you're in a damaged structure, you're a damaged structure, you're in a damaged structure, but you know at least it's got some walls, you know you're not being fed to the lions on a regular basis.

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       So that's a good thing and you can, you can emerge forward, know, heroically, magically to confront the chaos that constantly threatens the structure within which you live and you can free something as a consequence of that. You can learn something. You can strengthen yourself. That's the other thing, because the way what you're actually made of in many ways that what informs you, what you're made of is what you encounter when you voluntarily encounter the unknown. And so the more you voluntarily encountered the unknown, the more you get made of and the more you get made of the more there is to you and then the more you're good at encountering the unknown and restructuring order and calling forth proper order out of the potential of being and God, you got to think, why wouldn't you do that? Since you can do that, and it's an endless mystery.

Speaker 4:          00:13:36       You know, I think part of it is that people, well, it's also encapsulated to some degree in the story of Adam and Eve because what happens to Adam is when you become self conscious, right? He, he becomes ashamed of his self in regards himself as a lowly sort of creature and there's endless reasons why people would do that because of course were rife with imperfection and so he hides from God. And I think that's actually the answer to the conundrum, which is that people don't aspire to the highest good because they're deeply ashamed of themselves and their weaknesses and their insufficiencies. And so it's, it's not the only reason. I mean there's, there's the desire to avoid responsibility and there's all the negative motivations as well, like resentment and hatred and the desire to make things worse. I don't want to, you know, give us, given us too much of a break, but, but it's something like that, but it's okay to not be in a very good place if what you're trying to do with that not very good place is make it better.

Speaker 4:          00:14:37       And one of the things I really have learned as a clinical psychologist is that you just cannot believe how powerful incremental progress is you. You can do the calculations like it's like compound interest, you know, if you make your life a 10th of a percent better a week, man in two or three years, you're, you're in such a better place than you were, that it isn't even like the same domain. And if you keep that up for 10 years or 20 years, you know, especially if you're young and you start early, you start to straighten yourself out and, and fix the things that you can fix. You can transform your lives in ways that are completely unimaginable. And God only knows what the upper limit of that is in terms of human possibility. Because we are amazing creatures, you know, when we really get our act together and stopped running at 10 percent of our capacity.

Speaker 4:          00:15:24       So, so, so that's what you do. You've got, you know, the fact that things aren't exactly the way they should be, at least gives you something to do. You know. And that's, that's and, and, and maybe something great to do because there's no shortage of suffering and trouble that besets the world that you could conceivably ameliorate in some way and the utility and meaning the utility of that and the intrinsic meaning of that is self evident. So it also makes me curious about nihilism, for example, in despair, because I mean I understand those emotions and understand them deeply and the intellectual mindset that goes along with it, but they just see beside the point to me in some sense, because there are so many things that need doing that all you really have to do is open your eyes and look at them and then decide that you're actually going to do something about them.

Speaker 4:          00:16:13       And you might think, well, what's within my scope of, of, of influence is so trivial that it's not worth doing. It's like it won't stay trivial for long if you do it not at all. And I don't think it's trivial to begin with. I don't think that any. I really don't believe that anything done right is trivial. And my experience in my life has been that anything I actually did paid off it did didn't pay off necessarily in the way that I expected it to pay off. That's a whole different story. But if it was genuine commitment to do something, even if it went sideways and the outcome was really something other than what I expected, the net consequence over time was nothing but good. So every new frontier that can be conquered is an advance forward and there's no shortage of frontier because we're surrounded by the unknown.

Speaker 4:          00:17:01       We're surrounded by our own ignorance and we can continually move into that domain, into the domain of chaos, or we can restructure pathological order and that's, that's the secret to proper being. And so then you encounter chaos. That way you know, and then you can regard yourself as the sort of entity that despite its insufficiency, has the capability to conquer chaos. Despite the danger of that. That's the other thing, because the fact that you're fragile is actually a precondition for your heroism. Because if you weren't fragile, then there'd be nothing heroic about doing something difficult. Right? Because if you couldn't be hurt or damaged or defeated or or end up in failure, then where's the. Where's the moral courage in the endeavor it had? It has to be that the fragility is built into the courage and so it's not a. it's not a reason not to engage in it at all and in fact quite the contrary and so

Speaker 4:          00:17:57       well and so then you know what do you do while you put the city back together and maybe the way you want it so that it's functional and efficient and beautiful and so the people can flourish there and and and flourish in a manner that makes them, that makes them what w? W, what would you say that makes them feel that the unbearable catastrophe of being is worth it for the experience. That's what you're aiming at and it's not an impossibility. It's not an impossibility, and then not only that, not only do you repair the city when you do that, but you make yourself the sort of thing that continually repairs the city and that's even better. That's the end goal because it's not the repair of the city. That's the goal. It's the transformation of yourself into the thing that continually repairs the city and so there's just no reason for that not to happen and the more it can happen, the better. Well there's A. There's an under current to this story and that is also the story of the flood and that's the fact that you know the city that can become corrupt because people don't engage in heroic endeavor perhaps because they engage in precisely the opposite of that, which is outright destructive behavior and this is also something that's worth considering too because if you. If you, if you consider your your own manner of being, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:19:26       you can say things to people like tell, tell the truth and be good. And those are. Those are cliches obviously and so they lack power because they're cliches, but you can take them apart and utilize them in a manner that stops being a cliche and you do that by being more humble about them. I would say because maybe you can't tell the truth because you don't know what the truth is. But one thing you can do is you can start saying things that you know to be untrue, and you might say, well, how do I know that they're untrue? And the answer to that is, well, you need a whole philosophy of truth, the elaboration of an entire philosophy of truth to answer that question and so we're not going to bother answering that question because in some sense at the moment, it's beside the point that isn't the issue.

Speaker 4:          00:20:09       The issue is there are times in your life where you know that the thing that you're saying is not true. It's a deception. It's a lie of some sort, and you're using it to manipulate yourself or another person or the world and you're also possessed, fully possessed of the idea that you can get away with it. And there's a satanic arrogance about that. If in fact that is the of arrogance that's portrayed in the mythological character of Satan. Because Satan is precisely the archetype of the element of the mind that believes that it can twist and and banned the structure reality without paying the price for that. And you can't imagine anything that's more arrogant than not because really do you really think that you can twist the structure of a reality and that that's going to work out for you without it snapping back?

Speaker 4:          00:20:54       It's so obvious that that can't work, that, that everyone knows it, but anyways, back to the initial point is that you know by, by the rules of the game that you yourself are playing, that some of the Times you're violating the rules of the game that you're playing, and the first issue with regards to say, stating the truth or behaving in a responsible manner would be merely stopped cheating at whatever game it is that you've chosen to play. That's a good start and that'll straightened. That'll straighten out your life. It'll start in the street and start to straighten out your life. And so well the flood. What? How does the flood tie into this? Well, you know, we live in a corrupt structure were corrupt as individuals. We live in a corrupt structure and part of that corruption has just happenstance. It's the way things fall apart. But the other part of it is that not only are we not aiming up, we're actually aiming down and the flood story is a warning and it's a very clear warning, and the warning is if you aim down enough and then if enough of you aimed down at the same time,

Speaker 4:          00:22:02       everything will degenerate into something that's

Speaker 4:          00:22:06       indistinguishable from the chaos from which things emerged at the beginning of time. It's something like that because the, the, the cosmos that's presented in in mythological representations is chaos versus order. Right? The order is on top, you might say in the chaos is always underneath and the chaos can break through or the order can crumble and you can fall into the chaos and that chaos is intermingled, intermingled potential, and the way that you destroy the order and let the chaos rise back up, which, which is exactly how it's portrayed in the flood story, is by

Speaker 4:          00:22:39       well, by inhabiting the corpse of your father. That's one mythological motif and feeding on the remains and with no gratitude and no attempt to replenish what it is that you're taking from and the warning and the flood story is don't do that for very long because things will happen that are so awful you cannot possibly imagine it and that'll happen to you personally and what happened to your family and it'll happen to your community and it's happened to people over and over throughout history and it's quite interesting. You know it's very soon after the story of Cain and Abel. When you see evil enter the world in the story of Adam and Eve, along with self consciousness and evil, there is the ability. That's the knowledge of good and evil. That's the ability to hurt other people, self-consciously, to know what you're doing, and then of course instantly cane takes that to the absolute extreme and he uses that capacity to to destroy really what he loves best.

Speaker 4:          00:23:33       He, he gets as close as a human being can to destroying the divine ideal because of course his brother is able, enabled, is favored by God and and destroys them, which cane tells God at the end of that episode that his punishment is more than he can bear, and I think the reason for that is where are you? Once you destroy your own ideal, what's left for you? There's nowhere to go. There's no op and when there's no APP, there's a lot of down and you know there's an idea that was put forth very nicely in Milton's paradise lost when he was describing from a psychological perspective. Essentially what hell is hell is your inhale to the degree that you're distant from the good, that that might be a good way of thinking about it, and if you destroy your own ideal, which you do with jealousy and resentment and and the desire to pull down people who you would like to be, let's say, then you end up in a situation that's indistinguishable from hell and the way the story, the biblical story unfolds as well.

Speaker 4:          00:24:35       It's, it's, it's Cain and then it's the flood, and so kane adopts this mode of being that's antithetical to being itself, at least a positive being itself. He does it voluntarily. He does it knowing full well what he's doing and the net consequence of this that as it ripples through the entire social structure is that God stands back and says, this whole thing has got so bad. The only thing we can do is wipe it to the ground and that is. That is no joke. That's exactly how things work. And one of the things that's extraordinarily terrifying about that sequence of stories, and I believe this to be true. I think I realized this independently of any of the analysis that I was doing of mythological stories because I looked at what happened in places like the Soviet Union and miles, China and in Nazi Germany and the most penetrating observers of those societies.

Speaker 4:          00:25:26       The people who are most interested in how it was that those absolute catastrophes came about. All said the same thing. It was rooted in the degeneration of the individuals who made up the society. You know, you hear well, people will fault were following orders. It's like no that that explanation doesn't hold water or that you'd be punished if you resisted. While there was some truth in that, but nowhere near as much as people might think, especially at the beginning of the process more it was that people decided each and every one of them to turn a blind eye to the catastrophes and to participate in the lies and that worked the entire societies and they went, as you know, they, they veered their way downward to something as closely approximating hell as you could hope to manage, especially in places like Nazi Germany and well in all three of those places and in China and in the Soviet Union.

Speaker 4:          00:26:15       And so the thing that's so frightening about one of the things that's so frightening about the stories in genesis is they say something very clear, which is that your moral degeneration contributes in no small way to the degeneration of the entire cosmos and you say, well, I would like my life to be meaningful. People say that really? Would you really? You really would like your life to be meaningful. You think maybe people would trade a little nihilism to not have to face that realization, and I think people do that all the time. It's a terrible wait to to to realize, but we are networked together in the price of or let's say that's the vulnerability that's associated with our intense capacity to communicate and it is certainly possible that the ripples of our individual actions have consequences that are far beyond the limits of our immediate consciousness and I also think people know that too.

Speaker 4:          00:27:14       They know that in the way that people know things when they don't want to know them, which means they know them, embodied, they can feel them, they can sense them. They have an emotional response to them, but there's no damn way they're going to let them become articulate because they don't want to know and when you're feeling guilty and ashamed about the things you've done or not done, and I know that can get out of hand as well. It's often because there is a crooked little part of you that's aiming at the worst possible outcome. You know, one of the things you said about the shadow, you know, that young's famous idea that everyone has a dark side and that that dark side needs to be incorporated and made conscious. Young said to the shadow of the human being, reaches all the way to hell, and he actually, that's the thing that's so interesting about interesting about reading Carl young is he actually means what he says.

Speaker 4:          00:28:03       It's not a metaphor. It's like the part of you that's twisted against being is aligned with the part of the cosmos. Let's say the conscious cosmos that's aiming at making everything as terrible as it can possibly be and you know, it's a terrible shock to realize that. It's partly why people don't realize that it's something that people keep at an arm's length. It's, it's the same as recognizing yourself as a Nazi concentration gap camp guard, which is a very useful exercise because there's absolutely no reason why you couldn't have been or still could be one so. And if you think otherwise, then all the more reason for assuming that you would be unable to resist the temptation if it wasn't in fact offered to you. And if you don't think it's a temptation, then the then there's so much that you don't know about human beings that you're not even in the game. Because if it wasn't a temptation, then people bloody well wouldn't have done it. And plenty of people did it. And it's no wonder. So. So things get serious in genesis very, very rapidly. And, and the depth of the seriousness is ultimate archetipal. That's it. It gets as serious as it can get.

Speaker 4:          00:29:22       The story of Noah and the flood opens in a fragmentary manner. And I believe that these passages are part of a longer story, that we only have bits and pieces of it. And also one that's fragmented in its in its.

Speaker 4:          00:29:39       It's parts of more than one story. And it starts like this and it came to pass. When men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose. Now there's an idea there. There's two ways of looking at the past and you can kind of see that in the political landscape that we inhabit. Now on the more conservative end of the spectrum, people regard the past as the land of giants, right? They were the heroes of the past who established the current conditions that we exist and then the people on the left are more concerned perhaps with the, what would you call it, with a lineage of corruption that's come down through the centuries and both of those perspectives are are are accurate.

Speaker 4:          00:30:29       You can say, well, there were there, there were the great heroes of the past who established our modes of being. You can think of them as competent beings if you want. That's fine. That's a perfectly reasonable way of thinking about it and you can also think of the of the accumulation of corruption and evil that's come along the centuries as well, and so you see both of those reflected in these initial few lines that the sons of gods, so those are the heroes. So the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all of which they chose. Then this statement comes in as somewhat of a non sequitur and the Lord said, my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he is also flesh. Yet his days shall be 120 years. And I looked at a variety of interpretations of that line because it doesn't seem to follow so clearly from the previous line and exactly what it means isn't obvious, but it seems to be.

Speaker 4:          00:31:25       The first line talks about the heroes of the past and and this. The second line says, well, wait a second. There's something corrupt about the human mode of being and one of the consequences of that as far as God is concerned, is that there are conditions under which the divine spirit will not strive with man. What? What that means is there are conditions under which let's say the. I don't think there's any other way of putting it is the divine impulse towards the good will abandon you because of things that you've done and then the secondary consideration here is that perhaps because of the disc degeneration of people, it's not so obvious here that our lifespans are limited, that the, that the, that the spirit that inhabits us will only do so for a limited amount of time and that's tangled in a strange way in with the idea of human moral culpability and that's posed against the notion of the giants of the past.

Speaker 4:          00:32:23       And then it returns to the giant idea. That narrative returns to the giant idea and reads. There were giants in the earth in those days and also after that, when the sons of men came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them. The same became mighty men, which were of old men of renown, and that that's the end of that sequence of fragments. It's very broken, but you can see a dual narrative underneath it. And, and one of the narratives is that there's the kind of corruption despite the giant, the nature of the giants of the past. There's the kind of corruption lurking that would cause God to withhold his grace and allow men to deteriorate. And, and that sets the stage for Noah and the flood. And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that the, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. You know, one of the things I really didn't like about going to church when I was a kid, I went to a pretty moderate church. It was the United Church, which has hardly even become a church now. It's so moderate, so to speak. Um, one of the things I didn't like was the constant harping by the ministry on the sinful nature of human beings like it. It didn't speak to me properly, partly because I really didn't understand what it meant. Um, and partly because it seemed

Speaker 4:          00:33:56       well sort of, what would you say was self-flagellating in an an attractive way? I don't know if there is an attractive way to be self-flagellating, but there was, it was, and there was something about it that was also wrote and fake that I didn't like, but you know, in later years I thought about that more and I started to understand that there was some real utility in asking people to keep the evil that they're doing clear and conscious in the forefront of their imagination. I think I mentioned to you guys last week that this little episode from what we know of Mesopotamian culture surrounding the emperor, the New Year's festival, they would take the emperor outside of the walled city and strip him of his

Speaker 4:          00:34:46       garb so that he was reduced to just an ordinary man and then humiliate them richly and then ask him how it was over the last year that he wasn't a spectacular embodiment of Marduk. Marduk was the Mesopotamian daddy who made order out of chaos essentially. And the emperor was supposed to sit and think, okay, well, you know, I'm emperor and everything. I should be doing a good job. Maybe I should even be doing a great job and probably I'm coming up short and a bunch of ways and that actually happens to be important since I'm running the entire show. I should be very, very cognizant of how I'm failing to live up to the ideal. And that is what that call that constant clarion call that's degenerated, I would say an institutional Christianity. That was actually the idea was, look, there's a bunch of ways that you're not being everything you could be and it is not supposed to be a to try to knock you down. Although maybe it's a whip to knock down your pride. The pride that stops you from being aware of your insufficiencies. It's more like a call to the opposite. It's like, well, you should stop doing those things because you could be so much more than you are and that would be so much better for you and everyone else. That is just. It's just not good that you continue doing these things. Continue Breaking your own rules, let's say,

Speaker 4:          00:36:03       because we could certainly, as I said, we could start this game by assuming that you should at least play the game that you're playing straight and so, and it is the case that if you watch yourself, it's a terrifying thing to do. But if you watch yourself, you'll see you lie a lot. Like when I learned this to begin with, I was in my twenties and I was. I'm a smart person and I was very proud of that because I was also a small person. I was moved ahead one year in school and I was a small person

Speaker 4:          00:36:35       to begin with. And so as a very small person in my classes and also very mouthy, which might not come as much of a surprise and somewhat provocative. And so you know, and I got pushed around a fair bit because pete, everybody gets pushed around and my weapon was to be mouthy and it was a fairly effective weapon. Although tended to backfire because, you know, if you're really effectively mouthy with large, obnoxious people, then they tend to respond in a relatively negative physical way. And so that sort of thing was happening to me a fair bit and but I was quite, I was quite proud of the fact that I was, that I, I was, I had some intellectual power

Speaker 5:          00:37:13       and

Speaker 4:          00:37:16       darn it was then in my twenties when I learned about some of the danger of that because I started to read partly Milton's paradise lost and I started to understand the, the danger of the intellect and the danger of the intellect as far as I can tell, is that it tends towards pride and arrogance and it also tends to fall in love with its own productions. And so that's actually Lucifer in, in, in, in paradise lost. That's Lucifer. Lucifer is the intellect that falls in love with its own productions and then assumes that there's nothing outside of what it thinks. That's the totalitarian mentality, right? It's like we have a total system and we know how everything works and we're gonna implement it and that'll bring about heaven on earth. Right? That's that say that. That's the totalitarian mindset and that's associated with intellectual arrogance and

Speaker 4:          00:38:05       another at the same time. Another thing that was happening to me, so I was noticing that I started to understand what that meant and I also started to understand that there was more to life than the intellect, much more because I smoked too much and I drank too much and I weighed like 130 pounds. I wasn't in good physical shape and like I had a lot of things to do when I went to graduate school to put myself together and at the same time I was trying to understand why things had gone so crazily wrong with the world. It's encapsulation in the cold and what role I might be playing in that, if any, or what role any of us were playing in that. Um, at the same time I was working at a prison only a little bit. I worked with this crazy psychologist.

Speaker 4:          00:38:51       Um, he, he used to put jokes on is multiple choice tests. Uh, he was a really eccentric guy, but I really liked his courses. He and he, he taught a course on creativity and he was also a prison psychologist and he was an eccentric guy and he for some reason liked me and maybe because I was eccentric to and he invited me to go out to the Edmonton maximum security prison with them a couple of times, which I did. And that was a very interesting experience because I was trying to figure out what role each individual's behavior bore to the pathology of the group with something like that. And I went out there and I met a little guy smaller than me. I was a little bigger by then and he was a pretty innocuous guy. And uh, what had happened was I was out in this gymnasium, it looks like a high school, the prison, which is really quite telling in my estimation, but, and there were all these like monsters in their weight weightlifting and like they were monsters.

Speaker 4:          00:39:51       I remember one guy who was tattooed everywhere and he had like a huge scar running down the middle of his chest. It looked like someone had to hit them with an ax and you know, and, and I was in there and I had this Weird Cape that I used to wear that I bought and Portugal and some boots that went along with it and yeah, it was like an 1890 sherlock Holmes Cape and it was really like, it was from the eighties and nineties because this little village was up on a hill. It was a walled city on a hill and they sold these things and I don't think they changed the style since 1890. And so I thought they were really cool and so I was wearing that, which wasn't perhaps the most conservative garb to dawn if you're going to wear, if you're going to go to a maximum security prison.

Speaker 4:          00:40:32       So anyways, I was in the gymnasium and the psychologist, the psychologist left and God only knows. I mean that's what he was like. And all these guys came around. All these guys came around me, you know, and they were offering to trade their prison clothes for my cape and he was like, I was being made an offer. I couldn't refuse, you know, and so I didn't, I didn't really know what to do and then this little guy said something like that, the psychologist sent me to come and take you away or something like that. And so I thought, well better this little guy then all these monsters. So we went outside the gym through some doors, like school doors. We had outside the gym into the exercise yard I guess, and we're wandering along and he was talking to me and he seemed like a kind of an innocuous guy. And then the psychologist showed up at the door and motioned us back and so, which was kind of a relief. And so I went into his office and he said, you know, that guy that you walked out in the yard with? And I said, yeah. He said he, uh, he took two cops one night and he had them kneel down and while they were begging for their lives, he shot them both in the back

Speaker 5:          00:41:40       they had. And I thought, hmm. That's.

Speaker 4:          00:41:47       See, the thing that was so interesting was that he was so innocuous, right? Because what you'd hope is that someone like that would be very much unlike you, let's say, and certainly wouldn't be like somewhat innocuous that you'd met. What you'd want is that the guy would be like, you know, half world wolf and half vampire so you could just tell right away that he was a cold blooded killer. But no, he was this sort of ineffectual little guy who was certainly not ineffectual if you gave him a revolver and the upper hand. And so. So that made me think that made me think a lot about the relationship between being innocuous and being dangerous. And then another thing happened. I met another guy out there and then a week or two later I heard that he and a friend of his head held another guy down and pulverized his left leg with a lead pipe, like just

Speaker 4:          00:42:36       pulverized it. And the reason for that was that they thought that he was a snitch and maybe he was. And that that time I did something different instead of being shocked and horrified by that. Although I certainly was. I thought, how in the world could you do that? Because I didn't think I could do that, hey, I didn't think that. I thought that there was a qualitative distinction between me and those people and so I spent about two weeks trying to see if I could figure out under what conditions I could do that, like what kind of psychological transformation I would have to undergo to be able to do that. And so that was a meditative exercise, let's say, and it only took about 10 days for me to realize that not only could I do that, that it would be a hell of a lot easier than I thought it would be.

Speaker 4:          00:43:21       And that's sort of where that wall between me and what you describe is the shadow started to fall apart and that also was very useful because I started to wreck. I started to treat myself as somewhat different entity because I hadn't been aware up to that point, you know, because I thought I was a good guy and there's no reason for me to think that because you're not a good guy unless you really made a bloody effort to be a good guy. You're just not. It's not easy and so you're probably a moderately bad guy and that's a long ways from being an absolutely horrible guy, but it's also a long ways from being a good guy and so, but I had a little more respect for myself after that because I also understood that there was a monstrous element to the human psyche that re that you needed to respect and that was part of you that you should regard yourself in some sense as a loaded weapon. It's very useful around children to regard yourself as a loaded weapon because around children you are a loaded weapon and the terrible experiences that many children have with their parents are testament to that.

Speaker 5:          00:44:26       Anyways,

Speaker 4:          00:44:27       about the same time, I don't exactly how these things were causally related. I guess it was because I was trying to figure out who I was and how that could be fixed. Something like that. I started to pay very careful attention to what I was saying. I don't know if that happened voluntarily or involuntarily, but I could feel a sort of split developing in my psyche and the split and I've actually had students tell me the same thing has happened to them after they've listened to some of the material that, that I've been describing to all of you, but split into two, let's say. And one part was the, let's say the old me that was talking a lot and that liked to argue and that liked ideas and there was another part that was watching that part, like just with it's eyes open and neutrally judging and the part that was neutrally judging was watching the part that was talking and going, that isn't your idea.

Speaker 4:          00:45:30       You don't really believe that you don't really know what you're talking about. That isn't true. And I thought, hmm, that's really interesting. So now, and that was happening to like 95 percent of what I was saying and so then I didn't really know what to do. I thought, okay, this is strange, so maybe I've, I've fragmented and that's just not a good thing at all. I mean, it wasn't like it was hearing voices or anything like that. I mean, it wasn't like that. It was, it was. Well, people have multiple parts, so then I had a weird conundrum. It's like, well, which of those two things are me? Is it the part that's listening and saying, no, that's rubbish. That's a lie. That's you're doing that to impress people. You're just trying to win the argument, you know, was that me or was the part that was going about my normal verbal business?

Speaker 4:          00:46:18       Me and I didn't know, but I decided I would go with the critic and then what I tried to do, what I learned to do I think was to stop saying things that made me weak and now that I mean I'm still trying to do that because I'm always feeling when I talk, whether or not the words that I'm saying are either making me a align or making me come apart, and I think the alignment. I really do think the alignment is. I think alignment is the right way of conceptualizing it because I think if you say things that are as true as you can say them, let's say, then they come up, they come out of the depths inside of you because we don't know where it thoughts come from. We don't know how far down into your substructure. The thoughts emerge. We don't know what processes have physiological alignment are necessary for you to speak from the core of your being.

Speaker 4:          00:47:10       We don't understand any of that. We don't even conceptualize that, but I believe that you can feel that and I learned some of that from reading Carl Rogers, by the way, who's a great clinician because he talked about mental health in part as a coherence between the, the, the spiritual or the or the abstract and the physical that the two things were aligned and, and there's a lot of idea of alignment in, in psychoanalytic and clinical thinking. But anyways, I decided that I would start practicing not saying things that would make me weak. And what happened was that I had to stop saying almost everything that I was sick. I would say 95 percent of it as a hell of a shock to wake up and mean. This was over a few months, but it's a hell of a shock to wake up and realize that you're mostly dead wood.

Speaker 4:          00:47:56       It's a shock, you know, and you might think, well, do you really want all of that to burn off? It's like, well, there's nothing left, but a little husk, five percent of you. It's like, well, if that five percent is solid, then maybe that's exactly what you want to have happen. Well, so I told you that story is an elaboration of this line, and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagine have the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually to question worth asking just exactly what are your motives? Well, you know, maybe they're purer than mine were and it's certainly possible. I don't think that I'm naturally a particularly good person. I think I have to work at it very, very hard and I don't necessarily think that everyone is like that, but some people are worse than that.

Speaker 4:          00:48:46       And everyone's like that to some degree. So it's worth thinking about just how much trouble are you trying to cause, you know, and the other thing you might think about is that if you're not doing something important with your life by your own definition, because that's the game that we're playing, you get to define the terms at least initially, maybe you're prone to cause trouble just because you don't have anything better to do because at least it's trouble is more interesting than boring. You know, that's something you learn if you read Dostoevsky, does Tsq knew that extraordinarily well? And so if you're not doing something, if you're not pushing yourself to the limits of your capacity, then you have plenty of leftover. What would you say will power, energy and resources to devote to causing interesting trouble? And so well. So I would say this is also an archetypal scenario.

Speaker 4:          00:49:37       God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. That's something to meditate on and it's not self destructive because what it is, is an attempt to. It's like the diagnosis of an illness. It's like if that does happen to be the case for you or to some degree, maybe it's only 10 percent of you or something, or maybe it's 90 percent. Well then coming to terms with that is excellent because then maybe you can start doing it and what would be the downside to that? You'd have to give up your resentment, obviously in your hatred and all of that, and that's really annoying because those emotions are very. They're easy to engage in in there and they're engaging and they have this feeling of self righteousness with them and that goes along with them, but you're not doing this. In order to put yourself down. You're doing this in order to separate the wheat from the chaff and to leave everything that you don't have to be behind,

Speaker 4:          00:50:40       and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart, and the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I've created from the face of the earth, both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for repentance. Me That I've made them. What's the idea? Well, the idea is that the cosmos that God created has become corrupt, and that's a funny thing because you know this is the other thing about genesis that always hits me, is that that's also true. I told you that the Mesopotamians believed that human beings were made out of the blood of king, knew who was the worst monster monster. That the dragon of chaos could imagine. That's a pretty harsh diagnosis, but, but the reason the Mesopotamians believed that is because they knew as did the authors of Genesis, that human beings are the only creatures in the cosmos. Let's say the cosmos of being who are actually capable of deceit, conscious deceit, and malevolence, and the question is, to what degree does the expression of that conscious deceit and malevolence corrupt things so badly that it would be better that they didn't exist at all?

Speaker 4:          00:51:50       Well, you see stories. There's a story associated with this in the epic of Gilgamesh, associated with the flood that has exactly the same underlying narrative structure. In fact, some people think the story of Noah was derived from it, where the gods who created repented of their creation and determined that erasing it would be better than allowing it to propagate. And you see the same thing in the Mesopotamian creation myth. Enuma elish because the early gods, so they're representatives of, of the giants of humanity, I would say, make so much noise and are so careless that the original creator God timeout in her concert time, Matt decides to wipe them from the face of the earth. And so when you read something like this, if you read it from an informed historical perspective, it starts to have a depth that makes it transcend the sort of archaic and fairy tale like element of the story. It's like I've read some very terrible things about what happened in Nazi Germany and what happened when the Japanese invaded China and just what happened generally in the history of mankind.

Speaker 4:          00:53:07       Things can get so bad that it takes the imagination of a very bad person to conceptualize them and when they get that bad, this is the only kind of language that works to describe them. You know, that's another thing that I've discovered working with my clinical clients is when their lives are really not going well, you know, when they're close to suicide or when they're close to homicide or when there are things going on in the family that are so corrupt and terrible that they reached back generations and they're aimed at nothing but misery and destruction. The only language that suffices has a religious tone because there's nothing else that's available to describe what's happening with the proper level of seriousness. And it might be that you've never encountered a situation that required that level of seriousness, but that doesn't mean that those situations don't exist.

Speaker 4:          00:54:02       They exist. You generally do everything you can to avoid being ensconced in them, but they certainly do exist in the probability that you'll encounter a situation like that. Or two, at some point in your life is extraordinarily high. You'll tangle with someone who's malevolent right to the core, and maybe it'll be you that is, and that'll be a big shock. And then these sorts of things, these sorts of poetic descriptors start to become much more real. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations. And Noah walked with God. That's an interesting line because if you remember back in the story of Adam and Eve, what happens to Adam once he eats the fruit of the tree, of the knowledge of good and evil and wakes up the scales fall from his eyes, become self conscious, develops the knowledge of good and evil is he won't walk with God when God calls him in the garden and so noah is Adam without the fall essentially, and there's something that Noah was doing right that

Speaker 4:          00:55:10       motivates God to spare him or maybe to show him a pathway through the emergent chaos, something like that, and that's worth thinking about a lot because there will be situations in your life where what you face is the emergent chaos and maybe that'll be some terrible catastrophe inside your family or maybe it'll be something that's occurring on a much broader social level, but the chaos is coming and what you're going to want to know. Unless you want to be a dentist and have the chaos or even a contributor to it and perhaps that is what you want. Because many people under those circumstances choose that. What you want is to know how you build an Ark and get through it. That's what you. If you're, if you're interested in life, if you're interested in proper being and you're disinclined to produce any more suffering, the necessary, then you want to know how to conduct yourself when the catastrophe comes so that you have a reasonable possibility of of moving through it and starting a new. So when when this old story says, well, God's not happy and he's going to wipe everything out. It's like, well, you might want to take that seriously

Speaker 4:          00:56:31       and then when it says, but there's one person who had a motive being that protected him from that. That's also something you might want to take seriously because you might want to know what that mode of being is because you might need to use it, and so these sorts of things are practical in the deepest possible sense. They're real in the deepest possible sense and practical in the deepest possible sense. So Noah walked with God. Now I'm going to switch way ahead here because I said at the beginning of the lecture series that the Bible is a hyperlinked text and everything refers to everything else and so there's utility in reading it in linear order, but it's not a linear document. It's a document that

Speaker 4:          00:57:17       that you can move through in an infinite number of. There's an infinite number of pathways that you can use to walk through it and all of the document expands upon and refers to all of the rest of the document and so I'm going to search switch to the sermon on the mount, which I think is probably the key document in the New Testament and I'm going to switch to it because I think it's the closest thing we have to a fully articulated description of what it would mean to walk with God so that you're in the Ark. When the flood comes. It's the. It's the most fully articulated realization of that idea that that leaps out of the metaphorical. Because if I say, well, you should conduct yourself like, no, and walk with God and build an Ark. Obviously those are poetic and metaphorical suggestions and it's not that easy to bring them into practice, right?

Speaker 4:          00:58:13       It's the distance. There's a big distance between you and the archetype. It isn't obvious how to manifest it in your own life and what has to happen is the archetype has to be differentiated in articulated so that it becomes sufficiently practical and personal so that you can actually implement it. So I'm going to take apart some of the sermon on the mount. It starts in Matthew five and I'm not going to talk about Matthew Five. I'm going to talk about the end of Matthew six and most of matthew seven. Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil. Not Neither do they spin, and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

Speaker 4:          00:58:55       Wherefore, if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you. Oh Ye of little faith. Therefore, take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be closed? Those are famous lines and that sort of Christ the Hippie, right? It's like, Hey, let it all hang out. It's an old phrase, do your thing and everything will come to you and these lines have been interpreted in that manner many times, but that's seriously not the proper interpretation because there's a kicker with this injunction and the kicker is this, for your heavenly father knows that you have need of all these things, but seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you. That's a lot different than the hippie thing, right? Because there's a very, very, very interesting idea here. It's, it's certainly one of the most profound ideas that I've ever encountered and the idea is this, is that if you configure your life so that what you are genuinely doing is aiming at the highest possible good, then the things that you need to

Speaker 4:          01:00:20       to survive and to thrive on a day to day basis will deliver themselves to you. That's a hypothesis and it's not some simple hypothesis, right? Because what it basically says is if you dare to do the most difficult thing that you can conceptualize, your life will work out better than it will. If you do anything else. Well, how are you going to find out if that's true? Well, it's a Kierkegaardian leap of faith. There is no way you're gonna. Find out whether or not that's true unless you do it so no, no one can tell you either because just because it works for someone else. I mean that's interesting and all that, but it's no proof that it'll work for you. You have to be all in in this game, and so the idea is seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness. It's like that's actually a fairly important caution when you're talking about not having to pay attention to what you're going to eat or what you're going to where it's like what it's essentially saying is that those problems are trivial in comparison and the probability is that if you manifest yourself properly in the world, that those things will come your way is extraordinarily high and I believe, I believe that that's exactly right.

Speaker 4:          01:01:30       I mean, I, I've, I've watched people operate in the world and I would say that there is no more effective way of operating in the world then to conceptualize the highest good that you can and then strive to attain it. There's no more practical pathway to the kind of success that you could have if you actually knew what success was. And so that's what this, that's what this sermon is attempting to,

Speaker 4:          01:02:02       to pause it. It's like in, in the story of Pinocchio. You know what happens at the beginning of the story of Pinocchio is that Japan auto wishes on a star. We talked about that a little bit and so what you pedal does is align himself with the metaphorical manifestation, the highest good he can conceptualize and say, he says he makes sure he makes a commitment. Let's say he aims at the star and for him the star is the possibility that he can take his creation, a puppet whose strings are being pulled by unseen forces and have it transform into something that's our economists and real.

Speaker 3:          01:02:43       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:02:43       well that's a hell of an ambition. You know when we're wise enough to put that into children's movie, but too foolish to understand what it means. It's such an interesting juxtaposition that that we can both know that and not know it. At the same time you can go to the movie, you can watch it and it makes sense, but that doesn't mean that you can go home and think, well, I know what that meant. While people are complicated, right? We exist at different levels and all the levels don't communicate with one another, but. But the movie is a hypothesis and the hypothesis is there's no better pathway to self realization and the enablement of being than to pause it. The highest good that you can conceive of and commit yourself to it. And then you might also ask yourself, and this is definitely worth asking, is do you really have anything better to do? And if you don't, well why would you do anything else? Therefore take no thought for the morrow, for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. I spend a long time trying to figure out what that man to because it's another one of those lines

Speaker 4:          01:03:50       can easily be read as pro grasshopper and anti amped. You know, you remember the old fable of the grasshopper and the end. Maybe not, I'm not going to tell it, but that works. And the grasshopper fiddles and the aunt has a pretty good time in the winter and the grasshopper dies. And so this is like a pro grasshopper line, but it's not because it says something else. It says that if you orient yourself properly

Speaker 4:          01:04:19       and then pay attention to what you do every day that works and it. I actually think that that's in accordance with what with what we have come to understand about human perception because what happens is that the world shifts itself around your aim because you're. You're a creature that has an aim. You have to have an ame in order to do something. You're aiming creature. You look at a point and you move towards it. It's built right into you and so you have a name. Well, let's say your aim is the highest possible ame. Well then so that sets up the world around you. It, it organizes all of your perceptions. It organizes what you see and you don't see. It organizes your emotions and your motivations. So you organize yourself around that aim and then what happens is the day manifests itself as a set of challenges and problems and if you solve them properly, then you stay on the pathway towards that eighth and you can concentrate on the, on the, on the day, and so that way you get to have your cake. And eat it because you can, you can point into the distance, the far distance and you can live in the day

Speaker 4:          01:05:25       and it seems to me that that's. That makes every moment of the day supercharged with meaning that that's because if everything that you're doing everyday is related to the highest possible aim, that you can conceptualize, well, that's the very definition of the meaning that would sustain you in your life well, and then the issue is well back to Noah, well all hell is about to break loose and chaos is coming. It's like when that's happening in your life, you might want to be doing something that you regard as truly worthwhile because that's what will keep you afloat when, when everything is flooded and you don't want to wait until the flood comes to start doing that. Because if you're arcs half built and you don't know how to captain it, the probability is very high that that you'll drown. Take therefore no thought for the moral, but for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself, sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. That's not a particularly optimistic formulation, judge, not that you be not judged for with what judgment you judge. You shall be judged and with what measure you meet. It shall be measured to you. Again,

Speaker 4:          01:06:45       to sensible piece of. It's a sensible description. I wouldn't call it a piece of advice because I don't think that any of this is advice. It's a description of the structure of reality that's not the same as advice and it basically says that you'll be held accountable by the rules of the game that you choose to play

Speaker 4:          01:07:03       and that I also think is perfectly in keeping with what we understand about human psychology because you you are playing. You have to play a game that other people will allow you to play and that will cooperate with you while you're playing and that will compete with you while you're playing it, but you have a fair bit of flexibility in setting up the parameters of the game, but you don't have any choice about whether or not you're going to be in a game. You're in a game and you're going to be held accountable by the rules of the game because that's how the game works and so you might want to pick a game by whose rules you would be willing to be held accountable and why be hold us Dow, the moat that isn't my brother's eye, but consider it's not the beam that is in dire or how will you say to that, I brother, let me pull out the motive out of the Nih and behold, a beam is in nine Onei. What you might be wondering, what a b medicine, a moat is, the dust speck and a beam is a very large piece of lumber and so the issue is

Speaker 4:          01:08:07       not so much the blindness of others even though there's as much blindness among others as there is as there is for you. But the issue here, the advice here, the description here is you should be concerned about what's interfering with your own vision first and you should leave other people. The hell alone in relationship to that. And so if you're a mode of being in the world is if you would just act better, things would improve for me. Or if you identify the evil and the catastrophe is something that's outside that someone else needs to fix or that someone's responded to someone else's responsible for, then then you're not going to fix that and you're going to remain blind to the things that you're doing and not doing that make things not go well. And so it's just better to think, all right, I'm probably blind in many, many ways and maybe there are some ways that I could rectify that because it's highly probable that you're blind and all sorts of ways. I mean it's, it's in fact it's virtually certain and so it's just more useful to think,

Speaker 4:          01:09:21       how is it that I'm wrong in this situation? I'll tell you something that I learned to do when I was arguing with my wife, which happened quite frequently. Because when you actually communicate with people, you find out that there's many things that you don't agree on and that's because you are actually different creatures. And so if you're actually going to have a truthful conversation, then you're going to find out that you don't see things the same way and then you can either pretend that that's not the case in gloss over it and then ended up in a 30 year silent war or you can or you can have the damn fight when you need to have it and see if you can straighten it out. So now and then we'd get into a situation where we were at loggerheads, we couldn't move and it would spiral up into hate speech, let's say, because yeah, everyone laughs because they know they manifest plenty of hate speech towards those they love. So one of the things we learned to do was when we hit an impasse was to separate and to go our own ways and to go sit and think, okay, look, we're at this

Speaker 4:          01:10:28       unpleasant situation. We can't figure out how to move forward. I'd always think, of course it's her fault. Obviously it's her fault. Least Ninety five percent. But maybe there was something I did that contributed like five percent to it. And so I would sit and think and ask myself a question, which was, is there anything I did in the last six months that increase the probability that this impasse would manifest itself? And I'll tell you, you have no idea how fast your mind will generate an answer to a question like that because there's undoubtedly some idiotic thing that you did that you know, that you remember, that increased the probability that you're going to have your hands around the throat of the person that you love. And then you can go tell them that and then you can have a conversation, especially if they do the same thing.

Speaker 4:          01:11:19       Say, look, you know, here's how I'm an idiot in this situation. Now there person says, well, yeah, it's, here's how I'm an idiot, and then your two idiots and then maybe you can have a conversation. So thou hypocrite first cast out the beam of light out of I know, and I, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote of my brothers. I, that's pay hard to argue with that ask. And it shall be given you. Seek and Ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that Asketh receive it and he that seeketh findeth and to him that hath it shall be opened. That sounded pretty optimistic again, but, but again, I think it's a description of the structure of existential reality and and by, by which I mean

Speaker 4:          01:12:07       when I'm in my clinical practice and I observe and this is also the case with my students, is let's say people's lives aren't what they would like them to be. And so then you ask why? Well, forget about tragedy and catastrophe because that's self evident and we're not gonna discuss that. Although the degree to which you bring about your own tragedy is always indeterminant, but I would never say that every terrible thing that is visited on a person is something they deserved. I think that that's a very dangerous presupposition, especially because everyone gets sick and everyone dies, but one of the main reasons that people don't get what they want is because they don't actually figure out what it is and the probability that you're going to get. What would be good for you. Let's say, which would even be better than what you want, right? Because you know, you might be wrong about what you want easily, but maybe you could get. What would really be good for you? Well, why don't you. Well, because you don't try. You don't think, okay,

Speaker 4:          01:13:14       here's what I would like if I could have it and I don't mean I don't mean in a way that you manipulate the world to force it to deliver you good for status or something like that. That isn't what I mean. I mean something like imagine that you were taking care of yourself like you were someone you actually cared for and then you thought, okay, I am caring for this person. I would like things to go as well for them as possible. What would their life have to be like in order for that to be the case where people don't do that? They don't sit down and think, all right, know, let's, let's figure it out. You're, you've got a life. It's hard. Obviously. It's like three years from now you can have what you need. You got to be careful about it. You can't have everything you can have, what would be good for you, but you have to figure out what it is and then you have to aim at it.

Speaker 4:          01:14:03       Well, my experience with people as being as if they figure out what it is that would be good for them and then they aim at it, then they get it and it's strange because they don't know. It's a strange thing. It's not quite that simple because you know you may formulate an idea about what would be good for you and then you take 10 steps towards that and you find out that your formulation was a bit off and so you have to reformulate your goal. So you're kind of going like this as you move towards the goal. But a huge part of the reason that people fail is because they don't ever set up the criteria for success. And so since success is a very narrow line in very unlikely, the probability that you're going to stumble on it randomly is zero. And so if there's a proposition here in the proposition is if you actually want something, you can have it.

Speaker 4:          01:14:53       Now the question then would be, well, what do you mean by actually want? And the answer is that you reorient your life in every possible way to make the probability that that will occur as certain as possible and that's a sacrificial idea, right? It's like you don't get everything. Obviously you obviously, but maybe you can have what you need and maybe all you have to do to get it is ask, but asking isn't a whim or today's wish. It's like you have to be deadly serious about it. You have to think, okay, like I'm taking stock of myself and if I was going to live properly in the world and I was going to set myself up such that being would justify itself in my estimation, and I don't mean as a harsh judge exactly what is it that I would aim at? Well, one of the things I've found is that in test of this theory, let's say you can try this. This is a form of prayer knocking. Sit on your bed one day and ask yourself, what's what remarkably stupid things am I doing on a regular basis to absolutely screw up my life, and if you actually asked that question, but you have to want to know the answer, right, because that's actually what asking the question means. It doesn't mean just mouthing the words. It means you have to decide that you want to know. You'll figure that out so fast. It'll make your hair curl.

Speaker 4:          01:16:28       It's as if young thought about this, he saw it. He thought that people had two poles of consciousness in one was the individual consciousness that we each identify within. The other was something he called the self and the self is the. You might think about it as the divine within. That's close enough approximation. It's the universal part of your consciousness. It's your conscience. That's another way of thinking about it. Whatever your conscience is, but it's something that you can consult. It's like the Socratic Damon. Socrates said that the thing that made him different than everyone else in Greece was that he consulted his demon, his genius. He asked himself how it was that he should conduct himself in the world, and then he did that, whatever it was, he didn't try to force a solution. You know, he didn't try to force a solution. Selfishly, he asked, I'm going to manifest myself in the best possible manner in the world. I would like to do that. What would that be? While you're perfectly capable of thinking, God only knows how you're perfectly capable of immense feats of imagination and dreams and fantasies. God only knows how you do all of that. What would happen if you consulted yourself about the best possible outcome for you? You might get an answer, well, that's what this proposition is

Speaker 4:          01:17:49       have or what man is the review. Who if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent if he then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children. How much more shall your father, which is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him, well, this is a question about the fundamental nature of being, I suppose and one of the hypotheses in the new testament which is different. It's a different hypothesis in some sense than the one that structures the old testament is that faith bakes being good. It's a very interesting proposition and so the notion would be, and it it's an action oriented issue as well. You act out the proposition that if you act properly in the world, that being will reveal itself to you as benevolent, but you will not know. You'll never know unless you do it. So this is a call to that. Act out the proposition that if you act properly, that being itself is benevolent. There's no reason to assume the contrary. I mean to assume the contrary. It would be to be as cynical and bitter as possible and it's not like we don't have reason for that. It's not like I don't understand why that happens to people.

Speaker 4:          01:19:15       Therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you. Do you even, so to them for this as the law and the prophets and that's a reciprocity issue, right? It's like while imagine what would be. This is another thing I learned from young because young reverse this because this is often read, it's the golden rule. It's often read is be nice to be nice to other people. It's like that is not what this rule means. It doesn't mean that even a little bit it means something like and we'll reverse it so that will concentrate on you rather than the other person to begin with. It means something like conceptualize how things could be great if they were great for you, if you were taking care of yourself and then work to make that the case for everyone else. You know? You see that in Buddhism because Buddha reached Nirvana, right? That's the theory and then he. He was tempted with offer to stay there and he rejected that offer and came back to the profane world because he felt that the attainment of nirvana was insufficient unless everyone attained it simultaneously and so it's something like that, but it's treat yourself properly. That's a hard thing to do because you're a fallen, shameful, cowardly, deceitful, malevolent,

Speaker 4:          01:20:41       mortal creature, and so it's not easy and you know it and it's not easy to treat something like that properly and and, and it isn't obvious that people treat themselves better than they treat other people. I don't think that's obvious at all, but maybe you could start with yourself and think, okay, I'm going to take care of myself as if I have value. What would that look like and then I'm going to work to extend that courtesy to everyone else. And that's. Well, the hypothesis here is that if you take all of the moral wisdom that mankind has generated over, it's millennia of struggle, evolved and then manifested metaphor, story and then codified into law, articulated law, and you pick one principle that dominated all of that. This would be the principal

Speaker 4:          01:21:36       and it's interesting too because it's the law and the prophets and the law is the rules, but the prophets or the process by which the rules are being updated, right? So the profits are a superordinate in some sense to the law and the proposition that set forth in this particular statement is that this maxim which is optimize your own mode of being and then work to do the same for everyone around you, is not only the thing that's at the core of the law, but it's at the core of the process that generates it updates the law

Speaker 4:          01:22:09       to hell of a thing for someone to say, enter ye in at the narrow gate, because that's what straight means. Enter ye in at the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction. Well, who in the world could possibly argue with that? Every one in their right mind knows that there's a million ways of doing things wrong and one way if you're lucky to do things right, and so the notion that it's a very, very narrow pathway that you tread upon if you're doing things right. That's, that's wisdom. That's the line between chaos and order that you're supposed to be on constantly, right? It's a very, very thin line because if you're a little bit too far in one direction, then it's too much chaos and if you're a little too far in the other direction that it's too much order and both of those aren't good, it has the balance, has to be exactly right and you can feel that and I truly believe you can feel that and I think it's your deepest instinct.

Speaker 4:          01:22:59       It's your deepest instinct that I mean that. I mean that biologically. I don't mean that metaphorically. I think that your psyche is arranged to exist in a cosmos that's composed of chaos and order. I think that's why you have the hemispheric structure that you have this. This is deeper than metaphor and then when you feel as if you're meaningfully engaged in the world, when the terror of your mortality strips away and you're engaged and it's timeless, that's the deepest instinct you have telling you that you're in the right place at the right time and then what you do is practice being their practice being there and that's that. That narrow spot that's so difficult to find. You wander around it, maybe if you're lucky, you can watch, you can watch. This is an experiment. Watch yourself for two weeks like you don't know who you are because you don't.

Speaker 4:          01:23:50       So watch yourself for two weeks and notice there's gonna be times when things are proper there, raid properly for you. It's not easy to notice because when they're arrayed like that, you're so engaged. You don't exactly notice, you know, but you'll see, oh, I'm in the right place. It's like, okay, how'd I get here? What am I doing right? You know, how is it that this could happen more often? I'd like this to happen more often. How would I have to conduct myself in order for that to happen more often, and then you practice that and then maybe instead of 10 minutes a month or 10 minutes a week, it's like 15 minutes a day and then it's half an hour a day and then it's an hour a day and then it's four hours a day and maybe if you're. If you're extraordinarily careful, then you get to a point where you're like that a good proportion of the time, because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it. You were a false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. That's particularly good advice for today's political situation. I can tell you,

Speaker 4:          01:24:54       you shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes, have thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bring forth evil fruit? Well, that's what I learned from studying the history of totalitarianism in the 20th century is that a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit and that's for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:25:20       It's so funny. You know people who think when they're thinking about the relationship with divinity or their relationship with God, they think it's a primitive and childish way of thinking. What if a miracle just manifest? Why kind a miracle just manifest itself and I would be convinced, and the funny thing is, is first of all actually you wouldn't be if a miracle actually happened, you would actually forget about it and about six months, that's I mean you'd think that's not true, but it's true. You would actually forget about it because that's what people are like, but there are negative miracles that are happening all the time which actually lend some credence to my supposition and we don't pay any attention to that. If we can't learn from what happened in the 20th century, then we are absolutely incapable of learning because what in the 20th century was as bitter a set of lessons as you could possibly imagine, and it's associated precisely with this. A corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit. Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth forth that bringith not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire will. That's a flood motif right there. It's like we're constantly the archetype of the tree. That's the archetype of being the architect. Of the self often,

Speaker 4:          01:26:43       what's the warning here is that if you're mostly dead wood, you're going to get, you're going to burn up and you can think about that metaphysical. You can. You can project that into eternity and you can think about that as a form of hell. And the funny thing is is that when that's happening to you in real time, it is like an eternity in hell. It's a perfectly reasonable way of thinking about it, but you can strip the metaphysical elements off and you can say, well, if you're mostly dead wood, then a spark will light you on fire, and that's also very much worth thinking about. Wherefore by their fruits shall you know them. Not everyone that say a fun to me, Lord shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father, which is in heaven. That's an interesting line. I think.

Speaker 4:          01:27:32       I mean one of the proper critiques of Traditional Christianity. Maybe this is the sort of critique that needs you to put forth was that Christianity had degenerated and its moral mission. Young was a little bit more sympathetic and I'll tell you why in a minute, but niches idea was that Christianity had lost its way when it generated the presupposition that humanity was saved in some final sense by the sacrifice of Christ. It meant that the work was already done and that, and I'm, I'm being. I'm being harsh in my judgment for the purpose of rhetorical simplification, but the idea was that if you just professed faith that that had already occurred, then you were granted eternal salvation. It's like, well, it's not so straightforward and I think that that's what this line actually represents. It says, how do you enter into the Kingdom of Heaven? And again, you can think about that under the aspect of eternity or you can think about it as a psychological statement and the answer is quite straightforward, is that

Speaker 3:          01:28:43       you

Speaker 4:          01:28:45       do what Noah did to make him immune from the flood and that's to walk with God and that's what this sermon is about. It's laying out the practical elements of that and the practical elements are aim at the highest possible. Good and play that out in the world. And then

Speaker 4:          01:29:08       you may have the opportunity to inhabit the highest possible good that you're positing into existence. Perhaps not, but you can't think of any more practical way of going about that. I mean, if you build a house that maybe you can live in it, if you don't build a house, you're not going to be able to live in it. If you build a good house, then you'll be able to live in a house. And if you build a perfect house, then maybe you can live in a perfect house. But if you just say that the house has already been built for you and that you can just say that the house is being built for you, well then the probability that you're going to be able to live where you need to live is there's no probability that you're going to be able to live where you need to live. Many will say to me in that day, that's the judgment day. Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name and the name, have cast out devils in the [inaudible] name, done many wonderful works. And then I will profess unto them, I never knew you, depart from me, you that work iniquity.

Speaker 4:          01:30:04       See, that's judgment day. You know? That's an archetypal idea and partly it's archetipal because everyday is judgment day and the part of you that the part of you that's equivalent to the logo, say the part of you, that's your own ideal, sits in eternal judgment on your inequity, and that's the con. That's the source of guilt and shame and and and withdrawal and then resentment and then murderousness and then genocide. It's because you can intuit the ideal and the problem with intuiting, the ideal is that an ideal is always a judge.

Speaker 4:          01:30:48       There are no difference between an ideal and the judge and so you're eternally judged by your own ideal. If you have no idea, well then you've got no direction and no meaning in your life. And then of course the more extreme, the ideal, the harsher the judge. That's actually why young young was very curious about why the book of revelation was tacked onto the Bible because the book of revelation, that's a very weird book and you know in in, in the Gospels, Christ is I would say perhaps primarily merciful. There, there's a maybe a war in his character between truth and mercy, but it's one of the two perhaps mercy and Young's observation was the gospel. Christ was to merciful and that's why the book of revelation was tapped on, tacked onto the new testament because in the book of revelation, Christ, who's the ideal, who's above the pyramid, right? The transcendent ideal is nothing but a judge and everyone fails, and of course the ultimate ideal is the ultimate judge. And so that's the archetypal reality there. And you can say, well, I don't want to be judged and so I'll dispense with the ideal, but then your cane, because cane is exactly the person who dispenses with the ideal. And so there's no escaping from it. There's no escaping from eternal judgment. That's the archetypal story.

Speaker 4:          01:32:03       You know, people put a lot of work into these representations, you know, and there's thousands of them. They weren't messing around. These are serious pieces of work, you know, we don't understand them, but that doesn't mean that the people who created them didn't know what they were doing. These were geniuses who created these pieces of work. It's not like they understood in an articulated manner exactly what they were trying to represent, but what they were representing, where the metaphor is at the core of our culture, to the degree that our culture is functional and good. These are the metaphors upon which it's founded and they're not for the faint of heart. You know, you say religion is the opiate of the masses. It's like, yeah. Then how do you explain this exactly. You know, because if it was opiates hereafter, you might just get rid of that panel.

Speaker 4:          01:32:54       Especially when. The other thing that's so interesting about the proposition, if you look at revelations, revelation, and you look at the judgment, almost everyone ends up on the right side of this panel. So if you were just conjuring up some sort of pathetic wish fulfillment, why in the world would you tilt the scales in that manner you think that's supposed to make people feel good? I don't think so. There's almost nothing about this picture that should make people feel good. It should if you understand it properly, it should terrify you to the depths of your soul. That's what the picture is for. Therefore, whoever hears these sayings of mine and do with them, I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the winds blew and the floods came and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that hears these sayings of mine and do with them not, she'll be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it,

Speaker 5:          01:34:02       oh,

Speaker 4:          01:34:02       I made a mistake and it fell for. It was founded upon the sand and it came to pass. This is a very interesting line. I really, I really know now, and then you run across lines in this particularly happens in biblical settings. You run across lines that you cannot believe actually exists. You cannot imagine how someone could have imagined up and conjured up the line and and these two lines are like that as far as I'm concerned. And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings that people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes. And that's something so interesting because that was another thing that really I didn't really appreciate about the churches that I attended to and that would be that the lessons were taught by scribes and the words were mouthed, but there was no power in them.

Speaker 4:          01:34:54       There was no meaning in them. It was, it was as if, well, it was like when I was 20 years old and I was saying all these things, I didn't mean, you know, they were words that sounded good. They were like, like gilded cloth, I suppose that you can that you can wrap around yourself, but there no substance to them and there's a big difference between listening to something that has substance and listening to something that is spoken because it sounds like it should sound good and this line says that whoever spoke the lines that we just described was someone who sounded like he knew what he was talking about and not someone who is just repeating something for the sake of sounding good, and it certainly seems to me that the lines that we just reviewed have the awesome impact of authority

Speaker 3:          01:35:47       act to noah,

Speaker 4:          01:35:49       but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God, and Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The Earth was also corrupt before God and the earth was full of violence, filled with violence. Any of you see the new NRA ad? You might want to look that up. I would say that's the most shocking manifestation of political polarization in the United States that I've yet seen. Most of it I've seen on the left, the real. What's shocked me mostly has been on the left, but the new NRA ad, that's a whole new thing. So it's this attractive woman doing a voiceover. She kind of looks like Demi Moore, although she's Kinda tough looking. I guess Demi Moore could look tough now and then and she has contempt on her face and that's a dangerous thing and in the background there's nothing but images of antifa riots and Berkeley riots and fire and protest and she's describing that is a conspiracy, essentially a conspiracy that involves the intellectual elite including Hollywood, which is named by name. The accusation is that there is a cabal of

Speaker 4:          01:37:16       corrupt intellectuals, let's say, who are bringing the country to its knees and that it's time to get your God damn guns and so look up that and see what you think because

Speaker 4:          01:37:32       there's lots of people who would be perfectly happy if that was the direction in which we're headed. And one of the things that I'm hoping is that we might be able to talk our way through it, but we're in a situation where every act of interview, individual idiocy will push us one iota closer to the break and that'll make the 15 of the population or 30 percent of the population who would love to see everything degenerated into chaos, perfectly happy because that's their aim. Theory. Salsa was corrupt before God and the earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the earth. And behold it was corrupt for all flesh is corrupted his way upon the earth. And Noah said, and God said unto Noah, the end of all flesh has come before me. For the earth is filled with violence through them. And behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

Speaker 4:          01:38:25       Make the an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the arch, and then pitch it within and without with pitch. And this is the fashion which thou shalt make of it. The length of the Ark, shelby, 300 cubits, the breadth of it. 50 cubits and the height of it. 30 cubits and window shelf. They'll make to the arc in a cubit, shelldale finishing above and the door and the art shelters set in the side there or with lower second and third stories shall make it, and behold, I even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven. Everything that is in the earth shall die, but with the I will establish my covenant and now she'll come into the Ark, thou and thy sons and a wife and they sons wives with the.

Speaker 4:          01:39:08       That's a fairly optimistic twist on the story because not only is it noah, but he gets to save his whole family and down a couple of generations and so that's a good thing to think about. It's like as things you know, I had this client and she had a very hard upbringing. I would say. Not a lot of encouragement to say the least. Let's say a fair bit of discouragement and she had a son. And what was really interesting about her in relationship to her son is that all the things that she could have learned to do to him, given her extensive experience with being made as miserable as possible by someone who was hell bent on bringing her to her knees, she refused to do, to respond, right? She learned the opposite lesson from all her misery and tournament, which was not to move that forward down the generations.

Speaker 4:          01:40:00       And so the idea here is that if you walk properly and aimed properly and act properly, if you walk with God in this manner that we've been discussing, is that perhaps that isn't only good for you, perhaps it's also the thing that will save your family and then by implication perhaps save society because that's exactly what happens with Noah, right? First attempt and then it's his family, but everything else goes. And so by saving himself, by acting properly and by saving his family, he actually saves the world. It's interesting, you know, like the most profound people that I've read who've meditated deeply on the problem, say of totalitarian catastrophe. And I would put Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn at the top of that list, you know, hit the his, his entire Corpus, three volume 700 pages long. Each in tiny type is a long scream about the absolute necessity of individual, the absolute necessity of individual honesty and ethical behavior as the only bulwark against totalitarian catastrophe. And the. And I've read many writers who've attempted to diagnose the problems of the 20th century and I think units. And

Speaker 4:          01:41:21       he came to the same conclusions that Victor Frankel came to as a consequence of his experiences in the Nazi concentration camps and Frankel. I'm also an admirer of Frankl, but soldier knits and takes it to an entire different level of profundity and makes an extraordinarily strong case that not only do societies deteriorate because the people within the societies become individually corrupt, but that the only way to stave that off is for the individuals within that society to reject that corruption in the, in the confines of their own personal lives. And he tells endless stories of people that he met in the Gulag, in the work camps, in the death camps, in the Soviet Union of people. And this is what he learned. If people who are so incredibly tough that even under conditions the most possible extreme conditions, there wasn't a chance that they were going to step off that straight narrow line.

Speaker 4:          01:42:15       There was nothing the authorities could do to move them and just watching that was enough to transform soldier knits and because of course one of the things he wondered was after spending a good amount of time in the work camps was well just exactly how did I get here? And it wasn't well, it was Hitler's fault and it was [inaudible] fault. Although it was definitely the fault of both of them for social incident was well, it was also his fault because he was playing the same game. He just wasn't as good at it. And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shall they'll bring into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. And so the they. There's A. There's another message in this story which is that it isn't only Noah and his family and human society that's dependent on Noah's appropriate actions in the world. It's the entire living planet and in an era of excessive and extreme and genuinely disingenuous environmental catastrophizing, that's something to consider very seriously. Think perhaps there's nothing better that you can do for everything. All things considered, including those things that are outside the confines of human society than to get your act together and align yourself properly along all of the dimensions of your being, from, from, from the tiniest microcosm to the to the macrocosm, and that's the way that all of being is redeemed.

Speaker 4:          01:43:56       That's what the story suggests and we read it. You know, a cynical modern people. We read it as if it was written by primitive people who thought that it was really the case that someone could build a boat and put two of every kind into it and thereby save the world.

Speaker 4:          01:44:17       It's embarrassing to see things interpreted in a manner that shallow, especially by people who don't have ignorance as a justification. You know, these stories have to appeal to everyone, right? And there's lots of people in the world who aren't very bright and so they tend to take things concretely like a child would take things concretely if you read them a story, and this story can be taken concretely, but it has to be because the stories have to be for everyone. But if you're a sophisticated, that doesn't mean that you should dismiss it as if it's written for a child. It's maybe you have the obligation to look a bit deeper and think for a moment that it wouldn't be conserved for these many thousands of years if there wasn't something more to it than a casual intellectual dismissal would indicate and take the onto the of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to the shelby food for the end for them. Thus did noah. According to all that God commanded him. So did he. And the Lord said unto Noah, come down and all the house into the arc for the I've seen righteous before me. In this generation of every clean beast,

Speaker 4:          01:45:20       thou shalt take to the by sevens. The male and female and obesity are clean but not cleaned by to the male and female and, uh, follows also of the error by sevens, the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth for yet seven days, I will cause it to rain upon the earth. Forty days and 40 nights. And every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him. And Noah was 600 years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. And Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with them into the arc because of the waters of the flood, of clean beasts and obese that are not cleaning the fouls and have everything that creepeth upon the earth.

Speaker 4:          01:46:00       They went in to and to and to know into the arc. The male and the female is guarded, demanded Noah. And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth in the 600th year of Noah's life. In the second month, the 17th day of the month, the same day, we're all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of Heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth. Forty days and 40 nights in the selfsame day entered Noah and chairman, Ham and Japheth, sons of Noah and Noah, his wife and the three wives of his sons with him into the arc. They in every beast after his kind and all of the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort of they went into Noah unto no into the Ark, to and to evolve flesh. We're in is the breath of life

Speaker 1:          01:46:55       that makes no the ultimate shepherd, right shepherd of all things tender of the garden and shepherd of all things. That's a hell of a role and maybe that's the one that keeps you afloat during the flood. And they that went in, went in, male and female of all flesh is God had commanded him. And the Lord shout a man and the flood was 40 days upon the earth and the waters increased and bear up the ark and it was lifted up above the earth and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth. 15 cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered and all flesh died that moved upon the earth. Both have fallen of cattle and the beast and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man and all in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land, died in every living substance was destroyed, which was upon the face of the earth. Both man and cattle and the creeping things in the fall of the heaven. And they were destroyed from the earth and no only remained alive. And they that were with him in the Ark. And the water's prevailed upon the earth. One hundred and 50 days.

Speaker 1:          01:48:12       And God remembered no on every living thing and all the capital that was with him in the Ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters receded the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped in. The rain from heaven was restrained and the water's returned from off the earth continually. And after the end of 150 days, the waters were abated. And the Ark rested in the seventh month, on the Seventeenth Day of the month upon the mountains of air rat. And the water's decreased continually until the 10th month, the 10th month on the first day of the month where the tops of the mountain scene.

Speaker 1:          01:48:45       And it came to pass at the end of 40 days that Noah opened the window of the Ark, which he had made. And he sent forth a raven which went to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth. And he also sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground. But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot. And she returned unto him in the Ark for the waters on the face of the whole earth that he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the Ark, and he stayed yet another seven days. And again, he sent forth the dove out of the Ark. And the devil came into him in the evening and low in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So no one knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. And he stayed there yet another seven days and sent forth the dove, which returned not again onto him any more. And it came to pass in the 600th and first year in the first month. The first day of the month of waters were dried up from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the orchid, looked up and behold, the face of the ground was dry.

Speaker 1:          01:49:43       And in the second month on the seventh and 20th day of the month was the dried. And God spake unto Noah, saying, go forth of the arc, thou and thy wife and they sons and their sons waves with the

Speaker 1:          01:49:55       bring forth with the every living thing that is with the of all flesh, both of fall, end of cattle and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth. And Noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him. Every beast creeping thing every fall and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the Ark. And Noah building an altar unto the Lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean foul and offered burnt offerings on the altar. Immediate return to the sacrificial motif. And the Lord smelled a sweet savor. And that's new as proper sacrifice. And the Lord said into his heart, I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake. For the imagination of Man's heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I again smite anymore. Every living thing has I have done while the Earth remaineth seed time and harvest, cold and heat in summer and winter, day and night shall not cease, and God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth, upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand or they delivered.

Speaker 1:          01:51:25       You know, I've heard commentators, David Suzuki, for example, who claim that the substructure of Western culture in lines such as this

Speaker 1:          01:51:44       deliver the earth over to human beings and and justify our ravaging of the, of, of being, but I don't think that that's a very careful reading and it seems to me that given such matters, given the importance of such matters that are very close reading is actually necessary. You know, in the story of Adam and Eve when Adam and eve are thrown out of the garden, God tells eve that she's going to be subordinated to her husband. He doesn't say that. That's what should happen. He says that's what's going to happen, and the same thing as far as I'm concerned is contained in lines like this isn't necessarily that this is something that should happen. It's something that did happen. It's quite remarkable. You know, to think about how long ago these lions were penned, it wasn't obvious until perhaps the 19 sixties that we had dominated the earth so completely that it's very

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       future existence was in our hands and that's a prophetic element of this tale and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air and upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand. Are they delivered? It's like, that's exactly right. Every moving thing that lives shall be meat for you. Even as the green herb I've given you all things, have I given you all things but flesh with the life therapy, which is the blood thereof, shall you not eat and surely your blood of your lives will I require at the hand of every beast will I required in at the hand of man at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man? This is a hard section to interpret, but what it means is something like this. God describes the dominion over the planet that revivified humanity will have and notes the power that goes along with that and then puts a limitation on it and the limitation is maintain the sanctity of life despite your power. And although it's not easy to extract from the manner in which this has been translated. What God is telling Noah is that if you kill yourself, if you kill someone else, and if any animal kills a human being, that there will be a price to pay for that. So there's a an opportunity which is that the descendants of Noah can dominate the earth, but there's a moral limitation placed on that. Which is nonetheless, life itself is to be regarded as sanctified and sacred.

Speaker 4:          01:54:33       Whoever shared with man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of God made he man and you be fruitful and multiply. Bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply their in and God spake to Noah and to his sons with him saying, and I behold I establish my covenant with you and with your seat after you and with every living creature that is with you. Have the fall in the cattle and to every beast of earth that is with you. For all that. Go out of the Ark to every beast of the earth. And I will establish my covenant with you. Neither shall all flesh be cut off anymore by the waters of the flood. Neither shall there be any more. A flood to destroy the earth.

Speaker 4:          01:55:16       And God said, this is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations. I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the Earth and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth that the Hoa shall be seen in the cloud and I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. There's a negotiated agreement there of sorts

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       and then negotiated agreement is as far as I can tell to the degree that humanity agrees to act in the manner of Noah. Then the threat of catastrophic destruction will remain at bay and the bowl shall be in the cloud and I will look upon it that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, this is the token of the covenant which I've established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh. That is upon the earth, so that's a good place to stop and there's no lecture next week by the way, because the theater was booked so there'll be a one week break and then when we get back we'll finish the story of Noah. There's not much left of it. We'll talk about the tower of Babel, which is a very short story, but a very, very interesting one. And then we'll move on to the story of Abraham and so thank you very much for coming in. We'll see you again

Speaker 3:          01:57:03       two weeks. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:57:23       Now is the person who has the notification for the meetup after this here and do they have the notification? Okay. Because if you give that to me this time, I'll remember to read it before everyone leaves. So do you want to start? Okay. So see, let's see if the mic is working because lots of people will listen to this question and so. Okay. Okay. So you said on a recent live stream that you were two, you didn't have enough energy to answer this question, but you said it was intriguing. So I was wondering if you had the energy to answer how someone might help someone that has borderline personality disorder by example, by example.

Speaker 1:          01:58:13       You have an example? No, no, no, I don't. I don't. I don't mean that precisely. I mean that the. Let's not take borderline personality disorder precisely as the example. Okay. I understand the question. The question to some degree is how do you help someone that's lost and the answer to that is if they aren't willing to not be lost, you cannot help them. And I would also say that as a clinician you see, I mean it's an. It's a statement that's informed, I would say by my mythological knowledge, but also by straight clinical wisdom, not mine particularly. I mean one of the things that Carl Rogers pointed out was that there were necessary preconditions for entering into a therapeutic relationship and that that would be really any relationship where the mutual flourishing of the two people involved was the paramount goal. And one of the preconditions was that both people have to want that to happen and Rogers believed he didn't know how to get the horse to drink.

Speaker 1:          01:59:15       Once you had brought it to the water, and I've thought about that a lot because when people are really lost, sometimes they're so lost that they can't be found and I think the only thing that you can do in a situation like that is get your life together and she and manifest the reality of an alternative motive being that's what you've got. And so that's the only way I knew of to solve an intractable problem and I would say the reason that I went down that direction with regards to borderline personality disorders because it's one of the most serious of the personality disorder. It's very difficult to treat and so I'll generalize from that to situations that are very difficult to deal with. And you know, there's a statement too, and this has nothing to do with borderline personality disorder per se. There's a statement in the new testament that's really vicious.

Speaker 1:          02:00:12       In fact, there's a number of them, but this is a particularly vicious one and that is don't cast pearls before swine. And what that means is if you're trying to help and it doesn't work, then stop helping. It's not helping, right? It may be just wasting your time. It might be making things worse. Now, if you're. If you're offering something and it's not taken, then perhaps you should be offering it somewhere else and sometimes if you offer hand in, the person won't take it. You have to stop offering the hand and then what you do is you go off and you have your life and sometimes that means in people's lives, for example, that they have to leave their family members behind. There's a scene in the new testament. This is another very hard scene where Christ is walking down the road with his disciples.

Speaker 1:          02:01:01       I hope I've got this story right, but I've got it essentially right, and his mother calls to him and says, I believe that he's supposed to come back to the home because his uncle has died and that there's going to be a funeral, and he turns to his mother and says something like, let the dead bury their dead. I'm about my father's business. It's something like that. And you read that and you think, Huh, that should have been edited out. No, but it shouldn't have been edited out because it's exactly right because sometimes the thing you do is walk away because there's no other solution and if you

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       are trapped in pathological relationships and you see no way out of them, if you, if someone who is sinking has their hands around your neck and is pulling you down, you're not obligated to drown with them. No. There's a rule to. If you're a lifeguard, you know, some of you have had lifeguard training. How do you approach someone who's drowning and panicking in the water feed out? Right? Like this. It's like all save you, but that doesn't mean you get to drown me while I'm doing it and if it's you drown or both of us drown. It's you drown. And that's wisdom. That's not cruelty, right? So yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:02:27       couple of questions about dialogue and engaging in dialogue with people. So the first issue that I face is I have a very high need for intellectual stimulation and I don't get that with most people. It's something like, um, you can, you can have a dialogue for a time, but then it

Speaker 4:          02:02:45       titrate openness. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:02:48       And and now, but then they started run out of ideas or they can keep up and it sort of falls apart and okay, this is a problem that intellectuals have quite frequently. You said they, they sort of, once they start reading difficult to devoting stuff, they stopped wanting to talk to regular people and I think that contributes to the disconnect that you see between intellectuals and working class people and, and stuff like that. And the other question I had was about,

Speaker 4:          02:03:14       okay wait, I don't know if that's the question. I mean I believe there's a question in there, but I,

Speaker 1:          02:03:20       the question is how, how do you, how should we address that? How should I address it? And is that something that can be dressed?

Speaker 4:          02:03:27       Well, part of, part of the answer to that is that's what the universities were for. I mean, you know, not everybody is equipped to or interested in engaging in high level discussion of abstract and creative ideas. You know, you hear this idea that everyone's creative. That's a lie. It's a straightforward. Is that true? Creativity is very, very rare. And so, and if you happen to be a creative person or if you happen to be someone who's profoundly interested in ideas, you are in a pronounced minority, just as you are, if you happen to be extremely extroverted or extremely agreeable, are extremely conscientious. These are minority issues. And what you do is you find likeminded people who are capable of engaging that we know a heavyweight heavyweight weightlifters compete with heavy weight weight lifters for a reason and everyone thinks that's fine. And the same thing applies to intellectual and creative endeavors.

Speaker 4:          02:04:20       So what you do is you try to find a community where that's, that's the nature of the community and you likely have to find a relationship like that as well. You know? So I don't think so. I think what contributes to the siloing is the arrogance goes along with it because if you're, you can be interested in ideas and you can be creative. Well that's the arrogance of the intellect, right? That's the thing the Catholic Church had warned about for centuries is the arrogance of the intellect. So because if you're, if you're wise as well as smart and there is no relationship between being smart and being wise, they are not the same thing. There's no quick pathway from smart to wise. And many of the people who I've known who were very wise were, some of them were intellectually impaired and we're still wise. So it's the arrogance that brings up the block.

Speaker 4:          02:05:12       And I see this for example happening in the United States in particular because the last time I went down there for example, I was. I had friends down there and some of those friends are very, very smart people and some of them were talking about the trump voters and they were talking about the trump voters with contempt and I thought you better watch that because that's 50 percent of the population and it might be convenient to think that they're stupid and beneath you, but it's not conducive to a civil state. And there's no evidence that it's true because there isn't a straight line between intelligent and wise. And so I think that if your. If your character is developed and you're intelligent, you can have your siloed, creative community, but you develop enough wisdom so that you can see all the things that people can do that or have high ethical utility that are outside the intellectual domain.

Speaker 4:          02:06:05       You know, and I think that's why in the New Testament, I think that's why Christ is a carpenter, right? Because, well, first of all, carpenter is one of those jobs that when you're dishonest, it manifests itself immediately because what you build falls down and so if you're an honest carpenter, you build a good house. So there's a nice metaphor there, but it's also. It's also a warning in some sense, against the the equation of intellectual brilliance with moral superiority. And so if the intellects would drop their moral superiority and fat chance there is of that, then that divide between the working class say and the elite would would resolve. And there's every reason to have respect for decent working class people. It's on their labor as the left wingers at least hypothetically agree that the entire edifice of the culture is, is resting. So you can have your cake and eat it too, but you have to not assume that your niche makes you superior.

Speaker 4:          02:07:16       And it's very difficult for smart people, especially smart. There's this scene in niches. Sins thus spake Zarathustra Zarathustra. The prophet comes down from the mountain and he comes into a public square and there's this crowd around this little midget who was only about this high, who has a gigantic ear and everyone is marveling at him. Well, that's what the moderate intellect is like. It's a midget with a giant. Well mouth generally not an ear and the being is underdeveloped, but the intellect is hyper activated and it makes the person extraordinarily unbalanced. And it's partly because a, they can't compete outside the intellectual realm and that makes them very bitter because they tend to think, well God, I'm so smart. Everything should just come to me. It's like, sorry, that's not how the world works. And, and it, it also that, that, and that, that, that attitude is immediately evident to people that they're talking to when they talk in the manner that they talk. If they are arrogant intellectuals of that sort. You see that in the simpsons did a good job of that with Comic Book Guy. I mean he completely useless in every possible dimension with an Iq of about 160 and it's very annoying to people who have an Iq of 160 that they can also be completely useless, but it happens a lot. So yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:08:37       Thank you.

Speaker 1:          02:08:45       Long time. No, see how are you doing? Thanks. So I was at first going to ask about your thoughts on a very popular TV show. Rick and Morty

Speaker 4:          02:08:54       just recommended that to me and they said they thought I would find it funny and that makes me nervous because I like the simpsons and I liked the trailer park boys for actually liked the Turner. I really liked the trailer park boys. And so if someone said, I know it's so sad, you know, but they said that I would like rick and Morty, so I'm kind of afraid to even watch it.

Speaker 1:          02:09:16       It does have a nihilistic theme to it, I would say. So that was just quite telling of the young population which say falling in love with it. Everyone's talking about it, so,

Speaker 4:          02:09:25       okay, well I'll definitely watch it because I'd been looking for something to watch when I'm brain dead at night. So,

Speaker 1:          02:09:32       but I just had to tell him my question from a different angle if I, if I may. Um, and it's about, um, the case that governments, let's say, such as Russia and Iran, they are even more extreme cases like isis. They do not want to conform to a nihilistic aspects of the West. And as a result, they've taken an anti western approach as someone with a Middle Eastern background. Um, I've been trying to figure out where the origins of this hostility more precisely comes from and why things are the way they are. I recently found out that certain key uranium philosophers and political activist who are partially intellectually responsible for the 19, 79 and renowned revolution were highly influenced by the anti western Heideggerian philosophy. And this is partially why they believe that an Islamic state, uh, would it be be unnecessary counter position, uh, to the, to the nihilistic western thought. Uh, you, I know you also found there with

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       Aleksandr Dugin, a puddings advisor, except Dougan doesn't really seem to have a coherent answer. He says that an answer like that is necessary and that hypothetically it's something that Russia might be able to offer, but the details seem to me somewhat obscure. I mean the Russians may be, the Russians are doing what Solzhenitsyn suggested in returning to Orthodox Christianity, although Russia's corrupt enough so that it's very difficult to tell from the outside if that's mirror collusion between a corrupt church and a corrupt state or if there's something genuine going on there. Now, you know, the, the, I would say there's a question under your question which is tyranny or nihilism? Well, that's a good question man. That's a good question. Well, lots of people would pick tyranny over nihilism. And so if that's the only choice that people are offered then. And I also think that tyranny is stronger than nihilism because what are you going to do? Organize nihilists hardly. Well, look at, look at what happened to, what was that thing in central park, you know, against the one percent. Jesus. I mean, what a dismal affair that was. We'd like things to be different. How well we don't know. It's like

Speaker 2:          02:11:49       thank you.

Speaker 4:          02:11:53       So you know your. You can just run over that if you're a tyrannical and organized, you can just run over that like there's nothing there at all and that I think there is a danger and I do think that were enticing Islamofascism let's say by our nihilistic weakness and I think more than that, I think that we're doing something more than that because one of the things that I've been curious about, and I'm going way out on limb here, is I've been really interested in the alliance between the Neo Marxist denialists suspicious or the Neo Marxist, postmodern, especially the feminists and the Islamofascism. I just don't get that. It's like there's something very, very interesting going on there and I think part of it is that when you, when you drift too far into the nihilistic substructure, there is a huge call for tyrannical order that manifests itself unconsciously. And so that's the dynamic that I see playing out in that peculiar relationship between the modern neo Marxist feminists in the Islamic fascists. I don't. I don't know. That's a very. That's very interesting that that's a very interesting idea that you brought to mind. I had no idea that there was a relationship between heidegger and what happened in Iran in the 19 seventies. If you could send me a citation about that or something to read, I'd be very interested in doing that. So. Okay. Yep. Yep.

Speaker 2:          02:13:19       Thanks.

Speaker 4:          02:13:26       Thank you. That's, that's the closest thing

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       I think I'll experience to, to Arnold Schwartzenegger actually delivering that line.

Speaker 6:          02:13:50       April titled the Case for Free Speech

Speaker 1:          02:14:01       Distribution. Yeah. Not Ross, but yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:14:07       Whereby I guess the square root of the number of people involved in some sort of productive endeavor

Speaker 1:          02:14:12       do half the work

Speaker 6:          02:14:14       would result in half the production.

Speaker 1:          02:14:16       Oh, it's a nasty, nasty law. Yeah. It was also known as price's law.

Speaker 6:          02:14:20       Four hundred, 500 people we've all cleaned up.

Speaker 1:          02:14:27       Great.

Speaker 6:          02:14:28       What you're saying is that if you say that this Perrino distribution approximates a natural law, we all understand the force of gravity and there's no escaping the influence of gravity, that means that there's 20 people in this room who are going to be, I guess candidates to accomplishing. I guess the goal of being the next Jordan Peterson.

Speaker 1:          02:14:54       Hopefully there's fewer of them.

Speaker 1:          02:15:00       Two things. The first is if it isn't obvious what the population would be, that you would compare this population too, right? Because you could say, well, the boundaries, the 400 people in this room, but it isn't necessarily the case. The 400 people in this room might be the square root of the broader population. We're interested in this sort of thing. But with the prieto distribution, what you also see is that it's itself similar. And so, um, let's say there's 400 people doing something, 20 of them are doing half the work, but if you take 20, those 24 of them are doing half the work of the 20 and one of the forest doing half the work of the four. And so

Speaker 6:          02:15:42       it,

Speaker 1:          02:15:42       it. So why am I telling you that it's it, isn't it? Well, first of all, it isn't that there isn't useful work to be done at multiple slices of the prieto distribution. But the other thing is it's also the case that there's not only one prieto distribution, right? Because he might say, well, if it's just the square root of the number of people in a domain that are doing half the work, then what do you do with the rest of the people? And the answer to that might be while they're in a pre to a different prieto distribution as well, where they're doing something productive. So.

Speaker 1:          02:16:22       Well, I think it's a good question. Like, ah, we don't exactly. Um, so, so the basic rule is the look, the basic rule is example, if you take 100 scientists in a given domain, 10 of them will have published half the papers. And this works with everything. It works with every creative domain. The rule applies. So now the question is why? And I think the answer to that seems to be, and I've watched people who've become spectacularly successful and what happens is that zero is a really bad place to be, right? It's really hard to get out of zero. And that's often why people are trapped in poverty because if you have nothing getting to something is virtually impossible. Once you have something, getting to a little more of something is actually quite a bit easier. And so what seems to happen, this is also called the matthew principle, right?

Speaker 1:          02:17:14       It's the same principle. So that's a new testament citation. Let's say the matthew principle is to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing. Everything will be taken. That's another one of those lines in the new testament that you'd think that a good editor would have just got rid of. So but, but, but I think what it is is that every time you make a step forward, the probability that you'll be able to take the next step forward increases. And it seems to increase in a nonlinear way. So the, the world that the matthew principal describes is nonlinear. You know, so you might say, well, what's your trajectory if you're moving upward? Well, it's not this, it's this. What's your trajectory if you're moving downward, it's not this, it's this, right? You Fall, you fall, you plummet, you rise, you rise, you transcend. It's something like that and you might say, well that's a hell of a world, but whatever. It has to be run by some principle and the principle that it appears to be run by. Yes,

Speaker 1:          02:18:25       no, no, no. It doesn't mean that at all. What it means is that every truth claim you make, including those that are implicit in your actions, carries with it an ethic that justifies or doesn't justify the action. So for example, let's say I have a tool and I say it's an ax and I go out in the forest and I cut down. I tried to cut down a tree with it and it doesn't work. It's not an ax, it's something else. And so what the, what the. There's a good book on pragmatism called the metaphysical club, a history of American ideas. It's one I would really recommend and what the pragmatists. I can't give you a full answer because this is such a complicated issue, but what the pragmatist we're wrestling with back in the late 18 hundreds, the late 18 hundreds. This was William James and his crew in, in in Boston. I'm including a philosopher named CS purse, who is perhaps America's greatest philosopher. They were wrestling with the same issue that the postmodernist would wrestle with 100 years later, which is

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       things are indefinitely complex and we're not very bright. So how is it that we can make claims to truth about anything and what they were, what their hypothesis essentially was, is that with every action and with every truth claim you similar demarcate a territory within which that claim is valid and you, you determine whether the claim is valid by noting whether your prediction about the outcome of your action or your or your belief is commensurate is in keeping with so if the outcome is in keeping with the prediction than what you've said or done is true or good enough and that's as good as you get. And so that's the pragmatic perspective. And then when, when, when the pragmatists encountered Charles Dark Charles Darwin's works works, they immediately recognized that Darwin had generated a pragmatic solution to the problem of the impossibility of being. The impossibility of being is this, there's way more cosmos than there is you.

Speaker 4:          02:20:30       You are going to die. You cannot generate a sufficient solution to the problem of you're being. No one can. Nothing. Cat, it's like the environment is a snake that moves unpredictably across time and you're trying to stay on its back while I was how to, how does the Darwinian process deal with that? It produces infinite variance roughly speaking, almost all of which die. And that's how it solves the problem across time and the things that exist. This, the things that stay alive, our true enough, and that's the best you get. That's the argument I was trying to have with Sam Harris because Harris doesn't take his evolutionary cycle, his evolutionary theory, seriously enough, but we get. We kept getting bogged down. Anyways, that's, that's the best answer to that. I'd like to agree with that, but it's not true.

Speaker 6:          02:21:23       Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup. True scientific.

Speaker 4:          02:21:40       You really do like to ask hard questions, don't you? Um, I think it depends. See, this is also why like the Piagetian take let's say on, on pragmatism, because I think that pragmatism as a philosophy has the limitation that you just described, but only if you think about the Games is limited. If you have to play the game in an iterative way, then that issue resolves itself and the game theorists have done a good job of mapping that out. It's like you could say, let's say pragmatically speaking, there is no reason I shouldn't deceive you once. If I can get what I want, it's yeah. Yeah. Except that I'm probably not only going to interact with you once. I'm going to interact with you a lot and even if it isn't you that I interact with, it's going to be a bunch of beings that are so much you that it might as well be. You might as well be you. It's going to be me if nothing else. And so the pragmatic game stretched across time would include the necessity of interability in relationship to the validations of the truth claims. That's, that's how it looks to me when you. I'm gonna, I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Stop you say that again? Denied on several occasions. Yes. Like you're good at rhetoric. Yes. Thank you. Yes. But that's not all I am.

Speaker 7:          02:23:11       Uh, so this is on behalf of somebody, uh, Dr Peterson having listened to your expositions on the mythological evolution and amalgamation of religion and keeping in mind your working definitions of belief and truth and despite the obvious reasons for somebody of your background to identify most with Christianity, my understanding is that you believe Christianity to be the most complete and articulated form of many of the metaphysical ideas that proceeded. It led up to that. Keeping that in mind, would it also be accurate to therefore say that you're not only a believer in Christianity, but also if to a lesser degree also believer in, in Marta, in the ancient Egyptian gods and the subsequent gods that you've spoken of here, uh, that lead up and contributed to the form of Christianity that you're discussing and that you identify with.

Speaker 4:          02:23:56       Okay. I got to take that one apart a little bit. I'm bounded in my judgment with regards to Christianity by my ignorance. I'm no student of Hinduism so I can't make the claim forthrightly that there's something intrinsically superior to the Judeo Christian tradition because I don't know enough to make that claim. The claim I can make is that there's something that's dreadfully right about this core elements of the Judeo Christian tradition and I've seen analogs to that. Like one of the things I'd like to do, for example, is to do a a short series on the Tao Te Ching because that is one remarkable document. Once you know, especially you might want to read it, you can go online and read. It's very short. Tao Te Ching t a o, t h I C H I n g, and it's the fundamental texts of Taoism and once you know that the world of being is made of chaos and order and you know that that's represented by the Yin and the Yang, all of a sudden you can understand the Tao te Ching and it's just.

Speaker 4:          02:25:03       It's brilliantly simple and straightforward in new sex position, but it also seems to me to be entirely commensurate with the line of, of let's call it logic. It's more like a, the the mode of description of being that's encapsulated in these stories. Now with regards to being a believer, people ask me all the time, two thinks, hey, do you believe in God and are you a Christian? And they answered without both of those is actually. There's two answers. One is what the hell makes you think it's any of your business? That's the first answer. And the second is why do you think that you mean the same thing with those questions that I would mean with my answer. So you know, because it's, it's such a funny thing because I've spent like three. This is no accusation with regards to your questions in the least. You know,

Speaker 8:          02:25:48       I think it's more about trying to track the development of these ideas and you know, the residual truths and psych, psychological significance of all these other traditions that team.

Speaker 4:          02:25:56       Well, you know, the, the. I've been floored by either mythological structures like when I first understood or thought I understood the meaning of the Mesopotamian creation method, just I've never recovered from that I would say, and the same thing is true of the investigations I did into the Egyptian myths of Horus and Isis and Osiris and seth. It's just they, they're so relevant. I mean there are so unbelievably relevant. And how do, how do see this is a problem that none of us really know how to, how to solve. It's like there are sources of wisdom all over the world, let's say, and they need to be made commensurate with one another, which isn't to say that they need to be turned into a fast food. A mall, you know, that's, that's like multiculturalism, right? It's like all the food of the world served in the most terrible possible manner all in one place and something like that.

Speaker 4:          02:26:55       And you don't want to do that with comparative religion. It's just water everything down and say, well, it's all nice. It's like, no, it is not nice. Yeah. Or that it's all the same because it's not all the same. So the job of communicating between those domains of wisdom is really continuing. Right? It's been a problem ever since the beginning of civilization, but it's continuing and I would say the psychoanalysts too young in particular was a huge, huge steps in the direction of doing that in an extraordinarily positive way and not a simple minded way at all and not just hand waving that. Oh well it's. Everyone has one in all shall have prizes. Not that. So yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:27:37       thank you.

Speaker 4:          02:27:42       Last question

Speaker 8:          02:27:45       actually is a kind of in the same vein, but it's in regards to another kind of mythology. So in terms of I guess Carl Jung's own those, sorry to mix. Certainly tall, but a lot of the. I actually found some kind of archetypes like for example, in my own life, but also I've noticed in European life. So for example, in regards to Odin and norse mythology with Carl Jung's essay, I've only been able to touch you skim it because I've been trying to find something like. Because it felt like there's always this kind of psyche that was almost underneath, I guess, Western civilization and we've seen it really like embodied in this specific figure, this deity, the wanderer, the knowledge, gather the seeker, but he's also a war. God is, he is all these different aspects that are an accumulation of what seems to be something that's distinctly western. And I feel this is almost like the symbol in a way. Of course, it's not always positive.

Speaker 1:          02:28:45       There seems to be something. Maybe there seems to be something. I do think that the idea of the individual has been articulated most fully in the west. I don't think that's really a, I don't think that's a contentious claim actually. Um, that doesn't mean that the latent structures from which that idea might emerge weren't also many other places simultaneously. And the other thing from let's say from a biological perspective is that we're only talking about differences of a few hundred years in terms of the manifestation of these ideas. Right? From A, from an evolutionary perspective, that's, it's instantaneous. And it's like, well, a new idea has to arise somewhere. So it's going to be somewhere first and but it, it's spreading. Christianity for example, spreads so rapidly that it's absolutely beyond belief and it is actually spreading more rapidly in China now than it did in ancient Rome. So.

Speaker 8:          02:29:37       Well in regards to that, it's also been seen like almost in the wake of a dying Christianity. I've noticed that like there's been a tendency to go towards I guess paganism, right? Yes. I'm understand the lake. Some people love at off. Yes, you have waco, which was mainly a manifestation of all Alistair Crowley has it works which were then handed off to whoever actually made the actual ideology. And then next thing you know, we're finding something almost more stable in I guess norse mythology and it seems like it's acting almost as a pendulum swing from something that.

Speaker 1:          02:30:12       Well, people are like. The thing is, is when, when, when, when one mythological structure collapses, it's going to collapse into another mythological structure or another set of mythological structures and, and because you, you can't get out of the mythological structures, there's no possible way of doing that. What? And so I wouldn't say necessarily that the fact that other belief systems emerge in the aftermath of the collapse of the overarching belief system, I don't think that that's necessarily a bad idea. I think that it has its attendant dangers. And so I should stop because I'm starting to get tired and I'm not going to be able to formulate any clear answers than that. And it's also 10:00. So we also do have to start.

Speaker 2:          02:30:57       Oh yes.

Speaker 1:          02:31:01       There is an unofficial meetup and discussion group at Hemingway's restaurant. Second floor, 142 cumberland street. Just say you're with the Jordan Peterson discussion group. Yes. Everyone is invited. If you say you're with the Jordan Peterson discussion group, please don't miss. Behave too badly.
