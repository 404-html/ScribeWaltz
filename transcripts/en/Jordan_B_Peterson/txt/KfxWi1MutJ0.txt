Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi there, it's only about a week before Christmas and some of you are no doubt scrambling to determine what might make an appropriate Christmas gift. As you may know or also may not. I have written a book that's coming out in January on January 23rd as a matter of fact called 12 rules for life and antidote to chaos and it's possible that some of the people you know might be interested in receiving that as a gift. However, a promise to get a book a month later, it doesn't make a great Christmas gift. Exactly. So what I've done is put together a small package that announces that the book has been ordered that has a short letter in it for me and also that contains the introduction to the book about 10 pages, which I called over tour. You could order the book online from any of the vendors to whom I have provided a link in the description of the video and you could also download the package I produced and print it out to make the gift more tangible and therefore more well solid and appreciated, I would say. And then you could put it in an envelope and you can give that little package as a gift, and maybe that would be more appropriate than a mere indication that the book is on its way. So I hope that's useful. Thank you all for tuning in over the last year and before that, and for all the support you've offered to be in the last year and a merry Christmas and happy new year.
