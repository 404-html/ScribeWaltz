Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Welcome to maps of meaning. So the first question I guess I might have is, what, why are you here? Anybody got an interesting reason? Uh, order to be able to manipulate, manipulate reality to my best interests. A good plan except for the manipulate part is often it's better to work with reality generally then manipulate it because it tends to, you know, kick back. Anybody else? Yeah. Oh yeah, of course. Actually changes for the, for the better author really. Is he any good friend and you are no wonder he threatens to this course. Six years ago in this course, changed the way I see the world. So I want to say after six years what happens now? You want to see if it'll change back.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       Well, that's good. So why did you decide why? Why after all this time did you decide to come back? Well, I thought about the things you discussed in the class over you over those six years, but now it's been a while. And I want to refresh myself and see the new experiences I have in your things. I've learned how and what I can take from it. Now. That's very, um, dedicated and hopefully useful to get a spiritual awakening. God, I hope I didn't see that he did he. Did he did any, any, like any description or was it associated with an epileptic seizure associated with vision? Oh really? Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, that can get out of hand, that sort of thing. You know, it's interesting. I mean one of the things that I experienced when I started to learn some of the things that aren't going to talk to you guys about is a very radical increase in the intensity and clarity of my dreams.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       It wasn't pleasant by the way. I thought it was useful or most useful things aren't that pleasant. So you're in for some of the same punishment. I guess that's the plan. Is that all right? Anybody else sort of have a independent interest and existential psychology, etc. So this seemed like a good place to discuss it. And I took care of all your previouS class personnel personality. When did you take that? Couple of years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's a good preparation for this class. Like is there anybody here who doesn't have any idea what this class is about and just more or less showed up because the time was right to or anything like that. So you don't really have any idea what you're in for. It looked cool and it's not also that utfc right. Well I'm going to jump right into it because why not and all spend.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       So I'm going to talk to you for about two hours and then you can have a break and then I'm going to tell you what you have to do in the class. Okay. So, but by that time you'll know if you want to take the class because you'll know whether or not you were interested in what I told you about. So I'm going to video the clAss. I always do that. And so the vIdeos will be online. the ones from previous years are online as well. So, uh, you know, hopefully that'll be a useful resource. Uh, it shouldn't take me as much setup time the next time is it did today, you know, I'm still getting used to this equipment, so. All right, so I want to tell you why I'm telling you the things that I'm going to tell you

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       mean

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       when I was approximately the same age that you people are probably a little bit older because I imagine your guys around 21 or something like that. I was probably about your age and then maybe a couple of years older. First year I was in graduate school in particular, which I guess was the 1985. So I was 23 then, um, that was in, like I said, that was in 1985 and there were a couple of times in the late 20th century where the cold war, it came to a peak and one time I guess was probably in about 1957 when I think it was 57. I hope I have my dates right. Was whenever stalad and announced that he had developed a hydrogen bomb. Now I don't know how much you guys know about hydrogen bombs, but all you really need to know about a hydrogen bomb is that they use atom bombs as a trigger.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       So they're, um, they're quite the weapon. And the ussr and the us made some very, very big ones. They're big enough to make the thing that was dropped on hiroshima look like dynamite, you know, so hundreds and hundreds of times bigger, maybe thousands of times. It's been a while since I looked into it. and then in 1962 there was a cuban missile crisis. Not a good story about that. So about 10 years ago I went down to tucson, Arizona to a conference on consciousness there. And they have that conference fairly frequently in tucson. It's, it's become quite a popular conference even though it isn't clear to me that we know anything more about consciousness than we did before the conference started. And two songs, kind of an interesting town. It's in the middle of the desert, the desert, you know, it's a big sort of sorrow, a road runner, cactuses and um, but it's also extremely dry there, which is of course what you'd expect given that it's a desert.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       so one of the things the american do with tucson is store old fighter planes there. And so there's a airplane museum, which is an amazing place that has maybe 500 planes, including john f kennedy's airforce one. Right. Which is the jet that he used to zoom around the world. it didn't even have a shower in it. By the way. It's funny because on the outside it looks like a modern jet, but to me inside it looks pretty much like it was from world war two, you know, because 19, 62 is a lot closer to world war ii than it is to now and all sorts of ways. Even the. The rockets that went to the moon look like they were built by people who were using world war ii technology, right. They're full of switches, mechanical switches and there it's pretty basic anyways, as well as the airport museum, which is a very interesting place.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       There's be 52 bombers there and all sorts of things. Those things are huge. There's also an airport graveyard where they store old fighter jets and there's a lot of old fighter jets, so there's acres and acres and acres and acres and thousands and thousands of old mothballed fighter jets lined up in the desert. So that's kind of cool in a strange way. But there was one other thing down there that I went and saw, which was a decommissioned nuclear missile site and it was a, a intercontinental ballistic missile site. 10. Those were built in the fifties and early sixties. And uh, they were major league rockets. Those things, you know, I think the silo, because we could go into the cycle of missiles weren't there anymore. We can go into the silo and it was certainly farther across in diameter than this room, I would think probably twice as twice as large as this room.

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       So you can imagine how big a missile that would be it. It's not your grandmother's missile, it's a major league piece of armament and out on the grounds that these things were underground deep underground because they didn't want them to get blown up if, if, if they were bombed. So they buried them quite a long ways down and to get into it you had to go through this massive steel door that was like a huge safe door except you know, 10 times as big and 10 times as thick and out in the yard of the nuclear missile site. There were fences with barbed wire on them of course. And there was a missile cap, you know, so it'd be the nose cone of the missile down. Some of these missiles had single warheads and which were more than sufficient to demolish a city and some of them had multiple warheads so they would shoot out into space and then come back into earth and then they essentially break apart or, or disperse into multiple missiles and then you could really bomb the hell out of whatever you were going to bomb instead of just destroying one city.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       And so the nose cone was sitting out there and that was a pretty freaky looking thing. I'll tell you, like it was big. It was about seven feet high I would think. And maybe about the same amount of cross. And it was made out of this plastic, kind of a variegated plastic material that was about three quarters of an inch thick and then it would melt off of course on re-entry because as I said, these things shot out into space and so I was kind of unnerving really in a serious way. And then, so we're at the missile site and you know, I mentioned your grandmother's missile and that there was actually a reason for that. It was a bit of foreshadowing because it was a very funny place because at the front of the missile site there was sort of this museum set up, you know, and it had pictures of reagan and gorbachev on it because they decommissioned the missile sites.

Speaker 1:          00:09:11       You know what, when, when detente occurred and then when, when perestroika hit and the soviet union started to collapse and so there was all these pictures of reagan and gorbachev from 1984. And so the museum was kind of like a time capsule of 1984. And the people who were running it were like retired arizona's. And they were like your grandparents, assuming you have retired. Arizona's for your grandparents, but they're real friendly and you know, they were pretty happy to show you their nuclear missile museum and it was sort of like being in their rec room except that it was a nuclear missile site, you know, and they were hospitable and it was weird, you know, it's like welcome to, you don't welcome people to a nuclear missile sites, you know, it's just not, it's just not reasonable. So it was very disconcerting and it was disconcerting that it was locked in the 19 eighties and then it was disconcerting that it was friendly and hospitable and you know, they were kind of proud to show it off and happy to be there.

Speaker 1:          00:10:04       And then when you went down into the nuclear missile silo, proper, the control center, it's sort of like, like star trek, you know, from 19, 66 or 1967, except more primitive. I don't remember if the star trek control command area was modeled after the nuclear missile site control systems or if it was the other way around, but I suspect it was. They were modeled after the nuclear controls, but that was really 1950. It's like the whole place was painted in that pastel green, you know, late fifties and early sixties. People really liked, and it was, it had this 19 fifties, um, what would you call it, an aesthetic and you wouldn't necessarily think that a nuclear missile site would have an aesthetic, but it does. And it looked like high tech, 1957 in 1957 technology. And so they brought you into the control room and the control desk was probably, or the molecule or whatever you might call it, was about three times as long as this maybe four times.

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       Well, not pretty impressive piece of machinery. And the way you launch the missiles was not too secure in my humble opinion. What happened was one guy wore the key around his neck and another guy who wore the key around his neck. And then in order to launch the sites, you had to put the keys in the same time. And they were far enough apart so nobody could stretch their arms, you know, which was the kind of the high tech part of it. So. And you had to put the key in and then you both had to turn the key for 10 seconds. Okay. So now one of the things that you may know about ballistic missiles or you may not, is there not cruise missiles? Man, onCe you set those things off, they're not coming back. There are bullets. That's what makes them ballistic. So you know, if you aim a gun at someone and you shoot and you decide halfway when the bullets halfway there that maybe that wasn't the good thing to do, it's a little late because you're not telling that bullet to come back.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       And it's the same with ballistic missiles and those things are going a lot faster than the bullets. You know, like at 22 bullet goes about the speed of sound, 600 miles an hour or so. But a ballistic missile, nothing has to go seven miles a second to get out of the gravity of theory. Now I'm not sure they go quite that fast because that's escape velocity, right? You need to do that to get out of the gravitational wealth. But to get out there into space, you have to be damn close to seven miles a second. And so it's a bullet, very large bullet with a very explosive hand on it going seven miles at second. And once You turn those two keys, man, it's good. That's it. There's no, there's no turning back. That's that. And so theY took us through a simulated launch, which still kind of, it's still an uncanny feeling, remembering that, you know, because it was, it's a hell of a thing to apprehend. And then they told us that the keys Were in once, right? So we were 10 seconds away. Now they wouldn't tell us when, but we know it was during the cuban missile crisis.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       So, you know, there are a couple of times in the latter part of the 20th century where we made it through, uh, like the eye of a needle. We barely bloody well made it. And the cuban missile crisis was one of those points. But the, the early eighties things were heating up pretty badly to, you know, in about 1984, there was a movie that came out called the day after you guys probably don't know about the day after, but it was the most watched movie that had ever been broadcast on tv at that point. And basically what it showed us, what a city would be like the day after the United States had been bombed into total desolation by a soviet missile attack. And you know, it was a pretty hair raising movie. And one of the things that was quite interesting about it was the ronald reagan later said that he watched that movie and that was actually part of the reason that he entered into detente talks with, with the soviets.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       Now you know, reagan and being basically scaring the hell out of the soviets. He called him an evil empire, which liberals weren't very happy about. But the soviets man, they were an evil empire. There's absolutely no doubt about it. You know, it's not obvious how many people the soviets killed during their, their communist revolution. And in the years following that. But the estimates range from 20 to $60 million now, that's a lot of people like even if it's $20 million, that's three times as many people were killed in the holocaust, you know the song, the soviet starved 6 million ukrainians in the 19 thirties and that was just to get warmed up. So the idea that the soviets were an eviL empire, it's like it's a strong word, but there's absolutely no doubt that it was true. And the more we learn about what happened, especially during the this period, although lennon was no picnic, you know, he, he pretty much created the stalinists monster that followed him.

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       The more we learned about it, the more horrible if it comes, you know, and the soviet system was operated, the economy fundamentally ran on slave labor, you know, for what economy there was. And you know, what happened with reagan and park was, well first of all, the soviet union was falling apart because there's just so long you can keep a sinking ship afloat, you know, and something that big can die 20 years before it falls over. You know, a system like that can stumble along half got it and, and still manage and so by the time reagan come along, the thing, it probably pretty much burned itself out as a consequence of internal contradictions, but he ramped up the american military spending to a staggering degree and part of the idea behind that, at least that's what republicans would have everyone believe in, it might be true, was that they're just going to spend the russians right into bankruptcy and they basically did.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       and so that was that for the soviet union and it fell over 1989, which was like, that was a good day. That was a really good day. And the weird thing is no one saw it coming, you know, and that was, that was, that was shocking. It was like one day the soviet union was there and the next day the soviet union was gone and there were no cia analysts that said, hey, yeah, there were about ready to crumble. You know, you just have to blow on them and they'll fall over. It was a shock to everyone, you know? And then it was very iffy in the aftermath whether or not it would hold 'em yeltsin who was a terrible drunkard, but actually a pretty courageous while he was a russian, you know, he was a pretty courageous guy and he faced down a reestablishment by the totalitarians on a tank, you know, so that was good for him because that was pretty frightening to. Anyway. So I'm telling you all this because when I grew up, most of the people I knew were convinced that there was no bloody way we're gonna make it to the 20th century,

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       you know, when I think I can remember discussing this with all of my friends frequently, you know, and um, you know, some people kind of used that as an excuse not to get their life together. Like, you know, what the hell's the point, you know, we're going to blow ourselves up anyways. So, you know, I might as well drink until I fall over. And you know, that's not particularly a moral way of looking at it. But I'll tell you, like, there, there was no shortage of thinking that this was so insane that it was going to. Siri certainly am an absolute catastrophe. And it damn near did like it wasn't some kind of collective delusion, you know, there, there were times, in fact, there was a story recently published about it, uh, a russian general who was given the order to launch the missiles. Uh, there was a mistake and reading on their display, showing the missiles were coming from north America across the pools into Russia.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       And he was told to launch and he didn't like, well, good for him, you know, but that's a little too close really. You know, and there's all sorts of other crazy things that happened during that period of time. So for example, I read this book by an ex kgb guy who said he worked in a biological warfare, a lab in the soviet union, 'em. They'd killed a number of people by accident when some of their bugs got out, you know, on the new order of 500 people, which is a lot of people, but it's not, you know, like 250,000 people, but it's a lot of people. But what those geniuses we're trying to do mr krause, ebola, smallpox, smallpox, smallpox is unbelievably.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       The combination of smallpox in ebola is extraordinarily easy to transmit and very, very, very fatal. And so they were trying to cross it and then aerosolized it so that you could distribute it in canisters and blow it over cities, you know, nice bit of scientific investigation. Perfectly reasonable scientific question. Can it be done a little sketchy on the moral side you might say. So, you know, it was a pretty crazy period of time and I mean, all human history. What does the esky say about human history? The one thing you can say about that, it's not rational, right? He said the very word sticks in your throat. So, you know, it's always been crazy and it's crazy now, but it was really crazy then. And so we got through that and thank god, you know, as far as I'm concerned, the world is a lot better place now than it was. Well it is 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago, things are way better now. You know, you hear a lot of doom and gloom about how we're going to destroy the planet,

Speaker 2:          00:19:01       but,

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       but we probably aren't, you know, the population is going to stabilize out at about 9 billion. That's what the projections look like. We already have about seven. We can handle another two. There's kind of, there's gonna be some extinctions were eating up the ocean like insane. You know, purina, that's mostly a fault of public policy. But it looks like we're probably going to squeak through the century with a bit of damage and then things will settle down. You know, it's, it's highly probable if there's anything vaguely human left in 100 years that the big problem will be. That population is rapidly decreasing. That's already happening in european countries is happening in Japan. It's going to happen in China. So by the year 2100, the most populous country in the world is going to be Nigeria, not China. China's gonna lose people like mad because they had one child policy, right? And everybody in China is getting old so you know that it's not going to be hiker populated. So anyways, so I was interested in all of this because, you know, I kind of felt that I'd grown up, I didn't feel like I'd grown up under a shadow. I grown up under it's shadow, you know, and it was something in the back of our minds all the time. And then there was a question underneath that, a couple of them and one was

Speaker 1:          00:20:14       how, why is this possible? How is this possible? How could it be that the world could divide itself up into two armed camps like hyper armed camps, right? tens of thousands of nuclear missiles more than enough to wipe out the enemy many times over. I don't remember what the american arsenal peak debt, but I think it was more than 50,000 nuclear weapons. I don't know if there are 50,000 towns in the soviet union, you know, maybe they were going to bomb bomb moscow 50 times or something, but after the first two or three years, probably more or less irrelevant. So it was really, it was really crazy. You know, I don't know if you know this, but I believe this was during the kennedy era. I hope I've got thiS right. one of kennedy's genius boys came up with the [inaudible] kennedy's administration was run by a lot of harvard graduates and ivy league graduates and so, you know, they were supposed to be pretty intelligent, but intelligence and wisdom are not the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:21:07       But anyways, um, they established a policy which was called mutual assured destruction, which means if you hit me, I kill you and then you kill me. And so it'd be better if we just didn't bother. and the acronym was mad, right? Mutual assured destruction. It's like, you know, just thinking about that it, it's a chilling thought. It's like what horrible entity thought that up as a joke. You know, when you think, well, does that sum. It says that some politician's idea of width, like where'd that come from? So that's a hell of a thing to make a joke about, you know, mad. Well, that was right. It was definitely mad, you know, and the odd thing is, is that we didn't blow ourselves up and we didn't have a third world war and you know, you, you can't make a solid claim that the invention of nuclear weapons was necessarily the worst thing that could have happened, you know, because even the soviets who were completely insane, and of course the model was to probably even worse.

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       They weren't insane enough to start a nuclear war. Now stalin, there's evidence, there's debate about it, but there was, and there's evidence that stalin was basically murdered partly by khrushchev, was who was his, who was his successor, um, when stalin died, khrushchev and three other people were in his house and what happened in stalin's house the night he died is not clear. But I read a book recently called stolen. Interestingly enough, that was written by a guy who had access to the full communist party archives, you know, which was relatively new thing and that was his conclusion and he also believed that stalin was gearing up to do it, an invasion of europe and that he didn't give a damn how many cities would have to be bombed in order for the soviets to roll through. And stalIn. He was like that, you know, stalin was perfectly capable of taking entire nations of people out in eastern europe by train and shipping them out to siberia in the middle of the winter with nothing to eat and no tools and letting them live, which of course they didn't.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       And that meant women, children, men, you know, shorn of all their belongings and thrust out into the middle of nowhere to perish or, or, or live as they saw fit. And if they perished so much, the better as far as stalin was concerned. And so he wasn't exactly the sort of person. The idea of a nuclear war would necessarily stop. And it's certainly possible that that's what he was hoping for. You know, because when we look at people like stalin and hitler, we think, well, you know, thereafter world domination, you know, and you think, well in some sense that's kind of a positive motivation, right? I mean not really, but it's like if you have a core vat say and someone steals it, you can think, well, I know why they stole it. They want to have the corvette, you know, it's, it's an understandable motivation to want power.

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       It's not necessarily an admirable one, although sometimes power is a perfectly reasonable thing to pursue, but I don't have any idea why we ever assumed that those guys were after victory. Like you should never make the presupposition that everyone is out to When some people are out to lose and the more people they can take wIth them, the better. You know. And when hitler died, he committed suicide in a bunker way down below berlin. West berlin was on fire and europe was burning. It's like, as far as I can tell, that was exactly what hitler was after right from the beginning. You know, he was interested in fire as a purifying agent. You know, he's a fire worship or in some sense, because if you look at the nuremberg gatherings of the nazis, you know, they're spectacular, spectacular celebrations, unbelievably dramatic and impressive, and they frequently featured fire and fire's up purifying agent, you know, and hitler, by the end of world war ii was, he was pretty contemptuous of the germans because they really hadn't served him well.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       It wasn't like he thought, well maybe it wasn't such a good idea to start a whole second world war, you know, because he was a little on the narcissistic side we might say. But by the time the russians came marching in, in Germany was in ruins. Hitler was perfectly happy to have the allies tromp all over the citizens because that's what they deserved anyways. And so that's the sort of guy he was. And so why we would assume that he wanted to win just because that's what he said is something I've never been able to understand. You know, the kids who shot up columbine didn't want to, when they wanted to kill as many people as possible to make a point and then they wanted to kill themselves just in case you didn't exactly get the point and the point was the more destruction the vendor and if I asked to go along with it, hey, no problem.

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       That just makes me a little bit more serious than I might've otherwise be. And so those sorts of motivations are not pleasant to understand, but we have enough documentation about events like that, you know, especially the mass killings. Those guys have written down exactly why they do it. Now. I have some excellent books on extraordinary vengeful, a map serial killers at mass murderers. I know exactly how they think. There's a great book if you're interested in this sort of thing called pans, ram p a n zed r a, m and carl pants. Ram waS a serial killer and rapist who lIve pretty much early in the 20th century and he was a tough delinquency sorta kid from a large family and when he was, you know, 13, 14, they sent them off to some reform school and it was run by the same sort of people that run canada's residential schools and you know, so those were basically predators on children and of course he was raped and, and, and, and brutalized and tormented and in all sorts of horrible ways and, but he was a tough guy and when he came out he decided that, you know, the human race really wasn't worth that much and that he was going to reek as much mayhem as he possibly could for the rest of his life.

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       He raped a thousand men, killed dozens of people. He kept track of the dollar value of the buildings. He burned down like this was a serious scott and he wasn't. He was bent on destruction and that's that what his. What were his dying words? First of all, there was a committee, I believe, of women who intervened on behalf of him because they were anti a capital punishment and he said to them, if I remember correctly that he wished the human race had one neck so that he could put his hands around it and squeeze. So you know, that was his way of pointing out to the people who didn't think that maybe capital punishment was justified in his case that maybe they weren't thinking clearly. And then to the hang man, he said, hurry up you who's your bastard? I could kill 10 men in the time it takes you to hang me.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       So you know, you don't get a statement like that from someone who isn't thoroughly committed to what he's doing. So the situation in the world found itself involved in really had me thinking, you know, part of it was, well, what the hell is going on with all these weapons and how can it possibly be that anyone thinks that that's a reasonable solution? And how did it come about that this could even occur? And what are we thinking? And then so there was that and then there was also the why are people so damn convinced on each side of this argument that they are right enough to risk everything for, you know, which is a perfectly good question. And then there was the malevolence issue, like how much of this has nothing to do with wanting to see your side when and everything to do with wanting to see everything lose, you know. And then, oh, then there was another issue which was, well our are both sides wrong

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       are both sides, right? Because that's more of a cultural relativist approach, right? It's like, yeah, yeah. The communists believed one thing and the bloody capitalist believe another and they're just as bad. And who were you lIke, who believes what is completely arbitrary because belief systems are arbitrary and so maybe they're both writer, they're both wrong. And I thought, well, either of those conclusions was pretty damn dismal because if they're both right, then well, what are you going to do? Have them talk it out. I don't think so. And if they're both wrong, well that's not much better. And then if one's right in the other's wrong, well, does that mean anything like is it possible for one belief system to be more right than another belief system? Because of course that's certainly not attendant of moral relativism and you might think about that as the standard. Certainly the standard intellectual approach to morality and probably has been for the last hundred years, I think by the way that that's a reprehensible morality

Speaker 2:          00:29:24       w

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       and what I'll tell you as the course, whereas we move through the course because one of the things are trying to find out was why is what we were fighting for, you know, assuming that you give the west a bit of the benefit of the doubt and assume that some of the things that we stand for, we actually stand for and aren't just posturing and parading. Was that grOunded in anything or was it just arbitrary opinion?

Speaker 2:          00:29:49       So that's what we're going to talk about. We're going to talk about that,

Speaker 1:          00:29:53       why people believe the things they believe, what psychological function at the beliefs,

Speaker 2:          00:29:59       uh, uh, perform.

Speaker 1:          00:30:03       We're going to talk about malevolence and aS far as I can tell like malevolence is the willingness to do evil and I think the best is the best definition of evil. That, and I thought about this for a long time, it's like actually what constitutes evil. It's complicated and we'll talk about a lot, but I think if you want a one line summary, it's the desire to do harm for the sake of the harm.

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       So you have to think about it as a kind of art form. So like if you're. look, if, if, if you have a terrorist and you think he's hitting an atom bomb in a stadium and you think, well, he's not going to tell me you have good evidence, he's not going to tell me unless I torture them. I don't think you should torture because tortures wrong. But you know, if you're doing that and you really believe these hidden atom bomb in a stadium, well at least you have some justification for what you're doing and it's not necessarily that what you're doing is evil. It might be wrong, it might be misguided. I mean, who's to say in a situation like that, it should certainly be illegal, but at least you can say, well, there is a plausible explanation for it, but lots of situations where there is absolute horror, there's no plausible explanation for it whatsoever. So I can give you an example. so for example, one of the things that used to happen in auschwitz,

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       if I remember correctly, auschwitz, I don't know what you guys envisioned when you envisioned concentration camps, you know, like concentration camp. It's a funny name first of all because it's not really at camp. You know what I mean? But a concentration camp is like a prison, you know, and that's easy to scan, easy to envision them, like a prison, those bloody things where cities, right? They have tens of thousands of people in sort of their massive. At least they were large towns. So these are very big places anyways. You know, at the typical concentration camp, the trains would come rolling in and of course people have been packed into the damn trains, like, well worse than animals. They'd be packed standing and lots of people just died in the cars because especially if they are old or little in or had some respiratory problem or something like that because they'd overheat if they were cramped right in the middle of people or they'd freeze to death on the outsIde because they're pushed right against the wood or you know.

Speaker 1:          00:32:05       But that was okay. It just made the job easier when they finally landed at auschwitz, you know, and then once they were in auschwitz, well then the guards used to like to play tricks on them. And so one trick would be to get some poor son of a bitch who, you know, being torn away from his country, who'd had his family destroyed, who knew where he was going, who was half dead for six different reasons. Who iS among strangers. Maybe he dIdn't even speak or she didn't even speak the language that was most common there, you know, guarded by absolutely ruthless barbarians who wanted to do nothing else but make people as miserable as possible in is in the most creative

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       possible ways. And so what they would do with some of the prisoners would say give them wet sacks of salt. and so those weigh about 100 pounds and they'd have them carry them from one side of the compound to the other. Well, you know, that's not so bad when you're really, really Innovative in your capacity to perpetrate evil. But the next thing they did was carried them back. And so you think about that, you know, and this is something half to understand if you really want to understand evil, is that it's an aesthetic. It's An art form. You know. And the reason that that was such a terrible torture was, well, partly because these people were already ruined and 100 pounds is a lot of salt and maybe it was winter and they didn't have any shoes. And you know, like it's just brutal labor.

Speaker 3:          00:33:22       But solzhenitsyn, when he wrote about the gulag archipelago, he said, you know, even if you were a prisoner, they were having you build a wall. You can at least take some damn pride in building the wall. You know, you could lay some bricks out and you can think, well this sucks and it's really horrible and everything, but you know, I built a straight wall that something. BuT if you have to take a sack of wet salt, the one side of the compound and then carry it back, like the net consequence of that is zero, right? It's zero. Then of course the famous signs on the outside of the concentration camps were work will set you free right now. That's another joke. It's like mutual assured destruction, you know, and the only way you can, you know, a job like that is st stanek, there's no other way to think about it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:12       The a job like that comes out of the deepest depths of human malevolence and then the work that sets you free when it wasn't even work, right? It was, it was at parody of work and the purpose of the work was to destroy you, but not quickly because that's not as terrible as destroying you slowly, you know. So these are very, very terrible things. And so part of what I thought about in relationship to people's belief systems was, you know, people are territorial chimps, I don't know if you know this or not, but chimps basically go to war. Jane goodall diScovered that a couple of decades ago and it really, really was hard on her because she was kind of a ruse soviet. So for those of you don't know joe, john jacques rousseau is a french philosopher and, you know, french philosophers have a lawful lot of sins on their conscience.

Speaker 3:          00:35:02       And then of course it was. So, it was certainly one of them because russell was the first, like what fully articulate promoter of the idea that human beings were basically good. So we know we had a good soul in a moral sense, but we were corrupted by our social institutions, you know. So, uh, so, you know, as far as russo was concerned, it was kind of a noble savage idea. You know, like the human being in their raw form has a pure soul. And then you know, you, you give them to parents and you've given them to teachers and you know, they'd get into politics and there's group disputes and then they get all corrupted, you know, and well, you know, that's, I don't even know what to say about that except that it's absolutely moronic keynote. But it's an appealing proposition if you're naive optimist.

Speaker 3:          00:35:47       I mean, first of all, it doesn't explain where malevolence comes from because the people created the institution. So you know, it just puts you into an infinite regress chicken and egg if the institutions are reprehensible. BUt the people who built them aren't. Then where did the reprehensible element that the institutions come from, you know, he might think it's an autogenerated consequences of organizing people. But you know, it's a pretty specious theory. So I'm of course hit. He had a counterpart of philosophical counterpart, Thomas Hobbs and hobbs said basically exactly the opposite, that, you know, people were vicious and cruel unless you put them in straight jackets fundamentally and made them obey. Then everything was going to go immediately to help you know. And when, when you saw what happened in Iran after the americans won't stand in, the power structure disintegrated, you know, it was a hell of a lot more like hobbs.

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       Then it was like rousseau, right? You took out the, the, the, the tyrant at the top. And it wasn't like everybody got all peaceful and loving. All of a sudden it was like absolute chaos reign. So, you know, of course you can rationalize that. But anyways, roost. So by the way, had five children by a made a illiterate, made that, that it was as mr. And he put every single one of them in orphanages where, of course they perished because orphanages at russo's times were not exactly, you know, a luxury resort. And even up until the beginning of the 20th century, most children who are under one years of age who were in care institutions died partly disease and that sort of thing. But often because they just weren't touched, they weren't cared for physically. Even if they were fed and you know, 200 years ago they weren't even fed.

Speaker 3:          00:37:22       So anyway, so you know, but nonetheless, you know, people have people maintain the optimistic idea that human beings were basically good and that they were corrupted by institutions. It's a common idea among, I think it's a very common idea in universities, you know, because university people are always complaining about the corrupt nature of this institution and that institution, you know, well they sit here in the warm with the electricity on, you know, surrounded by wealth that characterizes maybe one 10th of one percent of the entire world's population and you know, they complained about how we'll press they are and how will we get no nasty? The institutions are, it's like, yeah, well you actually have been to a nasty institution, cause nasty institutions. They get pretty damn bad and most of the institutions in the world are like that. So it isn't exactly clear that people are pristine in their heart and then corrupted by institutions. Although I'm sure that happens patent depends around, for example. So anyways, this has been a line of philosophical speculation. That's, that's, that's, I would say constituted one of the unspoken fundamental assumptions of, of western intellectuals in particular, and jane thought, you know, it'd be in many ways the same way she thought chimps were basically at all. They're just animals. They are okay. They coexist relatively peacefully with one another, you know, even, um,

Speaker 3:          00:38:51       Carl Rogers, who I talk about a bit in my personality class, you know, he basically thought that people were fundamentally good and that institutions make the badge. But uh, the problem is you look at chimps and a fair bit like us, you know, bonobos, you can look at them too, and they're, they're genetically quite related to us and they're quite a bit different than chimps, but. So we're sort of a weird mixture of the two in some sense. But champs, like those things, there is no evidence that they really have any internal control over the regression at all. You know, there was a horrible case about two years ago where a woman was interacting with the chimp and it tore her to pieces and they can do that man. Like it took her face right off and they have the strength of about six men, like an, an, uh, an adult male chimp can break a 300 pound test cable, you know, those things are really, really strong and they are not friendly, you know, like.

Speaker 3:          00:39:42       So in arnhem zoo for example, there's been a troop of chimps there that have been followed by it, extremely brilliant primatologists named frans de waal who's work I would very highly recommend. The wall is a very smart guy and he's looked at the origins of morality and chimpanzees, you know, from a biological perspective, it's very, very nice work, very, very clearheaded. But you know, he's recounted absolutely horrific stories of chimpanzee behavior. So one of the stories he talked about, for example, was, you know, when you kind of have this idea that there's a mail chimp hierarchy, it's roughly true. There's a female hierarchy too, but the males and the chimp world anyways tend to be the dominant ones. And you know, you kind of think of a dominant primate like a prize fighter, you know, pretty much he's ruling because of his physical prowess. Now that turns out not to exactly be true, but in this particular case, the guy who was running the chimp troop was a bit of a bully and he wasn't very good at making friends, you know, and that's not such a good idea because no matter how tough you are by yourself to weaker guys can probably take you out.

Speaker 3:          00:40:44       And that's what happened during friends to wall observations and two chimps attack the leader and they had a coalition. They were grooming each other. They repels, you know, in chimps are pretty good at remembering like risk reciprocal relationships and having friendships really like they have a very highly social structure. Hey, just tore him apart like the things they did to him like you don't even want to talk about. And so chimps have really no upper limit on their capacity for aggression and when they hunt, because chimps, honda and they liked me, they often call us monkeys and they weigh about 35 pounds, like a cola. This monkeys a major league animal and they eat those things alive and they scream while they're being killed. And that does not slow the chimps down one bit. So it's not obvious that the chimp is really a creature of a lot of empathy, especially the males.

Speaker 3:          00:41:28       The females are likely more empathic because they have to deal with infants for longer periods of time. What seems to inhibit the aggression of mail chimp's isn't anything they hold internally. It seems that when they get hyper aggressive in the truth, the truth gets more and more agitated, basically shuts them down. So you can imagine maybe you're in a rough bar and some dingbat who is, you know, half psychopathic and has had two pints of alcohol is starting to cause a tremendous amount of trouble and he's not going to shut himself down, but the rest of the troop might. And that kind of means that the control over the aggression is externalized. It's not a consequence of super ego control. And we like to think that we actually control our own aggression, but I'm not so sure about that. You know, if you read things like there's a great book, horrifying book published about 20 years ago called the rape of nanking, which is while the woman who wrote it committed suicide.

Speaker 3:          00:42:19       So that sort of suffices to tell you what the rape of nan king is about and it's a story about the japanese in world war ii going into a chinese kitty's city called nan king where I believe about 350,000 people were killed. And the nazis in that story where the good guys. So you can imagine the kind of brutality that might be an been occurring there. But there's absolutely perfectly well documented evidence suggesting that the japanese soldiers engaged in competitive brutality. You know. And so really what happened was the japanese had been pretty militarized by world war two and nate adopted a prussian education system and the prussians and the germans, you know, pre, pre 20th century germans, they were basically interested in educating obedient soldiers, you know, because it was a militaristic culture and the japanese kind of adopted that because they were sick of being kicked around by the europeans and pretty successfully because they defeated the russians, you know, in the early stages of rural or of the 20th century.

Speaker 3:          00:43:15       It wAs quite a shock to everyone in europe and, you know, cause for great celebration in Japan and no wonder. But anyways, they militarize the hell out of their young men and taught them basically that the japanese were a master race, you know, and that other people were subhuman. It's, it's a very common human way of thInking. By the way. I would say it's really the default way that human tribes think about other tribes. You know, I mean, it's a little more complicated than that because human tribes tend to trade with other tribes. So it's not all demonization, but a lot of it is, you know, and if you look around the world in the anthropological literature, what you see Is that the names that most tribes have for themselves is something like that human beings or the people you know, indicating that the rest of the people are reading people, god only they're barbarians or you know, they live out where the sun is being eaten by the dragon of the night or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:44:05       And you know, the word barbarian is a, is a word that comes from the greeks making fun of how non-greek spoke, you know, they thought they went bar bar, bar, bar, bar, something like that. So anyways, what good. All phone was that? The chimps, like the chimp adolescents in particular in particular, the males would patrol the borders of their territory in groups of three or four and with often with a female or two, but the females didn't seem to be really the, the, the, they weren't, they were more part of the group rather than the initiators. But what the chimps would do is if they found a chip from another troop, even if that was a chimp that had moved from their troop in the not too distant past and joined another, because sometimes the males leave and sometimes they go to other troops. If they are numbered them, they would tear them to pIeces and it looked like that's why they were doing the border patrol.

Speaker 3:          00:44:57       They're looking for trouble there. Gangs roughly speaking, they're looking for trouble. But the point of it is, is that, and they would only attack if they outnumbered because chimps can, I wouldn't say they count, but they have a rudimentary notion of group size. You know, I don't think you can count without being able to verbalize, but you can estimate at a glance. And so, you know, when I mean, when I say tear apart, that's exactly what I mean. There's no upper limit on the brutality. And so good all discovered that first. And she didn't tell anybody about it. Now she had her reasons. I mean some of them I think radiological, oh the lovely chimps, you know, and fair enough. But some of it was also she thought that maybe the chimps had been corrupted as a consequence of their contact with human beings and that their natural behavior had been somehow transform, you know, and that's not, it's reasonable to be cautious if you're a scientist before you go out and say, hey, chimps go to war.

Speaker 3:          00:45:51       Isn't that revolutionary? Because it is, right? Because it just, it just ends. The idea that our warlike and malevolent nature is a function of culture. Like if chimps do it well, what did they perverted by their own culture? I don't think so. You know, I mean there are more and less violent chimp cultures and there are more and less violent baboons culture. So there is some cultural variation. But since goodall's time, this sort of behavior is being documented on many, many chimp troops. So that's us in a nutshell and it's not self evident that if you put the typical adolescent male say who's not a very well formulated personality and you know, because he's not that individual and you know, he hasn't seen much of the world and the typical guy that goes into the army is, you know, he's kind of on the margins of society.

Speaker 3:          00:46:39       Maybe he's not particularly bright and I'm not trying to be insulting by that, but you know, it's not exactly a high end job. You put someone that like that either place where there's no rules. It's like who leads where. There are no rules while the probability that it's the friendliest, nicest people is very, very low. and so what seemed to happen in nan king was the japanese soldiers took their cues from the people with the most brutal imaginations. So you know, when people can have pretty brutal imaginations, especially when they start to compete. So, so I was interested in that. You know, what exactly was at the core of that malevolence mean, and I think it is uniquely human. The chimps. So go tear another chimp apart, but basically they just, they're just, they're going to kill him, you know, that's their goal and maybe it takes a while, but it's not going to take four weeks.

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       Whereas if you're a human being, you know you can draw out your enemies death for a very, very long period of time and part of that is the desire to produce the misery and suffering that's attended on the death and only human beings have the imagination to do that. That's why I think, and we'll return to this. That's why I think that in the book of genesis, when people's eyes are open and they become self conscious, they always are all always all solar. Learn the difference between good and evil. Once your eyes are open and you know what you're like, once you know you're naked and vulnerable, then you can exploit that in other people. And only human beings have that kInd of knowledge. So the fact that we know that we can be hurt makes us particularly dangerous. Because if I know how I can be heard, I sure know how you can be heard.

Speaker 3:          00:48:11       So you know, it's a nasty situation and then of course I'm kind of interested in the motivation for that. So you know, you look at the columbine kids for example, and you know, the mayhem and they produced was trivial compared to the mayhem they were planning. You know, if it was up to those two guys, they would have bombed detroit flat that, you know, they, they had visions of doing exactly that and it was immediate spectacular. And they didn't do it because they were, you know, poor kids in some sense who were bullied. That is an idiotic explanation. It's not true. You know, everybody's at bloody outsider. You know what I mean? I'm sure there isn't a single one of you that don't have a memory from junior high where you were an outcast in one way or another, maybe some of the word, but it's very, very common.

Speaker 3:          00:48:52       And to think of that as sufficient motivation to, you know, shoot people cold bloodedly in high highschool. Sorry, that's a little on the naive side. So I'm very, very interested in what makes up that motivation. You know, because malevolence plus nuclear weapons is not a good combination and so it doesn't really look to me like we can afford that kind of unconscious malevolence anymore because we're just too damn powerful and if the wrong person ends up being like that with the wrong weapons, it's like game's over. So I've also become convinced while I'd been looking through this, that the problem that we're discussing is not associate logical problem or a political problem or an economic problem because you know a lot of what you read and a lot of political scientists who tell you this sort of thing because they're basically almost always closet marxists.

Speaker 3:          00:49:38       They'll tell you that the reason for for struggle for competition between nations economic and I think that's observed not because it isn't true, but because it doesn't actually address a more fundamental issue, which is okay, well economic struggle is a struggle about who has access to what's valued, but there's nothing self evident about what's valued. That's the problem. It's like you know, you have the idea of natural resource. It's like oil is not a natural resource till you have an automobile. You know, I mean the interplay between cultural values, structures, and what constitutes a natural resources so tightly put together except for maybe air and water that saying, well, there are natural resources which means things of intrinsic value and that's what people fight over. Well, you, you, you did, you made the mystery mystery disappear inside the word natural resource, but you haven't solved anything.

Speaker 3:          00:50:36       So the question is, well, why would people fight over things that they value? Well, because there's all sorts of things you could value, like peace for example. So it's not a suFficient explanation and uh, and it's also not clear to me that people's primary motivations are economic. you know, it's one element of motivation. It's not trIvial, but I would say the motivation isn't even really economic. It's more related to dominance, hierarchy position. And that's fundamentally a sexual motivation, especially for men because men are higher up in the dorm, male dominance hierarchy, then women are much more attracted to them. so you could make, you could say, well that's economics. I don't think it is. So this economic is just a secondary consequences of that. And I don't believe by the way that that's a theory because there's excellent documentation on hyper aggression in adolescent males and the best evidence suggests that adolescent males become hyper aggressive when you put them in situations where they can't win and then they become hyper aggressive and ended attempt to formulate a dominance hierarchy so that some of them can rise to the top and basically be attractive. So you can call that economic if you want. But I think it's, I think you're pushing your luck with that sort of explanation so. Well. So that's basically the background.

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       So when I was investigating this, I first started studying political science, you know, and I actually liked that quite a bit in the first couple of years because they're just basically reading political philosophy, you know, and it's actually worthwhile reading great political philosophers because a, they could think and that's a really good thing. And b, you think like they think even if you don't know it, right? Because one of the hallmarks of a great philosopher is that his ideas or her ideas sink into the culture so deeply that like 100 years after they've written, everybody just thinks they always thought that way. Like that'S one of the thIngs say that's happened to freud. I mean everybody kind of understands that there's an unconscious and that people are motivated by sexual, you know, sexual drive. It's like, what? So, you know, what's so brilliant about that? Like, well yeah, it's obvious ones. Freud points it out.

Speaker 2:          00:52:43       No. So.

Speaker 3:          00:52:54       So anyways, I started, I took political science first and literature, which I found was also extremely useful because great literary people have great things to say. Like dostoevsky mean what his novels just absolutely flattened me. He's so brilliant and I've never read anyone who takes moral question so seriously, like. So for example, if you look at crime and punishment, which is a book I would highly recommend, dostoevsky is the absolute model of a true intellectual. And I say that because in crime and punishment for example, dostoevsky has this character named roscoe and off and you guys can identify with risk. and the call to some degree because he's about your age and he's a university student now. He's having a rough time because he's in st petersburg and he doesn't have any money and he lives in this tiny little room which has basically a bunch of clothes on the bed that he can sleep in and he's starving to death.

Speaker 3:          00:53:48       It can only, only has bread to eat and he's a law student so he's having a rough time, you know, in st petersburg, the end of the nIneteenth century is kind of a rough place. So he hasn't, some of you guys probably have is pretty bad, but was calling the call. I've had it pretty bad. And so he's half starved and half delirious. And, and he's also very, his ideas are very adult because he's one of the first russians who really considered themselves an atheist. So, you know, Russia was a medieval society until the late name, 19 hundreds. it was sorta like quebec before 1950. [inaudible] before 1960. And I'm serious about that because quebec was really the last european country, so to speak, that underwent a secularization. And that happened in in about 1960 and quebec families went from an average size of about 12 to 13 to about one point two lowest birth rate in the world and see all the quebecois while we're married and none of them are now and they were all catholic and hardly any of them are now and was an overnight transformation.

Speaker 3:          00:54:44       And that's partly what fed quebec nationalism because there was actually a study that was, or a study that was released by gallup organization. I only heard it referred to in one meeting where they indicated that if you were a lapsed catholic and in, in, in, in quebec, you were 10 times more likely to be a separate that that's really worth thinking about, right? Because religion collapses and what happens is nationalism just rises up to, to take its place because you'd need a bloody belief structure because what else? What are you going to do? Wander around aimlessly. That's not fun. It's not useless are useful, you know, so you just jumped from one structure of belief to another or you fall apart. So. So that's also something that's very much worth knowing. Finding ways, so all risk on the cog. He thinks he's a pretty educated guy and he's pretty smart and he is pretty smart, but he's like smart, arrogant, not smart wise because he's 21.

Speaker 3:          00:55:36       What the hell does he know? He doesn't know anything but he's smart and he's contemptuous of other people because he can probably smarter than most of them, you know, and he confuses that with health, with knowing what's going on. And so he lives in this little horrible apartment and he has a horrible landlady and she really like this is where is a genius. Like cove hates his landline and then dostoevsky tells you why and you'd think, well yeah, I'd hate her too. So she's miserable. She owns a bunch of apartments. She charges too much rent for them. She tortures all the people that rent from her in every possible way she can, but places are filthy. She doesn't provide any furniture. She hoards money and doesn't do anything with it. So she lives in absolute poverty and you know, and, and in film and she's a cruel person in every possible way.

Speaker 3:          00:56:27       Plus she has this nice who isn't very bright, you know, same intellectually impaired and she basically treats her like to slave so she's not doing anyone any good and that's where to nicholson and then he gets a letter from his mother and his mother basically tells them that his sister is going to go marry this rich guy because she's in love with him and a battle solve all of his monetary problems so he can keep going to law school, but he reads between the lines and you know, he realizes pretty quiCkly that this rich guys are real like miserly scum rat and he's going to treat his sister and his mother absolutely miserably. And his sister doesn't really love in many Ways and the only reason she's marrying him so that risk all knockoff can go to school. So he's not very happy with that and you know, fair enough, you know, you can understand his motivation.

Speaker 3:          00:57:12       So he starving and he's full of these ideas. Also the sort of meat chicken, you know, so and like atheistic ideas hit Russia really hard because it went from seriously orthodox christian and every possible way to unbelievably skeptical in one generation and it just, it just fractured the society. It's partly why communism became so absolutely attractive for the russians and dostoevsky also details that extremely brIlliantly in a book called the possessed of the devils. So it's a wonderful book. It's hard to get into. You have to read about 200 pages before it really kicks in, but you know, that's. And all those sorta like that. So anyways, risk on the curve is he's thinking these sort of superman ish rationalistic ideas and he thinks, well, you know, there's no evidence that there's any real moral hierarchy and you can easily make a case that the reason that people aren't really moral, they're just cowardly.

Speaker 3:          00:58:06       And this is a nietzschean observation, right? Most of what you call your morality isn't morality all. It's just too, you're too afraid to do what you want and because you're too, we easily to admit that you say that you don't do those things because your moral. but it isn't true. You'd love to do them if you were brave enough, you just aren't. So people misread that to say that what nisha thought was that all morality was cowardice. that isn't what he thought. He thought that all cowardice masquerading as morality, that's a whole different thing. So anyways, recall the call is thinking about these things and he's thinking, well I could be a lawyer and I'd be a good one. I'd help people. I'd help the poor people you know, and, and what the hell good is it for me to wander around starving like this and it doesn't seem reasonable and, and my is going to go basically prostitute herself for this rich guy and that sucks.

Speaker 3:          00:58:53       And there's my landlady and she's an absolutely reprehensible creature and everyone agrees and she's old and worn out and it's like, and she has this person, she keeps us a slave. Although maybe I should just get rid of her. And what I love about that is that like this happens almost all the time in universities, I would say, but it really between and whenever you hear people who think they're smart have a discussion, what they generally do is they have an idea and then they have an idea about the person who has a different idea. And the idea about the person who has a different idea is that their idea is stupid. And so what they do is they produce. They're caricatures of that person's idea and then they blast it and they think, wow, I won that argument, which is really pathetic. It's a straw man argument.

Speaker 3:          00:59:44       It's the sign of a weak mind. What you do if you really want to have an argument with someone is you help them. LIke let's say you're a right winger and you're arguing with a left winger or you're a left winger and you're arguing with a right winger. It's like you want to make their argument as magnificent as you possibly can and then see If you can undermine it. That's what you do because then you're getting somewhere like any idiot can make a straw man in light it. Dostoevsky never does that. He makes the people that he's like, when he sets up two ideas to go to war, he embodies both sets of ideas in the most powerful characters he could imagine. So in the brothers karamazov for example, the two people, the two protagonists basically there's a bunch of them but one is named leo osha and the other is named ivan and now osha is kind of an innocent guy.

Speaker 3:          01:00:38       Goodguide fundamentally a little on the naive side, religious but not in a way that he can defend, you know, it's more of a natural expression of spirit and he's in a monastery and he's the follower of this famous monk and you know, he's kind of into orthodox christianity and his benevolent and sincere way, but he's not much of an intellect. And ivan, his older brother, like ivan's got everything. He's good looking. He's tall. I believe he's a soldier. Like he's an impressive guy and he's got a viciously cutting intellect and he just tears leo shoW apart every chance he gets across the whole book and you know, you can see the two parts of dostoevsky fighting it out in the book because part of dostoevsky was highly spiritualized, not least because he was epileptic and that often for reasons we'll talk about later that often exaggerate spirituality, but also because he was like, he was a deeply spiritual person and also a tremendous intellect and so he was at war inside and he put those parts of emoting into these characters and let them just go at it.

Speaker 3:          01:01:42       And it's brilliant. You know, I even makes the best argument for atheism that's ever been written. It's really powerful. You know, he taught. Basically what he does is he talks about all these terrible things that were being done to children in Russia at the turn of the century. Back in the late 19, 18 hundreds. You know, he talks about this one situation where the parents of this young girl locked her in a freezing out house overnight and she was crying and screaming and telling them that she was sorry, and they just left her in there and she froze to death and it was like front page news and in Russia at the time, I guess probably in moscow or maybe in st petersburg and dostoevsky lifted that argument. TheN said to he had ivan asked leo ships like, okay, well thIs is the sort of thing god permits.

Speaker 3:          01:02:26       okay. He said, the whole damn world isn't worth that. The suffering of one child in a situation like that, how can you possibly see that something like that can exist and wander around with your bone headed belief in a benevolent god what's up with you? Would you like a girl in our house overnight and let her freeze if that meant that other people would be happy, you know? And, and of course ldl osha says, well, no, I would never do that. And so I even tell some, well, yeah, you know, you wouldn't do that, but this god that you imagined exists would be perfectly pleased to let something like that occur. You know, ellie osha has no idea what to say about god and you're either that, you know, that's just a fragment of ivan's argument. He's like punching at him like map, you know.

Speaker 3:          01:03:05       And I think the way on the osha basically responds is by trying to live a good life, you know, he can't, he can argue are even better at it than he is in. Plus there's this vicious strain of critical thinking about religion, religion that's being lost it in from western europe. You know, there's 300 years of philosophical force behind it. And ivan is its mouth bass. It's like ellie osha and Russia itself is just blown apart by that. They have no defense against that. You know, the bloody western europeans had 300 years to get used to it. The russians had like 10 years solely just frank fragmented them, you know? And they were like waiting for the new messiah and they sure got one. I know. And both dostoevsky and in each. You prophesied about what would happen in Russia for 40 years before it happened. That's bloody amazing to be, to think that you could look that far in the future and actually get it right. You know, I mean, things didn't change quite as fast and as they are now, but you know, it wasn't like victoria, the victorian times were static, you know, there were a lot of things going on and so to get that right over four decades, it's, those guys were in touch with something very deep that was going on underneath the substrata of, of, of western civilization. So.

Speaker 3:          01:04:23       All right, so you know, I'm thinking about belief structures and I'm thinking about mlevel incident. I'm thinking about the psychological role that these sorts of things are playing, you know, because it occurred to me at some point something like an idea, something like this. And this actually tormented me for about six months I would say, when I'd been thinking these things through. and I guess it was for probably five years at this point. And I was really obsessed by it. I was thinking about this literally every minute of the day from the time I woke up until the time I went to sleep. It was really manic probably. But so I, I got, I got at one point I got to this conclusion. I thought, okay, well here's the situation. It'S pretty obvious that people need belief structures because first of all, a belief structure orients them to action, right?

Speaker 3:          01:05:13       So you have to believe that one thing is more valuable than another just to af. Right? So why did the chicken cross the road? Well, it's because he thought the other side of the road was better than this. It was on. Obviously, you know, because whenever you're moving, the implicit hypothesis of your movement is that the thing you're moving towards is better than the thing you're leaving and you know, unless you're self destructive because otherwise why bother? And so what that means is you don't move without a value structure and you don't get to not have one. You might say, well, I don't believe in anything. It's like, well no. You say you don't believe in anything. So technically you can't make an argument for what you believe or you don't know what you believe, but if you're not just sitting there vegetating than you believe something because otherwise because you act it out,

Speaker 2:          01:06:03       right? So

Speaker 3:          01:06:07       you have to have a belief system

Speaker 2:          01:06:10       or, or you fall apart. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:06:14       So your nihilistic or depressed or hopeless? Not certainly like who wants that? That's not good. It's painful. Depression is no joke.

Speaker 2:          01:06:23       No.

Speaker 3:          01:06:26       I know someone who had a very, very serious illness is an illness that destroyed parts of this person's body, destroyed their joints and they were also had clinical depression. And I asked this person at one point, okay, you get to get, you get to have a choice. You can get rid of the illness that's destroying your joints. So they had to be replaced or you can get rid of the depression. He said I'd get rid of the depression first. No problem. So that's where thinking about, right? So if you believe nothing, you're hopeless, you've got no values structure to place you end up is not good. And I'm sure lots of you have experienced that. You know, I mean most people, especially the people who are likely to come to this class, most people by the time they're your age, I've gone through a dark period or to, you know, for whatever reason relationship breaks up or maybe you lose the meaning in your life for someone betrays you or someone gets sick or you get sick or you know, some tragedy comes along and knocks you flat.

Speaker 3:          01:07:17       You think, what the hell? What's going on? Why is any of this worthwhile? And it's a good question. Okay, but you can't go there because that's like death. while then the other problem is, well, let's say you do have a belief system. All right, so what happens if I have a different one? What are we supposed to do about that? You can't give up yours because then you're done. I'm not going to give up mine for the sAme reason, but it isn't clear that we can inhabit the same part of the earth peacefully if we don't believe the same things. So I, when I sorted that oUt, I thought, oh, well that'S it man. We're baSically, that's it. We'Re done. Because you can't not have a belief system and if you have one you can't not fight and we're too well armed to fight now and we're not jUSt going to collapse into nihilism, although you know that happens quite a bit. So games over. Well, it turned out that that was wrong, thank god, but it took me an awful long time to even begin to understand how it could possibly be wrong because as far as I could tell, those were the options.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       So another thing we're going to try to figure out is not only you know exactly why it people have belief systems exactly what a belief system is and why they compete and why you can't just get rid of them, but we're also going to figure out what it is that you might be able to do about the fact that you're going to inhabit places with people who don't have exactly the same belief system as you know. And in some sense it's really the problem with social being right. And creatures have been trying to solve this problem ever since. Well, we don't know for how long I like to use lobsters as an example because lobsters arrange themselves into dominance hierarchies and they have very complex social behavior and they don't have much of a brain, so you can. You can have pretty damn complex social behavior without having much of a brain.

Speaker 3:          01:09:00       And lobsters have been around for 400 million years. So us roughly speaking because we had To shared ancestor with a lobster, you know, a very long time ago. We've been trying to figure out how to coexist with other creatures that don't precisely share our belief systems for 400 million years and we'd been sufficiently successful about it so that we're both social and here we are. So obviously there's ways that it can be dealt with. Although I don't think we necessarily understand them very well and part of. So I didn't want to just understand what it was about belief systems, you know, about their necessity and their function and the way that they become pathologist. I wanted to figure out if there was also a pattern to the processes by which belief systems are modified and negotiated so that the belief systems that have different structures can coexist in the same place peacefully and it's a vital question, right?

Speaker 3:          01:09:56       Because most of you are going to get married successfully or unsuccessfully, and even if you don't, you're going to live with someone for a long period of time and you're gonna. Find out that they're not like you and that's extremely annoying, but you know what are you going to do? You're either gonna be a slave or a tyrant or you're going to negotiate because those are your options and negotiation is extraordinarily difficult, right? Because you have to figure out what you want and probably won't even admit it, and second of all, you have to listen to your stupid partner telling you what they want and then you have to try to figure out how you're going to make both of them possibly. Well, slavery, tyranny. That's comparatively easy from a cognitive perspective compared to actually trying to figure out How you can be mutually satisfied in the same space, but you can do it.

Speaker 3:          01:10:43       That's the thing. There is a process and it's identifiable, so I want to talk to you about belief systems and their psychological significance, what they're like, what function they perform, but I also want to talk to you about how they transform because they do, right? They changed especially with humans so they can change. That means they can modify and that means at least in principle, that we could have a dialogue. Now dialogue is, and that's rough, but the alternative is war. Right? And that's partly why you're supposed to listen to your enemy because if you don't listen to your enemy, the only other thing that you

Speaker 2:          01:11:20       can do is fight with them. That's it.

Speaker 3:          01:11:36       You mean it's the desire for that to happen? Well, I would say it's partly the desire for that to happen. The thing is whenever I look at a political movement, especially the ideological, I think, okay, there's a bunch of things your for fine. What are you against? You know, because one of the things that people who adopted maybe theological position like to presume is that all of the right is on their side and that makes them very unconscious up their shadow, let's say from a union perspective. The nazis had all sorts of positive reasons for what they were doing, but you know, the negative reasons were there too and you could easily make a case that the negative reasons were really the reasons. And when I look at ideologues, I always think, yeah, yeah, that's what you're for sure. But I, I don't believe all the good people are on your site and be.

Speaker 3:          01:12:24       I know that negative motivations are more powerful than positive ones. So you say you're for things, but you're against them too. So let's, let's start with that. So I thought I started thinking about this after I read george orwell. I love george orwell, by the way. How many of you know who george orwell is? Wow. Really? That's impressive. How many don't? Okay, well that's, that's good. That's amazing. I'm like, how the hell did you learn about george orwell? Is it 19, 84? Fundamentally or animal farm? Animal farm. Okay. Okay. Well that's good because george orwell, man, I tell you, george orwell was the first western intellectual who figured out what the hell was going on in the soviet union. And he did that in the mid forties, early, you know, it was complicated because we sort of knew what was happening in the twenties and the thirties, you know, there was len and then that wasn't so good.

Speaker 3:          01:13:17       There was the russian civil war, there was the idea of universal communism that wasn't such a good idea, you know, for, as far as people who didn't want to be communists were concerned. And then there was what happened in the Ukraine in the 1930. So it was like, you know, the evidence was starting to pile up. But unfortunately what happened was the spanish civil war and the lefties were pretty much the good guys in the spanish civil war. Right. It was like a microcosm of the second world war. The lefties were fighting the fascists and some of the lefties were communists, but a lot of them were also people who were, I think genuinely fighting for freedom and a lot of north american literary figures went to Spain to fight on the side of the, you know, against the fascists. And so faIr enough, you know, the fascist, we're obviously, you know, reprehensible clearly and so and so that kind of muddied the water right because the fastest were bad.

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       And then that sort of means that people that are fighting them, their guard and some of them are communists and there was good. There is pretty good reason for people to be radical socialist at that point in human history because the plIght of the working man was relatively unpleasant. George orwell wrote a book called road to wigan pier and he went up to this town that was a coal mining town and he, he stayed with the coal miners for awhile and just looked at their life. So here, here's pArt of their life. So you basically work a seven and a half hour shift when you're a coal miner and you think, oh, that's not too bad by 1930 standards. it's like, yeah, except you have to go down to the coal mine tunnels, you know, and like they're not eight feet high and carpeted there like four and a half feet high and rough and poorly lit and the air is terrible.

Speaker 3:          01:15:01       And so basically you have to chimp walk or crawl up to three miles just to get to work and then you have to do that at the end of your shift and you don't get paid for that. That's just, that's your Commute, right? Right. So you know, it was no bloody well. and then of course what you're doing when you get there, it's like it's absolutely filthy. It's unbelievably noisy. It's brutally difficult. He said coal miners, they have no teeth because they're like, because of their living conditions, but their bodies were absolutely perfect. They were unbelievably powerful and strong because all they did was incredibly intense physical labor, but it was bloody rough. ANd the housing, those people had like 50 families for one outhouse, that's probably good enough to describe it and often they were row houses and the row houses had no back doors that they had no paths between them and all the old houses were at the back.

Speaker 3:          01:15:58       So that meant if you were with like 20 below and it was the winter and you were sick, then you get to go all the way around the block to your damn outhouse. Or maybe there'S only one there and you light up with 50 people. So that you know. Yeah. So an orwell, he was orwell was an upper class guy basically, and he was trying to help themselves overcome these upper class prejudices and who is a real documentary, one of the terrible working conditions of, of, of working class people. And he wrote this book called road to wigan pier. But one of the things that orwell said, he wrote this story about these poor god damn coal miners. and you think, well yeah. It's like how about some social legislation so that these people In their children aren't just absolutely brutalized nonstop? No. But then he wrote the last half of the book and he wrote it for the left book club, which was a socialist group that the publisher book every month or so.

Speaker 3:          01:16:50       And what he did was he. He wrote a critique of socialism, a pretty socialism. And he said, yeah, well this sucks man. It's like we should be on The. Sorry to these working people, but the socialists, I mean they're not on the side of the working people. They're like tweed wearing middle class hyper intellectuals who never go anywhere near the working class because of their class. Prejudice isn't for all sorts of other reasons and they don't like the poor at all. They just hate the rich. And I thought I'd been a member of the ndp for a long time. At that point. It was always something a little off about is especially the more radical and that works with you guys. Like it just doesn't look like benevolence as far as I can tell. There's a lot of whining and complaining and resentment. It's like, whAt's that? What's that about? I read orwell and I thought, right, if you hate the successful, if you hate the rich who were rich by the way is whoever has more money than you. That's how you defined rich, and the best way to mask your resentment is to pretend that you're on the side of the poor. And are I read that. I thought that's exactly right. And then that's part of also what made me psychoanalytically oriented because one thing psychoanalysts always do always is if you say you're, here's how I'm positively predisposed. The psychoanalyst says,

Speaker 3:          01:18:10       how are you using that to mask something easy and malevolent that you're doing? And that's always, that's a very, very useful questions. Not always correct, right? But, but it's correct a lot more than people generally like to think, you know, it's like the mothering him grant the mother or the witch in hansel and gretel. You know the story, right? This guy gets married, he's got a couple of kids. His new wife doesn't relate to the kids. You have 100 times higher chance by the way of being abused by a step parent. Then biological parent, just so you know. So the, the step where they're just like the kids, she tells the guy, well why don't you just go with those kids out in the woods, sold out. They go out in the woods. So they're lost kids, right? They have nowhere to go. So when they're wandering around out there in the forest and what happens,

Speaker 3:          01:18:59       they come across a gingerbread house. You think, wow man, you're a starving kid. Gingerbread house. That's good news, right? Not only is it a house, but it's made out of candy. How could anything possibly be any better? So when they go, well, and then there's this grandmotherly type care and you know, she starts to fatten them up and she puts, I think it's handling the cage and she gets gretel after awhile to basically work as their scullery maid. And it becomes quite obvious to the children that she's actually fattening them up so that she can put them in the oven and eat them. And so I think what hansel does is I think griddle gives him this leg bone from some animal and the old witch's half blind. And every time she reaches into sorta feel his laying, he gives her the bone and so like she's just not all that interested in meeting them in anyways.

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       The kids end up pushing her in the oven and closing it and getting the hell out of there. So you know, it's a happy ending as far as fairy tale skill. But it's an eternal story, right? It's a classic story, but it needs a whole family. Be bloody wary of people who do too much for you. Right? It's like if have a mother or any other relative for that matter, who's fattening you up on mercy and candy? The probability that her basic goal is to eat you enough so that you never leave. The probability is extraordinarily high and that's no joke. You know, one of the things that you do learn if you read about the sorts of people who burst out of their mother's basement and go shoot up dawson colleges that often. That's exactly the situation that you've been in, right? They're burning with resentment in your uselessness down in the basement for five or six years.

Speaker 3:          01:20:42       You know, they don't have to leave, they don't have to become independent, everything's done for them, so they never have to do anything for themselves. It's like it's not pretty. And so one of the rules for dealing with people, and I know this is actually a rule for dealing with elderly people in, in, in, in, in, in hopes for, for, for retired people, is do not do anything for anyone they can do for themselves. You are stealing from them when you do that. And it's a great rule of thumb for kids. Like once they can dress themselves, they dress themselves. If they can set the table, even if it takes 20 minutes, it's like they're setting the table. You're not doing them a favor by helping them do anything they can do themselves and it skips. It's kind of harsh, you know, but it beats the hell out of the witch in hansel and gretel. So. So anyways, you know, one of the things we're going to look at as well as the dark side of positive motivations. So now how are we going to do this?

Speaker 2:          01:21:37       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:21:40       One of the things you might ask yourself is, how in the world do you know if something is true? Now, the first thing I would suggest is that the attitude you guys should bring to this class is that nothing that I tell you is true. Okay? Now, I don't mean that you should be arrogantly skeptical because that's not appropriate, but you should bring every critical faculty. You have to bear on what I tell you to see if you can chip away at it because what you want to do, you want to build yourself a body of knowledge that you cannot undermine, and the way you do that is by trying to undermine it, by hacking away at the foundation with everything you've got, and if, if the ideas can withstand a total onslaught, then you've got something. You've got a foundation, you've got something you could stand on that's going to be there when things get rough, and so I'm going to tell you what I've found.

Speaker 3:          01:22:36       It's been useful to me when things got rough, but I don't expect you to assume that that's gonna work for you and I don't want you to to like I want you to listen and to think, but I want you to keep your wits about you. Now I'm going to tell you how I go about trying to determine whether or not something is true. First of all, there's different definitions of truth and so we're gonna basically flipped back and forth between two. One of truth is an objective definition and we don't have to talk much about that because you guys already know what that is, but there's another definition of truth that the. I think the best way of defining it is as pragmatically true and pragmatism is a branch of american philosophy and it's a very sophisticated brands and philosophy. In fact, I actually think it's the most sophisticated brand philosophy part part probably because it makes the least claims and what the pragmatists state basically is.

Speaker 3:          01:23:33       Well, you don't really know anything, right? You don't have ultimate knowledge about anything, so your knowledge always bought himself in ignorance. And so then the question is, well, how do you know them if anything is true? And the pragmatist would say, well in a sense you don't. What you know always is if something is true enough for a particular function. So for example, your theory about getting to the door might be that you can stand up and walk there and you might. Well god only knows what might happen on the way there. You know, maybe there'll be an earthquake or a ceiling tile fall on you. Or, or who knows, maybe I'll have a heart attack, you know, so you don't know whether you can get there. You can infer from past experience. But if you get there, then what you can say is my statement about truth was sufficient so that the outcome was what the theory predicted.

Speaker 3:          01:24:21       And so in some sense, what the pragmatists are saying is every time you make a statement, especially if it's related to action, that you will offer a theory of truth along with that statement implicitly, which is that this is true enough if what I predict happen happens. And so it's really, it's a binds very nice theory because it doesn't require you to be omniscient about anything for things to be true enough and you are ignorant. You don't know everything about anything. And so obviously you're working in the world with partial knowledge and it works not all the time. You get old, you get sick, you die. Like I mean you're, you're, you're not going to work it out thoroughly. But so we're going to use the pragmatic truth framework and we're going to use a objective truth framework. And one of the propositions that I'm going to make to you is that the stories that are associated with our deepest moral intuitions are pragmatic truths and that you need pragmatic truths and you need objective truth.

Speaker 3:          01:25:27       And you need pragmatic trees because you don't just need to know what the world's made up. You need to know what to do about the fact that the world is made out of things. And because you know, human beings are creatures. We act in the world. We act on the world. And so what we need to know is how is it that you should act on the world and that is not a question that can be addressed by objective methods technically, right? Because it's actually a value question. What should you do? Science by its very methodology refuses to answer such questions. And you know, people confuse the fact that science is value free, sort of with the idea that existence is value free. It's like that's, that's, that's philosophically primitive, I would say, because science was actually set up to get rid of the value of the subjective value in its, in its technique.

Speaker 3:          01:26:20       So you can't say, well we set this thing up to get rid of the value would look all the value score. It's like there's no value. It's no, no, no, no. You put that domain out of the range of consideration. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It's just, it's just a different. It requires different. It requires a different philosophy, a different outlook, different techniques, different tools, different methods of proof, all of these things. And so part of what we're going to do, I'm going to use objective truth as much as i possibly can because I think that, uh, that a lot of what psychology as a science has been able to offer in the last hundred years is actually extraordinarily useful for elucidating some of the issues that we're going to discuss because we really have made some progress and understanding the psyche, as you know, especially at a, I would say at a biological slash behavioral level.

Speaker 3:          01:27:13       We've got some pretty solid information. It's not perfect, but it's helpful. Okay. So we're going to draw on a bunch of sources. We're drawing stories. We're going to draw in literature, we're going to draw on philosophy, we're going to draw on religion, we're going to draw a myth, mythology. We're going to draw on biology and psychology. And there's this idea which you should have learned about if you're a psychologist called multi-method multitrack matrix. So this was invented by a guy back in the 19 fifties, I think it was neil and chronback, his famous paper that was published in the fifties. Everyone is supposed to know it. No one ever pays any attention to it, but what they were interested in was how do you know if when you say that something exists, like let's say a anger, does anger exist? Well, the answer seems self evident.

Speaker 3:          01:28:05       Yes. Well it's tricky, you know, because generally no one comes up to you and says anger, you know, they tell you a little story where they use words relating to anger in the story and then you sort of derive what they mean by angry from the context and the context is important in defining the reality. Right? So you don't know if that, that the central idea anger can be pulled out of the context and then you can say, well that's a thing. Like, like iron is a thing or like mercury is that thing, you know, because maybe it's not. Maybe it's a pattern or maybe it's something that's a convention or you know, there may be all sorts of things that are, that are associated with it. So one of back in meals, fundamental claims was that in order to determine whether or not something existed, you had to be able to detect it using different methods. Now it's tricky because it's not obvious what constitutes a different method, right? So you kind of have to make a judgment. But I would say you use a multi-method multitrack means of determining what's true with your senses. How many do you have? Six cars. Yeah. Pro proprioception, right? Why? Why, why? Well, let's say for the sake of simplicity, why one on one?

Speaker 4:          01:29:26       Uh, to increase the likelihood of it being true, you could see something but not be able to touch it. That might be a mirage maybe or a multiple reasons for it to be pointing to the probability of it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:43       Yes. Well, that's exactly it. And you want it to be. So the sense ideas are really good. One because you can see that census used different modalities, right? It's like obviously the ice relying on electromagnetic radiation and the ears rely on vibrations in the air and touches really an atomic phenomena in some sense. You know, because you're feeling the outer surfaces of electrons with your electronic surfaces and there's taste which is again, a molecular level phenomena and smell and you know, so our idea, connie, is if, if all five of those things detected, it's sufficiently real so that we can use it to guide our action and we won't be wrong. So it's five dimensions. You need a five dimensional analysis and that's evolved. So you might say, well, you know, that's. Let's call that a good estimate. You need five ways of detecting something before you can be sure it's true.

Speaker 3:          01:30:32       Now you know when you're learning about experimental psychology, they tell you p is less than point. Oh, five, right? You use a measurement and then you determine whether the probability that that has manifested itself exceeds a certain level of chance. If it does, then the thing exists, but that's, that's actually not right. It's not right for experimental psychology and experimental psychologists have known it since the late fifties. You have to demonstrate that the damn thing exists multiple different ways. Now. What constitutes a different way can be subject to debate. It's a complicated thing to sort out, but you can kind of figure it out, right? You know, maybe you as a physiological measurement and self report or something like that or you self report and other report or you know, and maybe you don't need five, but you probably need three or something like that, you know, depending on them.

Speaker 3:          01:31:25       So what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you a story roughly speaking and I want to make this story evident at five or six different levels of analysis and I want to show you how the story is the same and all of these levels of analysis. Now the one, one of the potential flaws of that method is this. So Joseph Campbell, for example, he wrote about here on mythology, right? Some of you from undergrad, the hero with a thousand faces and one of the criticisms of Joseph Campbell and people like him that they read the stories of multiple cultures, but they have an a priori framework. And because of the high priority framework, they only see what their theory tells them that they're going to see. They don't look for the exceptions, so it's a problem with pattern recognition, right? You may be able to recognize patterns where they don't exist.

Speaker 3:          01:32:21       Now my method could, could be criticized on that grounds I think, but the way I've tried to protect myself against that was to make sure that I drew from this enough diverse sources so that the probability that I would be able to tell a coherent, coherent story across all those different types of methods is vanishingly small. Now you're going to have to decide if you think that's true. So, um, and I can, I can tell you roughly the dimensions of analysis. The idea is that I'm going to talk to you about. I've put into practice personally. They worked for me. They work for the people that I've taught them to. so those are family members often, but not only family members, lots of other people because I'm also a clinician. Right? And so it seems to work quite nicely. I have a lot of people write to me and tell me that the ideas have worked, you know, and so, so I've got multi rater reliability there and then I think it's manifests biologically and I think it's manifest culturally and I think it's manifested in these very, very old stories and anthropologically and so forth.

Speaker 3:          01:33:28       So, you know, make up your own mind, you, you can see, you know, and I think the other, the other thing, and I don't really know what to do, what to make of this, you know, sometimes you have an intuition of truth, right? It's like maybe you're describing a problem to someone and they say, well this seems to be at the heart of it and they give you a formulation and kinda goes click and you think, yeah, that's how all those things hang together. It's a, it's a pattern recognition mechanism. It's insight mechanism. People generally have the feeling that when something like that happens, that something of truth has been revealed. Now a very common response from the students I've had in these courses is that I never tell anyone anything they don't already know. So, and I think the reason for that is I'm hoping the reason is, is that what I'm outlining our archetypal structures, you know, and I've drawn a lot of my work from you who was very interested in our critical structures.

Speaker 3:          01:34:23       And so what should happen, and I think it will happen, is when I tell you a story, you'll think, oh yeah, right, that's what that means and I see and here's all the things that it explains. And so you'll have this sense and that's the, you talked about your friend with the spiritual awakening. Often one of the cognitive phenomena that accompanies a spiritual awakening is the connection of many, many diverse phenomena into a overarching unity. And you feel that like as a radical simplification or something like that, a decrease in entropy or something like that. And a very, very powerful sensation. So, I mean there's other sources of what you might call spiritual experience as well, but that's certainly one of them. And so you can see, you know, all you stories, you can think, oh well, you know, how, how does that story manifest itself in your experience?

Speaker 3:          01:35:14       Now it's a phenomenal logical level of truth, right? So the phenomenologists branch of philosophy started by heidegger, not exactly, but let's say extended as well as anyone extended it by heidegger. Heidegger thought that western philosophy had gone wrong basically since the time of socrates, which is quite a long time, and he said that we were, we became interested in what the world was made of and how we knew things and what we should have been interested in stead was the nature and quality of being and whaT he meant by being isn't the objective world. What he meant by being was the manner in which you have experience and so there are elements of being that aren't objective elements and so I would say pain is a phenomenological reality, right? It's, it's not something you can. You can Index it objectively, but the index is not the phenomena and you know, is your pain real.

Speaker 3:          01:36:19       See, this is. This is a question for people who think there's no such thing as meaning. Like you try to argue yourself out of pain and see how far you get. You might think, well, that's not the sort of meaning I meant. It's like, you know, a negative meaning is a place to start, right? because if something's negative and it's real, it does imply that there's something positive. It's real. It might be harder to get ahold of. At least it's not pain, you know, so, but pain descartes, and I'll close with this. You guys can have a break. Descartes implemented a method he called radical doubt when he went on his philosophical journey and what descartes looked for was one thing he couldn't doubt because he was probably clinically depressed and he was just doubting everything. It's like, well, why? How do I know the world isn't just been mirage made by an evil demon to, you know, to, uh, to obfuscate reality from me.

Speaker 3:          01:37:12       While his conclusion was the one thing that he could not dispute was that he could, he was an could think. Now, I don't think descartes really meant what we meant by think. I think he meant more what we would mean by experience because thought has become a much more narrowly defined, you know, term since the time of descartes. So I don't think he meant, I think therefore I am. I think he meant something like I experienced. I have experienced there for him. But regardless of that, modern people think about it as thought heidegger was different. Heidegger basically said the one thing you can dispute is that that experience is your experience. It exists.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       You can't. It's almost by definition, right? It's like the definition of exist. And then he was interested in what the fundamental elements of existence I've existed. It's work and they're not on just like, you know, like the fundamental elements of the objective world. There are more things like pain and for me that was the thing that stopped me from delhi. It's like a candle. Don't be existence of pain. It seems real. And I might say it seems more real than anything else. Now you might say you don't believe that, but I would say, I don't care what you think you believe, I'll watch you when you're in pain. And every single one of your actions will indicate that you believe in it. And not only that, you can't not believe in it. Right? It's there and it's there so much that

Speaker 1:          01:38:44       well, that's a meaning and so that it's in that way that heidegger, at least in part thought of existence as or experience as composed of meetings and so part of the reason that this course is called maps of meaning is because one of the things we're going to look at is the structure of meaning and we're going to start with negative meaning because from my perspective it's. Look, you can doubt whether or not good exists, but once I'm done telling you about the things I know about human history, there won't be a single person in this room who thinks that evil doesn't exist and you might think that's a bloody horrible thing to learn, but it's not. It's unbelievably useful because once you can establish something that you cannot deny, then you can move from that and I think you can hypothesize that if you're capable of detecting radical evil, I'll tell you about unit seven, 31 at some point or you can look them up yourself. I wouldn't recommend it. By the way.

Speaker 1:          01:39:43       Once you can identify radical evil and you think, well, that's just beyond a doubt, that's reprehensible. There's no justification for that whatsoever, no matter what, whenever. Well, then you've got something to stand on and you can start thinking, well, what's the absolute opposite of that? Then, you know, it might be, how is it that you could conduct yourself so that in your sphere of influence, the probability like that anything like that would ever happen is reduced to the absolute maximum. Well, that's a reasonable moral question. And, and, and I, I don't think it's something that you can dispense with, with like a casual nihilism. I don't think a nihilist can dispense with it because he even nihilists suffer. Thank god for that. You know, it's their only, it's their only source of potential salvation. Sometimes they notice it, oh, I'm suffering about all this nihilism. Maybe that indicates that there's something flawed in it. It's always possible. So. Okay, so let's take a break. We'll take a break for. Oh, come back at three. What time is it? I want to make sure my clock, the 58. Okay. Come back at 3:15. We'll see you there and then I'll talk to you more about the technical elements of the class.
