Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hi everyone. I'm in Australia and New Zealand off to New Zealand in the next couple of days and I thought I'd bring you up to date with a story that's been breaking there that's of some substantial interest in a certain degree of absurdity. A group they're known as Auckland Peace Action released a press release on Monday 11th of February, 2019 stating quote Jordan Peterson threatens everything of value in our society, which I had to admit was rather impressive because that's not an easy thing to manage. Anyways, I'll read you a little bit of it. What happened after the release was that a journalist Sean Plunkett interviewed the author or the spokesperson of this particular press release and then we had a chance to talk the next day. And so what you're going to see in this video is me reading the press release. Then you're going to see Sean interviewing iris, Quiznos Yak hope I've got that reasonably right of Oakland peace action.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       And then you're going to see the full interview that I had with Sean the next day. So here goes Jordan. Peterson threatens everything of value in our society. In the lead up to Jordan Peterson's visit to New Zealand, we have a duty to condemn his sexist, queer, phobic, racist, and deeply reactionary views. Says Iris [inaudible] of Oakland Peace Auction. Jordan Peterson, professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, turned right wing media celebrity is in New Zealand to promote his book. 12 rules for life. This book, while offering superficially useful life advice to an audience of disaffected white men, promotes the reactionary misogynistic view of the world utterly in opposition to New Zealand values. Well, we as a country have many problems. We can be justly proud of our values of gender equality, egalitarianism and social inclusivity says Ms Krizia's Houk Jordan Peterson is actively trying to undermine these values. This is distinctly unhelpful. Um, I won't Redo the rest of it. You can find it at scoop politics if you're interested. And now we'll turn to Shaun's interview with Iris and his analysis of her claims.

Speaker 2:          00:02:33       The Iris, your group has come out with a press release yesterday. They got some coverage and sang Jordan Peterson threatens everything of value and our society. Why? Why does telling kids to clean their room up represent the end of civilization as we know,

Speaker 3:          00:02:56       telling kids to clean their room is probably not a bad thing. It's true. Comes subset of, you know, are pretty fast from old Jordan Peterson was doing.

Speaker 2:          00:03:06       Not really, that's what this book's about. That's what he's promoting on us too.

Speaker 3:          00:03:19       I would say not a few can. Like, I mean if you take a look at some of what's actually said in the book and in many of a media comments he's made elsewhere, it seems quite clear that he has some seriously problematic of yours. Okay. So let's see. Let's begin with the kind of surface interview with Camille Paglia. Um, we're in heat a six of what? Seed? Seed first. Well, you know, he believes that and discussions with me and he knows how to, he knows where he stands. More waste because kinds of guests of honor or something. It's Blacksburg refer to physical thoughts

Speaker 2:          00:04:00       can put, uh, may not be putting barriers around social interaction between each other because there's the implicit and underlying reality that if things get out of control with me and have a conversation, there was the possibility of physical violence and he sees that subconscious check on how far or how if you like bitchy a conversation can get these team could by that knowledge I don't see does does that vary suggestion or idea, which I know a lot of people agree with. Does that threaten Western civilization and the very foundations in everything of value in our society?

Speaker 3:          00:04:42       Well, can I just speak about wish I weren't sick it off western civilization, but if you consider something like say, I mean consider basically how that's going, how that kind of statement is going to be raped.

Speaker 2:          00:04:58       No, I think it's going to be read by me and saying, yeah, we need to think about denying the differences, the biological and I guess behavioral differences between sexes and we need to talk about these things honestly and openly if we're going to make progress on some of the issues of gender in our society.

Speaker 3:          00:05:16       All right, but on the Cultural Mueller where frankly, homosexuals are still getting beaten up, we have ridiculous rates of domestic partner violence. Franklin

Speaker 2:          00:05:26       just want to check you have a beaten his wife or beaten up a homosexual?

Speaker 3:          00:05:36       No.

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       Has he ever advocated people beat their wives will beat homosexuals?

Speaker 3:          00:05:42       I don't believe he has.

Speaker 2:          00:05:43       No. Okay, so that'd be a nine right?

Speaker 3:          00:05:45       Can I please, can I please continue?

Speaker 2:          00:05:48       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:05:50       The effect of the allows platform, there are many people paying attention to him. Yeah. If you're making statements and social situation, it was vitally important that you kind of, that's the statements you make cannot be misread and in such a way as to promote. I would say, look, everyone's made you, everyone has made kind of, if you don't, if you do it repeatedly,

Speaker 2:          00:06:28       that's all he does. Or do you think he may be? He should be shut down. Do you think his ideas are too dangerous and he shouldn't be allowed to speak in New Zealand?

Speaker 3:          00:06:42       The leafy should be shops down. Here's why we're not doing the issue. How is that his ideas, his ideas are rather more problematic thing. I feel your pain,

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       which, which ideas? Which ones specifically that you should clean your room. That you should hold your shoulders back. That you should take responsibility for your own life. That people shouldn't be compelled by governments to use words, particular words in particular circumstances.

Speaker 3:          00:07:09       Okay, but one of those particular words in particular circumstances. Yes, I agree with it. It'd be ridiculous to make some government to force effectively took you use government excuse for free, some governmental force to do that are being read in the media, including by some people.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       Yeah. Well he can't be responsible for the stupidity of people reading the statements. Kenny,

Speaker 3:          00:07:35       again, as I was saying, so do you think that still are not responsible for, do you think that, do you feel that people are never responsible for where your fixes or things like that?

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       Well, yeah. No, not particularly. But I'd also say that it would seem to me from my observation is the impact that Jordan Peterson has had on people's lives. That has been overwhelmingly positive for a huge number of people, which is why it's so incredibly popular.

Speaker 3:          00:07:58       I would point to out so she can say the same thing about a lot of special smoke from if they have a very positive effect on the lives of many.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       Are you saying that he's a fascist?

Speaker 3:          00:08:05       No, I'm not saying I am saying I am saying but he's exploiting all the same kind of basis.

Speaker 2:          00:08:11       No exposing anything. He doesn't compel anyone to go to his talks to look at his stuff on youtube. How's it exploiting anyone?

Speaker 3:          00:08:19       I'm not saying, I mean exploiting in terms of he is using the same chip. Like he is using the same basic psychological mechanisms to build his base.

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       Well what base? He's just saying what he thinks and people happen to be interested. I used to just thinking he's running some campaign to destroy the Western world.

Speaker 3:          00:08:41       Hardly. I just think that he is a very irresponsible man who is,

Speaker 2:          00:08:47       well, let's talk about, let's talk about responsibility. Shall we and your group or can p section. Um, you would like people to go and see sit and films and you're happy to physically into say to stop them seeing certain films. And in fact your Wellington branch bought fake bombs to create a terror at in 2018 at a film festival and stopped people watching a film about being Gary and right. Is that right, iris?

Speaker 3:          00:09:17       Correct. So you're putting a very negative,

Speaker 2:          00:09:20       well, let's just faked, I was just saying some facts, ma'am. So what do you think is a greater threat to our society? Threatening to plant fake bombs in a movie theater and telling people they can't go and see a movie because your group doesn't like it. Do you think that's a greater threat to our society than Jordan Peterson? Book out a horn, say pay some money and come and see me. If you want

Speaker 3:          00:09:45       Jordan piece, so certainly create a free society. I can tell you that I've got like I can tell you that what you're saying about trans people, those queer people about a woman.

Speaker 2:          00:09:56       I've never seen him say anything negative about women, trans people or Queer people. I've never seen them be homophobic or misogynistic. And I believe me, I've watched a lot of what Jordan Peterson says and does. I've never once anywhere seen him being misogynistic, homophobic, or transphobic. Can you point me to an example where he has been rs?

Speaker 3:          00:10:26       What do you mean by in this case, do you mean by an example?

Speaker 2:          00:10:31       We an example where he in any way is misogynistic, homophobic or transphobic.

Speaker 3:          00:10:36       So you do not feel that kind of say you do not feel that effectively saying you do. Just to be clear, you don't feel that same with women, a woman we lipsticks to work in order to a sexually provocative.

Speaker 2:          00:10:50       He's not saying that. He's never said that. What do you see the Iris, what do you see it? Irises if we need to, if we except Eh, we've got to have some rules. He understands the biology of men and women. And he says, uh, main need to respect women's boundaries. And he is always very, very clear about that. But he says, if we're going to have a d sexualized workplace, if we're going to have a seat of rules, let's be very clear about what those rules are. He would argue that my cap, right, that my cap is designed as a sexual display in its pure, in, in a, in an academic sense, people put on on makeup or have traditionally put on makeup as a sexual display. And he said, okay, if we're going to have workplaces where six and any sort of sort of interaction of that nature between the gin, the, the gene does is off the agenda. Maybe we need to think about makeup in the workplace. He is not accusing woman, he's not slapped shaming and he's not sitting there saying, woman bring it on themselves. He's just, we need to be realistic about what the rules and boundaries are.

Speaker 3:          00:11:58       Okay, so a question for you if you will. So Jordan Peterson, Jordan Peterson, which clearly I have, which you clearly feel are, you know, are not problematic.

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       Well, no millions of people think is not problematic and millions of people think, seem to think he's saying stuff that no one's had the balls to say for for a while and they're on board with them.

Speaker 3:          00:12:22       No one set of both to say is really pretty passe,

Speaker 2:          00:12:27       isn't it? That's what I'd say. Your movement prides itself on doing. Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:12:32       Yes. But we aren't saying it simply to, you know, because no one else has the balls to say it. We say it's because we generate genuinely believe in our political positions

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       and I'm sure that that Jordan Peterson genuinely believes in his, and actually to be honest, they seem more strip mainstreaming and less of a threat to society than buying fake bombs to scare people out of going to see a movie in New Zealand.

Speaker 3:          00:12:53       Just out of curiosity, how do you feel about, say I didn't know are bombing civilians have on society? Because the is what we're fundamentally apart.

Speaker 2:          00:13:03       Okay. Does, does, are you saying Jordan Peterson bomb civilians?

Speaker 3:          00:13:07       No, I'm not. What I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          00:13:09       The why when we're talking about your press release about Jordan Peterson. What'd you bring that up?

Speaker 3:          00:13:13       Well why do you keep on bringing up stuff about toe?

Speaker 2:          00:13:16       Cause it's your group that put out the press release and it's your group that bought fake bombs and said that people shouldn't go and see a movie you didn't like in a free country.

Speaker 3:          00:13:29       Well like if you're going to

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       iris, I might just be suggesting that your press releases a little bit over the top. Are you prepared to admit that on the back of this interview?

Speaker 3:          00:13:56       No, simply because I simply, because I'm living kind of on a daily, daily, on a fairly regular basis, what's the Georgian peace talks are having on his fan base. We are getting repeated consistent harassment from rebel from frankly Jordan, from Jordan Peterson fans. Because if I say sorry,

Speaker 2:          00:14:19       so Jordan Peterson.

Speaker 3:          00:14:22       Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:14:24       Give me an example. Give me an example.

Speaker 3:          00:14:32       Okay. Source the person really swift. Frankly, we uh, look, we got an email from him from frankly what appears to be a white nationalist. Yeah. We take a look at this. This if we take a look at a whole bunch of, oh, frankly, not the videos.

Speaker 2:          00:14:55       Yeah. Peterson Nazi videos. No. No. Okay. So what's he gonna do with that email from the Nazi?

Speaker 3:          00:15:05       Well, the fact of the matter is that his fan base, I was saying fan base thing.

Speaker 2:          00:15:10       I did not, I'm part of his fan base. I'm not a Nazi.

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       I'm not suggesting that you are.

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       What would you suggest to anyone who is does like what he sees is a Nazi? No, that seems pretty wild.

Speaker 3:          00:15:23       What I am suggesting is what he has created certain certain subset of the fence, which may not be the same subset of the Europe, so I'm pretty sure they ams. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:15:33       Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       It's behaving in, it's behaving and frankly quite discreet.

Speaker 2:          00:15:37       Does the subset of his fans that represent the threat to everything of value in our society, not Jordan Peterson. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:15:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:46       Right. But you can say, why didn't you say that in your press release? It was Jordan Peterson. He represented the three to everything of value in our society

Speaker 3:          00:15:54       because the Jordan Peterson was calling for us tends to coalesce. He is encouraging.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       Oh he's not, he's just saying what he thinks.

Speaker 3:          00:16:03       All right, so just out of curiosity or I just got to, where do you draw the line as to what? Like where do you draw the line as to responsibility for what you've said? So yeah, I mean surely you can't say, look you can't say, but he'll absolutely no responsibility for the behavior of people who um, effectively the behavior of people who listen to them and

Speaker 2:          00:16:24       well I'd be more, I'd be more worried about the consequences of buying a fake bomb to scare someone out of a movie theater to be honest. Ours and I had decided, I think nice nicely on this word as well.

Speaker 3:          00:16:38       Look, I think we can all agree that vest, that fet action was soulless and first we are not like, and as a result of that you'll notice that we have not done that again. Jordan Peterson on Barbara hand handles only doubling down on his positions.

Speaker 2:          00:16:53       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:55       Many more resources. A much wider base of support.

Speaker 2:          00:17:00       Yeah. Are you going to visit here and try and, and protest outside his talk?

Speaker 3:          00:17:08       Any number of things? These are things to be doing

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       line or are you going to plan fighting foams? The places he speaking.

Speaker 3:          00:17:19       Okay. That's just unfair.

Speaker 2:          00:17:20       Oh, okay. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:17:25       We've done it once. I've clearly stated sort of towards a bad idea and if we don't some teams to repeat tips. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:33       Well RSRs yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:17:38       as far as we're concerned. So best thing we can do in order to, the best thing we can do in order to counteract speak, just to make people aware of what his views are. What are you said and how else fan base behaves

Speaker 5:          00:17:49       and all these views are very reasonable and seem to be having a positive effect on the massive number of people who were saying IRS. Well cause it's the truth. Iris, I thank you for your time. That's Iris Christianne of Oakland Pace Action.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       So that's that. The Auckland Peace Action Group did release it. Another press release on the 14th stating Auckland Peace Action is issuing a statement to publicly correct the record about a protest action that occurred in Wellington in 2018 there's action occurred at the screening of the film, Ben Gurion at the dark edge film festival, both Oakland Peace Action and our sister organization Peace Action Wellington opposed to showing of this film as it is subject to an international boycott on behalf of Palestinian civil society organizations at both Wellington and Auckland screenings. The screenings were disrupted by activists with noisemakers and alarms. Subsequently, the dark edge director alleged that there was a fake bomb at the Wellington screening and this was reported by new hub. This was a complete lie. There was never, ever any fake bomb of any sort whatsoever, and z police attended both protests and we're fully aware that the items in the theaters were noisemakers as we're the theater goers. The theater was not evacuated and no one was arrested. So it appears that at least as far as Auckland peace action is concerned that Sean overstated the case in that lecture. In any case the next day I had a chance to talk to him directly. And so now we're going to segue directly into that.

Speaker 5:          00:19:35       Your face. Let's get the pronouns out of the way. What would you prefer? I call you professor, Dr. Jordan. Jordan's spine. Jordan's fine. I like it that way as well. Um, Jordan, my first question for you and the reaction here in New Zealand, um, to the very idea that you're coming here or that you're fronting on this show today. I just got to say, and I've watched you for a couple of years, you are one of the most hated people online. Why do you think it is that while people hate you?

Speaker 6:          00:20:06       I'm hated by a very small minority of very noisy and committed people. Yeah. And so, um, they're noisy and committed and so they can make a lot of racket and they are very good at it and often the profit often professionally trained to do so. And they're very casual with there. What would you call it? Epithets. I mean, I was listening to you introduced me and you, you listed off about 20, um, terrible things that I might be many of which were contradictory, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.

Speaker 5:          00:20:38       Well, it's so hilarious you, you kind of get your celebrity gets co opted from people on all sorts of parts of the political and extremes of the political spectrum, doesn't it?

Speaker 6:          00:20:50       Well, I think there's some of that. Um, I don't know if it gets co-opted too much on the radical left, let's say. Although I certainly face the majority of my opposition from the radical left, but the radical right types are not very fond of me either. There was a new book written called Dianetics by a rather reprehensible individual named Fox Day. And if you want to find out what the ethno nationalists think about me, that's pretty good read. I wouldn't call it precisely complimentary.

Speaker 5:          00:21:19       Hmm. Look on a personal level, and I'm someone who has fallen foul of the vagaries of Twitter pylons, but what's directed at you? Is it a whole different level, Jordan? And you've admitted, I know that you have or not struggled, but you, you admit your, you've had episodes of depression in your life. I know people who have been horribly affected by the most minor pylon on social media. How do you as an individual take or channel that hatred to Gooden and I imagined that affects your family as well?

Speaker 6:          00:21:53       Well, part of it is that I have a pretty solid family. You know, I have lots of people behind me, like my wife is firmly behind me without hesitation. Um, my children are behind me and they're smart and mature and my parents are behind me and I have a good set of friends. And, um, also generally I try not to talk about things that I don't know. Something about which also helps. Yeah. So, and I'm, I'm not impressed with the sorts of ideological positions that have been put forth, especially by the left wing radical types in the universities. And I understand what they're doing and why reasonably well. And, um, I feel that whatever vitriol happens to be directed at me is trivial in terms of its danger in comparison to the overwhelming social danger that these ideologies are producing. And so better to do something about it now than to wait.

Speaker 5:          00:22:53       Hmm. Oh, so, and I, social media world that is dominated by extremism and hatred and vitriol, uh, people I know who have have watched you, uh, literally dumbstruck by your ability to remain civil and to engage in debate without getting angry at those who, who often absolutely lambasted you. I think I've only seen there was a debate you did with Stephen Fry where, uh, an American pastor had to go and I think I saw some five there. I think you were genuinely upset, but you seem to have a remarkable, remarkable ability to play the ball, not the man or woman.

Speaker 6:          00:23:32       Well, that, that debate the monk debate that you're talking about. Mostly I was upset about the foolishness, you know, um, the, the person I was debating with Cole called me an angry white and it just struck me as so, so rhetorically foolish and inflammatory and unnecessary. All of those things at the same time. Uh, first of all, he was in Canada and not in the United States. And those sorts of statements actually don't go over very well in Canada. And my race had absolutely nothing to do with what we were talking about. And so it was just the kind of troublemaking statement that does nothing but make things worse. And I'm never happy when I see people behaving in a manner that only makes things worse. And so that, that I felt even, it's a funny thing, I can't say exactly felt bad for him, but I thought it was so foolish of him to undermine his own credibility in that manner.

Speaker 6:          00:24:33       It was just this sort of performance that removes all patients, you know, a bad rhetorical statement and unnecessary racist comment, a rhetorical flourish that had nothing but counterproductive consequences. As you can see by the youtube commentary, added nothing at all that was productive to the debate, didn't address the issues at hand, was a cheap method of scoring points, uh, a way of playing victim. I mean, it was all together. Um, uh, uh, second grade performance. And, and because he had academic pretensions was a professor. I have a lot less patience for professors and professional journalists than I do for, you know, other people because, well, because they're, they're supposed to, well that's,

Speaker 5:          00:25:20       I thought Stephen Fry was brilliant in that debate. I used to, man started outside. You didn't agree with a lot of what you said, but he was going to stand next year and fight your side. And he also said I'm, the world would be a much better place if everyone was less convinced of how right they were.

Speaker 6:          00:25:37       Yeah. Well Steven Fry is really something, it was a pleasure to meet him and he's uh, he's quite the remarkable person. So that was one of the very good things about that evening.

Speaker 5:          00:25:46       Hmm. We're going to take a bright Jordan and then I want to talk to you about an interview I did yesterday and if that's typical of the stuff that you get. Yeah, that was great. The interview man, we would talk to Jordan B. Peterson here on magic talk back and just to see, and we would talk to Jordan B. Peterson cultural phenomenon. And according to Oakland Peace Action. The biggest threat to New Zealand's way of life and civilization that, oh, I don't know. We've seen since the last earthquake. Uh, they came out earlier this week and through a lot of labels, uh, at Dr. Peterson and the spokesman, Iris or spokesperson Iris came on with me yesterday, some of these, so I could ask them to well provide the proof of their accusations. Um, I didn't think he did that well or they did that well, Jordan.

Speaker 6:          00:26:33       Uh, well it was quite the remarkable interview. I think that, uh, I don't know how many people have watched it or listened to it, but I suspect quite a few and it's no wonder because it was, it was, um, a real feat of journalistic persistence, I would say on your part, you didn't let your, your interviewee off the hook for a moment and there wasn't much content there. There was a lot of exactly the same sort of thing that's been happening for the last two years. It's really quite appalling. And that what seems to happen generally in the journalistic sphere on the negative side for me is that there's a list of epithets that are, it's like all the radical leftists have a list of epithets that are sort of add hand. Maybe they have them on a little sticky on their computer, misogynist, homophobe, Islamophobe transphobes a bigot, racist. Uh, then there's often some either Nazi, uh, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:27:33       Oh, don't forget you

Speaker 6:          00:27:36       location [inaudible] or there's Jewish shill, which is another one that comes up now and then, and then, um, the idea seems to be that if you don't agree with what someone says that you just lay out the longest possible list of Pejorative, that your imagination, your collective imagination can generate and hope that one of them is sufficiently true in some sense because of something you once said that it sticks and you're done. And it's, it's getting downright Dell. I mean,

Speaker 5:          00:28:03       but what seems to be that liberal journalists throughout the Western world have been lining up to try and take you down?

Speaker 6:          00:28:12       Oh yeah. Well, I mean, I've had a fair number of journalists who've been supportive, supportive of me. Now, whether or not they are on the liberal side, there's certainly not on the radical left side. Um, yes, this has been happening pretty much nonstop for two years. Um, and they're basically out of insults as far as I can tell, which in some sense disarms them, but they're actually getting rather dull to read because it's always the same old thing. Ang, although the person you interviewed yesterday did have a new twist, which was greatest threat to the civilization of New Zealand, which was really quite impressive as far as pejorative went.

Speaker 5:          00:28:50       Alright. So we've dealt with, and now you're in Australia now has the, if you like, the virulent opposition to you for whatever reason, is it starting to subside? And I know they haven't been protest as I understand so far in Australia.

Speaker 6:          00:29:08       Uh, there was a few in Adelaide, but, uh, about 25 and, and, and they, it wasn't exactly clear what they were protesting. Um, they seem to be more, uh, concerned about homosexual rights, um, which I don't really know what that has to do with me, but it had to do with whatever they were interested in. Uh, protesting, but there was nothing in Melbourne at all though. There was quite a large police presence at the venue. While there were a lot of people there, there's about 5,500 people, but there wasn't a single protester. And I would say that yes, overall, the, um, very elance and also the frequency of the hip pieces in the media is, has declined rather precipitously in the last three or four months. Um, I think it's because, well, because it's become dreadfully repetitious and because no smoking pistol of any sort has emerged, you know, people have gone over virtually everything I've said to students for the last 20 years because almost all of it is recorded and scoured my Twitter feed and my Facebook and you know, all this social media, um, platforms that are usable and haven't been able to find anything so far that's of sufficient reprehensive bility to, um, take my reputation out

Speaker 5:          00:30:32       the dots so that we have Jordan come on.

Speaker 6:          00:30:35       Well, it's not just a bit weird. It's very weird, but you know, it's not something I, let's say.

Speaker 5:          00:30:47       Alright. Um, I want to go back two years and in many ways I look at you and if I was going to put you in a fibril, you're the guy who said the emperor has no clothes, the emperor of wokeness of political correctness of third wave feminism. Did you plan two years ago to be where you are now? I cultural phenomena, global cultural phenomenon. Was it all part of some, some clever manipulation of modern social media? Or did you just stand up and say, I'm not going to do this? Well,

Speaker 6:          00:31:22       I mean, I was writing a book and I was hoping it would be successful. So there was that. And you know, I had been experimenting quite substantially with, um, with, uh, youtube, putting my, my lectures from the university on Youtube and some lectures that I had done for a small television show and they were developing a certain following. So I had about a million views Po far before the political controversy hit. But no, I mean, there's no way of predicting what happened. It's completely unpredictable phenomenon. But a phenomenon, but I can't say that I said what I felt like saying as carefully as I possibly could and I'd pretty much had enough of it. I mean, seriously, I've had enough of it and, um, I'm not happy with the radical leftists. I think the postmodern philosophy is, um, what intellectually Vapid, nihilistic, malevolent, destructive, arrogant and narcissistic, impractical as well.

Speaker 6:          00:32:24       All at the same time. I think that what's happening to the humanities and social sciences is borders on fraudulently criminal. If it hasn't already passed the line. And I'm absolutely no friend whatsoever of radical leftist utopians I feel that there's, after a hundred years of evidence of complete bloody catastrophe on the side of the radical left, um, it's time for us to wake up and notice that something has gone wrong on that end of the spectrum. And I don't see any responsibility being taken for that at all. You know, I've called publicly for the moderate leftist types who might have some sympathy for, to draw some lines. It's like, all right, we know that things can go too far on the left when exactly where, where is it that you go too far? Now my sense it's with the equity doctrine, which I think is, um, not really emotionally powerful. Unfortunately. It doesn't have that, that kick that's necessary to make something really stick in the memory. But I think the idea of equality of outcome is, um, dangerous beyond comprehension.

Speaker 5:          00:33:34       Oh, Ron, I want to talk about a few things going on in New Zealand, which is, you know, part of the culture war. We are part of the global community and we connected online. A fist up we have a cabinet, um, the Labor Party, uh, the largest member of a part of our coalition government. It has a quota, a male female quota for cabinet posts. What Canada too. Yeah. What do you think of that?

Speaker 6:          00:33:59       All right, thanks. I think there's absolutely no excuse for it. I think that it's an, it's a, you know, the, the, the radical leftists are always yammering on about biological essentialism, which they are so associated with something it can to fascism. You know, the idea that there are mutable biological characteristics that define people and yet they're the first people to insist that if you're going to have a cabinet that is let's say both competent and representative, that you have to divide it according to identity categories. And first and foremost, perhaps the ones of sex and, and to pick your cabinet by Genitalia is not an acceptable technical move. And exactly the same thing happened in Canada where 25% of our major parties, elected officials who are female, but 50% of the cabinet members or members ended up being female. And all that means what that certainly means is that the [inaudible], the most qualified people were not selected because it's statistically impossible for them to have been selected.

Speaker 6:          00:35:01       It was cheap virtue signaling. And, and it's also technically impossible even from the perspective of the leftist themselves with their intersectionality because they insist that people have to be judged in relationship to their oppression on multiple dimensions simultaneously. And I've done some back of the envelope mathematical calculations and if you have 10 dimensions that mark you out, let's say as in terms of your, of the group affiliations that characterize you, then you're the only person like that the world. So as you multiply, all you have to do is do the math as you multiply the number of groups that have to be given favored status because if there hypothetically oppressed situation, then you make it increasingly impossible for equality of outcome to even be to, to, to be something that can be practically implemented without a bureaucracy of, of terrifying proportions.

Speaker 5:          00:36:02       We also have a ministry of Women's affairs in New Zealand and the Minister of women's of feasible, the minister for a woman is, she's known suggested recently that they were too many white old men on boards in New Zealand, the private and public companies and just suggested that they needed to move aside so there could be more diversity. Your response to that suggestion?

Speaker 6:          00:36:28       Well, um, what, what's her racial and ethnic background just out of

Speaker 5:          00:36:32       hear you? I think she's born in America. Julianne. Gina. She's a member of green potty. Yeah. Is she white? Yes. Well maybe it,

Speaker 6:          00:36:41       it's time for her to bloody well move aside and let someone who isn't white have her position. All right,

Speaker 5:          00:36:47       so you've done a great job with Julianne Jeans. Instance.

Speaker 6:          00:36:50       There's also, look, they've tried this in Scandinavia where they put, you know, they've put quotas for females on boards and part of the idea was that if you did that that you would increase the rate at which women would move through managerial and administrative status rankings and that has had zero success.

Speaker 5:          00:37:09       This suggestion also is Jordan, that actually women can somehow um, up the financial performance of companies sure. That you don't believe they'd stats that resonance.

Speaker 6:          00:37:22       No evidence for that. What, what, what elevates the financial, uh, productivity of companies is quite clear. Trait conscientiousness, which is a marker for integrity and trustworthiness and diligence, diligence and due to fullness is a very good predictor of long term economic productivity. And so his general cognitive ability and that holds across sexes and races. And the reason for that, and this is the non racist and nonsexist way of looking at the world by the way, is that there is far more dif difference between individuals within groups than there are between groups. Because look, the fundamental racist, sexist, uh, ethnocentric proposition is that there are more differences between groups of people then there are within groups of people. Yeah. That's essentially the racist doctorate. Yeah. And so we need some black people because you know, all those black people are the same. And unless we have a voice or two from a black person, then we don't have that set of identity issues represent it.

Speaker 6:          00:38:31       Well, it's just simply not the case because most of the diversity comes at the level of individual personality and temperament. And the literature on that is crystal clear. You know, these, these, these are pseudo intellectual claims made by people on the radical left and they're very dangerous because they're easily shifted into the sorts of things that the radical right likes to enjoy, which is, oh, I see. There are immutable differences between Gen the sexist and the races and there are substantial import. And that we, we, we, we, we are, we need to take them into account when we're, uh, uh, what, what, what would you just say formulating such things as immigration policy. So no, there's no evidence that those claims are correct and, and there's counter evidence for much of it for so example in, in Scandinavian, and this is, this is as close to psychological factors, any thoughts that exist is that as you increase equality of opportunity, which means you open the doors for more and more people and especially in let's say with regards to sex.

Speaker 6:          00:39:39       Um, and, and that's had a big effect because of course there's far more women in the workforce than there than there once was. You increase the degree to which outcomes differ on multiple dimensions. And that's partly, there's a variety of reasons for that. At least a dozen. And they're all important, one of which is that women, especially once they hit their thirties prefer to work part time. And that's not bad or wrong. And it's certainly not an indication of systemic sexism. So the radical types like to have one explanation. Everyone isn't exactly the same with regards to outcome. Therefore the system is a corrupt patriarchy. It's like you can learn that in one minute in a, in a propaganda course in university and then you have an answer for every problem that ever be, sets you politically for the rest of your life and there's no excuse for it. It's appalling scholarship.

Speaker 5:          00:40:34       I want to come back to that point. The other thing, Bill proposed, bill we hit before at parliament is the idea of six self identification to make it easier for people to alter their birth certificates if they choose to identify as anything other than the sex they were born as. You'll views on on that sort of legislation.

Speaker 6:          00:40:57       Well, the first thing I would say, it might be useful to really address some important problems. That would be the first thing is you're dealing with an absolutely tiny minority of people. Not that that's completely without import. But the second thing is it has to be thought through and it's not, I mean, I don't know if you've been following,

Speaker 5:          00:41:17       oh, we just having a little hiccup there and we're talking to Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, who's joining us from Scott, from Sydney, Jordan. We were talking about, so six self od did vacation, uh, changes or proposed reforms in New Zealand. You see it firstly, it's a number

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       of people affected and seeking. Did you say we need to think it through? In what way? Well, one of the things that's happened for example, so really what this is, is an attempt by a certain ideological movement too, to put forth the insistence that sex is only a sociological construct, that it's only something learned and so that it can be changed at whim, which is also a strange thing because if it's learned, it can't really be changed at whim. And also if it's learned, it could be unlearned, which is something that the people who are putting this legislation forward aren't really thinking through because that opens up the opportunity for people who would like to reform people who would like to change their gender back to say normative behavior. Because if it's learned, it can be unlearned. But more importantly, sex roles are not only learned there, partly learned and there's plenty of biological differences between men and women and, and many of them aren't trivial, like men and women are more the same than they are different.

Speaker 6:          00:42:42       But the differences are quite market at the extremes. And so what we're seeing partly as a consequence of this now is the movement of say Trans Women into female sports. You saw this in Minnesota just the other day, I think it was Minnesota where I knew Lee, um, transition trans woman has been shattering the weightlifting records for women and Commonwealth Games competitor. It was a form of mind. Yes, it's absolutely insane. You know, I mean, first the fact that it's allowed to begin with is beyond comprehension. It's a real sign of cultural insanity. And the second is that psychologically it's almost incomprehensible. I can't imagine how you could be a man who transformed himself into a woman and all the ways that that's possible. And then decided to go compete in it at a high level sports arena with women who've been training their whole lives to hit the peak of their ability and then to absolutely bloody demolish them, say after a year of work.

Speaker 6:          00:43:51       And then to tout that as some sort of victory for the oppressed. It's completely what's narcissistic beyond comprehension. And it's, it's, it's, well, it's a sign of what happens when you don't carefully think things through. All sorts of unexpected consequences tend to manifest themselves. And you'll see the same thing happening now with rapid onset gender dysphoria and the treatment of very young people with very powerful hormonal and surgical techniques designed to permanently alter their psychophysiological structure. And like, we're going to pay for this in a big way in 15 years when these kids grow up and hit adulthood and start tossing out lawsuits as they certainly will. And should we're, we're going to look back and wonder just exactly what the hell was wrong with us. So it's, it's, it's, it's, well, it's driven by this ideology that that's been formulated by people like Judith Butler who absolutely insist because they have no biological knowledge, which whatsoever that all the differences between men and women are socially constructed, which is absolutely not true.

Speaker 5:          00:45:00       Absolutely. In general terms, Jordan, and we have it in this country and indeed everywhere we look at the millennial generation, they get a bit of stick here. The cold snow flakes, they seem to get outraged not on the, on their own behalf, but on behalf of others at the drop of a hat. And they use social media as elsewhere in the world to call out the things they find offensive or the feelings. Do you think there is a collective generational psychosis occurring because of social media?

Speaker 6:          00:45:34       Um, I don't know if the millennial generation is any less sane than the baby boomers. I mean the baby boomers had plenty of trouble and they cost plenty of grief and misery in the 1960s and experimented, you know, crazily with psychedelic drugs and a wild lifestyle and promiscuous sex and all of those things. And I don't think that the millennials are any worse or any better. I do think that, um, there is a small subset of them who are rather dependent and rather narcissistic and who are being encouraged in both of those by reprehensible adults in positions of authority primarily in the universities to make the most of their victim hood feelings and status. And I do think that the social media platforms also allow for a disproportionate effect of social effect of people who have extreme views that also in combination with the, with the increasing death of the, of the standard collective media, which is increasingly desperate for attention. And so we'll spend more and more attention paying to people who paying spends more and more time paying attention to people who have extreme views on the right end of life.

Speaker 5:          00:46:52       Making that

Speaker 6:          00:46:57       well, it's, it's possible. Well, I bet. I mean, I've certainly been represented as an extreme figure and that's really something that, apart from the fact that I'm adamant in my opposition to the radical leftists, which is rather rare among intellectuals,

Speaker 5:          00:47:11       which brings us rather nicely, Jordan, to what I'm talking about. I asked people to call and use today and it was remarkable the variety and number of people who sent me messages and rang and said simply reading your book had changed their life. And uh, can I just put a call out if you want to talk to Jordan, we've got quarter, hour, hour, 808 four four, seven, four, seven. If you'd like to ask a question or seem the mason jar or just say something to Jordan, you can ring in now are 808 four four, seven, four, seven Jordan, it also seems to me, as much as I see all the hatred against you and the controversy around you online, Geez, there's a lot of love there and there's a lot of positivity and you seem to be engaging and smiling and with young people, there's some good stuff happening here, isn't there?

Speaker 6:          00:47:56       Oh yeah, way, way more than the, like the, the, the vitriol vitriolic aspect of it is only a sporadic bother to me. Um, usually in the aftermath of a particularly difficult interview with a journalist, but the tour, I mean, I've been to about 140 cities now around the world, and the average audience size is, well, it's varied between 20 508,000, um, with, I would say an average of about 2,500 to 3000. And they're, the events are unbelievably, yeah. Positive. So most of the time I'm surrounded by nothing but positive responses. And when I go out on the street, no, wherever I go, you know, in a typical hour all be stopped by six or seven people. They're usually young men because the media has convinced.

Speaker 5:          00:48:52       Yeah, I actually was going to say yesterday we had justice been a young woman and middle aged women and middle age men ringing in.

Speaker 6:          00:48:58       Well, that's good. I think that's changed to some degree because of the book. But, um, all of the interactions that I have with people on the street or in airports or so on, they're all incredibly positive. People are very polite. They come up, uh, they're usually apologetic for interrupting. They introduced themselves. They tell me that watching my lectures are listening to the audio or reading the book has changed their life. They usually tell me a story about what's changed. They have a better time.

Speaker 5:          00:49:25       What office do that in real time right now. Um, Jordan, say hello to Rachel.

Speaker 7:          00:49:30       Hello Rachel. Oh, cure to Jordan. Um, I'm doing nervous to be talking to you and I'm gonna not very, very good at being precise in Westminster and when I keep it very brief and just say thank you as all I wanted to say. Um, I'm one of the people whose life has been changed immeasurably by your book and your lectures and everything that you stand for has really had a massive positive influence on me. So I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am.

Speaker 6:          00:49:57       I was. So, what's changed?

Speaker 7:          00:50:00       Uh, it would take a very long time to get into it, but I have struggled with, uh, mental health issues for the majority of my life since puberty. I'm 30 now and I've been through every type of treatment, counseling, therapy, medication, everything you can think of and you know, things have helped me briefly for a little while and got better and then got worse again. But your book, um, I guess it's the adoption of personal responsibility more than anything. And, and the more responsibility I take on, the more I find I'm able to in, the more I'm able to get myself out there and put myself in situations I wouldn't have normally had the confidence to. I'm standing up straighter. I'm not that great at keeping my room tidy yet, but I'm working on it a little things, everything just bit by bit. The more I take on, the more, the bigger it gets.

Speaker 6:          00:50:49       Yes. Well that's a good rule. That's a good rule. You know, that's a good psychotherapeutic rule is the more that you take on without overloading yourself, you know, because you have to be sensible about it. The more you find that you have abilities that will manifest themselves, that had been hidden up to that point because of fear and avoidance and so more power to you as far as I'm concerned. And I'm very glad to hear that what I've been doing has been helpful. Good on your Rachel. Mary, welcome.

Speaker 8:          00:51:19       Um, thank you very much for this opportunity. I'm doctor, I was staring into the abyss and now I'm not. Um, I moved through my life. It was fleet. Consider every action and reaction, uh, treat myself like I'm someone, a kid for four. It's been a revelation to me encountering you. I was in a very, very, very top slice and somehow I found you online. I don't know if it was through Dave Rubin or, or who Shapiro or, or, um, I'm not quite sure how it happened, but I've seen the Ilitches have, I'll listen to it. You mentioned meaning your elixirs on Genesis. Um, and it's just been a remarkable turnaround in my life and my family's life. Um, and I just want to say thank you.

Speaker 6:          00:52:15       Hey Man, I'm thrilled to hear it. So do you, do you have any sense of what in particular did it, like what was it that struck you?

Speaker 8:          00:52:24       I think it just depends on the store way that you spoke and it was just such plain English. It was, as you described previously, that was some rules are I sort of sort of cliches, but they hadn't been spoken of in a very long time. And it was as the previous coolest state, that positional responsibility, the, the taking care of oneself and it just struck such a chord. It was, I knew some of the things that you were saying, I'd heard them before, but I hadn't had them in a very long time. My father used to say, yeah, I'm strike. We just showed his bag and, and finally there was a game, but it was being seen in a different way. And it, yeah, it wasn't

Speaker 6:          00:53:08       I why Aa, that's, that's the thing. And that's what I tried to do with my lectures. And partly because I'm a behavioral psychologist, it's like we have all these more rules and, and people are told the rules, but they're very seldom given a multidimensional of why the rules are necessary. You know, it's while you should do it because that's what people do or that's because you know, that's what good people do or it's your responsibility and all those things are true. But the explanation of why it's true and how it's related to the responsibility that gives your life meaning and also improves the world, your family and the community, that's, that's often lacking. And so that's what I was trying to provide and in as clear and, and, and in English, as clear as I could manage it. And so, you know, it, I've tried to make it practical and useful for people and I'm really very, very happy to hear that it's worked for you and for your family. I'm thrilled to hear it as I always am when I hear a story like that. Um, pizza joins us now. Welcome Peter.

Speaker 8:          00:54:14       Well, you're doing, yeah. Hello. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:54:18       hello. How are you doing Peter?

Speaker 8:          00:54:20       Very, very little hay. Um, have you in a moment of self reflection head a little bit on, on this amazing and astounding following you created and, and one did where it's going to end up because at the risk of sending oxymoronic, you're probably the closest thing to secular humanist. Here's to a messiah.

Speaker 6:          00:54:43       Well, I thought about that. I wouldn't say precisely in those terms. Um, I mean, one of the things I did learn from studying Carl Young years ago was that if you're going to talk about archetipal stories, which I do all the time, did you have to be very careful not to confuse yourself with the archetype, you know? And so I'm, I'm, I'm very cognizant of the danger of the kind of popularity that I'm experiencing. And I do mean the danger because the higher you fly, the faster you can fall. And, and you have to be very careful to ensure that you're not increasing the probability of that. Um, I try to make sure that I credit other people with many of the ideas that I, I've formulated and, and because I've learned a lot from reading the great clinicians and, and philosophers have the last say 150 years and from my clinical practice and so on.

Speaker 6:          00:55:38       And so, and I think of this endeavor not as something that I'm doing, but as something that we're all collectively engaged in because I know that you know, that there's an old idea that every person is a center of the world and that the weight of the world for better or worse ways upon the shoulders of each person. And I really believe that's true. And so if you know that, then it keeps the ego TISM and the arrogance down partly out of sheer terror and it makes it much more effective to deal with people. Like when I'm lecturing in front of an audience, I'm not lecturing to them, you know, I'm lecturing with them, talking about problems that we all have, including me and aims that we all hold, need to develop, including me. And you have to include yourself, so to speak, among the centers and the, and the reprehensible types in order to communicate with people properly. I do my best to ensure that I'm starkly aware of my shortcomings and false, that every moment I can possibly manage. And I have family and friends who also help keep what I'm doing and check and to make sure that it's not going sideways in some manner. That's, you know, where I'm taking things for granted or becoming arrogant or any of that. And so, so far that's worked out well and hopefully it will continue to. Joe, welcome to the program.

Speaker 7:          00:57:07       Oh, hi Joe. Thanks for talking with me. Uh, Jordan.

Speaker 4:          00:57:11       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:57:11       Hi Joe. How are you doing?

Speaker 7:          00:57:13       Good, thank you. So I'm a young academic in New Zealand and one of the problems, well one of the stations I would say we haven't needed this days is focused on race and gender. So I'm, I would call a centrist position, um, somewhat liberal minded. But what advice would you give a young academic pushing against the, what I see is the file if the gender of the universities.

Speaker 6:          00:57:44       Well, the first thing I would say is there a lot more moderate types of your store then you think. And so if you're a careful person and you're thinking things through and you have things to object to, you can be sure, virtually sure that a majority of people agree with you even though there are two. Um, how loud let's say, uh, to, to speak up. Um, I would say get your thoughts in order, you know, so you know what you stand for. And then I would also say don't agree with anything that you don't agree with because all that'll happen. Yeah. And you're a young academic. All the will happen if you compromise your intellectual Saul like increment by increment over the next 10 years is that you will end up alcoholic and, and bitter, hating your job, despised by your undergraduates and absolutely sick of your existence.

Speaker 6:          00:58:42       And it's like you gotta keep that really firmly in mind because every time you're called upon to stand forth or something you believe in, it's a, it's a test of character and courage and it's easy to put it off because it's a lot of trouble. You know, it's a lot of conflict and you might think, Oh God, do I really have to go through with this? I've got other things to do. And if the answer is, well, I better stand up for what I believe in now because if I keep letting it go increment by increment for the next 10 years, I'm going to end up in a position that that is absolutely dreadful. You know, you'll be much older than you need to be and all of the thrill that should be part of teaching young people and doing research and staying on the cutting edge of knowledge. All of that will have been taken away by the India logs who already know everything and insist that they get to regulate what you think and say. So good to have the small fights. One by one

Speaker 5:          00:59:41       value of the lucky last is the coolest Jordan's split yet.

Speaker 9:          00:59:46       Yes. Talk to Jordan Peterson. You are awesome man are already booked and we were following you. I'm a student of psychology philosophy myself. I did a degree and I'm doing my post here and a lot of what you say, you know, there's a wee bit of each in there and um, you know, and I totally agree because we live in a, sorry, where like for me, I often say what I think and I have to moderate there, but particularly today in our society, when you do that, you're in way more trouble for offending someone or something and all. I love the fact that you kind of get it out there and I wish that you know it, it'll be handy to just didn't get it out and people can hear and get over one. One question I was wanting to ask you though. I mean I'm a, I'm a Christian, but I studied, um, mock is, she really is, and I read his book and I feel those books. I, you went to stoicism.

Speaker 6:          01:00:46       Um, not, I wouldn't say specifically lots of people who have been studying stoicism have talked to me and suggested that I should be. The overlap I think is that the stoic virtues have been radically underplayed in our society. Um, because we have this idea that life is easy and that we should be happy and well, first of all, life isn't easy and perhaps we should be happy. But there's lots of times when we're not going to,

Speaker 5:          01:01:14       I hate to break this up, both coming up to the news. We've got calls stacked up. I'm hoping to meet you when you come here and I'd like to invite you now if you get any spare time and you'll share jewel to come into the studio because literally our boards are full with people who want to talk to you. I also want to thank you enormously for your time today and for assuring us that you will not, you know, they to the visit will not lead to the downfall of New Zealand's civilization as we know it.

Speaker 6:          01:01:43       Well, I hope not. I hope not because I think you have quite a civilization and it would, I'd hate to be the bringer of its downfall. So

Speaker 5:          01:01:50       well, hope that tap lovely talking to you, Jordan. Thank you very much for your time.
