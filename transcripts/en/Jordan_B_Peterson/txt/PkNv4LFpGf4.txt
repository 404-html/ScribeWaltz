Speaker 1:          00:02          Many of you will no doubt. Remember Lindsay Shepherd, she was the teaching assistant in the Department of communications at Wilfrid laurier university who was subjected to a three member panel of inquiry after she showed a video taken from Canadian public television of me debating the compelled speech legislation introduced in federal bills. See 16 she showed my discussion with Nicholas Matt who held the opposite position. Here is part of the discussion and question, what do we do this? Let's take a moment. We're going to explain a few basic things here. The issue of so called non traditional pronouns goes together with nontraditional gender identities. New York City for example, recognizes 31 such gender expressions. In other words, besides man and woman, there are 29 other gender expressions. For example, Penn Gender Queer, gender, gender fluid, crossdresser by gendered gender blender and the list goes on and Nicholas, this is where I want to bring you in the discussion because you teach this, you teach trans studies, so if you would give us a brief primer on so many gender identities that in your view require non traditional pronouns.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Basically, it's not correct that there is such a thing as biological sex. And I'm a historian of medicine. I can unpack that for you at great length if you want. But in the interest of time, I won't. The three member panel included professors, Nathan Ramboo, Canna, her supervisor, her bird Pimlott in charge of the master's program and Adriana Joel Manager of gendered violence and sexual assault prevention, shepherd tape the meeting and released it publicly producing what I think was the biggest scandal that ever envelop it. Canadian University and certainly the only one in living memory that became news internationally.

Speaker 2:          01:51          Nothing has, can you share people from those ideas? Am I supposed to come for them and uh, make sure that they are insulated away from this? Like is that, what's the point of this is because to me that is so against what a university is about. So against it, I was not taking sides. I was presenting both arguments. Okay. So the thing of it is about this is if you're presenting something like this, it, uh, you have to think about the kind of teaching climate that you're creating. And this is actually, these arguments are counter to the Canadian human rights code. Uh, ever since I know that you talked about, um, [inaudible] ever since this past, it is discriminatory to be targeting someone, um, due to their gender identity or gender expression. So bringing something like that up in class, not critically, and I understand that you're trying to like, it was critical.

Speaker 2:          02:50          I introduced it critically. How so? Like I said, like I said, it was in the spirit of debate. Okay. In the spirit of the debate is slightly different than being like, okay, this is, this is like a problematic idea that we want when we want to unpack. But that's taking sides. Like it's taking sides for me to be like, oh, look at this guy. Like everything that comes out of his mouth is bs, but we're going to watch anyway. Okay. So I understand the position that you were coming from and your positionality, but the reality is that it has created a toxic climate for some of the students. Hey, you know how many, it's great. Ooh, like how many, okay. One, yes. May I speak? I have no, I have no concept of of like how many people complained like what their complaint was. You haven't showed me the complaint. Yes, I understand that this is upsetting, but there's also confidential at the end of confidentiality matters. The number of people's confidential. Yes.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Although the university apologize publicly for its treatment of shepherd as did Ramboo Kenna, it is not clear at all that the powers that be so to speak learned their lesson and the mistreatment of shepherd not only continued but arguably intensified, so she decided to press her case legally and presented the statement of claim against the three and Wilfred laurier early in the second week of June. It lists in painful detail the many ways that this situation was mishandled during and after the initial inquisition. I also discussed the situation with Howard Levitt shepherds lawyer. I decided that Wilford Loria had learned very little from its public embarrassment and the shepherds claims were valid, justifiable and necessary, including her statement that our future lack of employability in academia was improbable to say the least. I've been on hiring committees and I can tell you that even then the slightest whiff of scandal is enough to disqualify a candidate and consequence. Not only did I decide to read and post the entirety of shepherds claims, which I will do in a few minutes, I also decided to launch a claim of my own against the same defendants. I thought that two lawsuits might make the point better than one. I'll read some of my claim to after shepherds and you can all make up your own minds about the suitability of this course of action.

Speaker 1:          05:17          Ontario Superior Court of Justice between Lindsay Shepherd, plaintiff and Nathan Ramboo, Canna Adria jewel, Herbert Pimlott and Wilfrid laurier university. Defendant's statement of claim two the defendant, a legal proceeding has been commenced against you by the plaintiff. The claim made against you is set out in the following pages. If you failed to defend this proceeding, judgment may be given against you in your absence and without further notice to you.

Speaker 3:          05:55          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:56          to Nathan Ramboo Cana and to Adria Joel and to Herbert Pimlott and to Wilfrid laurier university claim. The plaintiff claims the following against the defendants individually and cumulatively the following 500,000 for the tort of harassment, 500,000 for the tort of intentional infliction of nervous shock 500,000 for the tort of negligence, 100,000 for constructive dismissal, aggravated damages in the amount of 500,000 general damages in the amount of 500,000 punitive damages in the amount of $1 million. The plaintiff resides in the town of Waterloo in the province of Ontario, the defendant's Herbert Pimlott Lord and Nathan Ramboo. Kenna are professors at the defendant Wilfrid laurier university. Pim Log was the coordinator for the Master's program of the university and Ramboo. Kenna at the relevant time was the professor for the course which shepherd was a teaching assistant for both had considerable influence over the plaintiff's employment as a teaching assistant and status as a master's student.

Speaker 1:          07:09          The defendant, Adrian Joel was at all relevant times acting manager of the university's diversity and equity office in charge of gender violence prevention. The defendant university is a creature of statute created pursuant to the provisions of the Wilfred Laurier. Hey Act. The university is vicariously liable for all of the conduct of the individual defendants referred to herein and at all relevant times, created an environment supporting and facilitating acquiescing to and implicitly and sometimes explicitly endorsing that conduct. The constituent statute of the university to Wilford Laurier Act 1973 as amended 2001 and 2016 in providing the fundamental jurisdiction and authority for the university to operate states as its object in section four that the objects of the university are for the pursuit of learning through scholarship, teaching, and research within a spirit of free inquiry and expression. The university has no other object and no jurisdiction and no jurisdiction to operate otherwise.

Speaker 1:          08:20          The university has no other object and no jurisdiction to operate otherwise pursuant to section five powers of the university. The act further states that the university has all powers necessary and incidental to the satisfaction and further its of its objects as a university. The constituent statute creating an empowering the university provides it with no other power or authority. Shepherd was at all relevant times. A student in the university master's program pursuing your master's degree and employed as a teaching assistant for a course under Ramboo Cana. And following that under Professor Judith Nicholson as a teaching assistant, shepard supported a class taught by professor Rambo Kinda. She was generally responsible for teaching to groups of approximately 25 students, was assigned topics and was entitled pursuant to the policies of the university and have ramboo Canna to devise her own curriculum. Rambo Ghana wasn't indifferent mentor who had only met with Shepard twice about his course and only then briefly ironically given his complaint against her as delineated below.

Speaker 1:          09:27          He provided her with very limited direction as to the content to provide to her students in his classes. The topic for one of our communication classes held on November 1st, 2017 was grammar. She taught three classes that day. Shepherd introduced the topic of the grammatical correctness of gender neutral language in the evolution of various languages and do facilitate. Discussion on this subject showed a field minute extract from a TV Ontario program moderated by and Pakan consisting of a debate between professor Jordan Peterson of the University of Toronto, Psychology Department and Nicholas Matt from the University of Toronto's sexual diversity studies program, Peterson and Nicholas Matt. We're debating compelled gender pronouns. Peterson argued against being required to use these new words, which he argued had not developed organically. Matt took an opposing position shortly following that class, Ramboo Kana ordered her to attend a meeting the very next day with himself Pimlott the program coordinator for the entire Master's program and Adrian Joel Acting Director of the diversity and equity office.

Speaker 1:          10:39          Both Rambo, Kana and Pimlott had considerable authority over shepherds. Fate at the university, apparently so to Joel Shepherd had never been called into such a meeting. Indeed, Rambo Kana to that point had barely acknowledged her existence at this session. All three lambasted shepherd viciously attacking her personally, falsely alleging that there had been a complaint or complaints about her tutorial and insisting that in playing the TV Ontario clip, she had been threatening to her students. Ramboo Kanick claimed that are showing this TV Ontario clip breached the Charter of rights and freedoms and federal bill [inaudible], which is not even govern provincially regulated universities, created an unsafe learning environment and was illegal. Shepherd was accused of Targeting Trans folks even though Shepard had chosen no side had up until that point, disagreed with what she understood to be Peterson's perspective and presented the arguments and the debate neutrally. Rambo Kana attacked and slandered Peterson claiming that he was part of the alt right and that playing a clip of Peterson without first providing any previous context to the students was like neutrally playing a speech by Adolf Hitler. Shepherd argued the doing is he asked would be taking sides and that was not her role. She was then further rebuked for taking that position at various points during that almost hour long vicious and abusive attack, shepherd was reduced to tears. Ironically, rather than being a present day personification of Adolf Hitler as Ramboo county implied Jordan Peterson has spent decades educating his students about the evils of the Holocaust and specifically as part of his psychological teachings has studied and taught how individuals degenerate ethically to the point where they take place.

Speaker 3:          12:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:28          To the point where they take part in atrocities.

Speaker 3:          12:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:33          As part of his psychological teachings, he has studied and taught how individuals degenerate ethically to the point where they take part in atrocities. During the meeting, shepherd was effectively attack as a protege and supporter of Peterson. Pimlott continued to libel Peterson explaining that people like him live in a fantasy world of false conspiracy and accusing Shepard of being an agent of those ideas because she had neutrally shown this video with it's opposing viewpoints. Ramboo can have falsely but imaginatively claimed that shepherd herself was targeting people based on their gender identity or gender expression and in doing so had violated the Federal Human Rights Code of Bill. See 16 although shepherds conduct was in no way violet of of that or any law.

Speaker 3:          13:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:19          Sheppard asked the individual defendants whether her job as a teaching assistant was to shield her students from debate and ideas. Ramboo Kana asserted that it was, and then accused her of targeting students due to their gender expression and identity. When Shepard pointed out that she had not taken sides in this debate, the three rebuked her for creating a toxic climate. The three refused to advise shepherd what the complaint was or who complained, claiming that even the number of complaints was confidential. As was subsequently ascertained, there had been no complaint at all.

Speaker 3:          13:53          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          13:54          shepherd protested that she did not understand how we're teaching methods constituted any disservice to the university since the idea is in the video were already part of social currency. Joel responded without any foundation accusing her of spreading transphobia. Ramboo Kana added to jewel's attack by essentially comparing her actions to white supremacy. Contrary to the allegations of the defendants at this meeting, shepherd conducted herself at this seminar precisely as her role required and singularly represented the principles of the Wilfrid laurier university act for this, she was viciously attacked by Rambo, Canna Pimlott and Joel. They continued to abuse her even after she began sobbing, accusing Shepard of causing harm to unnamed students. Shepherd apologized for crying during the meeting. Pleading. I am stressed out because to me this is wrong so wrong, noting that the very spirit of the university to challenge ideas that you already have and reminding them that she had not taken any side or position.

Speaker 1:          14:58          The meeting concluded with Shepard being advised even after she promised to show no further videos of Peterson or anything of the like that she now had to run all of her seminar notes passed Ramboo Kenna to obtain specific approval for any future clips of anyone that she attended to show and that Rambo Canna might have to sit in on her future classes. She was prohibited from showing any further videos. Finally, they suggested to her that her job might be in jeopardy. The conduct of the defendants was objectively outrageous and flagrant. They had reckless disregard for the fact that the foreseeable consequences of their conduct would cause shepard to suffer emotional distress, which it did. There are various policies of the university which constitute a contract between the university and its members including Shepherd Article 1.01 of the procedures relating to the prevention of harassment and discrimination policy.

Speaker 1:          15:53          6.1 of the university notes that informal resolution possibilities as well as emotional academic and departmental supports will be explored. None of this occurred. It also noted in article 1.02 of the procedures relating to the prevention of harassment and discrimination policy 6.1 that if the concern falls outside of this policies jurisdiction or could be more appropriately dealt with elsewhere, the individual will be referred to the appropriate office that also did not occur under article 3.02 of policy 6.1 the office of dispute resolution and support will determine whether a complaint may go forward. Article Three Point Oh four states that the office is available to provide guidance on the preparation of a complaint or response to a complaint. That guidance was not provided to shepherd. Article 5.01 of policy 6.1 states that an investigation may be required when other efforts to resolve the complaint have not been successful or not appropriate in the complaint by Jackson referred to below.

Speaker 1:          17:01          No other efforts to resolve the complaint were considered before proceeding to the formal investigation of shepherd article 8.03 of policy 6.1 states that Wilfrid laurier university's prevention of discrimination and harassment policy is not intended to inhibit academic freedom. It was used by Ramboo Kana, Joel and Pimlott for precisely that purpose. Article 8.05 notes that the university may take disciplinary action against those who make allegations of harassment or discrimination which are reckless, malicious or not in good faith. Although Pimlott Ramboo, Kana and Joel had acted recklessly, maliciously and in bad faith and it was ultimately determined by the university that this meeting never should have occurred. No action has been taken by the university against them and shepherd was provided no protection from their predations. The prevention of harassment and discrimination policy provides in article 1.02 that each member of the campus community is responsible for helping to create an environment that promotes mutual respect and understanding for the dignity and rights of others.

Speaker 1:          18:08          This policy was violated by Rambo counter pim law and Joel. The prevention of harassment discrimination policy defines workplace harassment in article 2.04 as engaging in a course of vexatious comment or conduct against a worker in the workplace that is known or reasonably to be known to be unwelcome or workplace harassment. This provision to was violated by Rambo, Canna Pimlott and Joel. Article 2.07 defines a poisoned environment as were harassing or discriminatory behaviors are severe and or pervasive and cause unreasonable interference with a person's study or work environment. A poisoned environment may be created. A poisoned work or learning environment is one that is intimidating, hostile, and or offensive. A poisoned environment can arise even from a single incident. It may be created by the comments or actions of any person regardless of his or her status. Ramboo Bukana, Pimlott and Joel created a poisoned work environment for shepherd and thereby breached the university's contractual obligations to shepherd.

Speaker 1:          19:14          Article Four Point Oh four states that the university will take appropriate steps to fairly investigate, respond to allegations of discrimination and or harassment in accordance with the procedures relating to this policy. No such steps were taken. Instead, shepherd was wrongly attacked by the members of the administration until public and alumni outcry forced the university to retreat from its position. Following this meeting being publicized, mcclachi president of the university was interviewed on the agenda by Steve Pakan, the same show, from which the clip of the debate between Dr. Peterson and Matt was taken. She was repeatedly asked by Pakan whether Shepard had done anything wrong by showing this clip from his earlier show, mcclatchy effectively defended the conduct of Ramboo County, Joel and Pimlott. She refused to acknowledge the shepherd had not acted improperly, despite pagans continuing to press her on this shepherd had the foresight to taper inquisition when it began and after outrage from the public and alumni erupted.

Speaker 1:          20:16          The president of the university, Debra mcclachi and Ramboo. Kenna issued apologies in Ramboo Kennis forced apology. He continued to lie, still insisting that there had been a complaint and that he had been doing his duty by addressing it. It was only when public and alumni outrage group that mcclachi was ultimately forced to admit that what happened to Ms. Shepherd in the meeting was shameful and that the material she showed was entirely appropriate. That was a quote. This was only after an investigator found that there never had been any complaints, formal or informal, and that Ramboo Kinda Pim. Lots and Joel statements to the contrary. We're false and deceitful. The university admitted in this statement from its president that this meeting never should have happened at all. No formal complaint, nor even an informal concern relative to university policy had been registered as to the screening of the video.

Speaker 1:          21:10          The president only when besieged acknowledged that these errors and judgment were compounded by the misapplication of the university's policies and procedures, that basic guidelines and best practices on how to appropriately execute the roles and responsibilities of staff and faculty were ignored or not understood that procedures on how to apply university policies and under what circumstances were not followed and that institutional failure allowed this to happen. The president noted that as there was institutional failure, the responsibility ultimately started and ended with her. She further acknowledged that Ms. Sheppard was targeted with vitriol by members of the university. Mcclatchy admitted that shepherd was involved in absolutely no wrongdoing and publicly stated that the university was taking action to ensure that this did not occur again, a claim that was and remains entirely false. Shepherd has never received redress of any kind, nor has she been consulted about the input that this treatment has had on her and her career prospects.

Speaker 1:          22:14          Instead, she was subjected to continuing abuse and it talks at climate from the university and its representatives as described below in mcclatchy's apology on November 21st, 2017 she states that quote supports were in place to support student involvement in a situation who are targeted with extreme vitriol through the situation and quote. Yet she and the university offered shepherd no such support in mcclachi claiming to be troubled. By the way, quote everyone and quote involved in the situation was targeted with extreme vitriol. She showed the same and equal concern for shepherds predators. As for Shepard herself. The president also acknowledged that the rationale for invoking the gender and sexual violence policy did not exist, that it was misapplied and that this was a significant overreach. Shepherd relies on mcclatchy's admissions here in mcclachi claim that quote Lauria is committed to the abiding principles of freedom of speech and freedom of expression and quote, her conduct throughout entirely betrayed that goal in Ramboo Canis disingenuous apology to Shepard on November 21st, 2017 he stated open quote.

Speaker 1:          23:27          While I still cannot discuss the student concerns raised about the tutorial and quote, but no student concern had even been raised about the tutorial prior to his and his codefendants bullying of shepherd. He acknowledged that his meeting with a panel of three people would be an intimidating for shepherd and would not have invited a productive discussion ramboo can. His apology claimed that he quote did not do enough to try to support her shepherd and quote when he did absolutely nothing at all, but instead attacked her following the public outcry the next time shepard met with her students, the chair of the Department of Communications. Peter Erkhart attended that tutorial and offered shepard students but not shepherd emotional support suggesting that they would be welcome to go to the campus wellness center. He sat at the back of the room for the entire tutorial, effectively shutting down any discussion on the issue and undermining shepherd's role in her classroom.

Speaker 1:          24:27          Erkhart proceeded on behalf of the university to publicly insult shepherd when asked by email, by Maclean's magazine why he appeared in her class on that day. He responded, quote, I assume she recorded it. Why not ask her for the recording and quote. He then sent maclean's a second email. Open quote, sorry. You're a pro. I should have assumed that you've already heard that particular recording and quote. Using his position of power and authority over shepherd to intimidate and embarrass her publicly. Professor Elisia Slowinski, who shepherd was taking a masters course from asked in front of the class for Shepard to put away her laptop and then said in front of other master's students that she gave this instruction because she did not want to be recorded even when shepard assured her that she was not recording the class. Further alienating and creating a toxic environment for shepherd.

Speaker 1:          25:22          Following these events, Ramboo Canis course ended and shepherd was assigned to be the teaching assistant to Professor Judith Nicholson, a professor of communication who had publicly taken a negative position against shepherd prior to shepard being assigned to her. Before that semester even started, Nicholson had signed an open letter supporting Pimlott and Ramboo. Kenna. This made the university assigning shepard to her tutor. Lich entirely inappropriate, created a poisoned environment for shepherd and made it impossible for her to succeed. Shepherds apprehensions about Nicholson's lack of objectivity toward her. We're quickly born out on three occasions during their relatively brief dealings, Nicholson without provocation, harassed and abused shepherd and deliberately create a difficulty for her from the outset of their meeting, Nicholson told shepherd that it was her quote, academic freedom and quote and that no one is permitted to make the university look bad, implying that shepherd had improperly done.

Speaker 1:          26:23          So. On the second occasion, she sent out a course syllabus with a territorial acknowledgement, I. E. A reference to the aboriginal tribe which had once been on the land, which Wilford Lauria was on shepherd. Considering this irrelevant to the syllabus and a ludicrous act of political correctness and virtue signaling. Cut that part of the note and tweeted it, noting that such acknowledgements were now even on the syllabus of university courses, Nicholson demanded in front of the other teaching assistants that she delete her tweet when shepard protested, that all she was tweeting was the university logo with the course name and territorial acknowledgement. Nicholson threatened to take her to the dean if she did not remove it. Nicholson also absurdly claimed that this territorial acknowledgement was her intellectual property. She proceeded to complain to the Dean about Shepherd's tweet in an attempt to further endanger shepherds position in the university.

Speaker 1:          27:17          The Dean informed Nicholson that the acknowledgement was not her intellectual property and called an urgent meeting with the two departments which shepherd was associated with the communication studies and the cultural analysis and social theory departments at least in part to discuss these issues. It was clear that if shepherd had tweeted positively about the land acknowledgement she would not have been in difficulty with Nicholson. The third occasion was in March, 2018 when shepard needed to reschedule her last class of the year and utilize polling software with a link to available alternate days for her class to fill out their available alternate dates. When Shepard found times that all of her students were available to meet, she emailed Nicholson to seek her approval for the new dates. Nicholson reprimanded her copying two deans claiming falsely that shepherd had moved these classes without Nicholson's consent in advance even though the letter was just such a request and the request on its face was premised on Nicholson's consent.

Speaker 1:          28:18          When Shepard advised Nicholson that she never had any intention of changing the date without Nicholson's approval, which was why her letter explicitly requested that approval. Nicholson counseled shepherds tutorial entirely. This was despite the fact that alternate dates were available for Shepard and our students to attend. Nicholson instructed shepard students to attend sessions of the other teaching assistants on dates which were largely coincident with dates which shepard and her students had arranged. Since this was to have been shepherds last class, she never saw her students again. Ethan Jackson, a transgender activist who has attacked shepard throughout the events described herein, launched a formal, patently frivolous harassment complaint against her to which even after Ms. Sheppard had completed her coursework at the university so she would not see Jackson again. The university responded by proceeding with a formal investigation. Despite its inherently vexatious bad faith and frivolous allegations which pursuant to the applicable policies the university should not have proceeded with.

Speaker 1:          29:25          Jackson had an online crowd funding page seeking a sex change operation, which was initially denied because of his mental health issues. Additionally, Jackson was banned from the University of Waterloo campus in 2013 for protesting and d platforming, a member of parliament who was to give a speech on abortion by dressing up as a giant vulva and yelling. Jackson was invariably hostile to shepherd Jackson's allegations against shepherd where that a, she was on her telephone during one class and purportedly disengaged from participation in that class. B, Ms. Sheppard had made four tweets with screenshots from Jackson's controversial social media account. Sea Shepherd responded to Jackson walking into the printing room and angrily ordering her to leave the room and cease using the communications department printer, which she required for communications coursework by referring to him as petty and pathetic. D when Shepard and two others were putting up posters for a lorry, a society for open inquiry meeting.

Speaker 1:          30:32          He claimed that they had followed him and his colleague as they were walking around the halls and that shepherds posters had signage which he found offensive posters, which he acknowledges removing from the walls without authorization. The complaint of Jackson was made maliciously after classes were over for the year at a time when he and shepard would not ever be interacting again. Since shepherd is not enrolled in a courses for the following session, despite Jackson's complaint being inherently self contradictory and ludicrous, the university not only proceeded to summon Shepard for an investigation, but threatened her with repercussions if she disclosed Jackson's complaint to anyone. The attacks on shepherd have rendered her unemployable in academia, resulting in her abandoning her previous ambitions of obtaining her phd or even teaching at a university as a masters graduate. Shepherd has suffered nervous shock as a result of the conduct of the defendants, which was the foreseeable and intended result.

Speaker 1:          31:31          In the alternative, it was the reasonably foreseeable outcome of their conduct and the defendants were negligent in their treatment. Of Her. So that's shepherds claim. As I said, after I reviewed this and talked in detail to shepherds lawyer, I concluded that Wilfred Laurier had not learned what needed to be learned and launched a claim of my own this week. It reads in part the plaintiff that's me, claims against the defendants, Nathan Ramboo, Canna Herbert Pimlott Atria, Joel and Wilfrid laurier university, the following 500,000 for defamation, 500,000 for injurious false hood, 500,000 in punitive damages, prejudgment and post judgement interest in accordance with the courts of Justice Act costs on a substantial indemnity basis and such. Further and other relief as counsel may advise and this honorable court may deem just the plaintiff's claim against Ramboo, Canna Pimlott Joel and the university defamatory statements on Youtube on or about November 2nd, 2017 Rambo Kana his then teaching assistant Lindsay Shepherd to attend what turned out to be a disciplinary meeting with himself, Pimlott and Joel to discuss her having shown an extract from a TV Ontario program to our students.

Speaker 1:          32:51          The TV Ontario program moderated by Steve Pagan consisted of a debate between Peterson and Nicholas. Matt at the meeting on or about November 2nd, 2017 Rambo Kana Pim lot and Joel each made numerous defamatory statements about Peterson, all of which the others endorsed both expressedly and implied. The meetings content has since been posted online on a video sharing website, youtube and is available on the Internet where it is open to the public and easily accessible by anyone who wishes to view its content. I'm skipping a bit here at the meeting on or about November 2nd, 2017 Rambo cannot Pimlott and Joel falsely and maliciously made numerous defamatory statements about Peterson including but not limited to the following defamatory statements made by Ramboo Canna. A Peterson identified student protestors by posting their social media accounts for the purpose of other people bullying and threatening them online. B Peterson is basically debating whether or not a trans student should have rights.

Speaker 1:          33:53          See, Peterson's position would be the equivalent of debating whether or not a student of color should have rights or should be allowed to be married. Contrary to the charter of rights and freedoms. Dee Peterson has engaged in the targeting of trans students, giving out their personal information for the purpose of having them attack, harassed so that death threats will find them. This is something that Peterson has done to his own students, Peterson has done to other students. He playing a speech by Peterson is basically like playing a speech by Hitler. F Peterson's opinion is like alt-right opinions, white supremacist opinions, Anti Trans Opinion, anti gay opinion, anti woman, misogynist opinion. G Peterson's view is whether trans people are people or not. Defamatory statements made by Pimlott Peterson is academically suspect to say the least. He does not have the substantial academic evidence to be a credible person. B, Peterson's positions don't have credible evidence just like Charles Murray with his race claims of white superiority.

Speaker 1:          34:55          See, Peterson brings hatred and targets groups. Dee Peterson Exhibits Charlatan Ism II Peterson has nothing really that is credible in terms of research defamatory statements made by Joel. A Peterson's position is causing harm to trans students by framing their identity as invalid or their pronouns as invalid. Contrary to the Ontario Human Rights Code. B Peterson is spreading transphobia. Now I'm skipping ahead a bit. Again, the said words in their natural and ordinary meaning and the connotation of the comments obvious to any reader were meant and were understood to mean that Peterson is comparable to Adolf Hitler. The greatest bought in world history deliberately spreads hatred both generally and in particular to students is a member of the alt right, is unfit to be a professor. Breaches the code of ethics of his profession and university is a white supremacist, has and expresses opinions, which are uninformed and uneducated, is sexist, is misogynist, is racist, is homophobic, is transphobic, is a deplorable person, is in competent, is a reprobate, lacks integrity, lacks the appropriate ethics to be a psychologist.

Speaker 1:          36:12          And professor is a bully and abusive towards students. Wants to deprive minorities of any rights, organizes attacks, even death threats on students, breaches. Canadian law dehumanizes certain of his students and lacks credibility and credentials. The statements made by Rambo, Kana, Pimlott, and Joel in for all of the above, including, but not limited to, that Peterson has unsavory, sexist, misogynist, dangerous, racist, homophobic, transphobic, analogous to Adolf Hitler and incompetent in his profession as an author, teacher, and professor, and were false and specifically designed to impugn his reputation. These defamatory statements were malicious and designed specifically to damage his personal and professional character. As a professor, author, lecturer, and public intellectual. Well, you get the picture. That's the end of that. I'm hoping that the combination of the two lawsuits will be enough to convince careless university professors and administrators blinded by their own ideology to be much more circumspect in their actions and their words. We'll see how that plays out.
