Speaker 1:          00:00          On Wednesday, the 31st of January at 7:30 PM, I'm going to be speaking about my new book and its genesis at the lovely orpheum theater in Los Angeles, and so I'd like to invite you to attend. I'll talk for about an hour and a half or so perhaps to take questions from the audience and then sign and dedicate books and so if you'd be interested in hearing about 12 rules for life and about how it came about and what it's about and why, then please come to the theater and we'll have a fine time. So looking forward to seeing you there.

Speaker 2:          00:42          12 rules for life, how to live properly in the face of vulnerability, tragedy, and malevolence. One of the propositions in 12 rules for life is that life existence is usefully characterized as an interplant order and chaos or unknown unknown. You're always striving to balance those two. If if, if what you, what you're doing is too familiar your board and if what you're doing is to unfamiliar, then you're anxious and what you want to do is find the harmonious line between those two and that signified by leaning. If you can get those two things right, then you can have your cake and eat it too. I hope people can take away the idea that there is a motive being in the face of the vulnerability and tragedy of life that is noble and powerful and capable of sustaining them through the worst possible times without becoming corrupt and bitter.
