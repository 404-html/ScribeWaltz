Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:00:22       Yeah. Sending this one out to my evolutionary psychology people. Yeah. David bus. Cosmic in Tubey. Yeah. Jeffrey Miller. Yeah. We live in this till the day that we die. Survival or the feet only the strong survive. There's walk and went on outside. No Man is safe. You can run but you can't have ever, you come to my black, you'll see some territoriality. You please wear a kill or be killed is the mentality would get his street. It's just a necessary strategy. You got to play the hand. You're dealt. What can magic? We escaped from the habitat that she was born in three homicides and when neighborhood is cops came and kicked the crooked door with no warning. I started roughing up my young cousins. She's only 17 and counterpoint in the oven plus a concussion, but she ain't done nothing. So keep your mouth shut. Don't jump to judgment on the lads were living.

Speaker 2:          00:01:16       Just close your eyes and listen with that. Pre counsel. Homicide statistics. So if you think the criminal man, it's just bacon, you're mistaken. This is calculated risk taking. We did banana situation with the low life expectancy and a major discrepancy between the haves and the have nots. And You wonder why the padlock on every cashbox smashed off. Come on. You can't call a pathological. Nah, that's a logical, you can try to understand it, but you can't stop a doe. Not Unless you address the root causes is the conscious and unconscious decisions to discount future prospects. C'Mon, it's obvious the beekeeper bouncing homicide rate keeps mounting, which leaves this deep discounting and a lot of violence, but it's not. A virus is a rational response to high risk environments and short time horizons with high stakes and highly visible prizes and you wonder why we're criminal minded.

Speaker 2:          00:02:05       Hey, you can't say we'll get satisfaction and for patient with self control and delete gratification when the only job that pays his casket baking death is the ultimate plan cancellation to check the facts and recent data release. It shows a pattern of increasing competition, a bunch of young guys off struggling status seeking, causing the crabs and make the social fabric weekend and life expectancy also predicts teen pregnancy. The need to leave a legacy genetically will never be completely control contraceptive. The, yeah, the transparent. Imagine if your kids would never meet the grandparents unless they followed the Bristol Pailin Plan for parenthood and then they see these young girls were fall down. Carolyn's do get pregnant before marriage is such a tragedy. Apparently. It's also a reproductive strategy, especially when you could see them adjusting activity when their circumstances change. In both the cases of the young ladies with babies in the mail risk takers, you see people that depth into their situation and it's the same in different places and with different reasons.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       This is not about ethical justification. It's evolutionary psych in, it's just the basics. I'm still, people call this behavior maladaptive because of our reaction when violence happens, but if we really want to change the outcome, then maybe we should just start questioning how it's it. And the bottom line is that a nick woody and life expectancy or the ultimate causes of crime and the results of crime, to me that's true that you could bind together in a feedback loop, but it got some moves to make now. So I'll be back soon. Just don't ask me what I'm about to do, right. Because I can't see, so what's left the on tour effect, but you're my death and my goal is to stay alive. Survival of the fee. Only the strong survive. That's right. We live in this till the day that we die. It's the Bible.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       Only the strong survive been this till the tea that we die survivals are the fee only the strong survive. That's right. We live in this till the tape that we die. It's the Bible of the fee. Only the strong survive this till the day that we die. Survival of the fee. Only the strong survive. That's right. We live in this till the tea that we dad survival over the fit. Only the strong. Only the strong. Strong, strong. Yeah. Sending this out on the evolutionary psychologists, Daly and Wilson. Steven pinker. Robert Reich. Yeah. David Sloan. Wilson. Yeah, that's right. Gathered the evidence. Make it real. Make it real human mentality and you represent, yes. Human Nature. Human Nature to the core mine and you get Joe's don't question my actions unless you're ready to make a little addition and before I make a subtraction up and traction. That's right. Love scrapping

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       please.

Speaker 3:          00:05:19       I'm here talking today with Dr. Martin Daly. Doctor daily is a professor of psychology at mcmaster university in Hamilton, Ontario and author of many influential papers on evolutionary psychology. His current research topics include an evolutionary perspective on risk taking and interpersonal violence, especially male male conflict

Speaker 3:          00:05:41       and fast. He and his wife that late Margo Wilson where the former editors in chief of the journal evolution and human behavior and former presidents of the human behavior and evolution society. He was named a fellow of the Royal Society Canada in 1998 daily is one of the main researchers of the Cinderella effect and has been interviewed many times in the press about it. So I'm very pleased to be talking with doctor daily this morning. It seems to me that he's one of Canada's most outstanding psychologists and perhaps you could say that about psychologists in the world. And he's done some incredibly interesting research on the relationship between inequality and male violence and inequality and other topics too. So welcome Dr Daily. Thank you Jordan. It's nice to be talking to you. Well, I'm looking forward to our conversation a lot. So you just wrote a book, which I'm going to show people called killing the competition and uh, I just read it. It was very interesting. So I thought maybe I could get you to start by talking a little bit about the book and, and also how you tell us, tell us the story that would be the, the good, a good thing to do.

Speaker 4:          00:06:57       Well, the general issue that is addressed in the book is the relationship between economic and inequality, which is usually indexed as income inequality and homicide rates. And it's been known for a long time by sociologists that income inequality is the single best predictor they've got of homicide rates across countries, across states, within the u s across cities within the u s and some other kinds of jurisdictional comparisons and there has been controversy about why that is and whether any quality itself is truly the problem or whether it's just a correlate of something else. And in this book I tried to make the case that no inequality really is the problem and some of the arguments that have been events for suggesting that Amir correlate of violence rather than in some way causal to violence are wrong. Can you tell us a little bit about how you calculate inequality and what the measure is?

Speaker 4:          00:07:57       Yeah, income inequality. There's a number of different measures that are used by economists and I'm just borrowing the dominant ones from economists. The number one one is something called the Gini Index Gin. I, I used to assume that that was some kind of a acronym, but actually it was the name of an Italian economist and it's a measured that is rages from zero to one. It would be zero if everybody had exactly the same income or exactly the same wealth if you're doing wealth inequality and it would approach one as income or wealth was concentrated more and more in the hands of few and then a single individual and in principle would go to one in the extreme if all wealth were held by Bill Gates and done in the rest of us had anything.

Speaker 3:          00:08:46       Now you analyze the, the judy coefficient to have different levels of of jurisdiction. Hey, so I noticed in your work that you've looked at countries and states within countries and I think that's particularly true in the u s so tell us a little bit about what you found.

Speaker 4:          00:09:04       Yeah. Well with within the U S and again this has been done by sociologists for some time within the u s and cross nationally. Um, the Gini Coefficient is a very good predictor of homicide. The correlation tends to be on the order of 0.7 in many studies, which means that the variants in either measure 50% of it could be a count of four by no variability. And the other measure when I'm saying between homicide and income and equality, and actually it even works on a neighborhood level. My late wife Margaux and I publish some analyses in Chicago that showed they didn't cut any quality, wasn't very strong predictor of homicide rates across neighborhoods within Chicago. Tell us a little bit about

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       you did in Chicago cause that that research is extremely interesting and also when you did it.

Speaker 4:          00:09:52       Um, let's see. We did our work in Chicago in the early nineties and at that time Chicago had a very high homicide rate, not the worst in the United States, but one of the worst in the United States and in fact have more homicides every year. And then the whole of Canada, which makes it a substantial enough phenomenon that you can sort of look for causal factors or correlates without a lot of stochastic noise. Um, it, Chicago, Chicago is divided up into some 77 I believe, neighborhoods by, there's a longstanding tradition of urban sociology in Chicago and there's these sort of well recognized 77 neighborhoods in any way for these neighborhoods. We were able to amass a variety of neighborhoods, specific information including an income distributions on homicides and so forth. Uh, working with the Chicago police who were collaborators in some of this work and Margo, um, went to the Illinois Department of Health to try and get information on other death rates and birth rates and demographic structure of each of the neighborhoods.

Speaker 4:          00:11:03       And she wanted to compute the life expectancy because the idea that she had was the local life expectancy. Would he affect the extent to which people were willing to sort of escalate dangerously in competitive situations in competitive. And that was our construal of what most homicides in Chicago. We're about where guys killing each other when dissed embars, um, circumstances in which there is some sort of competition and it gets dangerous and are our basic idea. They are. And elsewhere has been that a lot of the variability in homicide rates, the most violent, volatile component of homicide rates has to do with this male male competition. And where, where I'm, when does it get dangerous and where or when does it sort of dampen down. And for Chicago Anyway, the Illinois Department of Health had never, nobody had ever computed neighborhoods specific life expectancy, but the data were available to do it, age specific [inaudible] and sell.

Speaker 4:          00:12:03       I was available to do it. And so we computed a significant life expectancies, income equality and many other variables that uh, criminologists have considered relevant in past studies, racial heterogeneity and blah, blah, blah and tried to see what were your best predictor. So homicide and in that particular study, everywhere else we've worked, we've mostly found incoming equality would be number one in that particular study, incoming equality was a very good predictor, but the best predictor was male life expectancy at age, at birth or an age 15. And in order to compute, like of course you say homicide rates, homicide reduces male life expectancy. So you have to remove homicides statistically as a cause of death and say life expectancy net of the impact of homicide, that was our best predictor of homicide rates. And life expectancy is very variable in the city of Chicago. And I assume that other US cities, I mean the worst neighborhoods, male life expectancy at birth was down in the 50s as bad as in the worst countries in the world, in the best neighborhoods, male life expectancy was up in the I think was over 80 or in the high seventies in any case, um, corresponding to what you might expect in Scandinavia are the places but the best life expectancy in the world.

Speaker 4:          00:13:21       So it was a huge range. That was our best predictor than if you try and do a multivariate analysis where you look for, well, what else predicts some the residual variability and there wasn't much research tool variability. The second best indeed, the only secondary predictor that seemed to be statistically significant was income inequality across the neighborhoods. That was, that was the thrust of our, our study in Chicago. And I got lots to see more work on life expectancy as a predictor of violence, um, of a university. Take them all right. Y'All crib it all. And just mark, we've tried to do the same thing in Montreal, but he felt that a Montreal, the difference in life expectancy for men between the worst and the best neighborhoods was only six years, whereas Chicago, it was 24 years, I think. So what do you, what do you think accounted for the vast difference in life expectancy between Chicago and Montreal?

Speaker 4:          00:14:11       Was life expectancy itself associated with income inequality? Well, yes. I mean that's part of the problem of course in all this kind of research here, it's not experimental research. You don't control independent variables and everything of potential interest is correlated with everything else. So, you know, income inequality alone accounts for more than half the variance in homicide rates across Chicago neighborhoods. So does life expectancy alone. Um, so does percent below the poverty line alone. Um, you know, like these things are all correlated with each other. And so try to tease apart what's most important is tricky. So the low life expectancy, Chicago neighborhoods is not due to violence. A student, it's, it's too overwhelming lead to differential disease. Um, in Chicago, you know, privatization of medicine in the U s was so extremely tight. We were doing this research. Emergency rooms in the worst neighborhoods in Chicago had closed down because they got bankrupt.

Speaker 4:          00:15:11       Um, they didn't have enough money to remain open and therefore if you got stabbed or shot in a bad neighborhood in Chicago, you had to be transported somewhere else to try and keep you alive because there was, you know, the hospitals and shut their emergency rooms or had shut down completely. So there's all sorts of factors that contribute to a, to differential death rates. But you know, kids in the worst neighborhood are exposed to high levels of wed. There's some evidence that lead exposure and childhoods is a big predictor of variability of life expectancy. Um, all kinds of internal diseases. They were more susceptible to the effects of bad nutrition. They were more susceptible to. So if you divide causes of death and just so called external causes, which basically means homicides, suicides and accidents and internal causes, which is more or less synonymous with what we ordinarily think of as disease internal causes, we're still the biggest source of differential mortality across neighborhoods.

Speaker 5:          00:16:12       So you could make by the sounds of it, you could make a reasonable case that the same social safety net in Canada is flattening out the bottom of the, of the income distribution, especially the provision of healthcare. And you know, I also was informed a while back, uh, that the rate of entrepreneurship in Canada is actually higher than in than in the u s and part of the reason for that is that because healthcare is provided, people can take a risk of walking away from their jobs without putting their family completely at risk. And so one of the perverse effects of socialized medicine is that it elevates the rates of entrepreneurship. So I also wanted to mention, you know, your, your work was absolutely striking to me because of the effect sizes. Now for people who don't know about, uh, how to compare effects sizes, I should point out that you never see a correlation of 0.7 between any two variables in the social sciences. So there's a guy named Hamp Hale who did an empirical analysis of effect size comparisons, uh, about four or five years ago. Might be longer than that now. And he concluded that 95% of social science studies had a effect size of 0.5 or less. And so to see a correlation of 0.7 is absolutely overwhelming when you also take into account that measurement error is decreasing the potency of the relationship to some degree. So that's,

Speaker 4:          00:17:33       and when you take into account that, uh, that those, that 0.5 represents studies that were published because they got something.

Speaker 5:          00:17:41       Yes, exactly. Exactly. So, so 0.7 it's absolutely overwhelming. I've never seen effect sizes that big between two variables of interest in any other domain that I can recall. And then the other thing that's worth pointing out, and we can talk about this a little bit too, is the other thing that's so radical about your research is that it, and, and this, this what emerges out of the, out of the manner in which the Gini Coefficient is, is calculated because it's only a measure of relative poverty. Um, and it's the predictor. You, you also generate it data indicating that places where everyone was relatively poor or say relatively working class like North Dakota and some of the Canadian provinces had very low homicide rates and also places where everyone was rich. Right? So to rate reiterate, what you're seeing is that what's driving male homicide is the existence. And for, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, the existence of a steep economic dominance hierarchy that makes it difficult for the young men to obtain status through what you might describe as conventional and socially productive means. And so instead they turned to violence as a means of establishing status. And most of that's within race and between young men jockeying for position. Is that all correct?

Speaker 4:          00:18:59       Yeah, I, I think that's a pretty fair characterization. Um, uh, it's, it's worth stressing. Yes. That income inequality is in principle and in practice dissociable from just averaging cub or 4% below the poverty line or other measures of cell called absolute a deprivation, they're often correlated, you know, income inequality across a certain set of jurisdictions, maybe fairly strongly correlated with, um, the percent below the poverty line. For example. It'd be surprising if it was not, you should correlated, but, uh, but they're not necessarily as you said.

Speaker 5:          00:19:34       Yeah. So you demonstrate it or you were one of the first people to demonstrate where you, the first, in fact maybe that it wasn't poverty that was causing this kind of crime. It was relative poverty and that that changes the interpretation of the situation. Absolutely. Dramatically. So tell us a little bit about why you think that males are competing in this deadly manner. What's driving that behavior?

Speaker 4:          00:19:57       Well, it's very interesting, I think. I think men are sensitive to or interested in relative position status of maintaining face in competitive billions. And in a sense, all videos are a bit competitive. Um, and the willingness to use bio, it's partly s can be thought of as kind of a disdain for the future or I walked by now, um, I'm willing to do something that threatens by wife, like escalate and competition are not backed out or not walk away from an insult because I'm thinking very short term the rewards for, for being passive. You know, if you're, if you're a nice of Prosperous University, student of age 20, you have good life prospects, your chances for eventually becoming a well paid, uh, maybe people will laugh at this are still reasonably good. Your chances for eventually burying are still reasonably good if you're the same age guide to guy, um, in, uh, urban ghetto with a 48% of the appointment, right?

Speaker 4:          00:21:11       Or something like that, that you have very much more Ed ed with uncertainty about the stability of whatever income you do get with, with, um, the future of node, then you're more willing to take a risk now in the pursuit of status now and the produce suit of sexual opportunity now in the pursuit of monetary rewards, illegal or illicit now. And also the maintenance of face, like social reputation is the one resource you've got. If you've got other resources you could walk away from threats or or disrespect, um, add and reap your rewards later. If social status is all you've got, then it becomes an important thing to defend.

Speaker 5:          00:22:00       So I read some research a while back. It looked at the relationship between socioeconomic status among men and number of sexual partners and also socioeconomic status among women, a number of sexual partners. And that's another domain where you see these kinds of whopping correlations. So the correlation between socioeconomic status for men and number of available sexual partners is about 0.6 or 0.7. Whereas for women it's negative 0.12 and so do you think, so do you think that it's reasonable to assume that either at the phylogenetic level level or the on a genetic level leave either evolutionarily speaking or even as a consequence of rational calculation that part of the reason that men are perhaps the main reason that men are engaging in these status competitions is because of female hyper gummy? Is that a reasonable, is that a reasonable hypothesis?

Speaker 4:          00:22:53       Hypercarbia and as you say, set up simple access. I mean there, there is there, the association that you mentioned is presumably a very longstanding one. That is to say that bed ups with status et resources have had access to partners for sure. And probably multiple partners simultaneously or serially. Um, to a degree that bed of lower status have dot. There's high variates it eventual reproduction among males in mammals generally. And although the situation is less extreme and people that have been the other battles, the same is true for people. I mean what you say, they have high variates compared to what? Well, high variates compared to women for example, of the variability and eventual reproductive success as well. Where for women than for men or husband. Now you say sexual to it, but I think that's exactly the right level to be working out got in contemporary societies. But the reason why that matters is because ancestrally that translated into differential reproduction in a moderate environment of which you don't cut. Perceptive technology is available, especially to women than, uh, that that correlation may be broken down. But the motives to seek sexual opportunity, um, remain relevant.

Speaker 5:          00:24:14       So one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about too, is to, like you, you, you made a comment in your book about Adrian Rates and Adrian rains has written a book recently about the biological predictors of criminality. And you make a strong case that in some sense the, the, the turning to violence that's characteristic of men in uncertain situations is rational because it drives, it actually legitimately drive status increase and that produces a variety of positive effects. So in some sense it's a rational response to a radically uncertain environment where competition is high. Now reigns would say no biological type researchers they look at, they look more at the individual level and conclude that it's individuals who have various forms of prefrontal damage or, or characterological issues associated with antisocial personality disorder that are more likely to engage in violent acts.

Speaker 5:          00:25:11       And you can track that. I mean, Rashard Trombley has done some of this work in Quebec. You can track the emergence of aggression at an individual level all the way back to children at two years of age because it turns out that children who are two are the most violent children, particularly the boys, but mostly a subset of boys who who can't fight, hit and bite and steel at two, most of whom are socialized by the age of four, but a subset of whom are not socialized and then they become, they're more likely to become the lifetime offenders. And, and so what I'm wondering is maybe you can reconcile the difference between the two research streams like this. Imagine that as the economic gradient increases and the dominance hierarchy becomes steeper and steeper, the men who are prone to be violent, I'm like, it's the disagreeable men that start to be violet first, maybe ones that have an impulse control problem or that are character a logically like, like the violent two year olds that are character logically predisposed to be violent. It seems to me that those would be the ones that, you know, as the pressure increases, those men who are more prone to violence for other reasons are going to be the people who react with violence first. You think that's a reasonable hypothesis?

Speaker 4:          00:26:28       Yeah, I think that's a very reasonable hypothesis. I mean, my objection to atria raids book was that I think he vast, you know, he's, there's definitely evidence that betty kinds of, uh, violet criminal offenders have got something wrong with their braids. Eight Rehab Ray bloods to extrapolate to the conclusion that violent criminals I did. Deep criminals in general have got something broken about their braids and it's like criminality is pathological. Well, criminality is not pathological. People steal for cost benefit related reasons. Um, the crime is a, if you like God help us social construction in the sense that, um, certain behaviors are criminalized by a larger social group. It ordered to the turn up because self interested individuals but otherwise pursued them. You know, how do you make people stop exploiting others, stealing from others by criminalizing those activities and imposing penalties. And you know there's a rational choice of stream of theorizing within criminology that that other people like Adrian Ray just dismiss out of head. No, no. Criminal offenses are pathological. Yeah and I think that's silly. Well it seems unnecessary

Speaker 5:          00:27:51       because it is also difficult to make a marriage between the two issues. Like one of the best predictors, you know I do research on individual differences in personality and the best personality predictor of incarceration is low agreeableness. That's one of the dimensions on which men and women differ the most. And so as you become more disagreeable, you become more self oriented I would say. And that can push past the point where you're so self interested that you're willing to prey on others. And so those are the guys that as well as the guys who lack impulse control, those are the guys, the first guys to turn to violence, let's say when the socioeconomic conditions become sufficiently unstable so that a conscientious approach is not tenable.

Speaker 4:          00:28:35       Yeah, that's at the marriage between that kind of thing. Keg Ed ed thinking about irrelevant so that any quality is that there's guys at the top who are white, the violet people you described, there's people doing very well who are very happy to explain to others, but the costs of individual bio it action are high enough and the opportunities to exploit other people through sight. And she'll be just through your lawyers, um, through whatever tactics are available to, you know, well he'll bullies are, are safe enough that they opt to behave with those directions,

Speaker 5:          00:29:13       right? Because they've gone to their longterm future is relatively stable. And so that longterm planning and regulation of behavior actually play an important economic role.

Speaker 4:          00:29:24       Add, add, you know, and then in the case of somebody like Donald Trump, I mean, he looks like somebody who's suffering a little bit of an impulse control problem, especially sort of during the night when he wakes up and does his twitter account is too close at head. But he's, he's rich enough to bully people at other ways that actually heads on violence. Although come to think of it, uh, the famous remark that he made during the campaign about women suggests perhaps that, you know, it depends on your definition of heads on violence, I guess that qualifies.

Speaker 5:          00:29:58       Okay. So, um, there's a very large body of research that indicates that alcohol is a major contributor to criminality too, especially with regards to men. Um, and so both 50% of people who were murdered have a decent blood alcohol level and about 50% of murders. And I think that's partly that stat is equal equalizes, I think because much violence among men is exactly the sort that you described where it's a status dispute and it's more or less a toss up who's going to come out as a winner. But then I guess what's happening with alcohol perhaps is that because it's a disinhibitor because it reduces anxiety and anxiety is one of the suppressors of aggressive behavior that men who are already on the edge, let's say, because of the unstable environment and the steep dominance arc, you're also more likely lose control when they're drinking.

Speaker 5:          00:30:46       And maybe that's also fuel. This is something to that I'm curious about. I mean, you can think about it as a rational calculation, but, but I'm also curious about the degree to which it's fueled by emergent negative emotions. So it's easy for people who are in a steep dominance hierarchies to regard this system as unfair and to become resentful and angry about it as perhaps they should be. I'm not suggesting that that's necessarily an irrational response, but it seems that if the anger is simmering underneath the surface, that it's waiting in some sense for an opportunity to break free and alcohol in a bar or at home perhaps provides that, that that route.

Speaker 4:          00:31:30       What you say makes evidence says to be, I made a boat, it's probably worth injecting a bit of a caution about the word rationality generally well, but talks about, um, rationality and cry, but perhaps especially a confrontational violence. The point is not that the person has making good and carefully weigh decisions. I mean, I think, you know, emotions are the handmaid of what I would call ecological rationality. They, they help you know how you should feel about certain things and how you should react to them. And the rationality clay as more on clay above this person gets riled up, resents x ad there. Eddie should it. There's good reason to get routed up at breeze at x. But the fact that alcohol, perhaps this inhibits so that you know, the, the truly rational ballots between inhibitory and aggressive emotions is altered. The idea that ration that alcohol interferes with, with cognitive process, which is the point that people are start making stupid decisions when they're drunk, uh, decide to get behind the wheel or whatever. I think this plays very heavily yet to the reason why. So Betty Hobbyist sides tend to happen in contexts like two drunks is assaulting each other and stuff or you know, people who are somewhat under the influence of alcohol and insulting each other rather than uh, you know, with you, if you have more, if you have more bed til wherewithal at the moment, you probably have better capacities to confuse date to diffuse dangerous situations through, um, you know, ways that don't tail losing face by, by being articulate.

Speaker 5:          00:33:17       Great. Exactly. That's right. You have other tools at your disposal rather than immediate recourse to your fists. Thank you. Yes. So if I remember correctly, two and your Chicago Studies, this is one of the things that I found particularly fascinating was you tracked the consequences of killing someone in Chicago and the consequences were something of the following sort. Well, first of all, you are likely to be charged with something like second degree murder. It would be difficult for the police to find people to testify against you. And if they did, generally what they would say is that it was a two way altercation. And so in many cases you could plead self defense. Often it didn't go before a jury because the perpetrator plea bargain to down to manslaughter. The sentence was something on the, on the order of a couple of years and people were generally out of prison in 18 months with a substantial boost in their social capital because now they were like dangerous sons of bitches not to be messed with. And that was quite clear and also perhaps also improved so to speak by their soldier and in prison is that is if I got that right,

Speaker 4:          00:34:26       except for what detail? Well, actually it, our Chicago studies, we didn't have as good followup information is what you're talking about. This, this was a early, a piece of research in the city of Detroit that uh, that led to most of those findings. But uh, but yeah, exactly. Um, hardly, it's interesting. We had a, we had a single year sample of cases of Detroit and there were I think 590 homicide to Detroit that one year night, he'd 72 at which time Detroit did have the highest homicide rate. The U s s a large majority of these are bail bail dispute. So some sort of status disputes usually, but sometimes robberies and just as you said, um, witnesses are unlikely to come forward and have the prosecutors are stretched. They don't have, they don't have the resources that they would need to pursue every case. And so they, many cases were dismissed.

Speaker 4:          00:35:24       I'd be not even prosecuted, never buy play bark and something like approximately half of all male male macho dispute homicides in Detroit that were solved. We're not prosecuted. And the expectation that there was a self defense argument that bites, you know, with, with the jury that of the half that were prosecuted, almost all of them, yeah, we're plea bargained down to bad slaughter and the majority of them got a conviction, right. It's three years, 50% of the time off for good behavior. If you've behaved nicely, you go to Jackson State Prison in Michigan, uh, 18 months later you're back out on the streets of Detroit. And Margo in particular was very addressed. The question of whether killing in these contexts might either to actually ultimately pay off. For guys, I tend to, the view that actually killing is that, oh, he's overstepping the bounds of utility, um, that, that, that deadly threats are very selfish, rested and ineffectual, but up again. But that actually following through onto this may be the, you know, the, that nod functional tip of the iceberg, but I honestly don't know that that's true of these kinds of cases for them, for exactly this reason that, um, guys get some social capital out of having done it. Well, hypothetically,

Speaker 5:          00:36:39       will your mom, the Unimog ammo there, the tribe tribes in, in South America and South America, I believe are central, I think it's south. South America. Yeah. The more war, like men have a much higher rep production rate, the ones who've killed more. Now, I don't know, obviously it isn't necessarily the case that that's directly translatable, but there is some utility in being a successful warrior. It's, that's actually one of the reasons that I think that capitalism, so to speak, is underappreciated because in a very, I'm speaking in a very specific sense is that there are disagreeable and wore like men and some of them are very powerful in many ways, not only physically but intellectually in character logically and and with with great ambition. And the thing about capitalism is that it enables them to wage war in a manner that's, that's not deadly and to become successful that way and and to channel they're there, they're in intense competitive energy into something that, well I think often is often for a social good. Now it depends on how disagreeable the person is and how selfish they are of course. But people like that also tend to get punished in their, in their cooperative interactions with other people.

Speaker 4:          00:37:55       Yeah. I mean I partly agree, but I also feel that they offered toward the social good is a bit hopeful. I bead up to the degree that people are successful at a fairly unrestrained capitalist of competition. It's usually at the expense of large numbers of people at the bottom. But it depends how unrestrained that capitalist competition is. I was thinking of social good as in better than war. Yeah. Well better than war for sure. For sure. And sometimes, and sometimes the way you succeed is by producing goods that actually make people's lives better. Have no quarrel with that. So now I also

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       wanted to ask you in the last couple of chapters of your book, you turned to what I would regard as more political issues. And so I, I w and I am, I'm very interested in inequality because [inaudible] recapitulate for a minute. So your work and the work of other people seems to indicate that as inequality increases and dominance, hierarchies get steeper. Not only do young men get more violent and so society becomes less stable, but there's also detrimental impacts on things like population health and, and, and, and, and that was, that was documented quite nicely in the spirit level. And so I'm going to, uh, address a couple of criticisms of the research and, and then I want to ask you, I want to have a discussion about your, you're more prescriptive views, if that's okay. So, so the first issue, someone just emailed me this a while back and when I was talking about inequality and they said, well, what about places like China where the rates of inequality are starting to skyrocket quite substantially and have been for, you know, several years, maybe it'd be several decades, yet the, the homicide rate doesn't seem to be budging much.

Speaker 5:          00:39:43       And so I thought, well that was interesting. Maybe there's something different about East Asian communities, so they tend to have very low crime rates to begin with. Uh, like places like Japan for example, have very low crime rates. And so I'm wondering if what you think about that, is that a reasonable criticism and how would you address it?

Speaker 4:          00:40:02       Fair enough. Well, I don't, I don't think we could characterize, you know, orientals as less violent than box. It had holes or anything like that. I think history tells us otherwise that, uh, there's been a lot of severe and dangerous violence in Japan, in history, and did China in history. I don't know how good data we have on Chinese homicide rates, but what I've seen is that they have been going up a bit lately, but still the point that inequality has been skyrocketing going to be partly there's an interesting question about time lags effect. Some people, you know, how, how sued is an increased inequality effect going to play out as nasty interpersonal behavior. Um, and you know, people respond to inequality as a result of their lifetime experiences. You know, you were talking about young kids, I'll read very young children already being predictable and the extent to which they're willing to, you know, use violet tactics against other people and that, you know, Asig three and four year olds could give you some surprisingly good prediction of how they'll behave as adults.

Speaker 4:          00:41:13       It's not inconceivable that the effects of inequality even are influencing people's development prenatally. And so, you know, the uterus, right? Environments that they experience as a function of, of inequitable environments and the stresses of fraught social comparisons and so on that happened. And those environments could be influencing at all life stages. So I don't think we have any strong basis for expecting rapid changing inequality to be a company to the short term by rapid change of violence. Of that said there, you know, it's certainly the case that there's other things that matter and government controls are wad. I think, I think strong governments that monopolize the legitimate use of violence can keep a lit of violence for a long time. Um, I, you know, I, I would question whether they can keep it played on it indefinitely, but they could keep a lid on it for a long time if you, if you execute all charged birders. Um, I presumed that that would keep the incidents and birder doubt and not only because those people could be recidivists.

Speaker 5:          00:42:27       Great. So, so there's an element of potentially of authoritarian control. Yeah. And then the other gentleman did, I think is, is particularly interesting is the time lag argument. I mean, you don't know over what period of time precisely inequality has it's pernicious effects and maybe it's not even the span of one lifetime. It, I do. Do you have any data on that that that would help help answer the question?

Speaker 4:          00:42:53       Well, I did. I did make reference in my book killing the competition to one sociological study that was looking at effects of inequality. Ud mortality generally at the notion that inequality affects mortality generally is mediated by what you were talking about, about health effects. The idea that, uh, you know, stresses of social comparisons produce greater vulnerability to stress related diseases and Admin, fap, many diseases, most diseases maybe even are stress related in their ultimate impacts on people. Um, so there's this one sociological study by a guy named Shag at Ohio state, which sought effects of economic inequality of mortality in general, and came to the conclusion that there the, the effects were lag, that the maximum impact on current mortality was any quality seven years ago, which sounds kind of funny, but he had analyses, which seemed to show, and I'm a bit wary about the legitimacy of these analyses, but they seem to me to show and they seem to show to him that it equality of a few years ago affects the chats that you'll die now.

Speaker 4:          00:44:06       Um, net of the effects of, you know, age and sex and other predictors of mortality and that there's sort of the Qbo and have consequences of betty years of Mrj, of, of past inequality. So seven years ago was the worst, but six and eight also battered additively five years ago and died years ago also mattered additively 10 years ago also mattered. So that how bad inequality was in your past seems to affect your likelihood of dying. Now the effects of violence have a, have a look dead. It's hard to figure out how you could get a decent enough data set to do that, right? But I don't think it's impossible

Speaker 5:          00:44:49       health effects. So I'm going to lay out an account of the men. You can tell me what you think about this. And all right, so you're, you're, you're, you're, you're brain is always trying to calculate to some degree how good things are going for you. And that's an extraordinarily difficult calculation because life is uncertain and ultimately uncertain and it's difficult to predict the future except perhaps by using the past as a marker. And so what seems to happen is that our nervous and our nervous systems are always interested in how prepared we should be for emergency at any given moment. And as far as I can tell there, there are a number of ways that we calibrate that. One is baseline levels of trait neuroticism, so that sensitivity to anxiety and uncertainty and emotional pain. And so you seem to be born roughly speaking at a, at, at an at your average level of neuroticism, which can vary substantially between people.

Speaker 5:          00:45:46       It can be also adjusted at puberty and then the environment can move you in one direction or another. So for example, if you have a highly anxious child and you encourage them to go out and explore, then you can move them towards the normal range of Jerry Kagan has demonstrated that quite nicely. Okay. So the first, the first estimate of how worried you should be about the future is like genetic roll of the dice. Some people will be born extraordinarily worried, roughly speaking, and some people would be born hardly worried at all. And then that can be modified by the, by the particulars of the social environment. Right. So then the next thing it seems to me to be part of the calculation is comparison. How well are you doing compared to others? That seems to be adjusted by mechanisms that associate perceived social status with Serotonin, serotonergic activity such that as you move up a dominance hierarchy, you're, your serotonin levels rise so that your impulsivity, which would be partly sensitive sensitivity to immediate reward declines.

Speaker 5:          00:46:51       And so does your sensitivity to negative emotion. Whereas if you plummet down to the bottom of a hierarchy, you start to become more reward seeking and also more anxious. And the reason for that more anxious and is because the bottom of the dominance hierarchy actually is a more dangerous place to be because you don't have access to, don't have reliable access as reliable to shelter or food or mating resources or healthcare. When you even see this in birds, you know, so if, uh, a flu sweeps through an avian population, it's the bedraggled birds at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy to die first. And so then one more thing and then, then I tell me what you think about this is that you have anything that seems to happen is that as you plummet down the dominance hierarchy and your mind settles into a more depressed and anxious state, the levels of cortisol that you produce chronically rise and cortisol is a good hormone for activating you but in but in, but in high doses, high continual doses, it starts to produce brain damage, particularly in the hippocampus and it also suppresses immunological function which makes you more susceptible to infectious diseases.

Speaker 5:          00:48:04       So that seems to be approximately the process and so it's no wonder that people are trying to flee away from the bottom up, the dominance hierarchy. Does that seem reasonable?

Speaker 4:          00:48:13       Yes. Give me a, give me a moment. I've got a cough, a blow by note. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:48:25       Hay fever season in southern Ontario. Okay. Yeah. I wish I were a better behavioral endocrinologist and a do a bit more with more expert in some of the processes that you're talking about, but a lot of that makes sense to be the fraught social comparisons. I mean, the evidence certainly is that it's more stressful to be low. Right? Can you bet a high rank Kagan, we've had a little myth that all hot, big, a very high rank puts all this burden of decision making. He got you and that's terribly stressful. It makes you vulnerable to heart attack and Blah Blah Blah. And the day to say the opposite, the data say that's not true. The more power and status if you like decision making authority, you have the less vulnerable, you seem to be distressed related diseases. So you know, a lot of what you're saying makes, makes evident sense to me.

Speaker 4:          00:49:19       Then the developmental story that you're telling. I mean I, I, I think it's right that people, I don't, I don't know how important the uh, throw up the genetic diocese. I think it's an extremely interesting puzzle, evolutionarily. Why there's is much heritable genetic variability in CBE. Equally important domains as there is, and I'm not convinced anybody has, you know, real really understands what bond you weights, how much variability there is. But any case, um, that things are adjustable, it responds to what you encounter. And and a response to social status, perceived social status of responses, social comparisons makes evident sense to me and again I, I don't know enough about the putative damaging affects of excessively prolonged exposure to say high cortisol levels to be sure whether there isn't still sub adaptation sub actual functionality to the response to long term exposure lurking beneath the sea. Big breakdown in the system because it just seems to me that sort of a Darwinian, not evolutionary. Um, social scientists said psychiatrists and psychologists have been too quick too a soup pathology when they see states of affairs that do a deed have damaging consequences, but they had subbed nevertheless have some utility. I, I wish I do a little more about,

Speaker 5:          00:50:56       I think both the low serotonin and the high cortisol levels are interesting in that regard because what does happen is the combination of those two things makes you a more impulsive and be more prepared for emergency action. Both of those things are very useful in an uncertain environment. Detrimental. The detrimental consequences seem to occur as a consequence of prolonged overload. Is that because your body is utilizing, imagine what your body is doing is utilizing more units of resource per moment of time because of the necessity for preparation for unexpected events. And that can become physiologically exhausting in the long run. So I think it, it does, it, it, it seems to me that those biochemical effects do underlie the sort of adaptive responses that you described except that you know, too much is too much and if it's hard to live at the bottom, what that means is you age faster and you don't live as long and you also have higher susceptibility to disease. And maybe in some sense that's the price you pay for the adaptive impulsivity that's also necessary to give you a chance to shoot back up the hierarchy if that's the sort of thing that you're looking for.

Speaker 4:          00:52:09       Yeah, no, and I, I can't help thinking about sort of the evolutionary theories of, uh, of Senescence and bodily repair that, uh, or pioneer by Sir Peter Medawar back in the 50s and develop more by George Williams. The idea that, um,

Speaker 4:          00:52:30       betty, betty things involve some sort of trade off between expenditure for expenditure of energy, of accumulative resources, of capacity in the pursuit of something now at the expense of reduced capacity to be successful later. Um, and so you know, what breeze of why these chronic states may have logged herb. I'm a damaging effects is because selection against big of these chronic states has not been strong because those who are in them for a long time didn't historically tend to live very long anyway. And they're, they're being, if you like, motivated or prepared to engage at a high risk activities that at least have subjects of short term payoff, which is more or less what you said actually.

Speaker 5:          00:53:21       Well, and you know, you talked about miss, let's call it a misbegotten, that there's stress at the top of the dominance hierarchy, just like there is stress at the bottom and the stress at the top is responsibility and decision making and all of that. And you know, I, I do believe that there's truth in that, but there's an important, another important biological element that needs to be considered. And so there's, uh, there's plenty of work done in the domains of clinical psychology and some of this is psychophysiological and neuro physiological for that matter, showing that a stress of an equivalent magnitude as fewer negative effects if it's taken on voluntarily. So because what happens, what happens is that if you voluntarily engage in a stressful activity, your approach systems are activated rather than your defense systems. And the approach systems are associated with positive emotion and with, and with much.

Speaker 5:          00:54:17       And where is the negative emotions are associated with this defensive posturing that includes preparation for emergency and that's much more physiologically damaging. And so whether something, whether you pick up a load voluntarily or have it thrust upon you, seems to make a big difference to how heavy it is. And that's, that's very, it's a very interesting piece of a set of research studies as far as I'm concerned. It's quite fascinating that that can be the case. Yeah. Okay. So let me ask you another question. Let's get down to, we might say brass tacks here so we can make a case that inequality destabilize the societies and, and, and cranks up the male on male homicide rate and the destabilization of curves because young men become more and more unpredictable and violent. And so you could make a conservative case as well as the liberal case for not having a society that takes inequality to an extreme because conservatives, at least in principle, should be concerned with the maintenance of social stability over the long run.

Speaker 5:          00:55:20       So, but, but, okay. And so then you might make a case for income redistribution, but that gets very, very troublesome because it's not that easy to redistribute income. And that's what I want to talk to you about. So, you know, we're in a situation of course, where the top 1% of the population, uh, controls a substantial proportion of the economic resources and the top 1% of that top 1% controls the bulk of that. Now I've looked into that quite deeply and that that distribution is, it's not a normal distribution of money. It's a perigo distribution of money. But the weird thing about pareto distributions, and so that's a distribution where many, many people end up with zero. And you know, just a few people end up with a lot is that a prieto distribution characterizes zero sum games that are played out to their conclusion.

Speaker 5:          00:56:13       So like monopoly, everybody starts in the middle, but then random trading produces an eventual prieto shaped distribution where lots of people start to stack up on the loser side. One person accelerates towards victory until finally everyone's at zero except one person. So it's the logical outcome of random trading game. So that's the first thing that's interesting about the prieto distribution. The second thing that's interesting is that pareto distributions, um, they prieto distributions emerge in every domain of creative human production, not just the distribution of money. So for example, we did an analysis of the, of creative achievement across the lifespan using uh, using, uh, an instrument called the creative achievement questionnaire. So what it did was assess people's levels of competence across 13 potential domains of creative activity. And so we were looking at production rather than creative thinking per se, right? Although those two things are related and quite tightly, we wanted to know who actually accomplished things in the world.

Speaker 5:          00:57:16       And so for musical ability, for example, the zero score would be, I have no training or, or talent in this area. And the maximum score would be, you know, my, my comp, my original compositions of being played for international audiences. And so we've now administered that to hunt to hundreds of people. And the median score is zero across all 13 domains. It's a very, very, uh, precise burrito distribution with a few people who are the outliers producing the overwhelming majority of the goods. And you also, and that there's a, there's also a law that desota price, uh, came up with back in the 1960s governing the output of scientific papers. And he found that the square root of the number of people operating within an academic domain produced half the papers that were published in that domain. Right? So, you know, so that's not so bad if there's 10 researchers because then three of them are producing half the papers.

Speaker 5:          00:58:16       But if there's a thousand researchers operating in a domain, then 30 of them are producing half the papers. Okay, so and then one more complication and then I'm going to let you let you have at this. So I'd be looking for, now you can think that the prio distribution, which by the way characterizes the distribution of wealth in every known society, although the degree to which the distribution is skewed differs. You can say that the Prieto distribution is a consequence of the, of the final playing out of a random trading game. But then here's the complication. This is something that's been bothering me for years. There are predictors of longterm life success in relatively stable societies and the best predictors are in this order. The first predictor is Iq, the second predictor is trait conscientiousness and it's about half as powerful as Iq. And the third predictor is low neuroticism and it's about half as powerful as conscientiousness.

Speaker 5:          00:59:17       So if you get a good measure of Iq and a good measure of conscientiousness, then you can predict about 25% of the variance in performance, especially across managerial, administrative and academic domains. And then with regards to entrepreneurial performance, you can use Iq and trade openness, which is the creativity measure. So there are powerful individual differences that are driving differential performance and also driving this prieto distribution. And so it's not merely a random game, although how these people manage to make it into not a random game is beyond me. But there is evidence that, that our society does hierarchically arrange itself at least to some degree by ability and competence. And so then the question is how do you factor that into the equation when you're thinking about practical, let's call them income. I don't think it's so much income redistribution is that it's an attempt by society to stop too many people from stacking up at zero and therefore logically turning to violence and that sort of thing as an alternative.

Speaker 4:          01:00:24       Well, as well as an attempt to just improve the level of justice in society. The idea, you know, I mean, especially if there's an element, a strong element of randomness and who ends up where then there's something unjust about large numbers being stuck down at the Xero. But, uh, you know, you say how is it possible to redistribute, but countries vary and the extent which they do this, they very into the extent to which they tax inheritance, they value barrier and the extent to which they tax liar or cubs of they vary and the extent to which they provide education and health care try provide relatively a universally trying to make opportunity, relatively universal. They vary in these things and you know, some of the happiest countries in the world and I think the most productive countries in the world, um, the Nordic countries, Japan have the relatively equitable because they rigged this gay board that some other countries if you like.

Speaker 4:          01:01:28       Uh, so you know, you say that, uh, what stacks up at the top tend to be the most competent creative people. And to imply that to some degree we have a meritocracy and to some degree we do have a shock. But you know, the four wall Bollard Bard ehrs have as much wealth as the hundred billion poorest Americans putting together. And they did nothing to earn it. You could say, well, they're high quality people because they got half of their genes from Sam Walton. Did he did something. Darn it. Um, that seems like a pretty weak argument for why they should control that much. Well, if, if inheritance were more severely taxed in order to provide public goods for everybody, would this society to be worse off would, um, flattening out that curve of accomplished but actually reduced? You know, I think there's some, there, there's some evidence. I wish I could pull it to the forefront of my mind about the utility of distributing grab buddy, uh, more or less equitably and certain sciences, the amount of science you get for your buck is better. Where you give lots of lots of people, relatively small grants that will, you give us a small number of people, relatively large grades.

Speaker 5:          01:02:43       That's interesting because I've worked in the grant system in the u s and Canada and the grant system in the u s is more of the, give a few people a huge amount of money for variety. And in Canada it's distributed more equitably. And I must say that I vastly prefer the Canadian system now. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:03:01       I agree with you and I think the Canadian system has been moving regrettably of the direction of the American. I mean, it partly depends on the field of science. Of course, if you need a buddy, hey, drug collider, that you need billions, millions of dollars if you're a psychologist like you or be a thing to seem to work better in many ways. When you fund the higher proportion of grads with a lower variance, the amount awarded. What I first came to mcmaster, there was exactly, oh no, I shouldn't say what I first came by by saying let's say the late eighties and early nineties essentially everybody in the department how to research grab from either end circ that the natural sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada or sure. The social sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, usually the former at our particular department, everybody in the department had an active research lab.

Speaker 4:          01:03:54       Everybody created the opportunity for two or three students to do a bachelor's thesis of their lab each year. That would things get more variable. People Start People's people who are being productive, who are getting out of scientific paper or to doing decent work, making a contribution to knowledge when they start big to die. These grads, you know, like you refuse to or three times of the competition say, well the hell with it. You know, I mean I've got tell you I've got a good pinch of wind up. I think I'll become a real estate speculator. The opportunities for

Speaker 4:          01:04:28       the dissemination of research opportunity to a larger number of students shrink. Um, I think it's, it's been a disaster in surgery or I guess, you know, an area where I was raised animal behavior studies. If you just look at either the number of papers in top ranked journals by country according to how they allocate their funds or how much buddy is allocated to it, the buddy allocated to it as the less strong predictor of you'd expect of the equitability is a stronger predictor. Sweet and Canada used to, last time I looked both reg far above the United States in numbers of papers per capita getting into top quality research gertels inedible behavior. It's one little addict. Don't know way, but uh, but I would be very, if there's some

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       generality to this flowed well, are there, I wonder though, um, to play devil's advocate, that's the thing about distributing research funds more equitably is that you are distributing them among a population that's already being extraordinarily highly selected for capability. And so it seems counterproductive because it's for all the flaws of the university system, which are manifold. It is still extraordinarily difficult to become a professor. It's a, it's a multitiered selection system. And so the people who do become professors are on average, very intelligent and on average, very hardworking. And we know that because we know what the predictors are of success in academia and its intelligence and conscientiousness, unsurprisingly, although creativity seems to play almost zero rule had that. Well the thing, yeah, but that's partly because you know, sciences and algorithmic gay, right. And just beating away at it busily is a very, very powerful mechanism.

Speaker 5:          01:06:14       So I'm not the least bit cynical about that. I mean the reason that science works is because it's, in some sense it has the aspect of factory production. It can be distributed. Anyone can learn to do it and you get along way is by nibbling at the edges. You know, it's continual, continual slow progress when millions of people are doing it is progress. That's plenty rapid. So, okay, so, so there are definitely situations in which denying people resources seems to be completely counterproductive and that would be one of them. So now the other question though is I would say, and also that's the thing, there's also an effective means of funneling resources to let's say a wide range of professors. It actually works the problem. One of the problems with general income redistribution is, as far as I can tell, is that we don't really know how to do it very well.

Speaker 5:          01:07:05       And one of the, I mean look here, here's an example. You can tell me what you think about this. So I used to work, I used to live in northern Alberta when the oil price, sporadic oil, oops were going on. And my observation was that if you wanted to make money in Alberta when an oil boom was going on, you didn't go out and work on the rigs. Although if you did that, you could make a tremendous amount of money. Now it was all young men who did that pretty much say between the ages of 16 and 25, something like that. And they were making fantastic amounts of money, but they verged almost all of them came out of it with nothing to show for it because they would work for two weeks and then go into town and it doesn't have a blowout party for four days and spent everything they got and expensive cars and wreck them and so forth.

Speaker 5:          01:07:50       So it was reckless behavior. Um, that I think was a kid in some sense to that, to that, uh, to the, to the steep dominance, hierarchy, violence and that sort of thing. That for status seeking that you're describing the people who really made money where the bartenders, right, because they, they, they absorbed all the, all the excess profits. And actually generally, generally speaking or comparatively speaking, we're able to utilize the money properly. Now, the point I'm making is that an oil boom isn't very effective way of distributing wealth down the economic louder. But it didn't necessarily seem to me to be a very effective one because it didn't because the money flowed back up to the top 1% damn near as fast as you can shovel it downwards. And that's, that's the thing about that damn prieto distribution is that it's, it seems there are people, there's, there's a, there's a group, there's a scientific subfield called econo physicists and they actually, they actually modeled the distribution of money in an economy using the same equations that model the distribution of a gas into a vacuum.

Speaker 5:          01:08:59       So there's something that's natural law like about this that the economists call it the matthew principle, right? To those who have everything more will be given and from those who have nothing, everything will be taken. And I don't think that we've done a good job of grappling with the actual complexity of this and we tend to split up into politically opposed, uh, what would you call camps and argue about the, the solution to inequality. And the left wing solution is something like, you know, distribute the money, take it from the rich, especially they undeserving rich. If you can identify them and give it to the poor and the conservatives say, well no, the poorest of the poor should bootstrap themselves up and maybe be provided with more opportunity and that might equalize things. But it isn't clear to me that we're actually grappling with the magnitude of the problem. No, it isn't clear

Speaker 4:          01:09:49       either. But what you say about equalizing opportunity for example, is it a set to distributing the resources because one way you equalize opportunity is by having universal high quality health care that's paid for by sub sort of government. Wherever you sub taxes picked up somewhere. Um, free education, universal access to education is certainly another, that's, you know, it's another way that an effect you create a more egalitarian society. So, I mean there are, there are certain domains, certainly education and healthcare, maybe some others that are not spraying to mine. Well I suppose the improvement of various sorts of infra infrastructure that, you know, make it easier to get from point a to point b. Um, you know, public, publicly subsidized treads, things like that can certainly be contributors as well. Now that's equalizing it. It's all right. You don't have to take anybody a give to get specifically to anybody else.

Speaker 4:          01:10:45       Then there's things like a guaranteed minimum, a big cub at first. It sounds like a crazy idea. The idea that, you know, you should just, we should take government accrued resources which comes from some sort of taxation and we should just make sure everybody has 15,000 bucks a year to start or something like that. Um, it sounds kind of wacky because they standard argument against it from the right has been that, well underbite incentives and nobody will produce all if you know, if we could all be welfare rights, well want to be welfare queens mostly. And where this stuff has been tried by understanding is that, that it's been surprisingly successful that there was an experiment better Toba where a minimum big cub was tried for awhile where, Gosh, yeah, I remember that [inaudible] about to try it. Manatoba Toba has tried it. It was an NDP government I think, which them what replaced by conservative or, or nominally liberal governor, but um, then sort of cad the results. But the results came to light later and showed that for example, the number of people who chose not to work did not go up under this, uh, at that have various beneficial effects. And I think rebates, vc, but I think even the idea of putting buddy in the heads of everybody from the great collective wealth that has accumulated, could be socially beneficial, could be economically beneficial. It could be environmentally beneficial.

Speaker 4:          01:12:21       Certainly the debates like education and health care, that's in effect a kind of redistribution, right? That seems easy to effectuate. I mean, easy it not easy to effectuate in terms of convincing people politically or, or overcoming the propaganda against it. But we don't have a whole bunch of a, obviously a whole bunch of of our wealth is embodied in the infrastructure. Yes. Really noticed this for example, when I lived in Montreal because Montreal is a great city and one of the things that distinguishes Montreal for most cities that I've lived in, uh, especially western cities is that people live in the city. They don't live in their houses. Yes. And the fact that the city is extraordinarily livable so you can walk everywhere. There's always something to do that's exciting. There's a tremendously active street life means that there's access to infrastructure and social capital related wealth just distributed everywhere.

Speaker 4:          01:13:24       And that's a lovely thing. Um, so I see cows, I'm kind of looking for solutions to the prieto distribution problem that conservatives and liberals alike could agree upon. And so some of those you outlined improve the infrastructure of our society because those are public goods that benefit everyone. Then also improve productivity. It seems to be no downside to that at all. Also raises employment, improve the quality of education right from right from day one, which is something that I think we do a very bad job of. Um, uh, and then the issue with healthcare, it's my understanding that the Canadian healthcare system for it and it has flaws, um, because it's of course dealing with an impossible problem, um, still uses much less of its capital

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       on maintaining itself. And for example, um, having to maintain an infrastructure that collects money. I know that the hospitals in the u s spend something, some substantial proportion of the revenue, I can't remember precisely, but it's between 17 and 30%, if I remember correctly. Just gathering the money for their services, which seems to be rather counter productive use of the [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:14:35       resources. I wonder how much is spent on billboards advertising their hospitals to drive the interstate highways of the, it's astonishing how much information about, you know, cub to such and such where we have the best cancer doctors that it isn't well and the, and Americans pay a lot for their healthcare. They do it easily. Did they do indeed. I spent three years there recently and uh, we paid a lot for healthcare coverage that turned out not in fact to be held up thorough a coverage. Right. Well, when I lived in the states do, and I have decent coverage, I was teaching in Boston there I had a pretty good program, but it wasn't, I wouldn't say it was

Speaker 5:          01:15:19       manifestly different from my Canadian experience, which has been mixed. But of course it is very important to note that hell that making people healthy is impossible because everybody gets sick and ages and dies. And so it's an impossible task. And it also indicates to me that that's perhaps one of the reasons why it doesn't fit so nicely into a free market model because the free market assumes that there's not infinite demand for something and there is actually near infinite demand for healthcare,

Speaker 4:          01:15:48       especially if they're dying. There's that and there's also just, you know, it's, it's an impossible problem because of the aging population. It's an impossible problem because you know, governments have one of the determinants of the costs of the healthcare system is held many empties. You've got out there billing it and governments have a tendency to one respond to this by restricting the number of new medics. Um, so as to restrict that a birth people billing, but this is not much of a solution but you have large numbers of people try to find a family doctor. I just successfully, okay so there is, there is some meritocratic structure sure.

Speaker 5:          01:16:28       To our society in so far as Iq conscientiousness and openness predict longterm life success. And that's a good thing because that's an indicator of of health and the society. I would say it's, it's if your society is set up to, to, to allow people who are intelligent and conscientious nearer the pinnacles of power structures, that's a good thing for everyone. Now you could still have an argument about how steep that gradient it should be. But then with regards to the, to the guaranteed annual income issue, I'm also concerned that the importance of individual differences there are not being considered. So for example, I don't know what people who are extremely low in conscientiousness would do with an annual income because they're not inclined to work. And it isn't obvious to me that providing them with an easy way out is the answer. Because providing unconscientious people with an easy way out seems to be actually quite counterproductive.

Speaker 5:          01:17:28       And conscientiousness is a, you know, it's a decent predictor of longterm success. And we also don't know to what degree necessity is a motivator, which is of course the conservative argument. So, so, and we also don't know how homogenous it's and small as society has to be before income redistribution programs will actually be successful. It seems easier to implement them in relatively homogenous societies like the Scandinavian countries or the G or Japan, which is where they tend to have been implemented with more success. So that's a con complicated phenomena as well. And then the other thing that's really going to come up on his heart in the next 10 years, I would say, this is how it looks to me, is that I think computational devices are a multiplier of intelligence and conscientiousness. Because if you're smart and you know how to use a computer and your diligence, so as conscientious person would be, then you're much more deadly than you would be without your computer because it multiplies your, and there's a huge difference between someone who really knows how to use a computer, including knowing how to program it.

Speaker 5:          01:18:35       The someone who's, you know, literate enough to use their ipad to, to do a google search. And so I think one of the things that's also driving inequality, particularly in societies like the United States, is that increasingly people who are smart and conscientious can do a tremendous amount of work without having to hire anyone. So we have these tiny companies that employ almost no one that gathered massive resources to themselves, and that's going to be a problem. Well, here's a good example. Here's one of the thing that's coming. So, you know, the Tesla guys are working pretty hard on autonomous vehicles and then make it a lot of progress and they're not the only one. So obviously, but you know, the biggest employer for males in North America is as driver. I didn't. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the biggest single employment category. So, you know, we're, we're, we're, we're increasingly eradicating the possibility for people who are on the lower end of the intelligence distribution and the lower end of the conscientiousness distribution to find a place in society. And it's possible that providing them with, with minimal resources to survive might be sufficient to solve that problem. But I doubt it because as they say, you know, man does not live on bread alone. And it seems to me that people need that quest. The degree to which people need to find a productive and credible place in a functional society is something that we haven't yet. We don't know the parameters of that. They'll go, I, I don't disagree. I mean, the, the, uh, of course the loss of decently

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       paid work of and two dates, they beige or computer revolution to some extent, or at least the, uh, you know, modern electronic device and your phone could do everything revolution. And you know, I live in Hamilton, Ontario, where were former whale watch bucket taub with, uh, with an enormous number of people working in decently paid, working class jobs. And those jobs, but evaporating and pay. If drivers evaporators work is going to change work opportunities are going to change. And I take your point that people need something that they can think of as useful work. Useful work. You know, it's interesting we're talking, we're two males talking about this and we're probably thinking from a sub what bail perspective. There's a lot of useful work that is minimally or not at all comp compensated than a predominantly female don't maids, um, daycare kinds of things, various so called charitable activities and so on.

Speaker 4:          01:21:17       And you know, the, the idea that people need something to occupy their time with that feels worthwhile. That editors have been twist social arena where they engage with other people, that they come home satisfied, that they've done something useful and they also, you don't have a chicken in every pot besides I need a work opportunities shrink. And if the next mark Zuckerberg kind of play a hundred people to pull, um, tens of billions of dollars, then where's that gonna come from? Is, it may come from various sorts of unpaid work with a guaranteed cub that you know, enables that work to be paid and still be fulfilling? I don't know.

Speaker 5:          01:22:00       I don't know. Well that's a good thing to think about. I mean, maybe, maybe people will learn how to go out into the community and spontaneously do useful things. Although I can tell you that my experience trying to find gainful, uh, let's call it volunteer employments for people who are on the lower end of the ability distribution has been absolutely, uh, it's, it's difficult beyond imagination because it turns out that finding a volunteer position is actually no less difficult. And finding a job, for example, you have to go through a relatively complicated process of police screening for most jobs and you have to produce a resume and you have to be able to work in an office environment and you know, you need to have all the abilities that you would have if you were actually having a real job. And so that, that makes things complicated as well.

Speaker 4:          01:22:48       So, yeah. No, I want to come back also to what you were saying about the predictive power of Iq and conscientiousness, which I don't dispute. And I'm also not one of these people who suffers that the delusion that these things are totally open quotes, socially determined, close quotes. I mean I understand and believe that they have high heritability at identifiable genetic sources in that variability and so on. But you know, the standard old joke used to be, you can tell me because you know more about personality psychology that I do, the standard old junk used to be that everything's 50% heritable. That uh, that, that pretty much anything that you could measure as a trait that has any stability within the lifetime also turns out to have a heritability somewhere to your 0.5. But there's the other 0.5 of, you know, some people have low iqs because they were exposed to two buck chuck [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:23:43       Um, you know, um, I believe that conscientiousness, this can probably be, um, like I believe you suggested earlier that we know something about this already about developmental determinants of swell, of shifts in conscientiousness. And, uh, so, you know, we have to caution ourselves against talking about these individual difference factors as if they are a beautiful attributes of individuals that are going to undermine any sort of progressive improvement of, of that just for people who are, are, are, are, are, are going to create bad byproducts of attempts to produce social justice. It's just going to, you're going to leave here, you're dumb and Kanchi it just people out there being parasites or something. Well, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:24:32       um, there, there is of course decent evidence that their socio cultural effects on Iq, I mean the flynn effect, which is named after the man who described the, the, the, the phenomenon indicates that the average Iq has been increasing quite substantially over the last hundred years. And the reason for that, no one knows for sure. But one of the putative reasons for that is that we've lifted the bottom out of catastrophe. So there aren't people whose iqs are stunted by, by exposure to zero information during critical developmental periods and who didn't get enough to eat.

Speaker 4:          01:25:13       Yeah. Cause I was gonna say Superior Bell Nutrition. Everybody there a probation. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:25:16       yeah, exactly. Exactly. So we've, we've wiped out in many ways, we've wiped out the worst effects of privation and that's increasingly true as well. On, on the worldwide scale worldwide stage. You know, there's about 150,000 people a day right now being lifted out of absolute poverty by UN standards, the fastest improvement in the history of the world by a huge margin and also about 300,000 people a day being hooked up to the electrical grid. So we are making some progress, removing the absolute privation problem, which is a nontrivial problem. The problem with most of the attempts to raise Iq is that they don't change the variance in Iq. They tend to raise the average Iq across the population and that leaves the inequality I Iq inequality problem, basically untouched. So there have been studies trying to estimate how much socioeconomic, um, pressure, let's say you have to place on an individual to raise their iq lowering.

Speaker 5:          01:26:18       It's easy, right? Because making something worse is always easier than making something better. But if I remember correctly, if you take a, an identical twin who's adopted out at birth in order to produce a 15 point increase in Iq compared to the other twin, which is a one standard deviation increase and about the same as the average difference between a university student in, in an average state college and an average high school student, you have to move the one twin from the fifth percentile of socioeconomic status to the 95th percentile. So you need about a three standard deviation improvement and socioeconomic conditions to produce a one standard deviation improvement in Iq. So it looks like it can be done, but it's, but it's expensive, you know, and

Speaker 4:          01:27:06       I see, I see what you're saying. I'm kind of surprised actually. I mean, given, you know, we just mentioned bell nutrition as one possible source of low Iq one possible developmental source. I'm kind of surprised that, uh, to the degree that the flynn effect might be due to things like, or reduction of the number of people exposed to severe malnutrition, that wouldn't have also simultaneously truncated the variance a little bit. Um, that seems like they said,

Speaker 5:          01:27:33       sorry, let me restate that. It has truncated, it has truncated the variance, although the data on that isn't clear isn't as clear. So, but, but I, I do believe that it's a reasonable inference to make that the variance has been truncated. It's also hidden to some degree because the Iq tests are always renew warm to keep the variance set of standard 15 points. Yeah. So, so it makes it difficult to look retrospectively and see what's happened to the variance. So, but, uh, the other problem too is that, you know, you get these stories now and then about these companies that come out with the claims that their brain exercises can improve Iq in the literature on that is damn dismal. I can tell you it's that the holy grail is to produce cognitive exercises that produce a legitimate impact on fluid intelligence. And like, there has been a lot of work down on that. And the answer is so far is that it doesn't work.

Speaker 4:          01:28:24       So what about the game? What about the video gaming? I mean, I know there has been a suggestion that playing video games actually improves at least sub aspects of intelligence. There's a couple of studies that indicated that video games might improve spatial intelligence, but

Speaker 5:          01:28:39       problem, and I think this is, this is a critical problem or apps, an insoluble one or at least no one's solved it, is that what you get is that if you, if you exercise yourself substantially on a given game, you can radically accelerate your performance in the game. So you can get much better at those specific skill share. But you don't get generalization across cognitive sets, which is what really hoping for because I thought, I thought that was the claim from somebody. They have shown some increases in spatial Iq, but there's not very many studies. And I would say they're far over balanced by the other side of the research equation, which continually says, and I've looked at this because I'm really interested in the improvement of Iq. I mean that's, that's the holy grail in some sense. And that, and, and, uh, the, the, the overwhelming preponderance of evidence suggests that you don't get generalization outside the narrow domain. Now why that is, and even this, it's even worse, hey, because you might say, well, imagine that you could take five different domains of intelligence still associated type with the g and you had people practice routines in all five dimensions. Maybe you'd get generalization under those circumstances. And the, the, the results of the research attempting that indicate that no, as soon as you move away from those specific practice instances, you don't get generalization.

Speaker 4:          01:30:02       So, I mean, I guess it's, I guess the subways, some of this is to be expected from the consideration that everything is an allocation problem with it within the body at Brae in, uh, um, that, you know, by a large, an approvement blood domain tends to be bought at the expense of something else. Yeah, just that.

Speaker 5:          01:30:27       Right. And then conscientiousness, I can tell you some research we've done. That's cool. Although we haven't been able to demonstrate that it's actually improved conscientiousness, the first thing to note about conscientiousness is that no one understands it at all. Especially the industriousness element. There's no plausible biological, psychological neurophysiological or animal models for conscientiousness. All we've got is self reports. We can't even find tasks that conscientious people do better. It's unbelievable. But I'm self reports really. Also freeport, well you can get reports from teachers and parents and so forth, but it's all human report. Okay. The only way we can measure it, and we know like in my lab we probably tried 200 tasks trying to find something that conscientiousness, conscientious people do better. No luck. We can derive it from linguistic analysis of verbal output now to some degree. But that's still, that's not a task, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:31:22       Yeah. So now we, we produced a series of programs called the self authoring suite and one of them, the future authoring program to writing program that helps people lay out their plans for the future in, in detail. So they have to consider their, um, their intimate relationships, their career goals, their educational goals, their use of time outside work, their plans to maintain mental and physical health, their use of drugs and alcohol. They have to write for 15 minutes about what kind of life they'd like to have if they were taking care of themselves three to five years in the future. And then to write for the same amount of time, how terrible their life could be if all their bad habits took control. And then they have to turn the positive vision into an implementable plan. And we've managed to improve their college grades by about 20% and drop out there, drop, drop their dropout rate by about 25% over about 10,000 students now.

Speaker 5:          01:32:17       But you know, we tried to see if that was mediated by an improvement and conscientiousness and there was no evidence for that. What it was mediated by was number of words written during the exercise. So it turns out that thinking more about your future helps, the more you think about it, the more it helps. And maybe that, you know, maybe that would translate into an improvement in conscientiousness across time. But, um, there haven't been any credible studies that I know of indicating that there are exercises that can be done to improve conscientiousness. So that's also, you know, troublesome and worrisome because that would be a nice thing to be able to do.

Speaker 4:          01:32:55       Yeah. I mean I haven't thought much about it. They don't know much about the literature on conscientiousness as a trait, but the word seems to connote to me as an ordinary English speaker has a strong social element to it as well. It's kind of like a conscientious person is somebody who doesn't forget his obligations. Um, your index of conscientiousness and a university professor is, you know, somebody has asked you to write them a reference letter for getting into graduate school or whatever. Do you actually prioritize getting the DAB thing done? I'd Tibor is there some risks that you'll just forget about it and shove it to them somewhere else? I imagine cut, she had just, this is having a strong element of attentiveness to social obligation and to the wellbeing of others as it is defined and the personality of the literature doesn't have any of that.

Speaker 5:          01:33:44       Well, I would, I would say not so much attention to the wellbeing of others because that's more trait agreeableness, that's more than maternal dimension. But there's definitely a massive effect of social obligation, which is part of the reason why conservatives tend to be hired conscientiousness than liberals, but it's not well being of others. It's duty. And so the, the, the conscientious types may form and maintain social contracts. Yes, they implement their plans and they seem to feel shame and self contempt when they, when they fail to live up to their social obligations. And so that's another thing that's interesting about the income redistribution idea because it's conceivable to me that conscientious people would hate that because conscientious people do very badly, for example, if they're, um, if they're laid off from work, even if it's not their fault, they still take themselves apart for their failure. So, and so conscientious people in particular seem to find inactivity without productivity, highly aversive and adverse, if enough to really cause them, you know, major health problems. So well,

Speaker 4:          01:34:55       could, that brings us back to what we were discussing a little while ago. The problem of

Speaker 4:          01:35:02       ensuring that large numbers people have access to bd goofball work in an age at which it is more and more the case that uh, that big components of the economy are blue bag away with very few employees. I that's going to continue. That's probably going to escalate or back to that same topic to some extent. Yes. But again, I, I mean I think, I think any inequality of opportunity is sort of they bought of our bedrock of any quality. Yeah. Having its impact upon us. It's, it's, it's certainly the bond but bedrock of, of why we should care about it. Odd, moral and social justice grouts it's like, well why should people who,

Speaker 1:          01:35:54       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:35:55       why should bloods birthright affect the opportunity is available to what and

Speaker 5:          01:36:01       well, it's also a social catastrophe because hypothetically you want to set up a society so that whatever someone has to offer is maximally offerable to the community because otherwise the community loses. Yes. Now, it seems to be, I mean, I think one of the great examples of that, although I don't think this accounts for all of it, is that the relationship between the provision of women's rights by countries and their economic productivity is staggeringly high. So I think that also has to do with o openness in general to transformation and change with, with, with the provision of women's rights being an index of that. But nonetheless, it's a great predictor of eventual economic success. Well, so our park,

Speaker 4:          01:36:43       we get a ducks and partly perhaps bar more direct effect that after all it slightly over half the population, um, maybe their talents are better utilized.

Speaker 5:          01:36:55       Right. Well that's certainly what we would hope. And I think, I think as you said, I think the evidence at least suggests that. Yeah. So, okay, so let me recapitulate because we should probably fold this up. It's so, so as far as I'm concerned, your work was revolutionary because it undermined the general proposition that the fundamental cause of crime and violent crime in particular was poverty. Instead you, you flipped it, you flipped it on edge, so to speak. And made the, made the claim well substantiated by the research that it's relative poverty that drives violent crime because of status seeking primarily among young men and older. There are effects of absolute privation and that would be the poverty. It's the, the effects of relative deprivation of status are much more, let's say, especially in our societies, much more socially significant. Yes. And up the status competition is driven at least in part by the desire of men to attain status, to obtain access to, to women roughly speaking.

Speaker 5:          01:38:04       And it's partly because women outsourced the problem of mate selection to the male competition domain. Right. So the males compete, the women peel off the top. It's like a market solution in some sense. And then, and then having pointed out that inequality not only drives male homicide but also tends to destabilize societies. There is an impetus for people to consider how we can stop the winner from taking all without becoming unduly or authoritarian about it or, or, or impeding individual productivity. Given the fact that there is individual variation in yes, in the elements that actually produce productivity. That's our set of social problems, exacerbated by the fact that we're going to be wiping out employment for huge categories, particularly of men over the next 15 years.

Speaker 4:          01:38:55       Yeah. Let me, uh, in this context, just make a point that I spent most of a chapter of my book on and that is that the notion that inequality is somehow, um, the engine of productivity. It's been pretty much rejected by economists themselves in recent years. I've come to the conclusion that relatively equitable places actually have more of economic productivity in the ensuing period of time than those that start out boring, inequitable. And there's a lot of reasons for that. Um, the one that I think is most striking to you that I would commend people to look into is the concept of useless, if you like, are wasteful expenditure on guard wave or relatively on equal societies. A guard waiver is a term coined by economists samples and Arjun Jayadev. And what they've shown is that the number of people who are employed just jobs like being security guards, um, goes up as it equality goes up. It's no great surprise when you think about it, but you could defy guard labor bar broadly or more narrowly. And the general result is that a large proportion of people are engaged at work then is it a sense nod productive? It's just trying to prevent people from usurping the property of other people and that this is a very wasteful consequences of extreme inequality and economic waste that's reduced to relatively equitable societies. And there are others. As the

Speaker 5:          01:40:24       society becomes more unequal, it tilts towards authoritarianism at multiple levels.

Speaker 4:          01:40:30       Organization, it's one that just, sorry, I was just going to say add towards exactly this and it's counterproductive even from the point of view of, of simple, you know, economic criteria, GDP, it so odd that, uh, that inequality gets in the way that for a bunch of reasons and other really interesting when the ball's has, um, has articulated it in a book. Paul's b o w l e s sat bowls to people I don't look about. Um, I think that's book was called the new politics of any quality of redistribution to that. I liked it a lot. Anyway. One thing that he's shown that I thought was very interesting and it never entered my head before I read was that the actual quality of goods it is society can be damaged by severity, quality. When rich individuals, which firms have the capacity to keep innovators and small companies from establishing themselves. You mentioned before about the differences and entrepreneurial undertakings and where large numbers of people with worthy small business plans can't capitalize them properly. It can't get off the ground. You've actually got a phenomenon of people with lots of wealth and shoddy products can drive people with better quality products who are trying to get started at the bottom out of the bar camp with negative results for just the consumer.

Speaker 5:          01:41:57       Well, the society having people stack up at zero zero turns out to be a very, very difficult place to get out of because you can't leverage yourself out of it. And what's also in those really unequal societies to like say Central American societies, it's also becomes increasingly unpleasant for the people who are wealthy because they're only wealthy in a very narrowly defined way because they can't go outside. They can't let their children go out on into public because they'll get kidnapped. I mean, the societies get pretty ugly when the fences have to be really high and yes, and, and so, so yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:42:33       Wow. So the rich countries, rich countries of the world, those problems are not absent. I mean there are certainly worse than the u s than they are in Canada or most of western Europe.

Speaker 5:          01:42:45       Yeah. Well, all right. That was really good. I'm very happy that you agreed to do a podcast with Ben and I mean, I found your work well. I'm, I definitely regard you as one of the people who's been highly influential on my thinking. I mean, I think that work on relative poverty is just, and the effect sizes, the work you guys did in Chicago, your work on indicating the adaptive utility of, of uncertainty related dominous challenges in, in unequal societies. All of that's brilliant I think can nicely biologically predicated in the science has done extremely soundly and it has remarkable policy implications and you know, and it changes the view around crime and, and, and wealth and in a very important way to tilt it over towards the inequality side. I think it's, and it fits so nicely in with the dominance hierarchy, literature and all of that. It's, it's really profound stuff as far as I'm concerned. So I'm really glad you had a chance to share it with everyone.

Speaker 4:          01:43:44       Thank you very much. I appreciate those kind words. You can, flattery will get you everywhere. Yeah. Well the thing is,

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       the best kind of flattery is truth. So, and uh, I would certainly recommend that people take a look at your book if they're interested in what we've been discussing. Again, that's killing the competition, which is, it's very readable, I would say. It provides a lovely argument with regards to inequality, addresses the major criticisms, I think very effectively and, and starts to lay out what is going to be an increasingly necessary public discussion about how civilized societies can, can, can ensure that they don't collapse into two extreme distribution, um, uh, w into two extreme distributions of wealth or other resources. It's a real danger. It's a conscious, unconscious, constant danger. It needs to be thought through and addressed very intelligently. So thanks again. Hopefully, maybe we'll get another chance to talk, hopefully a couple of hundred thousand people to watch this. That will be good. That'll okay. Great. Thanks a lot. You Bet. [inaudible] signing off. Okay.
