Speaker 1:          00:00:45       We're going to collabs lecture eight and nine together since there's no class on the 27th. Bsa is now due on the third of April, the next day. So just after reading.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       I suppose for the next essays, although once again you're obliged to pick your own topic, some use, some reliance on the secondary meetings would probably be useful because one of the things that concerns me is that people aren't going to do the secondary reading since we don't talk much about the in class since I don't make it a point of pestering you with exams or such. Regarding the secondary readings, they are important. Um, did I want to ask you, did I go over in this class the purpose of each of the readings? No. Okay. I did that my other class. I'll do that now. Do you want to tell you why I wanted you to read what I outlined?

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Well, the purpose of the neuropsychological papers that does everybody have their syllabus. Okay, good. The purpose of the neuropsychological papers is pretty much obvious to get to give you some additional material bearing on neuro psychology to sort of flesh out the additional discussion. Okay. Newman's book, the origins and History of consciousness provides the best overview that I know of here on mythology. The most accurate overview. It's a book that's much like Joseph Campbell's hero with a thousand faces, except I think it's the. See the problem with Joseph Campbell is that he's too optimistic he'll. For Campbell, the hero's journey is something that's always positive and I don't think that's true. I think it's more. Well, I mean the standard hero myth in Western culture is Christ's passion that involves exposure to a hostile group, torture and then dad. So that aspect of the hero myth at least could not be construed as particularly positive. So anyways, I, I think that new ones work is for original and the great mother. While the reason that I want you to read the great mother is because. Let me read you something from ham here. First would be a good introduction to this. I like this quote because a Donald Hebb is extraordinarily well regarded by physiological psychologist. He was the person who originated the hypothesis that I'm of neural networks basically and um,

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       suggested that learning occurred as a consequence of potentiation, of the communication between neurons. Anyways, head states, even in ourselves. Civilized, amiable and admirable parts of mankind well brought up and not constantly in a state of fear. There are signs that this or that, it depends as much on our successfully avoiding disturbing stimulation as on a lower sensitivity has already suggested the capacity for emotional breakdown, maybe self concealing leaving the animal to find or create an environment in which the stimuli to excessive emotional responses are at a minimum. So effective is our society in disregard that it's members, especially the well to do and educated ones may not even guess at some of their own potential realities. One usually thinks an education in the broad sense that's producing a resourceful emotionally stable adult without respect to the environment in which these traits are to appear. To some extent, this may be true, but education can be seen as being also the means of establishing a protective social environment in which emotion instability as possible.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       Perhaps it strengthens the individual against unreasonable fears and rages, but it's certainly produces the uniformity of appearance and behavior which reduces the frequency with which the individual member of the society encounter such causes a disturbance on this via the susceptibility to emotional disturbance may not be decreased. It may in fact be increased the protective cocoon of uniformity in personal appearance. Manners and social activity generally will make small deviations from customer care increasingly strange, exhausted. The general thesis is sound increasingly intolerable. The inevitable small deviations from customers will bolt increasingly large and the members of the society finding themselves tolerating trivial deviations well. We'll continue to think of themselves as socially adapted with that. The last sentence there, I mean when he says it a little, because first it is to read that this even the slightest difference will be noticed as large, but then you're saying that that we're bearing that there will be born well.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       Does that mean that the biggest society does. He just means that maybe I'll be able to tolerate you if your hair is an inch longer than mine, and if I can do that, I will think I'm taller, but if it's three inches longer, well, I said look out. So what he's basically saying is the range within which the definition of tolerance exists will become increasingly restricted. So nonetheless, society will continue to think of itself as Tom. Absolutely right. Absolutely. So now what does that have to do with the great mother, which was of course the question that I addressed the quote to, well, if have this right, and other people have made very similar suggestions, including you who said that? This is quite hilarious. I think he said what is ordinarily called religion is a substitute to such an amazing degree that I asked myself seriously when did this kind of religion, which I prefer to call a creed, may not after all, have an important function in human society.

Speaker 1:          00:07:05       The substitute has the obvious purpose of replacing immediate experienced by a choice of suitable symbols, tricked out with an organized dogma, and Rachel, the Catholic Church, maintains the by her indisputable authority, the Protestant church, if this term is still applicable by insistence on belief and the evangelical message, so long as these principles work, people are effectively protected against the media who they just experience. The notion being that the purpose of dog culture is protect people from religious experience now might think, well, why does it have to do with him statement? Well, the essence of religious experience might be regarded as as overwhelming emotional experience, and what young is saying is that the purpose of Dogma is to protect you from encounter with the most fundamental emotions and have points out that culture may protect you so well. Then you have no idea what it is that you're being protected from. The general thesis of this course is that the thing that you are protected from, it's so terrible that you'll do anything to maintain the protection even though under most circumstances you won't even know that it's there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:22       The reason I want you to read the great mothers because it contains a description of symbols that have been accumulated in innumerable societies over thousands of years that have been created in an attempt to portray the nature of what is so terrible that you cannot tolerate it, and to the degree that art works, this symbolic representations of the unknown are effective because most of those I would say, fact that what our does, you know, if you think, think about it this way, that the purpose of culture isn't as similar to Oregon and that's one way of looking at it and the processes that exist around the perimeters of the Oregon, so to speak. Think of it as an island. It's always expanding. The processes that work in the middle of the island aren't the same processes that work on the edges, the clothes that you are to the middle, so to speak.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       The more things are absolutely defined which which is to say that you can explain them in words. They very predictable and been given a rational, rational underpinnings. They're explicitly discussable there semantically formulated, but around the edges, x word peculiar activities still takes place. That would be the initial stages of the assimilation process and that's where fantasy plays a big, big role because fantasy is the place where the unknown first transforms itself into the unknown and while you could say that people's use of symbols and that sort of thing, you know, artistic productions are their attempt to make up the unknown. Something provisionally. No, I mean I think that's what art is doing. It's always working as it, as the little cow where new information is being fed. New cultural information is being fed into the culture. That's its purpose.

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       And there's a book by

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       no, there was an address by social units and the Nobel prize winning addressed, I think it's called beauty will save the world, which is a dusty esky quote. And this is an argument that social media makes that link of purpose of, um, of higher order culture, the humanities and the arts on to open a window into those domains that still exist as unknown. And to let some new information in, you would say, well, artistic religious symbols of that sort function to do that. Over time they performed their function. Then they lose their vitality. So you can't tell what they mean anymore. They don't. They don't intrinsically attract your attention anymore. Forget what they mean. The reason I want you to read the great mother and to look at the in there so that with any luck, what the people who made those representations were trying to communicate will retain. It's significant so that you can see the nature of the terror that religious dog, one culture in general, which gives everything a uniform appearance of irregularity. Why? That was what that was all directed to protect us against. So now it's the purpose of that whole. And I think if you read it, it will do it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       What's the title of Associate Address?

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       Beauty will save the world. I have the essay in a collection

Speaker 2:          00:11:30       than I can. I can show you.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       Even if you look at, look at it this way. Okay, so you walk into a museum. Mrs Happened to me on a number of locations. There's all paintings everywhere and some of them have no emotional significance at all. You know, you might try to generate some sort artificially, but a lot of them just don't capture you now. And then if you're lucky, if you're in a good museum, I suppose whether you know something or not also makes a difference, but you'll come across a payday or a statue that will grab you and the reason that grabs you, I think. So. It's a visual portrayal.

Speaker 2:          00:12:12       Um, then go.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       That's a good example of sunflowers. What van Gogh managers to do is to present you something that's familiar or that you think is familiar, which means something that you've habituated to, which means something that you think you understand, but he twists it so that the phenomena now retains that. The novelty that perhaps it once had when you first encountered the thing or in the primeval state, I suppose would be a symbolic way of looking at it. So what the artist's forces you to do, at least momentarily, it's to snap out of the or habituated complacency and to view the object that's being represented as something that has not yet lost its sheen of arts pristine.

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       It's pristine aspect, so then you can see what's actually there instead of looking at your own memory, which is what you almost always do when you look at something and you have very limited attentional capacity and almost everything that you encountered, you see as a representation of that thing. Everything that you've explored before, that's how your brain, in a sense makes the most use out of its limited capacity. You always watch your own memory and a great artist is someone who can snap you out of that momentarily to make you see what's actually there and theoretically that can give you some insight, some additional insight into the nature of the world. And art in that sense still has a religious function in their arch. Originally only had a religious function. It's only had a nonreligious function in the west for maybe 400 years. So for the bulk of human history, art played an explicitly and that's what it's trying to do.

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       It's the place where information is first manifest, first manifests itself before it becomes something that's concrete and candidate. So anyways, hopefully if you look at the great mother, you'll be able to see these constructions with the same eyes that the people who originally made them and you can tell if that happens because the objects will stop looking like foreign cultural artifacts and start looking like representations of something. And it's really. I think you can really see a shift in perception if, if, if if you, if you were doing the right thing, what you want to try to do is to occupy the territory, the person who originally constructed the representation to see what it was that they were trying to portray. A lot of these figures, they took a lot of work. You know, you have to be highly motivated to spend hours or weeks or even years constructing a representation of something that you don't really understand.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       You have to put yourself in the position of those people and see what it was, what worked it, and think about what it must have been that grip them so hard to motivate them to produce something that has so little apparent economic value and yet it takes so much effort, so it's very. It's very worthwhile to do that. The use and abuse of history. That's the next leg. It's a very small book. The reason that I want you to read that is because it's the only book that I know of. It clearly describes the pathological aspect of culture, not the pathological aspect of any particular culture, but the fact of the culture as a phenomenon necessarily. How's it pathological impact or pathological aspect that's inevitable. He basically points out that history is a burden as well as, uh, as well as a great advantage. And to put it simplistically, I suppose what you might think of is the fact that if you're going to be a classical musician, for example, the fact that innumerable classical musicians have lived before you is a tremendous opportunity because you have the opportunity to master the skills they developed and transmitted, but by the same token, it's also an incredible impediment to your own progress because your domain of competition has become so broad, you know it only compete for preeminence and recognition in the present with all the other people who are trying to become classical musicians, but you necessarily pit yourself against those people who were the absolute best at that for as long as that particular activity is being recorded.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       So as a consequence, you're necessarily trivialized in relationship to the, to these heroic figure something

Speaker 3:          00:17:01       the past. So neat. You have also added to that by saying that the great composers of the past have also limited the president composer by making the eyes of of everyone around them used to the, to the, to the, to the kinds of stuff that previous one time at created would expect that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:21       Yes, yes. Certainly whenever I think like I can, I think you can see minor indications of this on an ongoing basis in our own culture. Like I think one of the things that mass, the mass reproduction of music for example, has done because this also. This also occurs with televised events because the television is even more accurate. What television does is make history of an event as it curves and the fact that you get the historical perspective on things as they're instantaneously occurring I think is very hard on your own perception of the utility of meaning of your own life. It strikes me that increasingly we're in the position of not presuming that anything is real unless we see it on television and that people have devalued their own personal culture and I mean by that they're individual culture and their familial culture in favor of this global culture which which although it appears to be ongoing, is really sort of instant history.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       So the thing about a television has, it'll capture your attention no matter what. Someone. It'll capture your attention instantly, which basically means that you're considering the thing that's being portrayed as more important than anything that you could be doing at that present time. So the how does that. How's that? Is that what you mean by history or do you mean something else? By checking into history, meaning taken away, taken away what people would add to it or. I mean what I understand what? Well, it's just part of the weight of the. Like. The thing about television is that it's the whole culture, right in your living room. You know what? It's a tremendous. It's a tremendous. It competes tremendously for your attention. I mean it offers you access theoretically all these cultural resources, but at the same time simultaneously while you're engaged in getting access to these resources, you're not actually living and you're not producing or creating anything of your own so that it's a good example of what Nietzsche is talking about when he talks about the abusive history.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       So wait, it gets an opportunity because it's information, but at the same time it's a tremendous weight. So you know, you see this when you get people sitting around. This used to happen to me in graduate school now and then when people would sit around and a large chunk of their childhood memories that are shared memories were television shows that they had all watched. And what that means is that instead of having individual memories about the events, you have transpersonal memories about the same events that aren't even real. I think that's another indication of how it. Yeah, it is. It's very peculiar. Very peculiar.

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       Well, I was thinking that this was more trivial, but I was thinking the time that this has only happened over a span of 40 years. Say Rock music is only 40 years old, but as there was more and more of it, the likelihood that I'm stations like these, all these golden oldies stations popped up in the eighties and they played like the music of the sixties and the seventies. And what happens is there's a limited bandwidth of radio and the historical productions occupy a broader and broader section of the bandwidth until the new bands, so to speak, are not only competing against all the other bands who were now, but all the other bands that have accumulated over this 40 year period when nature, he talks about the weight of history, the accumulated weight of history. Well that's a trivial example as I said, but that's.

Speaker 1:          00:20:53       It's still something that's happened over the span of four years. So it's a burden. So it's a very short essay that I thought was the best answer I've ever encountered on that particular topic. So nature, you see the reason I like that, it's because they need to. Being an extraordinary burner. Genius was always cognizant of the fact that you don't get this, which is like the protective aspect of the great father. That's the thing that renders everything predictable, intolerable. You don't get that. Then you can get it without also getting this is that the wise king and the tyrants are inseparable and there can be some movement back and forth from one to the other. I mean, it does seem upon occasion all of culture can turn into something tyrannical, but Nancy was pointing out that even in its most positive guys is the fact that there is culture constitutes an impediment to your own success as well as one of the preconditions of your success. You get kind of warped views of that. This is mostly interesting for those of you who are interested in clinical psychology or psychopathology. The humanistic branch of psychology basically took this argument but only half of it and he said, well, because one of their questions was where? Where does human evil come from? Where human suffering, I suppose it Carl Rogers and Abraham maslow and probably the foremost

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       exemplars of humanistic psychology. They basically made the presupposition that this is their story. The individuals intrinsically good and if you just provide the proper preconditions, then everything will turn out positively to the degree that the individual isn't good. It's because society, which is then cast complicity in the negative role, distorts the possibilities of the individual as he or she matures. Well, that's a good story and it's true. I mean, it's obviously the case that as you mature all sorts of arbitrary limitations and be placed on you, really arbitrary limitations, many of which have crushed and distorted and work your your character in some matters that might even be unalterable,

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       but by the same token, this is also true is that you are an behave nasty little brood when you were little and it was the positive aspect of culture in force on your behavior that made you even vaguely socially acceptable. Now the humanists tend to tell one side of the story. This is the thing. This is another reason why I really like this, this diagram because it's a pretty simplistic diagram, but the fact that it's a complete story is very useful and if you know the complete story, you know that, well, yes, there's negative aspects of culture, but they're in separately tied to the positive aspects and yes, there are negative aspects of nature or the unknown, but there are also positive aspects and likewise for the individual than it. If you know that, if you understand what it means, then it can stop you from falling sort of whole heartedly into what I think are relatively one sided simplistic ideologies. Because if someone says, well, you know, all human evil is attributable to the faults of society. You can say, well, yes, but you know, here are all sorts of counterexamples to that particular claim. Or if people say, well, because this is a common environmentalist claim, sort of.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       This is kind of funny. I had another friend in graduate school who was a German great big guy. I mean he was a German ancestry and uh, he, he was really a nice fellow. Which meant that in your contact with him, you never observed any overt aggression. And uh, he told me once he was a left sort of, he had your typical left leaning liberal philosophy, the ideology. He was environmentally concerned and he was anti big business and so on and so forth, which is all perfectly reasonable. But he told me once the planet would be better off if there were no people on it, meaning that human beings intrude onto nature and destroy things and that it would be better. But then I thought, well that's an interesting example, the collective unconscious, I suppose, because the notion that the notion that the planet would be better off without people in it presumes that nature is something that's all beneficial.

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       The pristine and unspoiled nature is all positive, so he is dominated by the archetype is dominated by this architect is thinking unconsciously. He thought nature was a French impressionist landscape. But then he said, well, the planet would be better off without people on it. Which meant that if he was given his free rein of expression, he would immediately become an exponent. This part of the great mother and do his best to, to decimate everything that he could lay his hands on. Yes, the people than I thought. I thought it was interesting and in part given his German cultural ancestry, because the idea that the planet would be better off without people on it was certainly something that motivated the Nazis. For example, so whenever you hear anybody say that, I mean, he, he was no problem because he was in graduate school, graduate students at most. He could recap all according to his girlfriend and maybe a few friends, you know, if you really went into all out. But uh, anyways,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       I don't understand what the frame of references is that I'm negative. Positive, positive to the individual or is it two areas are just innately negative or positive? I don't understand.

Speaker 1:          00:26:55       Is the emotional. I guess it's the emotional valence of the different domains. All I'm saying there is that any phenomena has the capacity to produce both positive and negative emotions depending on the context and interpretation, sort of an implicit part of it. I guess it would be in reference to the individual. Okay. So presumes a subject.

Speaker 3:          00:27:19       So the negative, the negative aspect. So the great mother on this side where the individual is positive, um, is, is, is seen by the individual is negative.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       Oh, well. Oh, I see what you're saying there is the positive aspect of culture protects you from the negative aspect of Don. No. Okay. And here it's that the negative aspect of culture, uh, for bids, your contact with the positive aspect of the unknown, which was your point, say with regard to the composers, there are ways that you should conduct yourself, which means here's a whole set up alternative possibilities which you're forbidden to explore and that's useful because you won't become afraid, but it's constricting is restricted to your potential domain of activity. And I would say here, well, the reason these two are matched is because it's the negative aspect of the individual that we'll see later that heightens the likelihood that culture will take on a negative or tyrannical last time. So I would say for example, let's take a look at the Nazis.

Speaker 1:          00:28:30       Now, one of the things that Nazis were trying to do, they have a tight ideology and they were trying to produce a domain that was very secure and they were sacrificing people all the time to construct this particular domain. So, and I would say that, well, there's two reasons possibly to, to persecute other people. One is because they're in your way and you're trying to construct a do a domain that's secure, so if you're an explorer, for example, when you come across another tribe of people who don't speak your language, while as far as you're concerned, they're barbarians and your job is to establish your territory, but then the other reason for first accusing other people is because you enjoy it because there's something pathological about you and I would say that the cultural movement, which is to establish new territory tends to become aligned with individual pathology and when that happens, then you get increased likelihood that when territory is being established that people will be persecuted.

Speaker 1:          00:29:47       So people like the Nazis would say, well, this is necessary because we want to establish the third. Right? Which is our particular brand of utopia on earth. That's their. That's their justification that they wear like a uniform so that when they look at themselves in the mirror and they can tolerate it, but really what's going on is that they really liked to hurt people and they can use the cultural movement, which is part of the hero's journey. In a sense to mask that even to themselves. So can you, can you look at each circle that has some kind of fortress I guess, or a castle and yeah, this is a counselor

Speaker 3:          00:30:22       negatives. When you partner likes a track and this and unlikes whatever repel. So I mean the positive doesn't let in the negative. Negative doesn't end with a positive with positive lead in the positive and negative 11.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       I think that's a reasonable way of looking at this could easily be conceptualized as a castle wall here in particular with would that out, you know, this domain being outside the individual's surrounded by the culture. That's, which is what I was saying with regards to the great mothers. You never get to look at this even because you're so well protected by this. You don't even know what's there. So it's like in the story of Buddha, Buddha was brought up by his father and uh, on just before Buddhist birth, a sage told his father that he will need to grow up to be the world's savior or a political leader. And his father wanted him to be a political leader anyways. So one of the things he did to help ensure that he would stay in love with the world so that he occupied that domain was to erect a wall around him and to put a paradise that means a walled city.

Speaker 1:          00:31:30       By the way, that's very interesting. I think to put around Buddha Gautama a castle wall, and inside the castle there was nothing that was sick or old or in any way diseased because he didn't want to become conscious to essentially become self conscious and to abandon the world. So that's another good. That's that story. Has this structure explicitly like the great father erects the wall around the individual to protect him or her against the negative aspect of the unknown. And that's, that's. I mean that's the subject matter for today's discussion basically. So okay, so you're reading use an abusive history because niche outlines the positive and the negative aspects of it. History. Sorry, I just wanted to ask you something about what you said about what your friends said about the world being better off without people because that that seems to be sort of a strange and really meaningless projection because without sort of an emperor of a more sizing of the state of the world because without, without people, but world

Speaker 4:          00:32:39       could not be said to be better or worse in any way whatsoever beyond completely meaningless. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's why I

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       immediately look for turtle alternative motive, especially given his ancestry, which isn't to say that there's anything peculiar about journalists necessarily just that it's not far. We're not far enough away from what happened in the Second World War for the reasons for what happened to have disappeared or changed in any significant way whatsoever. It's another reason why trying to work with this material. In the introduction of the book, one of the things I tried to point out was the fact that we don't know what to remember about the Holocaust or what to change in our behavior as a consequence of its occurrence. It's only happened not even yesterday and we're still the same people that we were. So when he says that the planet would be better off without people on it, then I immediately wonder, well, just precisely what does that mean? Like what's your real motivation? His motivation is something like there are

Speaker 4:          00:33:43       people are tainted intrinsically, so badly that the only solution to the problem of their existence and to the problem they posed to nature. So to speak, that below there, the fact that they are our nature is to rid the planet of the. Now you might think that's making a lot out of an offhand statement, but the point is that people do act very often as if they're motivated by precisely that set of motivations. So here you've got the identification of the positive aspect of the individual with the positive aspect of the unknown. Because if you're saying that he wants to destroy somebody who wants to save nature,

Speaker 2:          00:34:24       um,

Speaker 4:          00:34:27       well, if, what if one of these reacting against the, essentially the negative aspect of the great father, which is, which essentially, yeah, but which is composed of all of the, as you were saying about the identification of the negative aspect of it, of the individual with the, with the, uh, negative aspect of, of the father. Then what then what he wants to eliminate as essentially the negative aspect of the father. But the reason you would do that would be for the sake of the, of the positive individual and there. And it seems to me that then, then to project that on bias in terms of just you're trying to save the planet, which is nature. I think people seem to identify nature in the positive sense with the positive in. Oh, you, so you, you're, you're making the point essentially that he was confused in these mythological precept positions. Is that. Well, um, possibly. I don't know. It just, it seems to me that, well, you know, like the idea that there is some, the God that has everything everyone has has in them.

Speaker 2:          00:35:26       Um,

Speaker 4:          00:35:28       I mean, it seems like if you're saying it seems to be strange, strangely paradoxical to say that you want to, you want to eliminate the human race, um, for the of nature because what

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       it really seems to me that you're saying is that you're, you want to save what is natural and people. I mean. Well, that's cool. That's what I, that's why I was wondering about confusion. Presuppositions. Yeah. Well, um, I don't know. I don't know where to go exactly any farther with that particular argument. I mean, he had.

Speaker 3:          00:36:01       Well, I don't know what else to say about that. Have you been saying. I mean, can you, can you say that you liked nature and also say that you want to help the world because. Well, I mean, could you be lying in? He could, he could. When he says he wants to save the world, could you actually say, I want to kill a bunch of people?

Speaker 1:          00:36:19       Yes, absolutely. Certainly. Sure. And then it was, that's the best excuse for killing a bunch of people. It's the one that if you adopt, makes you tolerable to yourself. So I suppose it would always be the case in a sense because if you're saving your world, if you're, I in in terms of what we're talking, sure, it's, it's a logical justification, which perhaps upon occasion is even true, but it's also the kind of justification that can easily and rapidly be twisted for your own particular nasty and see. Because one of the things that's interesting about war is the fact that people will commit crimes in the course of work there that go beyond

Speaker 1:          00:37:10       the don't actually help the cause of the war in any particular manner. And not only that undermine necessarily the things that, that person is theoretically fighting for. Like one of the things that springs to my mind is, uh, the plan rape of the Muslim women in, in what used to be Yugoslavia. And it takes that particularly the justification that we are just establishing our own secure territory is not sufficient to motivate the planning of that kind of event. You need some other little bent twist to come up with something that, uh, that it brilliantly cruel. And anyways, I'm discussing this in part as a, what would you call a precursor to the whole last section of this particular course because one of the things we're going to discuss in detail is the nature of that additional twisted motivation. We haven't talked anything about this at all.

Speaker 3:          00:38:08       Yeah. So yeah. Wait, so I'm trying to understand what you just said is the only way that you can, you can justify rape is not only to, for the war to be a warring over land but also over this objective territory. Well, I would think if you, if you, if whole land women were to be raped, that would. I mean it obviously affects it. It brings down the morale of the women that were raped and also the community, the community because when that happened. So it's not really a material gain when but also an emotional.

Speaker 1:          00:38:53       Well, I would, I would say under most conditions it would be the reverse because I think like if you want to defeat someone, I think anything you can do to them that's gratuitously cruel likely only heightens their will to resist. So I think it works as if it actually would work as something counterproductive. So anyways, I want to leave this because we'll get back to this in detail later in the course. This is, like I said, this is just sort of a preview and it says I want to get your mind thinking about this other. Because the law, one of the things you see we don't take into account, and this is true in general psychology I think is we have a hard time coming to terms with more complex base motivations. Like we don't. We're not very good at conceptualizing things like a cleaning fee undertaken for aesthetic purposes.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       So we can't really come to grips with that. Like even when we talk about antisocial personalities, for example, we tend to. We don't tend to think about it in terms of some sort of. All the evil is being taken out of the personality. It's something that's just a matter of, uh, say heightened approach systems and reduced response to anxiety and so on. There's a whole set of complex motivations were not very good at like the desire to kill things to hurt things. We don't know how to deal with that or how they conceptualize it. Anyway. So we're going to talk about that, but there's also taken out of that also, right? The more complex positive, the complex positive, like maybe their desire to learn from pushing the borders. Possibly. Yeah. Okay. So the structure of scientific revolutions, I want you to read that because what killing discovered with regards to scientific revolutions, I think is just just get beyond good and evil.

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       Oh yes, I did. Okay. Beyond good and evil, I would like you to read because me and she wrote it after Western culture had moved into an intervening period of chaos as a consequence of the loss of its religious foundations. And so you could say that when there's, you know, the bouncing ball diagram, well, when Western culture, the religious presuppositions of western culture will were shattered. There was an intervening period of time where morality as such had unspecified, an unspecified reason for being a niche. He was trying to explore the nature of what used to be taken for granted, which was the existence of the religious structure and the possibilities for reconstructing an alternative morality. I suppose that would be rationally, irrationally comprehensive. I guess the reason I want you to read beyond good and evil war particularly those because reading that should do to you.

Speaker 1:          00:41:51       It's like an initiation ritual, I guess in a sense that's intellectually produced because nature, he said himself, he philosophize with a hammer. His point was to break down presuppositions. That's what he wanted to do for a defined end. He wanted to release the will power, I suppose, or to make people aware of it. And I would say what the will, the will to power could be most accurately conceptualized in terms of thing that allows people to continue continually erect structures of nod, break them down and redirect them. I think that's. That's what nature striving. Yeah. I mean it's difficult to see what he was driving out. So there'd be lots of debate about that. But beyond good and evil is, is useful to read for a number of reasons. First of all, you'll never find another book, I think in your whole life. That's so unfair.

Speaker 1:          00:42:36       It's so remarkable. Brilliant Nature said that he wanted to write in a sentence what other people could not write in a book. And I think that he accomplished that, particularly with beyond good and evil. Every sentence is a thought and most of the thoughts are brilliant and there are many books that have one thought in them and not even such a good thought. So it's also pretty useful from a stylistic perspective because nature was a master, a literary master and reading him can help clear up your thinking. She's amazingly clear thinker. So anyways, so those are the reasons for. He's also questioning, see nature, you said that he was the first philosopher who didn't set out a priority to prove that a particular morality that already existed was true. Like Nisha said, look up to me. Every western philosopher has worked within an established moral system and only attempted to justify it even though they didn't know that's what they were doing.

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       He thought that he was the first philosopher in history who is capable of saying of seeing that alternative realities existed everywhere and that's the fact of morality had become a problem. Why is the morality not which morality is right even or that are particular? Morality isn't necessarily right, but why is the morality and Ken, they're justifiably the morality? Is there any reason for presuming that the question, what is good and what is evil is even worth asking or answering or has any reasonable answer? Those are all questions he was attempting to address because Nietzsche believed, if you knock the god out of a religious system, which is a moral system that the entire moral system, therefore it no longer has any reason to exist, and if it has no reason to exist, it will disappear. Quite take hundreds of years, but it will disappear, and that's why he said God is dead and we have killed him. He also said to finish that phrase off, that we will have a difficult time finding enough water to wash away all the blood, which was his prophecy for the 20th century and the part of the quote that many people do not, don't realize. Photos. The first part, he was attempting to address the problem. If we lost our religious belief, so now what did we do for morality? So it's worth it's worth reading for a number of reasons. The structure of scientific revolutions, Thomas Kuhn, discovered,

Speaker 5:          00:45:07       don't be. Don't mean to imply by that, that before when we were in western society had thought there was any less fortunate.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       Yeah, well that's a complicated question because part of it's technical technologically technologically relate. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:45:25       Would that be right? No Way.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       I don't mean to imply that I don't think probably he meant to imply it either, but his point I think was more particularly that the demise of fixed religious systems would necessarily mean that the conflicts of the 20th century would be ideologically motivated, specifically ideologically motivated as annuity ologies rose up to try to occupy the territory. That previous ideology or religion really hasn't been any allergy because most of them, most of our religion is implicit and most of the ideologies exploits it. I think because someone actually wrote it down, call it Karma isn't, for example, is more likely to a sense more like a scientific system because all the presuppositions are actually are actually explicit, so I think there's some reason for distinguishing niche. You thought, well these new ideologies would necessarily rise up to who occupied the position of ideology and that we'd see more fair on a grand scale in Europe as a consequence of that.

Speaker 1:          00:46:26       So no, because it's not reasonable to say that. It's hard to say know because people compare what Stalin did, for example, in the name of videology, to what the Catholic Church didn't, Spain during the period of the inquisition. The inquisition was nowhere near as horrifying as the Stalinist purges, but it's difficult to tell if that's because the motivation different or because by the time of stolen the technology for implementing inquisition like procedures were so far advanced, so solzhenitsyn believed the Stalinist purges were worse than anything that had happened in Russia, his previous history under the czar and worse than this, the inquisition as well, but again, there's this complicating technology, so I don't know what to say about that. Precisely. I don't think people have probably changed that much, so have the people who ran the Spanish inquisition had access to the technology, the product just this horrible.

Speaker 1:          00:47:37       Okay. For the structure of scientific revolutions, Kuhn couldn't basically attempts to demonstrate that this bouncing ball diagram also applies in the scientific domain. That's not exactly right. He attempted to say that a process like this applied in the scientific domain without necessarily considering the fact that it might characterize all cognitive revolutions, including those that operate in the domain of morality. The reason I want you to read this book is because one of the risks of the approach that I take in this class is over reliance on a few sources. I tend to rely heavily on you, for example, and that's partly because they're the only people that I know who actually deal with this material. So I don't think it's so much narrower as just lack of options. But I wanted you to read Kuhn because you've. Well that way you can. That's a book that was very well received.

Speaker 1:          00:48:32       They made become world famous. It was published in I think 1960 in 1962. Um, I want you to see for yourself that these sorts of ideas appear relevant in other fields and have been discovered by other people who are working from entirely different, from entirely different set of presuppositions. And also because you have such a terrible academic reputation, which I can on and on actually understanding to, to allow you to see for yourself that an idea that made kill and world famous and in 1960 was positive 30 or 40 years earlier by you on a much broader scale and was as far as I can tell, more or less completely overlooked. I don't know why that is. Anyways, the devils. Okay. The Devil's paradise lost notes from the underground and the Gulag archipelago. I'll make a unit and the unit is a discussion of the negative aspect of the individual paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          00:49:41       This is the first time I've used this book in this course. Paradise lost is the story of the fall of the devil from having now what he tried to do while he tried to do two things, he said he was trying to justify the ways of God to man, which is an amazingly ambitious project. No, it's amazing that someone would take it upon themselves to too seriously conduct an enterprise like that. But also what he did was there's a kind of a, okay, remember I used the example and you say, if you want it to think about what art and mythology does with relationship to the construction of knowledge that you might think that if you think of culture as an island and the processes around the edge of the island being qualitatively different from those in the Middle Myth and art sort of circulate around outside, say as information goes more towards the center, tends to give, take more on the shape of Dogma or codified knowledge, and on the outside it's less, it's more amorphous and it seems to be contained more an image that's, that's my impression anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       Last verbal, more image. The farther out it isn't. Our at the farthest reaches its still behavior. It's in ritual and seemed invitation. Don't even really have an image of it yet. You just acted out. Not only can you not talk about it, you can't form an accurate image of it, but you can still act about. But anyways, what Milton did was to collect a myth that have formed around the central core of Christianity. And to give it a more or less formal structure and the math is the notion that there is a rebellion in heaven and that the devil fell. Who was God's highest angel? One of his two sons. I guess one. The other one being Christ say to be the oldest son rebelled against God in an attempt to occupy this position and was cast into hell. Oh, it's an interesting. It's a story that has always running around in my mind for some peculiar reason.

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       Lucifer means light, bringer, and Lucifer is the agent of consciousness, even in genesis. As far as that, that's my particular take on it anyway. As Lucifer is the serpent who gives both eve and Adam, the apple that makes them self conscious. He brings them to the light and the Bible represents that as a catastrophe. Obviously people get thrown out of paradise, but there's some split. There was apparently, according to young, there's even split in the Medieval Christianity, the the absolute negative quality of that particular event because it was also regarded as a fortunate error because the fact that Adam and Eve got kicked out of paradise provided the precondition for the necessary appearance of Christ who is a savior or hero. So anyways, I'm interested.

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       Look, Christianity took the discussion at the devil and his nature farther than any other form of religion has ever taken. The discussion of of evil could say that for us to conceptualize, say as a culture, we have been trying to abstract out from our general behaviors, the pattern that characterized as evil ever since we attempted to map who we were has a conscious endeavor. Which is to say that we've taken 10 tens of thousands of years to try to come to grips with the essential nature of the behavioral pattern, their attitude pattern that characterize as evil. You know, we obviously still don't have a very good verbal description of what that means because you can't just go up to your neighbor and say, you know, spoke me off a paragraph or two that will define the boundaries of behavior that would generally be recognized as evil. We don't know that you say.

Speaker 1:          00:53:33       You could say, well, I knew it when I see it, which means that it's still kind of implicit knowledge. I would say that the idea of the devil seemed to have derived from zero astrium religion. There's a garden zoroastrianism named her a Mazda and he has two sons whose names escape me. That was the first religion, and by the way, those are osteons also believed that the universe was engaged in an internal battle between the forces of good and evil and that they were basically balanced, which Christianity didn't, didn't exactly dog that. It's referring to this as well. The battle between good neat. Anyways, Christianity's things the end, he started fuel from the self is there, thereby leaving it to be repressed and. Well, it's something. Yeah, it's something that's. Well, the thing you know, there's a lot of sense in this story. What about original?

Speaker 1:          00:54:29       Well, yes, but it wasn't a young. One of the things that young find out was that the triumvirate of that the trinity are there. That is, that is God is really a fraternity. The debt and the devil attacks attempts to eliminate the evil from from the individual. Yeah. Well that was something that you can have a particular moment about boat, about Christianity with because he thought that he thought exactly what Christianity tended to view evil as the absence of God, whereas young tended to view it as a, as an actual presence in and of itself, something that was complex enough and solid enough so to speak, that you couldn't just account for it by the absence of something good and that was a, I suppose in medieval times that would be needed as a remarkably heretical state. So that was humans particular take on it, but there are good reasons for believing the opposite to the to to believe that evil can be understood as the absence of good.

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       That's a real logical argument to. I don't think it's one that you'll give enough credence to that is that it's still your presentation is what he thought. Anyways, let's get back to this myth Lucifer's associated with rationality in Christian mythology, and the reason I want you to read paradise lost is because I think what paradise lost is about, and this is, I don't know, this is pure speculation on my part, is certainly about something that we know people have been working on building that myth for a long, long, long time. It's about something but what it's about, and I doubt very much if it's a description of empirical reality. So it's about something else and what that meant says is that the highest angel in God's kingdom, which I would view as something as a description of an interest psychic state, the place where there are spirit, so to speak, attempted to you serve God's position which is characterized by omnipotent, omniscient, omnipotent, and uh, it was pretty.

Speaker 1:          00:56:36       The other one is three cardinal attributes of God should omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, right? Said, I can occupy the position of God instantly. He's inhale. Now, I think what that means, and this is something that from northrop prior also commented on was the say, if you think of the development of rationality, Cuban rationality, which is one of the things that necessarily distinguishes us from the animals in which western culture has put more stress on than any other culture. I think that can be reasonably portrayed from the mythological perspective as the highest angel in God's heavenly kingdom, so to speak. Think about that as the description of an inter psychic hierarchy. What that says, that what that says is that if rationality construct something and then attempts to make of it a god, instantly everything around it will turn into something that resembles hail 10. It's a story about.

Speaker 1:          00:57:34       I think it's a story about the dangers of authoritarian presumption, so I want you to read it in the context of these other works and you can make your own judgment about that. Which is to say, look, all it is is to say this. If you construct the system of belief with your rational faculties and then make up that system, something that has all the attributes of God, then what will necessarily happen because you're completely opaque to any anomalous information, is that within a brief span of time, everything around you will turn into a wasteland and also that all you have to do to get out of it is admitting that you're wrong, which is one of the things that happens to milk Satan by the way, all he has to do to get out of where he is is admit that he was wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       That's it, but he won't do that. So I would rather I'd rather rule inhaled and serve in heaven and I, I think from my perspective as a clinical psychologist, that that's the most accurate representation of neurotic personality that I've ever encountered. So that's exactly the situation. Just like you're doing something that follows up your life, you'd rather do that than change specifically as you because you're the master of it. That's right. It's knowing what we know how that works. It's unknown territory, isn't it? Because you don't have to. You don't have to go through this process, for example, to stay there. It might be miserable and it's gonna get worse all the time and it will get as bad as it can possibly be. Oh, you have to do. To get rid of it is to pause that. If you stepped outside of it's something good might happen, but you won't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:59:06       So is that what you mean when you talk about Communist Roger? Yes, absolutely. That's an idea. That's exactly it. If you think of that though, it's difficult within the domains of rationality during depression, ality. Yeah, way. Well, that's not necessarily the case level. I'll give you right away. We're talking about the relative importance of phenomena. So let's let's look at it this way. Say what your rationality does this help you make sense of phenomena that you encountered, but it is not necessarily the thing that propels you forward to the place where you'll find something to make sense out of. I would say that so I would say that your rationality is doing a proper job, which means that it's in the right place in the hierarchy values. If it's always serving the tendency to go out and make order out of chaos. Now if you. That's not rationality, that's something else. That's the thing that makes rationality useful. Right? But if your rationality and then it sort of follows, but you wouldn't understand this, you wouldn't necessarily like it. That's right. Well, you don't necessarily want the subordinate position. It's something that's very relevant to western culture because I believe this is the case. I hope this is true. I believe that after the French revolution, one of the first things that happened was the erection of a statue to the goddess of reason in Notre Dame cathedral. Does anybody know if that's true?

Speaker 1:          01:00:31       I think that was one of the immediate post revolutionary acts, but it's very. It's very symbolic. I think because the French Revolution was one of the first extra religious movements in western culture understands the attempt to put reason up on the highest pedestal and there's a problem with that. And that's the problem that Milton, I think was wrestling with and said, well, yeah, you know, rationalities a good master, good servant, but it's a terrible master. So then the question is what's supposed to be the master? Now, the thing that's interesting about this is there's, there's a line of mythology and Christianity that sort of points out that this is vague again and there's no canonical basis board as far as I know, but the, uh, that the, that Satan was the gods, oldest son who was passed over in favor of the youngest son who was Christ.

Speaker 1:          01:01:19       And that's a common mythological theme by the way, that the passing over of the older and wiser son and in favor of the younger and more questionable son, that's part of the, that's part of the mythology, the trickster. But anyways, the point is here is that rationality. It's supposed to serve the as opposed to certainly hero and not to constrain it. So you can say it's supposed to be subordinate, supposed to be a subordinate process, and as soon as it's known as supportive process, which means as soon as it says, what I have created is everything that's necessary, then it then it. While that's tantamount to this revolution in heaven, this is my spot. No, no, no, no. That's, that's a really good observation because star trek is pure mythology to boldly go where no man has ever gone, no one now,

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       but that's. That's right, because it's a well constructed and spock is subordinate to the irrationalities of the human beings. That's right, and the drive and the drive to explore. Right. Great. Great. Very Fun. They also has pointed ears and have a of data, right? Right. Rationale, rationale, all knowing, all knowing is the big thing as far as I'm concerned with regards to radiology, because that's what an ideology does, right? If you're an authoritarian, although you. Sorry, go ahead. Talking about religion might be trying to tell about his or her place within a community. I'm trying to lead into that in today's discussion, and this is all sort of preliminary material, but most of the last half of the course talks about this, this relationship, which is what you're trying. What's the. What's the proper balance between the individual and that culture?

Speaker 5:          01:03:40       Is the idea that religion is supposed to liberate the individual. How. Okay. Given that line of reasoning, what, what would you use as the definition of self? The Ego in another words that that everything is within my own self. Everything I see and what's real, what I see is real. What you may see is not necessarily right because I'm operating within myself. The idea of liberation from the prisons. I mean that would. I think in part the problem is is that there's two aspects to the systems as a general rule, there's the aspect that socializes and then there's the aspect that attempts to transcend the consequences of socialization and they tend to work at cross purposes. That's why one of the stories you'll read later in the manuscript is edited it down. Dostoevsky story, the grand inquisitor and then the grand inquisitor. Christ comes back to Earth and he runs into the inquisitive who says, who in prisons prison immediately we're going to kill you. You established this, but now that it's here, you shouldn't come back to mess it up. Fine. The next day when he was supposed to kill him, he lets him go out the back door. Well, that's regarded as sort of as the pinnacle of Dostoyevsky's literary achievement. A particular story, and it is a brilliant story because it basically says that, well, and this is

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       mostly with regards to the Catholic church, that religion necessarily has to impose a structure. It has to because if there's no structure, there's no protection, but in order to maintain that structure, it has to allow the process that creates it in order to exist, at least to the degree that it can continue to update the structure and that's like. That's exactly dead on. Relevant to your question with regards to the proper role of the relationship, proper role of the individual with regards to culture. It's the same relationship that the Pharaoh, how do you need you to society. You're supposed to embody the culture and I would think in part the notion of the prison of the self is partly the idea that you embodied the culture which is that you swallowed the particular morality and the ways and the means that your culture says to act, but then there's this other part which says, yeah, you are that endure necessarily that, but you're also the thing that created that and the thing that can update it. When when necessary,

Speaker 5:          01:06:21       you also swallowed religion, which creates, and I'm not necessarily sure that religion was free. No Man from the south because it creates a suffolk.

Speaker 1:          01:06:31       Well, it depends. It depends. I mean it because you have to send. Okay. This leads in directly to what we were going to decide what we were going to discuss today because I, I, I titled the Chapter That We're discussing today apprenticeship that inculturation and that has to do with the adoption of a shared map and so the issue is going to look at this particular diagram. I want to read you something again. I'll get to this one sec. I just wanted to finish going through these books. The last three books have to do with alchemy and they ultimately is a discussion. Humans writing something with me anyways or discussion of a collection of 2000 years of symbols. The yellow thought illustrated that process, which is the process of radical re adaptation. So I want to read you something for me. It's kind of long, but I want you to listen to it carefully. This is from the navel and if you want, if you listened to this, then you'll also know why I want you to read beyond good and evil because the whole book is like this, not just this particular.

Speaker 1:          01:07:40       Every morality is as opposed to letting oneself go, a bit of tyranny against nature also against reason, but this in itself is no objection as long as we do have some other morality which permits us to decree that every kind of tyranny and unreasonable is impermissible what is essential and didn't ask to mobile in every morality because they've. It constitutes a long compulsion to understand stoicism or puritanism. One should recall the compulsion or whichever language so far has achieved strength and freedom. The metrical compulsion of rhyme and rhythm. Okay, so what Nietzsche is trying to say, there's

Speaker 1:          01:08:29       that there's a necessary relationship between morality and slavery. To adopt any particular viewpoint means to exclude all other viewpoints, but also that having done so, having adopted one limited viewpoint means the possibility to develop all sorts of skills that you might not otherwise be able to develop. So it uses the metaphor. Poetry says, look what a poet does to produce poetry and to develop the language is to put way more constraint on his or her domain of action than is normally the case and paradoxically, as a consequence of applying this constraint, something is created instead of just being repressed. So you say you don't have to only allow yourself to write in rhyme and rhythm. It's much more difficult to do that which you might say would constitute a barrier to achievement, but Nietzsche is pointing out that it is in fact the position of those constraints that constitutes the precondition for freedom.

Speaker 1:          01:09:29       So he's making a strange, strange claim that under in some contexts of interpretation, slavery as a necessary precondition for freedom go. Then the question is, you better understand the context in which that's true and the context in which that's not great and we'll but we'll get to that later. How much trouble the poets and orators of all peoples have taken, not accepting a few prose writers today and who's he are there dwells in exhaustible conscience for the sake of some foolishness as utilitarian adults say, feeling smart, submitted abjectly to capricious laws as anarchists, say, feeling free or even free spirited, but the curious fact is that all there is or has it been on earth of freedom, subtlety, boldness, dance and masterly. Sharing this weather in thought itself or in government or in the rhetoric and persuasion in the arts, just as an ethics has developed only owing to the tyranny of such capricious laws.

Speaker 1:          01:10:32       Every artist knows how far from any feeling of letting himself go. His most natural state is the free ordering, placing, disposing, giving form in the moment of inspiration and how strictly and suddenly he obeys thousand fold laws precisely then laws that precisely on account of their hardness and determination defy all formulation through concepts. Even the firmest concept is compared with them not free of fluctuation, multiplicity, and then, but the other thing that needs she's pointing out there, and this is an example of how, how decades of thought that are still to come are embedded in his sentences. Law, is that precisely on account of their hardness and determination, defy all formulation through concepts. He's saying, well, when you were free as an artist, your acting according to precepts that are inviolable, that are so archaic that you can't even say what they are. They're still implicit, still implicit, right? They're still procedural. What is essential in heaven and earth seems to be to say once again that there should be obedience over a long period of time and in a single direction given that something worthwhile always develops and has developed for whose sake it is worthwhile to live on earth.

Speaker 1:          01:11:51       For example, virtue art, music, dance reason, spirituality, something transfiguring, subtle Nad and divine. The long unfreedom of the spirit. The mistrustful constraint in the communicability of thoughts. The disciplined thinkers imposed on themselves to think within the directions laid down by a church or a court or under era's Tutelian presuppositions, the long spiritual will to interpret all events under a Christian Schema and to rediscover and justify the Christian God and every accident. All of this, however, forced capricious hard, gruesome and anti rash has shown itself to be the means through which the European spirit has been trained to strength, ruthless curiosity and subtle mobility, although admittedly in the process and irreplaceable amount of strength and spirit had to be crushed, stifled in the room that for thousands of years of European thinkers thought merely in order to prove something

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       today. Conversely, we suspect everything or who wants to prove something, that the conclusions that aren't to be the result of the most rigorous reflections were always settled from the start, just as it use to be with Asiatic astrology and still is today with the innocuous Christian moral interpretation of our most intimate personal experiences. This tyranny, this Capris, this rigorous and grandiose stupidity because educated the spirit. Slavery is as it seems, both in the cruder and in the more subtle sense, the indispensable means of spiritual discipline and cultivation to consider any more, lot with this in mind, what there is in it of nature, teaches hatred of just letting go of any all to great freedom and implants, the need for limited horizons and the nearest tasks, teaching the narrowing of perspective, and that's in a certain sense, stupidity. As a condition of life and growth, you shall obey someone in for a long time or else you will perish and lose the last respect for yourself. This appears to me to be the categorical imperative of nature, which is not addressed to the individual, but to people's races, ages and classes above all, to the whole human animal to ma'am. Brilliant. That's a brilliant page as far as I'm concerned. What's he saying in your question? What's the proper relationship with individual in culture with regards to you say, well, what's what? I wrote this, this diagram on the board here.

Speaker 1:          01:14:34       The unknown is both negative and positive

Speaker 1:          01:14:40       and the culture is both negative and positive. Say you have to have a culture because the culture brings predictability to the objects that you encounter and to all of your interpersonal interactions. You have to have that because that in its absence, everything is so chaotic that you cannot actually exist. That's the literal, the literal truth. Your culture regulates your emotions. You can't just give it up, but if someone comes along with a different idea and that different idea, if you accepted it would upset your whole culture. Well, you can't just accept that idea, but the alternative to accepting it often seems to be to attempt to destroy the person who brings the new information. And the problem with that is that now we're so heavily armed that if one camp attempts to destroy the other camp, the overwhelming likelihood is the both will disappear. So on the one hand you can't just get rid of your culture because someone else comes along and says, that's not the way to do things, but you can't do what we've always done in the past either which has have a war about it and said, well, who's going to rule what territory?

Speaker 1:          01:15:52       So then the question is, well, given those two options, as theoretically the only two options, and then both the both the outcomes of those two options or negative well, what's left to do well, that's a real difficult question. That's a paradox as far as I'm concerned. Well, this diagram has speaks to that to some degree, say nature is pointing out that in order to be able to do anything, you have to restrict what it is that you're going to do to a narrow domain. This is the notion of an apprenticeship. So if you want to become, let's say a classical pianists, would they say to become a classical pianist, you need 20,000 hours of practice before the age of 18 to become a concert. That's assuming you have the, you know, the innate ability, which basically means if you have to exclude from your life any number of things that would have occupied those $20,000 alternatively, and that you have to subjugate all of your diverse individuality to this extraordinarily narrow range of, of action.

Speaker 1:          01:16:58       But the theory is that having voluntarily subjugating yourself to a set of arbitrary and fixed rules, because the rules that make up music are in many ways arbitrary and fixed, that if you master that territory, then you'll come out the other side with all of those skills at your disposal and then with the capacity to do something that actually constitutes free to have with them. So the notion of the apprenticeship is the long sub voluntary subjugation of the spirit followed by the capacity to create a masterpiece. You know the word masterpiece that signifies the end of an apprenticeship right now. It's even though I suppose where the master's degree came from, is that a masterpiece indicates that you are now free from the tyranny of the person to whom you were bound. It means that you've absorbed everything they know, plus you've added to what they knew and transmitted to you. Something that's uniquely yours that justifies the entire subjugation.

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       Well, that's that for me, that seems to be the way out the of this cultural paradox because that's an apprenticeship model of adolescence. I think that group identity is the construction and strengthening of group identity is the appropriate developmental stage for adolescents that it has to be gone through and this gets rid of some of. I think some of the more annoying aspects of standard humanistic psychology says you have to accept as a precondition that subjugate yourself to a set of rules that a lot of what you are is going to not be developed in the process because you always sacrifice possibility for actuality if you pursue any actuality, but the hope is that you'll come out the other side with whatever is used still in tact and it seems to me that.

Speaker 1:          01:19:01       Well that gives you the benefits of both situations. If you say the purpose of culture is to predict, protect the individual who's no longer a child from the negative aspect of the unknown. Say children are dependent on their, on their mother, so to speak. Initially as they grow, they start to encounter problems in living that their mother can no longer solve. Example hundred. Both conditions like in our culture. If you're a male and you're 14 and your brother is still trying to solve the problem of finding someone to date for you, something seriously has gone wrong because she's attempting to extend her domain of protection past it's logical bounce, which is to say the psychoanalysts used to refer to that as the necessary failure of the mother. Anyways. The point is is that as you grow up, life starts to present to you problems that weren't there to begin with, that your other campaign and what moves in fill the gap before you're fully mature is is the processes associated with group identification.

Speaker 1:          01:20:14       So it's like. I think it's a bridging bridging mechanism. I think the problem that we face as a race in a sense is that we're stuck at an adolescent level of of adaptation is that people even still view the identification with the culture, which is essentially the adoption of a patriotic stance. That's when we're looking at it as the highest level of possible obtained insurance people never individually. Well, that's rarely enough. So that being stuck at the level of cultural identification still poses a major constant threat to her poses a constant threat. So not a blanket statement, obviously, right? Not a blanket statement because. But I guess the. I guess the idea of perhaps is that well at least that something beyond mere adequate group identification might realistically be posited as an ideal without, without necessarily undermining the idea that group identification as a developmental stage is absolutely necessary and that it has to be gone through.

Speaker 1:          01:21:26       Like I mean you see people who, who never made the transition to group identity, which means that they remain dependent on their mother. That's A. There's a whole category of personality disorder for that. That's dependent personality disorder. They don't even make the first transition. People who get through the group identification process, I think very often are those who actually mastered it. So they have gone through an apprenticeship, which means they've allowed themselves to be subjugated to the group identity and have absorbed all the discipline and possibility that that subjugation subjugation allows me to send you. Some people do manage to reach to go beyond that stage without having very much group identification managed to reach the estate reach individuation without going through a great deal. Okay. Okay. Can you think of an example of that? Because I'm not convinced that that's the case. I think that these.

Speaker 1:          01:22:26       I think that this is an invariant developmental stage that you can make the. I don't think you can make the lead on and I shouldn't say never, but I don't think that under most circumstances you can make the leap from childhood to adulthood without this intervening inculturation, which is mostly group foster because it's then that you learn, for example, as an adolescent, that's when you learn how to cope with people in groups and how to and how to to act as the responsible member of the culture. Say once you've got that skill, then you can go beyond it, but if you don't have it, well it seems to me that that provides a pretty vicious impediment to your continued progress or do you think think could you get them at

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       more or less at the same time? I mean, I'm someone who is not particularly socially capable until they, until they become self capable and I think, I mean I think most, most kids go from there go from being children to being members of a group and then if they're lucky they move beyond that. But uh, what about people who go from go from children to being, to being essentially sort of doing nothing and then building, doing both at the same time? I mean because sometimes if you have, if you have a little enough social ability you can, you can be very vulnerable or are outcast from the, from the sort of group situation but at the end. But at the same time there are people who are in that situation and we'll also who have a fair amount of self competence but, but no social competence. Do you see what I.

Speaker 1:          01:24:01       well, I was thinking about about possible exceptions to this. I guess I would say perhaps that if someone is popped out of the group, I identification game because they're pursuing an interest that's unique to them. That it's possible that the continued development of the interest might lead to to to a proper establishment of an adult as an adult, but I would also say that it's inappropriate to presume that group identification necessarily mean something that happens at the normal level of adolescent behavior, which is. I'm not saying necessarily that to make the gap, to make the jump from childhood to adulthood, it's necessarily to associate with a gang of peers like in this a sort of classic adolescent mode. I would also say for example, that if you're interested in something like say you're really good at the violin, that might be an example. If you have a particular talent, your peer group then becomes all those people who've had that talent in the past who's process of adaptation you're imitating and mimicking to develop your skills to move towards the point where you're going to be an individual in your old.

Speaker 1:          01:25:09       Right? So for us, I mean this is especially true for people who are, who are abstractly capable. Your peer reference group might be the group that you find in books because that's where the group identity has been abstracted into ideas. It doesn't necessarily like, especially in a culture as complex as ours, there are peer groups who you can identify with at every level of functional analysis. There are groups that are based purely on a purely on ideas. There are groups that are based more explicitly on shared patterns of activity, so. But I would still say that to get from the point of being a child to the point of being an adult, there has to be this intermediate intermediary process. I think culturation you can choose, you can pick and choose what that's going to be, but you need a framework like say, so

Speaker 4:          01:25:59       if you. If you were operating, if you're someone who is capable enough in something, the semantic, the main may never make it back to procedures essentially, which is.

Speaker 1:          01:26:08       Well, I think that would also be a mistake as a general rule,

Speaker 4:          01:26:12       but. Right, but it. But it can happen. Yeah, I think it does. Well, what you said about books, you have to be a representation of that. Is that some mean someone who's maybe maybe socially uncomfortable, but I don't really use it reads a great deal when you were saying that they're essentially getting

Speaker 1:          01:26:32       sure. Sure, of course they are. It's just the thing. The group they're identifying with his speed abstracted into into some maybe their peer group may be people who are mostly dead who live only in books, which is not necessarily such a bad peer reference group. Depends on your. Although I would also say that the inability to deal with the living so to speak sooner or later is going to constitute it is likely going to constitute a problem. I mean it might not be a fatal error, but it's still going to be a problem and even somebody who was as a. What would you say, socially isolated as Nietzsche, especially in the latest part of his life later part of his life. He still wrote, I mean the desire to be part of the community. It's very paramount even among people who are very individualistic and it's also the case that the hero is not the person who discovers the goal, gets the gold from the dragon and then wanders off up into the hill.

Speaker 1:          01:27:25       The hero is the person who gets the gold and then it goes back to the community so that that presupposes the capacity to make the knowledge that's been gathered on the individual route, accessible to the community and the skills that allow that to occur. So it sorta seems different to be dealing with the representation of the group than with a group itself. Yeah, right. Definitely the whole interaction, the demands, the whole thing seemed to be pretty sure there's all sorts of other things that come into play when you're actually dealing with a person because then it's a two way. I mean then you have to give back as well as receive, which seems like a part of what you're describing. This process of acculturation. Right? Right. And there's other things that come into play to like sexual tensions and, and dominance, hierarchy maneuvering and, and all sorts of other things that, that to be part of a community you have to master.

Speaker 3:          01:28:16       Yeah. Um, I'd always thought of. Well, I think that that's just the way I see it is. Um, so I've always been, will be probably a freshman in college. I always thought that details aren't important, so like to look at that, what you're saying as a cake, I always went for the frosty and instead of instead of like the base of the cake and I think that it's possible to, to still add to, to get a feel for the team. Um, but in my experience as an Undergrad, I think that, that knowing the details or, or going through this is downward process. Um, I don't know if it, if it makes for a steeper slope, but it does allow you to get. There's this, there's this level here that you just can't get to without, without this.

Speaker 1:          01:29:09       Okay. So now I want you to tie that more concretely into the discussion that we just have.

Speaker 3:          01:29:15       Okay. Um, with, with him, yeah. Okay. So what it seems to me, what you're saying, I don't know, is, is possibly that it's, that you don't understand, they, you, you're getting a feel for the, for the case, for the frosting. Um, and you're saying that maybe you don't need to have a group, um, to, to have to grow on this individuality. You can have a mix on it. Um, but what I take you to be saying is that you need to have, you need to, you need to know the group fully before you can go to the highest level of industry.

Speaker 1:          01:29:49       Yeah. Mike, I guess the way to specify this could be to say that isn't ignore the county fair, fair enough. Fair enough. I don't want them to think the don't have the capacity to interact in a group that's composed of knowledge that's implicit and tacit as well as explicit. Then if you only go for the explicit knowledge, then you risk missing the tacit knowledge. That's the stuff that's been so embodied say non verbal behavior, but people seem to have different levels of ability of transforming explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge. I mean different, different willingness to do that. Yeah, I mean the interplay between the, the memory systems, the ability to go down the hierarchy as well. Is that right? Great. Well we often don't think down and is necessary. Right, and I think that's because we take the attitude that you just described is that if you know that if you know the words, you don't have to know the music, you don't have to know how to put it into action.

Speaker 1:          01:30:46       I think that's. I think that's part of the reason that actually by the way that the general public in the USA, for example, holds intellectuals in content is because we think the fact is the is the knowledge and that's when you can act out the fact you're an idiot. That's why I like woody Allen movies actually because woody Allen's characters are just so stuffed full of facts that it's appalling. Almost completely useless because they haven't made the transition down the hierarchy. That's right. That's right. Are they confused? I think what they confuse his knowledge with wisdom, it's like, and that's what academics do in general, what intellectual students we think because we know facts that were smart and that's dumb because knowing useless facts, that's stupid. Yeah. What about gender bumps or. So another question about to what extent if there's inculturation is like necessarily like, would you say that in order to be successful artists and do something new, you would have to understand all our thinking before you or could you like sort of working in isolation still do something?

Speaker 1:          01:31:52       Okay, well look, that's a tough question because when you're working in isolation you're not working in isolation because like say by the time you're 20 or 21 or whatever and you're working in isolation, your, your head so to speak, is already stuffed full of your culture and many of the things that you discover, you're actually just remembering like it's already the presuppositions that I remember. Let me give you an example. The first political science class I took when I was 17, I wrote an essay with a friend of mine that outline the wheat. We outline the preconditions for an ideal state. We thought this was very original piece of work and we handed this to the professor and the next week we studied John Stuart Mill and John Locke and everything we had written down was in their writings and I never read John Stewart neuro or John Law, but the point is is that what they said 400 years ago, it's so much part of everything that we do that even if you don't know, you know it.

Speaker 1:          01:32:52       So then if you start thinking about what, what constitutes the ideal, well he ended up doing is recapitulating what's already been done. So. So that's, that's like one answer to your question. The other answer is I would say in general, keeping in mind Nietzsche's objections that the more you know about what people did before you, the greater your chance of going somewhere that no one has ever done before. Because otherwise you risk reinventing the wheel. And it really. And in a way that's inefficient. Like Einstein, I think it was Einstein, he said, I can see so far because I stood on the shoulders of giants and that's, that's a reference to the Einstein was a revolutionary, I mean, but he still said despite the fact that I'm a revolutionary and I undermined my ancestors so to speak, the only reason I ever got there is because I knew exactly what they do.

Speaker 1:          01:33:41       I do. That's the way to go about it. One of, one of the things that seems to be some, it's awkward to talk about this because we think independence is good and dependency is bad and interdependent sort of is some sort of a liminal condition. I mean, we don't quite know what to do with in our culture. It seems to me that some of the unease of that, this is related to that, but I actually wanted to ask about gender difference in relation to this process we're talking about and whether that's significant. Um, I don't. My guess is that at a, at a fundamental level, I would say probably not. Whether there's, where were you thinking about gender differences in relationship to the, the group connection, that group experience and what the group experience is like an adolescent? Oh, I think there are probably gender differences in adolescence.

Speaker 1:          01:34:38       Partly because women hit puberty like two years earlier than men do. I think that that makes quite a quite a big difference. So there are groups get fragmented earlier about what difference that makes. I don't know, but I would suspect that it's a severe enough difference to, to, to have some at least short term implications. I mean girls hit puberty at 12 or 13, 14 and two years later for boys, so by the time boys have to deal with all that, there are two years older and have two years more experience. Also, I think what happens to girls peer relationships is that when they hit puberty, they start associating immediately with older boys two or three years older. Of course then they're immediately put in a, at least at temporarily subordinate position and they don't get a chance to develop their peer network groups quite to the same degree. Whereas boys have to kind of do that by default, maybe when they're 13 or whatever, they'd rather be associated with girls have their own age, but the girls will have anything to do with them, so it was like while they're off, they're off together by default. I don't know what that means in the final analysis.

Speaker 5:          01:35:45       I'm thinking subjectively that making powerful gender differences in the entire story all along the line. Just that could be a topic that might come back to it at the end of the. Yeah. Well if you have ideas about that that you know, that would be a really useful topic for an essay, for example, if you want to explore that more thoroughly because the gender issue is. Well first of all there is gender problem, so to speak. He looked at classical religious, western religious traditions. There's big gender issues occurring there all the time. The central figure in Christianity is male and this is. This is troublesome for even from the perspective of ritual invitation, it's troublesome. You also. It also does seem to me the case, they didn't mythology as a general rule, the figure of the hero is represented as masking so and I don't know what that means for for it doesn't mean that heroes are map.

Speaker 5:          01:36:41       It certainly doesn't mean that in a sense it does because you have to ask to ask about the culture. Your culture is represented as the great father and right to think that we have a patriarchal culture in the west. I think we've talked about individual stories and there are some very important developmental differences between boys and girls that I think we're the last, maybe in the seventies and eighties we weren't willing to investigate, but now maybe we are in the field of psychology and one of those is that boys have to need their mothers girls. Right? Right. And a lot of the themes of the course in terms of the terror like your nephew, he's terrifying dreams of having to go out on its own and here or having to leave and having to kill his mother. All of these seem to be very tied into this masculine experience of having to leave. One's mother, for example, in a lot of monkey colonies, the unveils how often it's two girls, right? The girls don't have to leave. I think very different developmental perspective. It doesn't mean it goes to get along with them. Others, it just means you never expected to make that break. Boys are. You never put in that same position and I think that it's also the case boy's initiation.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       Rituals tend to be much more violent than dramatic than those girls and I think you've said, I think it is very much for this reason because there a break that there's a more severe break that necessarily has to be made or this has. This has really profound implications for the constructions of ideals too because it seems to me, this is my own personal opinion of course, but it seems to me that the feminist movement, especially in the sixties and seventies, miss the boat in some regards, bike presuming that the male pattern of development and construction of the patriarchal society necessarily constituted an ideal form of behavior and one that women would do well to emulate. I mean, you can say that separately from saying

Speaker 5:          01:38:36       from, from. You can say that separately. Well, I'm not so sure about that. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:38:45       okay. I mean this, this is an issue obviously, that there's, there's all sorts of area for debate, but that's my general impression. So anyways, it's just an absolutely useful, useful topic and I don't know how to address it from. One of the things that's interesting with regards to this though is that it's not so much the case in this class, but most of us students

Speaker 5:          01:39:06       were women and the appeal of his writing has generally been to women. No, I don't. Why that is exactly. I think that's more here relates to extract information and I think that has to do a lot with like the historical moment. I think that women and men experienced our historical moment, adolescent funimation identity in such different ways. Like due to a large project managers yanked away from their mothers, his boys and then they have to go through this initiatory. Right? And then they see women no longer his mother but his mate, you know, for reproduction to Marin and perpetuate society or whatever. So the point being is that not only j, they have very different experiences so that like the feminist movement, you know, you can't parallelize the woman's experience to a man's experience so that like the way young interprets, you know, life is just, it's more effective to a woman because, you know, he deals with women are socialized in much different ways that you can deal with issues relating much more to a women as a woman does, where history is like, you know, historically dominated by men and man creates history.

Speaker 5:          01:40:20       So what do you think it is about his writings and make making in particular more attractive to women? I mean, they're, I mean, they're so interesting to me. They're just fascinating because I think it's just because it's more, um, I don't know, maybe you know, you're sold or you know, it's just, it's not really something you can articulate very well. But, um, I guess just his references to um,

Speaker 1:          01:40:44       well, you, you believe that you don't believe that the idea of thinking of how things were connected was more intrinsically attracted women than the idea of things of how things are different. And the masculine consciousness has a discriminative quality which cuts things into pieces and I think that might be. I think that might because males are more bilaterally split in there hemisphere as well. I mean, I don't know. I don't know that the idea that that represents. I mean I know that that's not, that's somewhat speculative in terms of physiology, but the, the idea of the strength of the masculine identity with the semantic system. Well that's a, that's a possibility. I mean, if I was going to speculate in their direction, that's probably the path down which I would go. So what's that? Smaller? Yeah, I think that's. I think that's the case. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:41:33       One other thing, I just wanna I to pop some ideas out with relationship to this before we close out the class because I really want you to think about this because this is important. Um, look, you know, if you're, if you're searching for information about how to behave well, that's a search for wisdom. And the question that sort of underlies the search for wisdom is an internal philosophical question. Then the question is what is the good. And I try to make something of this and this manuscript because I think that posing the question in that way has caused us a lot of trouble. Now I would say that like if you're here, okay, so mom's gone, you know you're not a child anymore and you can't, she can't solve your problems anymore. And that has, that's just the way it is. You're too big. So then you're here in this chaotic intermediary position and someone comes along and this is what initiation rituals do.

Speaker 1:          01:42:27       They tear the boys and the women all cry because the boys are gone and when they come back they're going to be again. And that's the truth. So when they acquitted, they cried, they made it. The boys are taken out away from their mother and they're terrified half to death, which is basically what happens to marines. We need to put through bootcamp. And then for precisely the same raises, it's like you're no longer child will put you through the ringer. Your old identities. No, it has to be killed. We'll kill it because it's better than it dies now than that. It hangs around with 20 years torturing, which is what it would do otherwise, so we'll just scare the hell out of you and put you in a very suggestible state and what would have suggested estate paid? Well, I would say I'm going to strip away all your past beliefs and put you in a situation you've never been in before, which is to say you've always been afraid of the dark, but mom was always there, so now I'm going to do is find the darkest and most frightening place that I can possibly imagine and I'm going to put you in it, and that's what people do and initiation ceremonies.

Speaker 1:          01:43:22       It's like, here's a. here's a case. You don't know what the hell is in it. Maybe there's a monster. In fact, there is one that your imagination is put there and it's the worst monster you can think of. That's where you're going, so we're going to put you in there till till you discover that although you feel that you're going to go crazy, you won't. That's your heightened state of suggestibility is I'm in a place where nothing makes sense and put me because I've never felt this before. What do I want? I want an answer. Well, that's when inculturation of course, it's like you're no longer a child. Here's the mysteries of the tribe. That's your new story. That's brainwashing. We proceeded so you're all chaotic. You want me to story including one that will cover everything that you just experienced. Someone comes along and hands it to you on a silver plate.

Speaker 1:          01:44:08       You take it in, that's your inculturation. So now you're an adult and your standard bear of the community. So you could say, well, the question here is being a child is no longer an answer to your problem. So the next problem is what is the good? And that's conceived of as a concrete question and their answer is our culture. So that's where the human being Smith and many cultures, the word many cultures used for the members of that culture is the word that's the equivalent to human, which is that if you're from this culture, you're human. If you're from another culture, but whatever you are isn't human. For me, it's something that's sort of looks like but partakes more of the domain of novelty than of the domain of the encountered. So given culture is a specific answer to the general question. What is the good, and it's the question that's answered when you make the transition from childhood to adolescence.

Speaker 1:          01:45:06       We know that, that an answer to the question, what is the goodest troublesome say in the Old Testament, for example, it says, shouldn't make an idol out of God. That's right. No graven images. And why is that? Because you shouldn't confuse the abstract thing with the concrete thing and the problem with the question, what is the good, which is a question that western philosophy is being trained to address 4,000 years, is that it presumes that there is an answer to a question like that, which is to say that in the way the question is phrased, there's an implicit presumption that it can be answered in that form and I would say that when you adopt a group identity, that's what you've answered, but there is a better question and it's the question that you answered when you make it to the next step. So you say, well, chaos group identification, Bang, that's your solution.

Speaker 1:          01:45:54       What is the good? Well, here's a whole bunch of rules, right? Those are concrete representations of how you should behave and what constitutes good and evil from a particular perspective, but then there's another question that might rear its ugly head later, which is a much more profound question and that is the question. What is the nature of the process? By which answers to the question, what is the good are formulated, right? It's a medical question, it says not what's the answer to the question, but what's the nature of the procedure that you engage in when you're answering the questions which you really have to know because the question what is the good shifts with environmental circumstance, which is to say that what's good for you one day is not necessarily good for you the next day or what's good for your culture now like do it in 100 years.

Speaker 1:          01:46:43       So if you answered the question, what is the good with an answer, then you've already made an error because the answer presupposes that there isn't permanent answer to that question and that's wrong. So I would say when you get to this level of the whole system, which is the next stage beyond your cultural identification, what you're looking for, is it a description of the process that leads you to be able to answer questions of the sort? What is when you have to update them constantly. And so I would say that why do you identify with when you moved to here is the process by which these structures are actually January. So it's the process that you read stories itself and that that gives you all the wisdom that you already have as a consequence of your cultural identification with the additional knowledge that you're also the one that builds the stories.

Speaker 1:          01:47:40       That's where your central point of identification can be. So then if you say you're involved in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in settling a dispute between people from two different cultural positions. And the thing is, you know, you know that person a and person b are both exemplary representatives of their particular culture, but they're at odds with one another. So then the question then is, well, what constitutes common ground? Because you need a position. Remember we were asking and wondering what's the, what's the issue? Here's one story. Here's another. They're not the same as a consequence like traveling is breaking out. Well we don't know what going to maneuver over here where there are no rules. It's great because neither side excepts the rules on the other side. So then the question is, well, what are the rules that allow you to maneuver when you're outside the place that there are rules?

Speaker 1:          01:48:33       And I would say, well, I would hope that I could appeal to you on a general basis and as someone who's not only an exemplar of the culture as specified territory, but an exemplar of those members of the culture who had enough courage to construct the culture to begin with, and that's the place where we hope to operate. And then I would also hope to be able to say to you that your culture differs from my culture, but were there the same is that they were both directed by people who had enough courage to erect. And so if you really want to identify with your culture, then you stop identifying with the rules and you start identifying with the process and also to the degree that you want me to identify with the rules, you stop yourself from identifying with the process. Most people are not those courageous people.

Speaker 1:          01:49:23       Well, I think partly it's a problem of conceptualization is that until you can perceive the possibility. Look, if you want to stop kids, for example, from, uh, from forming gangs and from proceeding morally within the game. But immorally with regards to the rest of the world, I don't think that saying to them, well, the way that you construct your game is inappropriate. It's going to work because they need the gangs, but what you might be able to say as well what you think you, you think what you're doing is the most courageous thing that can be done because a lot of gang activity, for example, is quite dangerous. But then you say, well, it's not his. There's a whole other realm of courage. It's outside of the domain that you've considered. It's much more difficult and if you are a real human being, so to speak, that's what you do. Because if you want to offer someone an option and have them take it, I think you have to offer them something that's more difficult. The moral equivalent board or if that's right, that's the moral equivalent of war. Yeah, absolutely. But the problem is something that's just as excited and just as dangerous. But where did the territory's different? The problem is worried something procedural and therefore it's easy to grasp as an alternative. Whereas this is something that's correct.
