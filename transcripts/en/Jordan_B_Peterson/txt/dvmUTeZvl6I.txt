Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Welcome, my name is Barbara. I'm the president of blue matter project, uft chapter. On behalf of my team, we thank you for deciding to spend your night with us. Our mission at the matter project has been to provide the resources that we believe would be beneficial to the mental health of our fellow students at u of c because a healthy mind is crucial for success at this university and I think we all know that maintaining such as fade is no easy task. I'm going to be asking you a few questions and I hope that you participate by simply raising your hand. If the question applies to you, how many of your currently undergraduate students, how many of you have had a radical change in your core beliefs after entering university? How many of you have been reasonably stressed out throughout your university life? How many of you have wondered at least once in your life what the point of it all is our confused about how you should deal with the situation?

Speaker 1:          00:01:10       If most of these questions apply to you, then you have at least I hope come to the right place. If they don't apply to you personally, get some coffee with you on me to see how the hell you do what you do, just getting on Brooks, so probably have to split the company. The person who I have the honor of introducing tonight that I considered with significant influence on me, I most likely on any of you who are also familiar with his work. If you don't believe me, you can check the rate my prospect site or did you have some comments on these lectures you said you you will see the words such as mind boggling and life changing very frequently. I was first introduced to him in the first TEDX UFC event back in 2015 when I was in my first year of study at UFT. He was the first speaker at Tedx and the title of his talk was potential as a life science. As students just finished a series of courses in biology, chemistry, and mathematics. I could immediately see that his perspective on life was radically different compared to the perspective of other lecturers I had listened to before.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       As a result, I found it difficult to connect with the content of his talk at first, but it was nevertheless interested in his perspective. Fast forward two years later, Dan, which I didn't hear any talk even remotely similar to that are facing the Tedx talk and I took a psychology course called personality and its transformations without initially knowing that he was taught by him and how fortunate I consider myself to have decided to take that course. This course, along with his other course called maps of meaning, how far being among the select your courses that I genuinely have enjoyed trying to extent that I have watched some victories over and over solely out of interest. I presume by now you're have your constant. What's the word? Obsessed means? Our speaker tonight has a bachelor of arts in political science and a bachelor of arts in psychology from the University of Alberta.

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       He received his phd in clinical psychology from Mcgill University. He taught at Harvard University as an assistant and an associate professor from 1993 to 1998. He then returned to Canada and took a tenured position at the University of Toronto and has been teaching here ever since. He's the author of maps of meaning, the architecture of belief as more than 96 published articles, he stocks are sincere and eloquence and presenting content of unfathomable depth. He has attempted to present the forms of untruth that we should both pay attention and not fall prey to in order to find truth and ultimately leaning, leading a meaningful life. I'm sure you are. As excited as I am. So we sent you to stock tonight and without further ado, please join me in welcoming Dr Peterson.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:03:53       Thanks. That was one of the things that struck me asking those questions is how many of you have been, you know, pretty stressed out by your university experience and I killed them. Really. Think, how many of you were second year students? Okay. How many are third year? First Year of their. They're too busy. So. So anyways, that was the case when I was an undergraduate. I enjoyed my undergraduate degree and um, I went to a small place to begin with, which was just a community college in northern Alberta. That was actually a huge advantage because I had the small classes, the big classes at 38 and the people who were teaching there really liked to teach and although they might not have known as much as might conceivably be, they were excellent teachers and they do a lot more than me and that was sufficient and so I really liked that.

Speaker 3:          00:05:10       I learned a lot in the first year that I did in my entire school career prior to that, which is partly to do with me and partly to do with the schools. And then when I went to the University of Alberta I, it was less enjoyable because it got more formulaic, but I still have a good time. I wouldn't say that I was stressed particular, you know what I mean? No, I wouldn't say that. I would say I was probably less stressed in the university that I was in. High school pays better and I think that that was. I think that was probably the case for most of my peers, the people I knew with the score, so you know, things have changed since then and I think some of those changes put undue stress. I mean the first is that your ability to access careers of certainty has declined.

Speaker 3:          00:06:07       Like for those of you who want to become a clinical psychologist for example, or who wants to go to medical school, it's insanely difficult. It's no wonder you're stressed. My nephew tried to get into medical school three years ago and I mean that kids, bright man I was watching him do those is that online set of exercises that are supposed to make you more intelligent but the mosby and he was doing amazing exercise where you have to maneuver his way through a maze as well. It was rotating. You're treating them and that guy could do that just like in the standing still. It was really amazing. We had a four point zero average from queens and he had. He was a like a really high level soccer player and he was a, he's a good guy, you know, he's the sort of person you just hate because not only are they good at everything, they're actually great people and a medical school.

Speaker 3:          00:07:01       What the hell? He had 99th percentile and he couldn't get into medical school. I thought, what the hell? How stupid is that? Because obviously that's a wasted talent, right? It's obviously a waste of talent and it's a betrayal as well, people's because he hit the ball out of the park on multiple dimensions and still had to walk through three extra two extra years of hoops. He finally got into medical school, but man, he shouldn't be in a shoe in and by getting into clinical psychology, which is another one that I'm very familiar with it, you know, I can tell you how to do it. You have to have a higher grade point average because otherwise you have to have good gres. In fact, you probably have to have great juniors, but then what you have to do is you have to apply it everywhere because it's a laundry.

Speaker 3:          00:07:49       So you have to apply to 30 place and so remember that because it's a water and a lot of these things are lot of reasons. So what you do in the base rate of rejection is extremely high. It's first of all, don't beat yourself up about it because it's the base rate of rejection is really high and you'll get rejected. It has nothing to do with you, the base rate taught and you really have to learn that in life. You know that the base rate of rejection for most worthwhile things is like 95 percent and it's hitting I think in many situations it's getting the odds against you or actually increased. Now there's some other positive things about the way things are going. You know what I mean? Maybe you have access to the forms of opportunities that would have been unimaginable to me, but a lot of those are also wanting to monetize.

Speaker 3:          00:08:37       So that's, that's an increasing problem, especially if you're a creative person. So, so you know, there's been this ramp up and competition and it's partly because the certain jobs, as I said, are difficult to obtain law laws the same way and increasingly even having a career as a lawyer is more risky than it was say 20 years ago because a lot of lies being nibbled to death by technological transformation. And of course journalism that's out to most creative enterprises are out because he can't monetize. You guys also look forward to a job career trajectory. What are you going to be changing jobs very often. And so one of the things that I would recommend is get used to that it good at it. Have you been CP it used to doing interviews. He ready to move at the drop of a hat and keep your options open because a lot of you in order to rush yourself up the career ladder where to have to be partners and you're going to have to have options at hap.

Speaker 3:          00:09:33       And so whenever you're employed you might want to be looking for other opportunities that you can use as bargaining chips so that you need to transfer. You know, cross it up or you can use that as a hammer to lap your employers on the heads way because you're going to have to be candy and tough and you know, the upper end rewards insanely odd, but it's a lot higher, harder to climb into that category. So I think that's part of the reason that you're stressed, you know, is that your future is more variable and more uncertain than people's future was when I was in university. So that would have been in, in the early eighties and certainly much more uncertain than people in the sixties. People's, the people in the sixties, their concern was that they were going to graduate. They have a job that would last the rest of their life that would pay well and know and then they're concerned with how oppressive that was going to be.

Speaker 3:          00:10:27       No, it looks pretty damn pathetic in retrospect. So, but you guys don't have that worry. So we're even with that. So you know, part of the reason I'm telling you, because if your stress, the first thing you gotta do is figure out how much of that to you and how much of it is situation because it isn't necessarily going to make it less stressful to know that it's situational, but at least you could dispense with some of the guilt and self criticism. And also, for example, in publishing just for scientific articles. If you want to publish in a journal, there's a one percent acceptance rate. So you have to assume that you're going to get it a lot and the best things you ever get. If you're trying to publish papers that that paper really sucks. But if you do a lot of work on it and maybe rewrite it, rewrite it completely and do a few more studies of the same sort and they will tend to really send it out for review.

Speaker 3:          00:11:23       And that's like time for a party. And a lot of the things that you're going to do in your life. We're going to be like that. Like they're very low probability events and there'll be able to gradually. But they are so you need to know that because otherwise you will take responsibility for that onto yourself and normally taking responsibility is a good thing, but you want to take responsibility for the things that you're responsible for and you know, parcel out external circumstances, could they external work and so with conscientious people and you know a fairly large number of you are going to be above average and conscientiousness are, you wouldn't have gotten to where you are because you're above average in intelligence and above average in conscientiousness. Is it conscientious? People often feel guilty and also if they're not doing as well as they expected, they automatically assume that there's something wrong with them.

Speaker 3:          00:12:14       Now that can be a useful adaptive style because generally if things aren't going your way the way it changed this to change things that you can control, right? So if you're thinking it's situational, there's not much you can do about that. And so sometimes there's utility in focusing in on your micro path said I'm all for that. You know, you got to take responsibility. But it's easy for conscientious people to take excess responsibility. And so for example, they do very badly if they're unemployed and because they feel like losers, you know, and then they attributed that to themselves and that can easily go too far. So the first thing is, you know, you have reason to be stressed. Now another thing that's happened is no. One of the things you might ask yourself, is it better to be a little a big fish in a little pond, little fish in a big pond.

Speaker 3:          00:13:06       And I would say generally speaking, it's better to be a big fish in a little point. And you guys made a mistake by coming to the University of Toronto on that diminished. And I saw this when I worked in schools in the United States. It was quite interesting watching the students there. So those were the Harvard students because you know, the diabetic students have a reputation for being arrogant and I think that's more or less something that's carried over from the time, you know, schools we're really interested, chronic, you know, and it was mostly based on economic factors and familial connections. It's not like that anymore. The Saudi agreement. The thing that was interesting about the Harvard students is that they were the top of the class wherever they were, and maybe they get the smartest people they knew and when they came to her and they were, they were in the middle for almost everything in the bottom for some things and the days of being the smartest person in the room were seriously over and so it was really hard, you know, but it was.

Speaker 3:          00:13:59       It was alluded to some degrees because they were now with the non representative sample of people and so you're also with the non representative sample of people and so average in a high school is that's it's nothing if you're thinking about it from an actuarial perspective and a probabilistic perspective than not. There's nothing to be surprised about and that's something else to keep in mind. Now, the downside of course is that wherever you go in your life, what will happen is you keep quiet until the people. You're competing with her approximately as good at things as you are, and so that that performance tension that you feel is something that probably will never go away. Hopefully you'll end up playing games that are fair where if you work hard and you do a good job, that'll actually translated into success, but I suspect that that's going to be the case.

Speaker 3:          00:14:49       The majority of you know, because intelligence is a good predictor of longterm outcome and so it's conscientious. People who can do things are rare, really rare and one of the things you'll find in the workplace is that if you can do things and you're reliable and honest and all those things and someone finally notices that opened doors for you, like math and that's something about especially I would say especially entrepreneurial enterprises that are functioning well. It's something that's underplaying when they were described. People who do a good job with things almost always want to create opportunities for other people who do a good job at things. It's actually a part of the. If you're a successful, one of the perks of being successful is that you get to mentor young people have opportunity and possibility and help them and that's rewarding in and of itself.

Speaker 3:          00:15:40       And all the people I know who are high performing people who are powerful, they all love doing that. So know. So there's places you're going to find that are going to be relatively inviting. But having said all that, you know, there's a lot of uncertainty in the future. There's a lot of technological transformation and it isn't obvious what's going on in the future. So, so a lot of, a lot of it's situational. And then you know, the other thing that's happened to some degree is that there's an undue amount of emphasis placed on let's say, grades as the criteria that we'll select you for the next level of attainment because I think it starts to become a mistake. So I think people purely on the basis of race, once you're above about say a, b plus or a minus, something like that, because people start to gerrymander their education so that they increase the probability that it'll get straight a's.

Speaker 3:          00:16:36       And so they don't take the courses that are interested in a course to still get a's in logically, so they twist and untangle their interaction with the educational system so that they get the output, the system demands. And I think that's really not good. You know, I think an optimal level academic record is actually one where there's a fair bit of high attainment with some outliers now because it kind of indicates that you're not obsessively focused on your grades because you shouldn't be on sensitively focused on them. You should be focused on them. And also maybe that you're willing to take the chance to step outside of your domain of comfort in hope of getting educated. But of course that isn't how it is. So you're, you're also stuck with that. So I'm from a practical perspective, I mean, one of the things that I've done that you guys could probably take advantage of if you wanted to, I'd be interested for a long time on what interventions might help people obtain the awkward in motivation to move forward and the minimum of uncertainty and stress.

Speaker 3:          00:17:42       And I could tell you some things that you can engage in that are going to help. They're going to help optimize, you're going to help optimize your life and there's some exercises you can do. This exercise called the future authoring program, which is online at [inaudible] dot com and we've used that now with thousands of university students, mostly in Europe, but we also just random Mohawk college intro students at Mohawk college through it, and it raises their grade point average 25 percent drop out rate by about the same. And so what the future authoring program does is help you. It fills a niche in your education that is pathologically underfilled for reasons that I can't really quite comprehend, but I've looked into to some degree which is, and it's really the purpose of the humanities, which is I think in many ways speak for God. The issue is who the hell are you and where you would go, where are you going?

Speaker 3:          00:18:41       And then the subsidiary issues are why, why are you doing that? And those are not optional us, like they're philosophical questions but true philosophical questions. They're not decoration on the business of life. There are the most fundamental possible issues that you can grapple with and if you don't grapple with them property, you'll get flattened because you'll be wheat and wheat means you won't be able to express without falling apart and life is full and stress. And so if you can't tolerate it, you'll fall apart and that's just not good. And so, you know, part of what you need to figure out is what makes you condition optimally in some sense for battle. It's not just that because it's also cooperation,

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       but

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       you need both of those metaphors in order to, to consider the situation properly. The future authoring program asks

Speaker 2:          00:19:36       people

Speaker 3:          00:19:40       to formulate a vision of themselves to formulate an ideal for themselves. And it's not a Nietzschean kind of formulation under the things that need to discuss when he was describing the collapse of values first in western civilization and then maybe around the world, the classic traditional balance. So as that, people would have to create their own values as a replacement, but it's, uh, it's too good. It's an erroneous demand in some sense because first of all, you can't create. You're smart enough and you don't live long. You have to rely on your culture and second, you just can't create your own values because you can't cost yourself around. You are a certain way who have certain interests. You had what prophylaxis. You have certain inadequacies and weaknesses that may be very tightly aligned with your strengths is complicated and so basically what you have to do is discovered in some sense what your values are and aligning yourself with the property.

Speaker 3:          00:20:39       And so the future authoring program does that basically asks you to envision. Look, one thing I've observed about people is that part of the reason people don't get what they want to do that and you're not going to get something with it. That's for sure, and the more precisely targeted your vision is and more clearly laid out what you want is the higher the probability that you're going to get it and it's partly because you'll be moving ahead like an organized and crystalline entity and you'll be basically moving through much because other people are much less concerned about stopping you. Then you are concerned about going forward and so things will move away from you and they do that quite dramatically, so it's. It's a nontrivial, a nontrivial utility to get your act together, point yourself in the proper direction. The question might be, well, how do you do that?

Speaker 3:          00:21:35       And I've tried to think about that from a practical perspective. I mean the first thing is what do you want, and that doesn't mean it actually doesn't mean what you want because when people think that they can, because we're in the theory of the stick, they tend to think about that in terms of acquisition. It's like, what do you want for Christmas? And that's it's understandable and it's not wrong. It's just second rate. It isn't. It isn't as good as it could be and it's not good enough. Really what you should be thinking about is what sort of character you want to have and the reason we want to think about that is because your character is your motive force forward and your armor and if it's not well developed then you're weak and you're going to get run over and so you're. The primary purpose of education is the development of character and it's not.

Speaker 3:          00:22:29       It's not the sort of you should be like this if you're a good person. It's not prescriptive, not if it's not. If it's deep, it's, it's what are what, what under what conditions would you be willing to be satisfied with your life? And this is a very important question because it's not that easy to be satisfied with your life and this is partly where our education system leaves people terribly astray because you know the bone headed noise, it's all about being happy and that is not good because life is suffering. It is. And then having established that you can say, Oh yeah, okay, I get it. I see. That's why things are like this. Then you can start thinking about what you might do about that, but if you start from the earliest presupposition that the default condition of human experiences, happiness, you're just done from the start because every time you're unhappy, you're going to think you're not going to conclude that you're inadequate, so you're not inadequate. That's just how it is.

Speaker 3:          00:23:32       The question is how do you deal with them and so we'll just say, well, you're destined to suffer. You destined to lose your parents. You're destined to be unhappy in your career, at least from time to time. You're destined to fight with your closest intimate friends and perhaps to be divorced and have sick children and could develop some sort of horrible disease yourself and like there's a lot of things coming forward at you and Lauren have you are experienced those things. So like giving all that. Why don't people are. This was just hopeless. There's nothing new about it, but the problem is is that isn't going to help and it's also gonna make it worse and that's just the beginnings of the problem because if you take that attitude, not only does it not help and make it worse for you, you will then turn and naked way worse for other people, and so that's just a nonstarter. You don't go there. That's inappropriate. It's novelistic technically

Speaker 4:          00:24:21       and

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       nihilism leads directly to have as far as I can tell, and I mean that metaphysically and technically so because not always is one of the root causes of terrible social psychopathology and societies can get so far out of whack that they can do things that are absolutely unimaginable and you probably don't want to be part of that. And if you do well then you should think hard about exactly what you're doing because there's something about it that's corrupt. So. So forget about the nanoscale issue. But the other thing that you shouldn't do, and this is another place where I think our education system fails you, is that you should not learn to parent ideologies and almost everything that students are taught as far as I can tell now in the humanities, is basically the paradigm of both the head of the chiefs and there's ways of identifying ideologies.

Speaker 3:          00:25:15       And one of them is it's always someone else's fault that's one of the hallmarks or it's society's fault. And the other hallmark is everything that's complex can be explained by one principal because that's wrong. It's just no one's sophisticated. Everything stuff. It's like you're looking at the card isn't working and all you know is that the fan belt might be loose. And so no matter what the car is doing, the reason is, is the fan belts, loops. It's, you're not going to fix the van, the car, because sometimes there's other things that are wrong. So any alarms over simplify and they're very, very rigid and they're also resentful. And so. And that's in some sense that's the easiest alternative denialism right? Because it's false certainty and it's, it's, it's rigid. And the breakable and also takes you in a terrible direction because if you're rigidly, if you originally identified with your radiology, anyone who challenges, it's instantly your enemy

Speaker 4:          00:26:13       and

Speaker 3:          00:26:15       what you want to do with your enemies. It's not pleasant. So that's also not a very good route to take if you're, if you grab not end up in an absolutely terrible place. Okay. So then you think, well what are the alternatives to that? That's where it gets hard because sometimes it doesn't like there is much of an alternative and it's like things are pointless obviously because look at all the suffering and the shortness of life and all of that and nothing's really turned. So you have to take refuge in some arbitrary set of rules and concepts and you know like postmodern relativism basically. That's basically it's completion, you know, mind system and other system. It doesn't really matter. They're all predicated on power girl, basically arbitrary. And so there is nothing else there that's not right. It's seriously not running and it shouldn't be taught to people.

Speaker 3:          00:27:04       I really think that's a bad thing. I think it hurts people's mental health. And actually I actually think that that's the point, so because malevolence is a motivator and so his resentment and not everyone is trying to make things better and lots of people would rather have the misery shared that hasn't disappeared. Okay. So then let's say potentially there's a middle road and what is that? Well, I think some of it's empirical, like there's this idea in behavioral therapy of, of collaborative empiricism. And basically what happens is a person comes into therapy and they say things aren't going the way I would like them to be, which basically means I can't bear the tragedy of my own life. That's basically what that statement piece. And the therapist says, okay, well fair enough. That's not so good. You're willing to change obviously because here you are.

Speaker 3:          00:27:55       How should you change? And the answer is, well, we don't know. So the first thing to do is find out and so you go and then maybe ask the person to watch their life for a the while and see when things are going well and see when things are not going well. And that's, that's not the same thing as creating your own values, right? That's more a process of observation. And so like I could say, I noticed some exercises like this that can be ridiculously powerful. One of them is, well, watch when you're miserable and see if you can figure out why, but more importantly, notice when you're not miserable and see if you could figure out why. Because at least in part what that indicates is that you're in the right place at the right time, right? Then that's when you shouldn't be. Now where do you should be?

Speaker 3:          00:28:40       It's partly in time and partly in space, right? Because things progressed. So you're always trying to locate yourself in prime, new space. And now I'm in your nervous system reports that all systems are go, okay, so that's a hit. It's like, okay, I don't know, I'm doing something right now. And that seems to be working. Now. It's not, it's not an a mississippian hint, but it's a start. Okay? So then one thing you can think of is, right, let's see if I can figure out what those places where I shouldn't be looked like. And then let's see if I can start making those places bigger and you know, if you could make them one percent a week, if you do that for three years, it's like they hold from maybe two percent or five percent of your experience to 85 percent of your experience. That's really useful.

Speaker 3:          00:29:23       So, and that means humility, you know, that's actually a classical virtue. Humility means you don't know what the hell you're doing and you better pay attention because you might learn something and then you're training ignorant even with regards to yourself and. But it also means that you treat yourself with a certain respect because it means all of a sudden that know the autonomy of your own experience has a real reality and it's an observable reality. And so, you know, people talk about this sometimes in terms of the flow, which is not a bad concept, but basically what it means is that you could find yourself engaged in business in life. It didn't matter that sufficiently meaningful. So the fact that life is tragic at that moment, that's not matter or maybe even better, it's acceptable. You know, you might see this when you have children, if you're lucky, and I think this is one of those experiences where people get close to that.

Speaker 3:          00:30:16       Children exposed the tragedy of life like nothing else, but if your relationship with them is what it shouldn't be, you think, oh yeah, that they're terribly vulnerable and it's so worth it, and that's what you want. That's what you want. You want to see your terribly vulnerable and so is everyone you love and so it was everything that you have around you, but there's a way of comporting yourself that makes that worthwhile and that's what you're after. And I would say that's actually the goal of any genuine religious practice because, and the reason I'm I'm using the religious example is because if something is truly religious significance, what it means is that it deals with the deepest elements of human existence. By definition, that's what it is. If it isn't that it's not, it's not in the category of religious experience or knowledge. So you need a path of being justifies the suffering of life.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       Then the next question is, well, can you find such a thing and the answer that is you've got your whole life. Find out and under the doing it, that's the answer. It really is the answer. It's the prime question. Can you conduct yourself in a way that justifies the tragedy of the now in order to do that? Part of it is he can't be too arrogant, man. You can't think you know what you're doing now. If you're all happy and things are going wonderfully and you have a perfect relationship with being, hey, no problem, but you guys don't put up your hands when you said you're stressed out and you know you're doubtful and you don't know what's going on and you know, so you're teetering between nihilism in India, logical possession and so you have a problem. Well that's a good thing to notice.

Speaker 3:          00:32:00       I have a problem. Then you can know this. Maybe I'm not correct because that would be lovely if the reason that you have a problem is because there are things you don't know. That's such a good deal because the alternative is things are terrible because they're terrible. There's nothing you can do about it, and then it's like not only were there no bloody wonder, so you could start with the possibility that perhaps the reason that things aren't as good as they could be or as good as is necessary is that there are fundamental things that you need to observe and learn and change and then if you really careful and sufficiently terrified because that's also a necessity. If you're going to be sufficiently careful, maybe you can figure out how would conduct yourself so that you get to be strong enough so that you can tolerate to tolerate that and maybe even more.

Speaker 3:          00:32:47       Maybe you could put yourself together so that you're so strongly the other we can. You could say it's okay that things are this way or maybe even that. It's good that this girl, so when I learned that in part by having kids, because kids are unbelievably vulnerable, you know, and be really. They're so cute and so perfect in a certain way that there are vulnerabilities also even more painful, you know, but you think about them and you think, well, let's, let's eradicate some of that vulnerability. You cannot take a little three year old and they're wandering around and you know they're subject to any number of potential catastrophes at any moment and you think, well, you know, you can enclose them in Styrofoam and you then you could roll them down the stairs and that wouldn't be a problem, but then be enclosed. It's powerful, which is really what we're trying to do with kids.

Speaker 3:          00:33:40       Or You could make them 20 feet tall and making a buyer and then, you know, cars. We've heard them all. But the thing that's so strange is that every step you take to, to, to eradicate the vulnerability is simultaneously a step that would involve the destruction of the person. So that's so interesting because what it means is that the vulnerabilities, that central element of what it is that you love, that's pretty interesting because it means that you could love something that's truly vulnerable is something that's, you know, that's, that's susceptible to tragedy and it's and it's mortal and fragile and all of those things. Okay? So that's interesting because if you love someone, you make the judgment that their existence is, is good, and that's cool because it shows that well that happens to you spontaneously. You can spontaneously make that judgment. You know, maybe you could make that judgment about yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:34:29       Now I don't think you can just, you can't just do that. That doesn't work. People are like, you can't really fool yourself, and so you can learn to not judge yourself with unnecessary harshness. That's really useful. And even learn to be compassionate with yourself, which basically means to treat yourself as if you're someone who care about because that's where true compassion means. And so you could modify to your, your capital, logical self criticism, but in order to establish a positive relationship with yourself, you also have to respect yourself. And I think to do that you have, there's a bunch of things that go along with that. You have to be good for something good for you. That would be good. Good for other people that'd be even better, good for other people in a crisis that would even be better, you know? And so that way you can have some respect for yourself because although you're full of flaws and vulnerable, you know, if there's a storm coming, you can still stand up in it.

Speaker 3:          00:35:27       And that's a good thing. And No. So I've observed people on surrounding a deathbed, let's say, you know, just it's easy thing for people to be terrified of but doesn't help. Like the person is dying. You're in the room, you're terrified and upset. It's like, Hey, it's not your turn. It's their turn. And so hopefully when you're in that situation, you've got yourself together now so that you're actually going to be helpful then. And then if you're not, you know, really terrible things happen. So families often tear themselves apart when you know a major part of the family guys, you know, father and mother because there were so mangled up in 15 different ways that, well, the tragedy is unfolding may turn on each other like carnivorous wolves. And so they take something that's just a tragedy and they turned it into hale. And I would say generally you can tolerate tragedy, but you cannot tolerate health. So part of your life is part of what you're doing in your life is to stop tragedy from deteriorating into hell. And if you can do that, man, like you're worth having around. And that's actually grounds for some self respect because that's hard. It's really hard.

Speaker 4:          00:36:38       But consider the alternative,

Speaker 3:          00:36:41       you know, it makes everything that's sad. Absolutely unbearable in every possible way. You know? And I've seen families who were coping with the death say of a mother who were courageous people. You know, there were people who had, for example, worked as palliative care nurses. That's pretty tough for a man. And you know what they did while their mother was dying was held.

Speaker 4:          00:37:09       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:11       That makes the whole situation different. If it transforms the whole situation and you know, you just don't know how much your situation can be transformed. You don't know. And you can take very terrible situations that mean don't get me wrong. Like I know what terrible situations are, like I'm not trying to offer you some naive response, but you can take situations that could be honored imaginably pool and terrible and you can transform them at least into bearable tragedy. And that's, that's, that's the transmutation that someone with real character can manage. And so those things are real. You know, a lot of what you hear about is about the fragility of representations of the world, you know, and about their arbitrary ness and falseness that, that there isn't that belief system in some sense that is rotten to the core and questionable. And I think part of that is just because it's the wrong questions that are being asked. Like if, if the manner in which you addressed the world makes you stronger, then there was no. That puts us beyond question,

Speaker 4:          00:38:26       if you want a question at that point, and

Speaker 3:          00:38:30       even if you come up can come up with a rational way of criticizing it because you couldn't say, well, who cares how he wrote to you are on your mother's death bed. We need a trillion years. You know, all the stores have exploded in. The galaxies are extinguished. When I hear objections that anyone parody, that's such a stupid question, like you're just missing the point completely and it's a pathological objection because you could say you're one of the first soldiers that lays eyes on Auschwitz and the first thing you say is at, it doesn't matter who's going to know in a million years.

Speaker 3:          00:39:05       Sorry, I get, I get the rationale, you know, get the impeccable logic, but it's, it's, it's the logic that only someone who's corrupt beyond measure would dare to use in a situation like that. And so there's a simple way alternative to that. It's like if you're engaged in something, say that reduces suffering. We'll just start with that and something pops into your mind like who's really going to carry in a million years? The first thing you should conclude, is that the wrong time for that thought because you can criticize either thing, right? You can say that art is paramount and the conclusion is irrefutable or anything say anymore on any chattering, devil can come up with that objection. Why in the world would anyone with any sense ever listened to it? And that's a much more. That's a deeper response. It's an embodied response. It's not a, it's not a rational response. There are deeper responses than rational responses. Their responses that involve your whole being and those are the kind of responses you're after. You know, because rationality, it's a, it's a, it's a states note and it's the highest spirit and God's heavenly kingdom. Yes it is. It's the most powerful psychological forest we have at our disposal that you and it shouldn't be lost and if it is you and it's awesome that it's not good.

Speaker 2:          00:40:33       So.

Speaker 3:          00:40:36       So there's no reason to let that happen. You can just, you can just refer to your own experience. I mean there's other exercises and do. This is a really good one. This is terrifying though if you do it right, detach yourself from yourself. So that's sort of a Buddhist faith subset so you become a watcher of yourself and so you have to watch yourself like you don't know who you are because you don't, so you might as well do that. And then

Speaker 3:          00:41:02       watch what happens when you taught, kind of have to watch with your whole body and notice that sometimes when you say something, you align and you come together, you get stronger. And sometimes when you say something, you get weaker, you fragmented, you get weaker, and you know, you could notice, sometimes you'll get weaker if you say something to impress someone you know, you'll get weaker if you falsify your own experience because you're trying to manipulate the situation in order for something to happen. Um, you'll get weak if act on it. Act as if an intellectual principle is something of your creation when it is, you know, because lots of great ideas you can't really use unless you, unless you've made them your own, you know, when we've had an attack to take responsibility for them, you have to be bought into because otherwise you'd just chattering, chattering

Speaker 3:          00:41:56       like a tape recorder. You were chatting with tape recorder. Nobody is crowded and you don't have the right to know. Um, you'll notice sometimes this is a good one. You'll be involved in an argument with someone and you'll feel stupid because you're arguing. Shut up there, you know, and that's often what will happen if you do this a whole bunch of very many occasions. You just have to shut up because there's nothing you could say that won't make you feel weak. And then you can start to feel yourself around your words and you'll see that here's something you could say, your solidity hair, you know, it's like you're standing on a rock in the middle of the swamp. And if you deviate from that, come apart and start, feel weak. And so we practice that. You say, all right, I'm going to see what happens if I only say things that make me feel strong while you do that for five years and see what happens, and it's partly it's fleeting reference to a very old idea. It's an idea that's at the heart of humanity, which is that the idea that there's an idea that conscious human interaction with the ground with the va has something to do with that. It reveals it

Speaker 3:          00:43:08       conscious human interaction with the ground of being is what makes potential transformed into reality. It's something like that. It's an unbelievably powerful idea and I believe it's. I believe it's as true as anything can be true.

Speaker 3:          00:43:24       That means to some degree that you speak to yourself in the va and so that being said, if you want to make yourself strong, you speak truth so that you could bring yourself into being in truth and the reason you want to do that because you shouldn't be truthful. Like in some sort of external, external sense of being in accordance with the traditional route rule. Although if you really pay are real, him is a lot better than just the AI. It's more than that. It's your attempt to construct yourself into something that can react to the manifestation manifestation of b property. That's true. You're matching yourself to be and why would you not want to do that? You have to contend with it. Who knows how powerful you can be. If you contend property people can be so powerful. It's just unbelievable. And you see this even in minor for dinner with this guy a while back and he, he, he'd been an athletic guy.

Speaker 3:          00:44:24       He a lot of biking qualifications, that sort of thing. He got hit by a car just wipe out, so he's still recovering and he's. He's pretty disabled, pretty. Went back to work. He's aligned with mine. It's a hard job, right? You've got to climb up power splice cables together and you have to do it under employment conditions because that's been the standard, the, it's demanding and dangerous and all of that, and he's pretty screwed up because he got hit by a car. So he was telling me just just to casual a story. He was telling me about the last day that he had worked and he was working with somebody who his partner had Parkinson's disease and really could use one of his arms very well, so I don't know. He could use his left arm and the other guy could use his right arm and so they were on the ladder trying to fix this and it's like, no, it just made my jaw drop because how ridiculous is that?

Speaker 3:          00:45:12       He's not run over by a car and then this other guy has Parkinson's disease, which is just as miserable as clean as you could hope to have nearly our their ladder. No freezing rain or fixing the power lines. It's like people can be unbelievably tough, you know. And the other thing that you get universities now that just drives me crazy is it's like you can't be racist. You can't say anything bad about black people or Mexicans or white people or Jews or whoever. You can't do that. But even expressed as much hatred for the entire human race as you want. And so that's just. To me, that's just like, it's really bad if you only take one sort of person, but if you hate everyone, well that just comes into your life. You know, you hear about this all the time. We're screwing up the planet and the planet will be better off if there were people on it.

Speaker 3:          00:45:58       Then all this thing, I think man, never give the keys to the nuclear arsenal to someone who thinks that way, you know, it's a despicable way of thinking and it would be nice if we could develop some respect for people. I mean, you know, we, we labor along under the burden that exceeds the burden of anything we know. We're the only creatures there are who are conscious of their own vulnerability and its ultimate vulnerability. Man, you're going to die. That's where it talks out and look at, here you are. Now you're standing up, you're in here learning. You're trying to have a life. You're maybe some of you are even trying to be good. That's a hell of a thing to do under those conditions. And so, you know, when you started thinking that way, well first of all, you can have a little more compassion for people.

Speaker 3:          00:46:42       It's a little hard on the environment, but it's understand it's role in returning the favor, you know, I mean we're at war with mother nature, but she's going to win, you know, we all die and we're doing our best to protect ourselves from that. And obviously there's some stupidity and foolishness and you know, malevolence and ravenous and this and greed that goes along with that. But asking someone to solve an impossible problem perfectly, it's like you're just the ultimate tired when you demand that. So you could think, well, we could give ourselves a bit of a break and that's something to apply your sending. And I went to this thing at Queen's university. It was a tedx thing, was so appalling. If a professor came out and he was supposed to be talking about these computerized surfaces that he was inventing, which were pretty cool.

Speaker 3:          00:47:32       No, but he came out and he went into a tirade to the students about how they should not reproduce because he said him and his wife going limited themselves to one child and I thought personally that was one more child and he should've passed. No, he didn't even notice that what he was doing, he was addressing a whole room full of people like you who are just entering into the, into the beginnings up there, up there, truly adult life, which is about children. Is that what makes these adult and he's telling them, you are so despicable that you're tight, shouldn't breed. And then he thought that was more just like, what the hell? I told him it was great horror because really, really nervous because I really don't like doing that, but you know, I told him that I thought that what he did was pathological beyond belief and that she should be ashamed of themselves, but you know, I freaked my wife out, completely panicked and he just hopped off the stage saying that's what happens when you talk about things.

Speaker 3:          00:48:34       It's like, no, that's what happens when you have genocide in your soul. That's not the same thing. So you know, hatred for humanity. That's not a good thing man. We know where that leads. So why would say you could start having a relationship to yourself and have a little bit of respect for people can older like mangled up and chewed up and spit out and work in. It's no wonder. No. One of the things I've noticed about psychology is that we always get things backwards. Why did people manifest their abnormal behavior? Jesus, a stupid question. It's like, what would you expect? It's why people are ever normal about anything. That's step one in this history. You know, people come in to my office and we're having a phobia. I'm afraid that I, if I go outside, I might die and we'll get to the hospital with todd having heart palpitations and they're getting older.

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       I think. Oh yeah, that's not surprising. You have tax surprises in it. Like all the other 50 year olds don't happen because of course what you were afraid of and then you don't know with the idea that the idea that it's a mystery that people engage in abnormal, no personality mystery. It's no mystery why people are afraid. It's no mystery why people have low self esteem, which is a work by the way I hate and why people are depressed and anxious and in pain and confused and uncertain and all those things. It's like tap doesn't require any explanation, so if you were any of those things, it's like so and then the issue is, well, what do you do about it?

Speaker 3:          00:50:17       You need to know. You know how you would say your right heel should be informed by your knowledge of the greatest happiness of the past because there's all that knowledge city around your waist back. Don't waste it, use it, and even ideal and ideal is a target and it's a judge at the same time and it's a motivator because you can be like that and yeah, as you move towards your ideal, it will transform because otherwise it wouldn't be anything to do. Somebody's ideal will receive, but we needed an ideal need to construct it some sense or discovered ideal that you believed in. You have to inform that with your knowledge of the past. That's partly why you need to get educated and that's why the humanities are so important. If the humanities still be universities and they're going to go, I think because because they committed Harry Carey fundamentally and of resentment as far as I can tell, and so it's really not good, but the terror of it is that it deprives you of what you mean.

Speaker 3:          00:51:16       You need to be able to extract from the past the ideal and then you put that in front of us about it and it has to be an ideal that you believe is valuable. You think, look, man, if I could pull that off, if I could do that, if I could be that all this trouble would be worthwhile, and so we do this practically. We say, okay, look, three to five years in the future because after that it gets kind of blurry for France. Who Do you want your friends to be? Because you can pick your friends, you know, you can pick people who like you and want the best for you. That'd be good. If you're willing to extend that courtesy to yourself. What do you want for your education? Why do you think? Let's talk about education. What does it mean? Here's what it means.

Speaker 3:          00:51:58       If you're educated, you get your land, which is great. You know how to speak and you know how to write. If you know how to speak and write, you are unstoppable. That's why you're supposed to get educated. No one ever tells you that. It's like, well, why are you running this so well? It's a class assignment or maybe I'm learning too, right? It's like, why bother? Why is that important? It's hard. Why bother? Can write the reason you can't write. It's because he can't think and again, hey, then you run into things and if you run into things, then your life is horrible. So the reason that you get educated this so that you can fake and not run into horrible things and your life expanse and it makes you powerful. You know, part of what I'm doing in my therapy sessions all the time, if someone comes in with a problem and we articulate the problem fully and then we can get rid of most of it because once it's articulated to you can see what's the problem and what isn't, and then we can focus on a few key things and make an articulate what a solution would look like.

Speaker 3:          00:52:59       Then we can go war. It's like, okay, this is the problem. This is what you want. How can you get it? That's all articulation. Here's strategy one, strategy two. Here's the rationales for all those strategies. Here's what you do. If they fail, you do that. You do that. Continuing things just move away and front could be like they're not even there because the people in like systems that are stupid or stupid and weak, otherwise he wouldn't be. He wouldn't be stupid and weak if they weren't stupid and weak. And so if you're, you know, a straight Arrow, let's say, then that stuff just disappears in front of you because there's no commitment to it. And language you're, you want to be a master of language. That's why you're getting educated. That's why university. And so I would say not only should you not say anything, it makes you weak. You shouldn't write anything. You don't believe I was talking to one I, my daughters

Speaker 3:          00:54:00       phrase this are great because I can't drink coffee. I actually hate it. But for a drug that might compromise with my own stupidity. So she was complaining about this sociology class that she was taking half Concordia. I thought that was a sign for mental health. Yeah. And then she said she had to wrote her essay so that you know, feed back to the professors with that particular professor one of the year. And so she was irritated about that. Couldn't get me to do it, to notice that the reason she couldn't get motivated to do it was because she had set herself up to the store for her, her logos to just start her being in order to please some person. She had no respect for what's going on. How could you be motivated to do that? I said to her, look, you can't do that. You can't do that. You have to take your lumps. You write the best essay you can. He make it something you believe it and if it doesn't fly, tough luck for you, but at least you haven't corrupted your character and she's sort of my door. Well, can you just don't understand how the university has changed?

Speaker 3:          00:55:15       That's maybe true, but it's not relevant. The problem is is once you write something you believe, if you can't tell them the data, and that's actually. If you can come here and let's say you're a radical left wing or on some viewpoint or radical wreck when you're, it doesn't matter, and then I say, okay, you have to write an essay countering that position. Now, to renew in a week later, you shifted weight close to your argument, and the reason is is that the belief you have to begin with is shallow. You've never really articulated it. You just have it. It's like a heuristic. It's probably based on your temperature. You articulated revival, you have a weighting or a well developed argument for the repellent they need to do for the original proposition so you ship, so every time you write something to please someone, then you're damaging your character. You might say, well, who cares? Like the honest dope Friday anyways, which is wrong. By the way,

Speaker 3:          00:56:14       that's what you've got is your character, because nothing else will defend you against suffering. That's what you've got. So you sacrifice that, you sacrifice it everything. And it's worse than that because once you sacrifice that, you get weak and when you get weak, the tragedy mouth and as the tragedy mouse, you get resentful and then you get cruel and they get vicious and there's no stopping. And that's just the beginning. I mean there's no end to the downside with that and like we already saw in the 20th century what happens when people do that. It's not good and all of those deaths should have taught us a lesson and the lesson is don't do that. It leads to it least the worst possible situation that you could imagine. No matter how well you can imagine impossible situations and maybe you want to partake in that maybe don't, and in fact maybe you do not want to partake in it.

Speaker 3:          00:57:16       You want to do exactly whatever is necessary to decrease the probability that that will happen and we know it can happen and we know it doesn't have to, and so obviously there must be things that you could do to ensure that doesn't happen, so those things are hard to discover. You know, it's easier to see where something is wrong than where it isn't wrong. It's just simpler. But, and I think that's very tightly aligned, you'll find that stereotype type in your life at the same set of phenomena that you will discover. If you know this day to day, week to week, month to month, what makes you weak and what makes it meaningful, so weakness. If you speak in a way that makes you weak, you'll be curated into that domain. If you don't and you watch what makes your life meaningful, then you'll get stronger and stronger and we get farther and farther away from that and you'll be more and more likely to manifest yourself in a way that makes those things less and less likely.

Speaker 3:          00:58:14       And you know, even like, here's a, here's the proposition for nihilists. It's, I think these are good propositions. Okay? Argue yourself out of pe. Oh look, you can't do it well so much. The deliberate steer rationality, and this isn't the things that are maybe less because there's pain and that's a form of meaning. It's not a form of media you want, but it's there and you can't argue yourself out of it. So the next thing you might say, well, how about a little less pain? How would that be? And then you say, well, what difference has been made? It's like get away from that person because I think some things are self evident. Don't torture kittens to death, but who's going to care in a million years? It's the wrong level of analysis, so that's just a trick of the rational mind so you don't play along with that.

Speaker 3:          00:59:06       You notice and that's upsetting. That's horrible. That's terrible. I don't want to go anywhere near that. Great. Don't go anywhere near it. That would be a good thing. And so you can start by avoiding. That's the way to bring meaning into your life. You start by avoiding hell and then if you're lucky you, well, if you avoided enough, then maybe you can start thinking about how you might, you know, climate stairway to heaven, but the first is the first is the first because it's really easy to believe in pain and so all you have to notice is that you believe in and that maybe you'd rather not have any more of it than necessary. And perhaps that that would also be good for other people. Hey, that gives you a starting point and once you have the starting point, it's like our communities. He said, you know, if you gave them a lever and the proper fulcrum, you could move the world.

Speaker 3:          00:59:55       Well, as far as I can tell, that piece of knowledge is precisely that because I don't think he couldn't. You can't dismiss it, not without in instantaneously establishing yourself as an agent of malevolence so, so that's that. So I would say you Orient Yourself, you Orient Yourself, you have to do that. You have to Orient Yourself towards an ideal and you'll have to dinner out with your ideal is you can figure out what your ideal is by noticing who you admire, because the phenomena of aberration is the attempt of your psyche to construct an ideal that you can fall and it's involuntary, which is another thing that's interesting to notice, right? It's like you don't pick who you admire, it just manifests itself and so it's an unconscious manifestation of your psyche. Or You could say it's a revelation of Ba. It's the same basic idea, and so you think, well, I fire this person.

Speaker 3:          01:00:58       Okay, well now it's like day. There's an ideal nest in that. What is it that you want for match? What is it you want to derive from that and you derive that and then ride the old ship and so it's a moving target in some sense, but it's well worth following. So and again, it's nothing that you can rationally undermined as far as I can tell any more than you can rationally on your mind, being in love with someone you know, being trapped, being in love with someone either can't control it so you can accept it as an existential Faq and then you can work forward on that basis. So then I would say, well, part of the ideals Orient Yourself towards the improvement of being. So the idea is, and it can be vague because what the hell do you know? But the issue is you've got to decide you want things to be worse or do you want them to be better?

Speaker 3:          01:01:48       That's the first decision. And you might say, well obviously one of the things to be better, it's like don't, don't be thinking that's obvious because it's not. And people are always working to make things worse. And there's a part of everyone that works to make things worse. So if you think that that's not part of you, then you're not even in the game yet because you, because you're naive fundamentally and you're going to get walloped and walt enough, you won't be dying and then you'll start seeing this and that will be painful. So it'd be better just to circumvent that completely. You could. So you think, well, how am I going to make things worse? I'm going to make them better. Well, what's works? Milo? Milo is China. That was bad Soviet Union. That was fat Nazi Germany. That was bad. Let's not go there. Okay? So we thought how great things were.

Speaker 3:          01:02:36       Staff, we get away from that. How to make things better. Comfort question. At least stop making the worse you. And then I would say, you know, one of the, the other exercise that I think is very useful apart from watching your speech and don't write things you don't believe now that is really dangerous. It's, you're working your character and once you do that, it's very difficult to get to work stuff because you actually rewiring yourself, writing does that. You're changing your memory structures. Would you? Right. So I think that's even more indication when you, when you see the same thing happens with you speak, the next thing is in part, notice what you could make better, you would make better, and then make it better because you might say, well, I don't know what's good, what's not good. So that's a start. That's really useful. That doesn't. Just because you specify the end one end of a continuum, it doesn't mean you necessarily specify know. So it's fuzzy. What's the opposite of being a Nazi? Well, we don't really know. We don't know exactly,

Speaker 3:          01:03:50       but you get glimmers and I think that's the right way of thinking about it. There are things that glimmer glimmer is this is right and I can fix it. And then it's like, you know, it's not right. You don't have to question. These are grandiose states. These are small things. They're really, they're small things like, um, there's, there's some things I should attend to today. Little tasks, you know, things that you know, that if you don't do your life will be worse at the end of the day. Then it was at the beginning who enough and some of those things you might say, well, I'm not going to do those and okay fine, or I don't know why, but some of them will be the things that you could do that, you know you should do them. They're little things, they're little things, but if you do 100,000 of those states and everything will get pristine and beautiful around you and that makes life a lot more bearable and then you can kind of start distributing that around and that's really, really helpful.

Speaker 3:          01:04:42       It's really helpful. So, so he need to know where you're going and hopefully up rather than down. And if you've got desire for doubt in you then well then the first stream to do is notice at least to know that that's the case. If people are very destructive, you know, and they will hurt and they need to destroy it and so that's part of you and you have to. You have to grapple with that and you have to decide if that's what you want. I would say that's all there is to it. You have to decide if that's what you want. What does you notice? What did you decide that and you tried it or anything so that and start watching, watching what makes you strong, what makes you. We'd do the things that make you strong. He stopped doing the things that make you wait and while you're doing that, try to make things better.

Speaker 3:          01:05:34       Now, not in a grandiose way because what the hell do you know if you don't want us to fix everything because you're just screwed up. You want to fix a few things around that are within your realm of competence that you know absolutely that you could make better. Now you might not move. Why? It doesn't matter. You have the confidence. You know how to do it. A child comes up in their car or maybe they tell down, you give them a hug and pat them on the head and you know that works. It works. Okay, so that's something that you're competent to do, so that's the right thing to do in that situation. You know you don't have a discussion about that because it's already established and there's lots of things that you guys already know that are like that, so you do that micro steps and sunsets and then you stand back and you have some faith and faith is the willingness to try that to see little while that's all because there's no proof like, I can tell you about this but I can't prove it within the confines of your own experience, and so you have to manage faith that things could possibly be right and that's an act of courage and then the things around you sort themselves out and hopefully they sort themselves out for you in a way that also sorts them out for other people and then things get better and maybe as they get better, we won't be so concerned about how horrible things are because you've got to say was so bloody creative and amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:07:07       If everybody on the planet was like laying things out as fast and hard as they can, man, we'd solve every problem. There is no time flat. So seems like a good deal for beats complaining about how miserable, wretched and destructive human beings are. No, it's not good. It's not good. It's not a sign of ethics to do that. It's quite the contrary. So I have to save all of that. So we're going to have questions. Right? Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:07:43       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          01:07:55       What I'm going to do, I'm going to answer questions that I haven't answered the question. It's either because I'm too tired or I can't formulate reasonable as morally right to bring people into existence without consent and knowing that they will inevitably injured or suffering during their life. Isn't it selfish? Good question. Um, tolstoy asked that question in his confessions. So if you're interested in an answer to that question, one of the things I would recommend you read that book because that was Kinda historically should be looked at life. And he taught and he tells this story. It's a story about this guy in the field and he's being chased by people who want to kill him. So he jumps into this hole and he's hanging on. It's like an old. Well, he's hanging on for dear life is scratching and at the bottom of the hole there's a crocodile and so he's heading on there will always had you gone.

Speaker 3:          01:09:07       He noticed there's two things. There's some grapes on the vine and then there's about two nice ones, the black mouths and one's white Nelson and they're on either side if the and they're chewing through it so he knows he can get out and detail. Taylor, you can fall and get killed or he could wait. So what do you guys eat? The grapes and it's a Buddhist story that was story because the white mouse is chaos or order in a black house is chaos and there's always things working at the of being. There's no doubt about it and you know you're screwed no matter what you do, which is the moral of that story. I told a story, looked at that story and said, look, the only logical conclusion that you can draw from that is that life is so terrible that it shouldn't exist, and hey, dusty dsts the same question in probably just chromosome.

Speaker 3:          01:09:59       You have this character named Ivan. It was a smart goodwill being tough guy, good intellect, perceptive, and he has this revenue down the Osha who's kind of. He's a soft diet in some ways. He's not an intellect, but it was really a good person. Now the just kind of classically religious and he's. He wants to be a novitiate in the monastery and I just to bed because he can blow over with his intellect, you know, and I can tell us the story about the Gospel. He took the newspaper, this family, mother and father, they were angry at their four year old daughter and a locked her house overnight and she was screaming out there and she froze to death. It was news and in Moscow, and I can basically says to Leo should know who's making the case for the goodness of being of the goodness of God.

Speaker 3:          01:10:53       Anyhow, you want to look at it, and I've been so you bothered, how can you even dare to make $9 like that? It's like this is the sort of thing that happens in the brain all the time, and then you ask somebody, oh, should look when you be willing, voluntary departure, that girl to death to ensure that things would continue. Well, no, I what I know you wouldn't do it. So it's like, what's your conclusion about that being shouldn't exist? And then that asks the same question in a firehouse is character in that have met the software, these, this. He's kind of the intellectual ankle of statement. That's one way of thinking about it and he says the same thing. He's talking about his motivations. He says, well, what motivates the great adversary of mankind? And if it says it's straightforward, being so terrible that it should be eradicated. Okay, fair enough. Strong people try it.

Speaker 3:          01:11:59       It's not clear to me that that's where we should go. So because as far as I can tell, when people work for the eradication of being, it makes everything that they're complaining about way, worst, really fast. And so then the other thing you might ask yourself is, do you think that's the motivation? It's really so purehearted no, they're going to destroy mankind to save and then making a judgment. The judgment is being is so terrible that it shouldn't do exist. Now, don't get me wrong. I get the rationale for that is either his rationale. It was never put more strongly than in the brothers Karamazov. It's a famous passage and writing. So the question here was with regards to bringing children into the world. Well, it's a variation of the same question. No, the question is what do you have to conclude if you're not going to do it, you're completely with but is not with the being is not justifiable.

Speaker 3:          01:12:51       Well, that's a hell of a conclusion. I would be very careful before I made it because there are places it takes you that a not good. So. And then you might also ask yourself, are you so sure that you're asking that question just because you're a good person or you maybe asking that question because you don't want to say of having a child in his finger and said are maybe you're afraid that you won't know how to fortify the child property. So you're withdrawing fair, fair enough. Look, what do you do with children? Does you encouraged them? And I mean that literally it's like a little kid and he'd say, look man, you can take on the world. And you don't sugarcoat it just like it's not. It's all fairy tales and roses. It's not the old Sheila is. She opens enough so you don't damage them.

Speaker 3:          01:13:43       It's a really tight because you don't want to know why overwhelmed someone hurt them while you're teaching them. You have to expose him gradually and with intelligence, you do that by having a relationship with a kid. You don't want to shield them from existence. We want to show them just what it's like and then you want to tell them it doesn't matter, man, you're tough enough. You can do it and you can do it right and it's true. It can. And if you, if you fortify them with that knowledge matter are, they're being is not characterized by the kind of suffering that makes existence intolerable. And so the answer is not to have children. The answer is cooperative and encourage them, and that's tough because you don't. You're kind of fragment had been broken and if you treat your child right, they might exceed me and that's annoying, so you made you everything.

Speaker 3:          01:14:36       You can bloody well made sure that your kid is broken enough so there's no way they're going to do it any better than you, and so I wouldn't recommend that, but people do it all the time, but that doesn't mean that existence itself is insufficient. It just means that you're not handling the property and you're making it far worse than it has been. One of the things I asked myself a long time ago, first of all, I know there's a distinction between tragedy and that's an important distinction. Tragedy is when things happen that aren't good, someone gets canceled. No, I'm your child slips and breaks his or her leg. You know your parents die. That's true. Evil is when something tragic happens because someone wanted to tap. Okay, so we can distinguish between your students. The first thing I would say is people can have a tragedy like you can get tough enough so you can have.

Speaker 3:          01:15:31       In fact, I think you can get tough enough so that you even get tougher if you're exposed to trash. That sort of statement about, you know, whatever doesn't kill me, makes me stronger. Obviously itself, it's an overstatement. It's very hard for people to tolerate evil level ones. So like I've seen people, for example, because that adolescent clients with posttraumatic stress disorder there very often traumatized by malevolence, not trashy. They fall victim to someone who wants to hurt and maybe it's even been self that wants to hurt them and that's revealed to them, you know, but sometimes it's that they come into their often naive people, they come into contact with someone whose purpose is to hurt them and that shadows so badly they can't put themselves back together. Evils really devastating. I think human beings can tolerate tragedy and I also think that if people oriented themselves towards the improvement of being, we could continually ameliorate tragedy.

Speaker 3:          01:16:25       And I do also believe that being a striving to perfect itself. Now that's obviously a metaphysical statement, but I don't really care if it's a medical metaphysical statement. I have my reasons for for bleeding and I think that the purpose of human life is to participate in that process and because again, the alternatives, things are quite list and life is suffering and it should be eradicated. It's like that leads nowhere. Good really leads nowhere. Good, so I can dispense with it. It's better tasting. It's like a bad roadmap because most profound it is our roadmap. They tell you how to get from one point to another. You know, if you want to get to the depths of infernal chaos or do you want to move towards something that approximates paradise, well, he'd better make sure you have the right map and so and most belief systems, our roadmaps, they're descriptions of reality description, objective reality.

Speaker 3:          01:17:23       There are so have kids say it's one third of your life, you will bloody won't regret it. If you don't do it. You're not going to make 20 or 30. Some days you're going to be 50 or 55 and maybe it will be alone. That's not so good and so you're a fool if you don't have kids. Now, I mean, I know people have their reasons and some people have appropriate reasons and all that, but if somebody ideological hang up that stopping you, Ms Dot Donna, you better dispense with that instead instead of dispensing with the kids.

Speaker 3:          01:17:59       Is there a book you could consider essential reading? Oh yeah. You have to ask that because after all you are at university, you should read Dostoyevsky's five grades. They're unparalleled. So that's notes from underground crime and punishment. The possessor of the devils, it depends on the translation. The brothers grounds off the idiot. There's also one called the adolescence, so I missed there sits, so any of Dostoyevsky's great novels. They're not. You can't not read their key pieces in the. In the psychology of I'm Solzhenitsyn's Gulag archipelago. That's a nature book. Math and that's the description of his experiences inside the prison camps and that book helped bring down the Soviet Union. It destroyed the intellectual and moral credibility of communism. It was an atom bomb, that thing and he memorized it 2,700 pages long, so it's hard to manage because it's nothing but atrocity in terror, but there's.

Speaker 3:          01:19:09       There's no shying away, you know, like, and this is one thing that I really like about it most of the time, like the novels or intellectual or moral doubts, that's a better way of thinking about it. And you know, most of the time when you hear people have an argument, they do tricks. Like let's say you and I are going to happen on argument about something, the first thing I'm going to do is listen to what you say and then I'm going to create a stupid form of it and then I'm going to destroy that stupid form. And when you try to object, I'm going to into Robert. No, that's the, that's the straw man argument, right? What I should be doing is I shouldn't be listening to and if you're not very good at formulating your arguments, I should help you formulate them. So they come out as clearly as they possibly can and then we should have a discussion to see where we go.

Speaker 3:          01:19:56       And that's what does doc does. He takes like his. He was an Orthodox Christian and Russian Orthodox Christian, his atheists man, those are deadly atheists. You know, they make it's look like a piker. Dorsey esd takes Ivan is a really good example. That guy saw everything going for him. He's really good looking. He's really strong. He's your courageous like he's sharp, he's admirable, he's fearless. He's a major contender and he formulates arguments in favor of atheism that are almost. They're almost, in fact, our actually cannot write your rejoinder while he does instead is he. He plays out the consequences of the ideas, you know as the characteristics and he takes his other characters like that who don't adopt that way of being and then plays that out and shows them what the consequences are, which is brilliant. It's like if you read brothers Karamazov and then the possessed with the devil, and then you read who let her go, you have the perfect merging of literary or veterans

Speaker 3:          01:21:02       literature. You have the perfect marriage of literature and history because what Dostoevsky says will happen and why it happens is exactly what happens. So it's just fun. Broken sequence of moral revelation. So Nike camp under you can hardly overestimate the impact of soldier nets is for. First of all, we wanted to know the price for it, but more importantly he did more than over. Took out a tarion communism. Then the American, the American military. No, no. I'm not saying necessarily that the American military was a major player. That boy, I certainly think they work because Stalin was perfectly willing to drop into Europe with hydrogen bonds. You know, he's a seriously. He was seriously not a good guy. So when. Okay. So those like, those are absolutely necessary books. Most books written by people who are universally regarded as great. This here, you know, you hear this again on the edges of literary criticism said the canonical writings were selected because of the desires of the oppressive class or some sort of absolute rubbish like that. It's like

Speaker 3:          01:22:23       partly, but it's not relevant because all these people like pages and pages full of derogatory comments about women know they're not full of them, but they happen now. Well, who's writing by yourself? He was really, really sick. Never sold any books. He was so ill, he could hardly write it. All confined is reading. Took like 10 minute bursts and he was isolated and alone, so now I'm tired to resentful and wrote something rude. The guy had his off time. He, Darlene was like for me. You know what I mean? He was a genius. He was a full professor when he was here as John. It's like, you know, it's not pleasant, but what you're supposed to do when you read a grit work is from the. We know we're not supposed to noticed one stupid thing and say, oh, the whole thing is rocking. That's as fast.

Speaker 3:          01:23:22       Really. That's faster. Here's so pathetic. If you do that, you know when you read Freud and like, yeah, he wrote in the 80 90 [inaudible] and some of his ideas are outdated, but what do you expect? The 80, what do you expect? It's like, so you say, well you have to discard 20 percent of it and you pulled in the other 80 percent of your bloody lucky that the 80 percent is there. You're supposed to be reading not to get rid of things, but you take the things that are valuable. And so I would say, you know, I learned a lot from reading Freud, I learned a lot, a tremendous amount from reading your bio is so profound that it's through unspeakable. It's no wonder they don't teach it in universities like I'm serious, man, that guy was, he was a whole different form of life. So he's terrifying you only as the person who will convince you that there are things going on in your head that have nothing to do with you. And that is not

Speaker 2:          01:24:16       a very,

Speaker 3:          01:24:20       that isn't one of those things that's designed to make you sleep easily. At night. Rogers, I learned a lot from Carl Rogers, like all the great clinicians, they already have something to say and, and practical to say that will help you live your life. George Orwell, Elvis, Huxley.

Speaker 2:          01:24:39       Um,

Speaker 3:          01:24:46       well that's not that start. But like, if it's part of the Canon, this, especially the literary Canon, you can assume that there's something to it. And if you could also assume that if you read it and you don't get it, it's probably you. So fucking. So that's what does forgiving yourself look like? That's a good one, but I'm not going to answer it. What's the best strategy? Can help people

Speaker 2:          01:25:17       get your act together, lead by example,

Speaker 3:          01:25:24       and then if somebody comes and asks you for your opinion, tell them the truth. That's. That's one thing I never liked someone listen, psychological trouble. You'll just make it worse, especially if they're of on the schizophrenia ends up things do not lie to them because they're very clinging to the reality as it is and if you, you know, they're already courtney structured in some sense he dropped a little bit more sensitive to that,

Speaker 3:          01:25:53       you know, and it's hard to tell the truth. It's, it's tricky because you have to be telling the truth sort of at all levels at the same time. And also it has to be reworded. It has to be right. The phrase has to be right in the semester. We write paragraphs to be right. The dialogue between the two of us to be right, you have to be oriented in the right direction. Like all of those things have to be happening at the same time for it to be true, because otherwise you could say something that's destructive just so that you know, filled the demands of the darkest part of your being and then you can say, well was true. It's like, no, it wasn't. It was true. I had one tiny level of analysis and what you're doing is usually off the street to demonstrate your moral superiority would actually interacting in a Mrs. Steve messed up bad. So listening is really useful too. That's great.

Speaker 3:          01:26:47       So you mentioned that part of us wants to make things worse. What exactly do you mean? Is there anybody here in this room who's actually never wanted to hurt someone? Look, people look deeper. How about yourself? It's okay. You don't have to answer that. The reason that there are people, one make things worse fundamentally is because they get irritated that the structure of being, you know, we get tortured by da because this soccer and then they get resentful and angry and then they want to take it out on someone. You know, when you really see that, you know, the US has an epidemic of mass shootings were happening so often I need to record them, was doing that resentful people who want to make things worse and they're people, they're like, you know exactly like you, but they're quite a bit like you. And so if you can't imagine what they're doing and why that.

Speaker 3:          01:27:53       Well, one thing I would say is you don't know very much about yourself and you're actually not watching very carefully because I mean I think I might have a darker side, but most people, I mean be inclined to believe that from time to time. Oh, I'm not sure if it's true, but if you watch yourself, you can see how you want to hurt all the time. It happens. I bet it happens 50 times a week. You know, you want to win an argument with someone you love. That's a good example. You don't listen, you're not trying to solve the problem. You just want to win an argument. Well that's not very helpful. It makes things worse. So, and this isn't my opinion, although it is my opinion, I mean one of the oldest stories, you know, there's a few very old stories of mankind and one of them is that there's a battle between good and evil going on in the human soul. And that's exactly right. As right as people can make as it's as right as people can state it, you don't, you might say, well, you know how you define good Auschwitz.

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       We don't have to have that discussion anymore. I'd like to know a bit about your personal ideal. What are your longterm goals? What motivates you in your life? Well, my mind, what motivates us, that's I think fairly strict. All sorts of motivations. But I mean, nate, major motivations. I like to figure out what the hell is going on and communicate it. You know, I really, I believe that I've done my best to actually pursue the truth and, and it's so useful. It's so useful. It's so fun to communicate to people because one of the things I see, and this is gonna be fun. So when I talked to the audience, it's so cool because lights go on it.

Speaker 3:          01:30:06       That's really fun. So when I see that all the time, if I really communicating to an audience because someone, people like that and then the nod and you think yes, right? Or a bunch of connections, just throwing stuff together. Then the person got a little blast that's like turning on lights, you know. And so that's fun. That's fun. So that's my longterm goal, man. Turn on lots of lights. Yeah. What motivates me in my life. I would really rather than things couldn't get as bad as they could. So that's motivated me since like 19, I don't know how long, 19. 80. Probably because it was in the height of the Cold War, you know, and things did not look good and I just started to read about the history of the 20th century. God so terrible. And like I would just wrap it up in half. It seems unnecessary.

Speaker 3:          01:31:03       So whatever I could do to make that even somewhat less likely to happen again, that's fine. That's fine. And I don't question that because it seems so wrong. You know, I remember the story that really stuck with me and there was this story about, you know, our switch was a big city basically, it was a huge place and one of the things that gardens used to do was when the people were unloaded, you know, they were separating families and anybody who didn't look like they were going to be useful to do a bunch of useful score before they died would be just sent off to the gas chambers. And so that's pretty imaginative and uh, but that wasn't bad enough, you know, because if you did survive even after having lost everything like that, then there was always the opportunity to purchase you with useless work. So one of the tricks of the guards was to make people pick up a sack of salt. We are 100 pounds and carry it from one side of the camp to be up and then back.

Speaker 2:          01:32:13       Brilliant, brilliant.

Speaker 3:          01:32:16       You know what evil is an aesthetic and it has a sense of humor. I mean, the sign over Auschwitz read work will make

Speaker 2:          01:32:26       great.

Speaker 3:          01:32:30       That's a joke by the way. It's like the mutual assured destruction. The geopolitical idea in the 19 sixties and fifties was mutual assured destruction. When you launched your weapon, you're done, you're done. There's nothing left in the afternoon is math. It's like that's a joke. It's a joke, but it's not funny and you know that's. That's a place where you see the art, the archetype of evil, urge in the midst of the geopolitical debate to emerge from the pit, so to speak, in your job like that, and then to retrieve. It's not.

Speaker 2:          01:33:13       That's the thing. Worth the fight.

Speaker 3:          01:33:27       We should decide someone. When do we stop? One more question. Okay. One more question.

Speaker 3:          01:33:49       How do you compromise making it? Are you becoming successful while being true to yourself and not falling into the system? Pretty question. That's an existential question. By the way. The reason I framed it that way just because it's an eternal question. I think that's the question that human beings have always had to face no matter when, no matter where, because the system is always corrupt. It's always corrupt. That's an archetype stuck to the old dead evil and the reason it's corrupt. There's two reasons, one is it started with Dave and because it's lighting behind the present and the future, so it's, it's just design for the wrong era. That's part of it and they never part is. People aren't updating it because they were willfully blind tartar away, but, and so now if you align with it too tightly, then you risk becoming a carbon copy of that.

Speaker 3:          01:34:42       But by the same token, the thing is it's one side who's upset. So this is a really important thing to learn. He first he is the culture is that the tyrannical cane, but it's also the vice kate and at the same time, and you know, you're obviously the press by the University of Toronto, but you know, here you are and so you're unbelievably privileged at the same time you're being torn apart and that's exactly what it's like to live within a culture. You know, you're lucky if you're lucky, if all that's happening is that you're not being torn apart because the typical tyrannical system, all it does is to create a lot. It doesn't do anything good for him. At least you can sit here and relevant piece and say what you want lights are on and it's warm, you know, so that's actually pretty good. So the first thing you have to understand is that you need to be grateful to the system.

Speaker 3:          01:35:30       It's given you everything. Now it's taking away a lot too. But that's just like, yeah, that's the existential issue is games with one hand and takes away with the other. So the trick is how to not become corrupt by identification with the system. It's how to balance balance gratitude with the, with the awareness and the desire to make change. And that actually is being represented in religious thought in many ways. So with the ancient Egyptians, for example, they, they represented the system with the god or Cyrus who was old and blind and and likely to fall under evil influenced and the different dog named horace who is the art of Egypt, you know, and horace. His job was to see evil because I'm serious, was blind to it. And then to enter into combat with it, even though that's very difficult, and the horror said, one of his eyes, pour it out when we did that.

Speaker 3:          01:36:23       And then to go bring your side of the stack. The death basically will. That's what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to you, you've got an old dead came and your job is to pay attention. See where things are not right. Fix it. And if you do that, then you can align yourself with the positive element of the culture while you're simultaneously act as the living corrected to its accesses. And you can do that. Here's one way to do it. You could start new university. Well one is don't write things you don't believe. I would also say this is where you're supposed to challenge things. University. Don't act like you believe things don't bleed. No, because. And it happens. You're not going to fight about the culture. You're going to find 100,000 micro battles with the culture. And you have to decide with each micro battle what you're going to do.

Speaker 3:          01:37:21       And it's really important. So I can give you an example. So let's say you go to work and there's a bone there because there will be and the boy comes into your office and you have 10 seconds to make yourself make it clear whether or not you're going to be bullied. That's all 10 sentence because he's going to figure it out that well. So how, how have you been in not being bullied? You have to transform yourself into the sort of person that isn't going to be bullying and the bullies will figure that out right away and he'll go find someone easier to pick on him and you win and you'll hardly even notice. So if you continue to fight against, if you continue to fight,

Speaker 2:          01:38:03       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:38:03       and I'm wait and colorful way against things that we didn't press you, but it will become strong and if you become strong but you won't be co-opted into the evil of the system. And a lot of that has to do. The Egyptians have this right? The mesopotamians had the same idea. They're gone. They're chaos. Eliminating God had eyes all the way around it's head. Whereas the Egyptians just worshiped the. I naturally we're thinking about, because I don't think you fight corruption with rationality and intelligence. There's no correlation between intelligence and conscientiousness by the way, so it's not a moral, so what our moral faculty, it might be a discriminating factor, but it's not an olfactory attention. That's what you fight against. Corruption. You Watch, you pay attention because paying attention means I'm willing to see what's happening and if something happens that you find objectionable and you know what to do about it and you could do it and you would do it, and that's about it.

Speaker 3:          01:39:03       We feel you should engage in that invasion right down there because that made you start the system. It's Michael Michael Challenges. Stop the system from degenerating into corruption and actually that's not a theory. You already know that if you read the Gulag archipelago. One of this things that social hits and does is say, okay, how did the Soviet Union developed into something that ate its own children? That's his question, and what he said was people lied about everything all the time. They so they would claim to be happy and satisfied with. They were terrified and angry and they were micro decisions, you know, it's like little things like big lie now happily for three hours to get bread. Now that's not a great example, but. But I can't. I'm sorry. I can't conjure up a great example right at the moment. The bullying example is not a bad one. And then I guess the other thing would be it's associated with the ideal. So if you're an idealist to make things better,

Speaker 3:          01:40:12       then you put that above whatever else it is that you're doing. And if you're offered the opportunity to engage in something corrupt for short term material gain or even to avoid conflict, you shouldn't take it. You should say no, but you have to be ready. Say No and I don't think you'll be ready to say no unless you know what the consequences are. Not Said No. Does our, you'll get weak. Things will go downhill, they'll get worse and worse, and then you'll start. You'll, you'll be increasingly motivated to start hurting people. So if you don't want to go there, then when you're offered the chance to build their own little bit, don't go there and you have to be terrified because the thing is going to be conflict, right? If you say no about something, first of all, if it's a moral request, you were exposing the corruption of the person who's making the request and they're not going to be happy about that.

Speaker 3:          01:41:05       And the second thing is you have to engage in some cars like that's not pleasant. So you've got to think what's going to fortify you enough to do that? And that's easy. All you have to do is know where the hell you could end up. And if you really know that, if you really know it, you have man, I'm not going there. I knocked go there and if it means we have to have a bit of an argument for an hour, no problem, no problem. And you'll find it's pretty cool. It's what you'll find is that people just don't know that much about those sorts of things. They just don't come and do that to you because it just doesn't work. They'll go find someone who's either corrupt, but you know you have to know the difference and you have to want to know and then then you can do it.

Speaker 3:          01:41:52       I think you could do it because I think that I think the truth is more powerful than deception and I think the good is more powerful than evil and I really mean that. I think evil and deceit are weak and so big. How could they withstand the truth? How would that even be possible? The truth is reality. How do you withstand reality? Have a sad reality. It just rolls over you and so people who are devoted towards malevolence and he used deception, pathologists to relationship with being, you've got to be strong. If you do that, it's not probably possible. It's like you're driving a rickety car across a really bumpy landscape, so thank you.
