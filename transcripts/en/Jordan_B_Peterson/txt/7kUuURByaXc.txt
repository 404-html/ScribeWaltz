Speaker 1:          00:00:16       I have the distinct pleasure today of being able to sit down and talk to Dr Steven Pinker, Harvard University, who's just written a new book, many. He's written many books, but this is the newest one. It's called enlightenment now and it's a New York Times best seller for seven weeks, so that was a great accomplishment and darker pinker has indicated to me that it's doing, it's, it's, it's, it's doing better than his other books have and and that. And they've also done very well. So that's really something. So Steven Pinker is the Harvard College professor of psychology at Harvard University. He's a two time Pulitzer prize finalist and the winner of many awards for his research teaching and books. He's been named one of Time's 100 most influential people and one of foreign policies, 100 leading global fakers. His books include the stuff of thought, the better angels of our nature, the blank slate and the sense of style. And so I'm welcoming Dr Baker obviously, and I'd like him to start telling us to start by telling us about the book itself and then we'll talk about broader issues and about the other books he's written and that sort of thing.

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       Well, the book's subtitle is the case or reasons science humanism and progress at all. I'll begin with, with the progress because that was the epiphany that more than anything inspired the book. I'd been in a previous book, the better angels of our nature when I was surprised to come across data sets showing that many measures of violence. It declined over the course of history. I was stunned to see a graph that showed the rates of homicide from England and other western European countries from the 13 hundreds to the 20th century, showing a decline of anywhere from 35 to 50 in the chances of getting murdered. Uh, when I, uh, called attention to this factor and a blog post, I didn't got correspondence from historians, from international relations scholars, from sociologists say, you know, you could have mentioned other declines, another decline of violence. And War scholar showed that the greater depth of war had plummeted.

Speaker 2:          00:02:32       Another showed me the rates of domestic violence have gone down, still another that rates of child abuse had gone down. And I realized that this was an important story here that was a, that it had to be told that these different declines of violence ought to be presented to the world in between a single pair of covers, uh, just because it didn't seem to be something of a pattern. And as a psychologist it opened up the challenge of how to explain it. First of all, how to explain the, uh, the fact that there's been, that there is so much violence in human affairs, but also the fact that it can be brought down. Oh, I had a similar set of epiphanies that led to the writing of enlightenment. Now, when after better angels was published, um, I started to come across data showing that other aspects of human wellbeing had improved.

Speaker 2:          00:03:19       The rate of extreme poverty had plummeted by about 50 percent just in three decades. And now stands at less than 10 percent. Life expectancy has been increasing all over the world, including the poorest parts of the world. Uh, the number of kids going to school has increased, including girls, more than 90 percent of people under the age of 25 on, on the planet are literate now. We have more leisure time. We're safer, uh, in measure after measure life has been getting better. And it's not the kind of development that you could learn about reading the papers. Quite the contrary because journalism covers what goes wrong, not what goes right. You could easily come away with the impression that the world was getting worse and worse as a kind of statistical illusion of a feeding, a cognitive bias and not realize until you look at data sets, how many ways in which life has improved, including measures like war and crime, uh, which would, what my guests are going in the wrong direction as opposed to the right direction.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       And I combined that. The other motivation for the book was a set of attacks on the application of science to the traditional domains of the humanities, to, to history, to the arts, to morality, to language. Uh, a, uh, an effort that I think is quite a celebrity is the fact that, that, that scientific insights that are being brought to bear on a Cuban affairs and how could they not give him the, uh, art and society or are in a sense products of our, our psychology products of human nature. But in a lot of intellectual life, there's bitter resentment to any application of scientific ideas or the scientific mindset to human affairs. This was first noted by CP snow in this famous lectures and cultures in the early, late 50, [inaudible] early 19 sixties. But the conflict was very much with us. I wrote an essay called science is not your enemy, which were published in the new Republican, which went viral.

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       And that was the immediate, a kickoff for the proposal that ended up leaving and enlightenment. Now, uh, I was involved in something of a literary spat with, uh, with Leon wieseltier and editor at the new republic. But I quickly realized that, uh, two guys having an argument is not enough to, to, to pump out a book. And so I had the centerpiece of the book, just be the documentation of a fact that most people are unaware of, namely that in most measures, life has gotten better over time. Now, as with the better angels of our nature, I didn't want to just present a bunch of grants, although I did present many graphs, but I wanted to explain them and it seemed to me that if we, if there was any overarching explanation as to wildlife, get got better. It's that people, uh, in the past thought that by understanding how the world works, including ourselves, uh, we can try to solve problems, remember what works a drop, drop the failures. And as we accumulate are our cultural knowledge, uh, we can improve our wellbeing. And I attribute that mindset to the light and the idea that we can use knowledge to improve human wellbeing. Now that might sound almost too banal and that tribe to be worth defending. And so I thought that those ideals very much needed a defense.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       Yeah. Okay. So you're waiting a number of things together. So the first is your discovery that if you look at the data that things are getting better at a rate that's so remarkable that it is really nothing short of miraculous and you've produced dozens of graphs showing that in enlightenment. Now I noticed the same thing about three years ago when I was working for UN panel on economic sustainability, the for the, for the secretary general, the original narrative was extremely pessimistic, detailed how we were disappointing the planet and how everything was getting worse and how we are at, uh, at each other's throats. And I started to read extremely widely and I found that on measure after measure with some notable exceptions like oceanic oceanic overfishing, we have been doing so staggeringly much better in the last 150 years that you can't believe it on almost every, on almost every measure you can imagine, which is exactly what you detail out and enlightenment now.

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       And, and then now that that's a secret, let's say people don't know about it and the, and that's strange. And then you also associated with a critique of the, of, of the enlightenment and scientific rationality. And it seems to me that you're implying, or perhaps you're stating explicitly that you're stating explicitly that there's a connection between the pessimism and the lack of knowledge about this and the critique of the enlightenment and rationality. Because there's a question here. If things are getting so much better and if the news is overwhelming on that front, I mean some of the things you outlined are like the weather, the decrease, decreases and starvation, I suppose the most remarkable and the provision of bountiful food on less and less farmland, which is not something that people know. It's like if all this is happening, why don't we know about it? And how is it linked to the. How do you think if, if it all is linked to the critique of, of enlightenment rationality,

Speaker 2:          00:08:53       what are the reasons is an interaction between the nature of journalism and the nature of cognition? Namely the news is about what happens, not what hasn't happened. And a lot of the. A very beneficial developments consists of things that don't happen. Countries that are at peace, that used to be kids who are not starving. I'm a kid, a terrorist attacks that do not have it. You never see a journalist saying, I'm reporting live from a country that's been at peace for 40 years. But if a war breaks out, you can be sure that we'll hear about it all. The more so now that, that a majority of humanity consists of a, on the spot video. Journalists, thanks to smartphones, uh, also a bad things can happen quickly. Things can blow up, worse can start a massacre, can happen, but good things aren't built in a day.

Speaker 2:          00:09:42       And they often consist of incremental improvements, but few percentage points a year that the compound that, that accumulate, but that can never make the news because they never happened all of a sudden on a Thursday in October. But together with all the, the, um, cognitive impediments to understanding the state of the world, the fact that news reports a memorable events. And we know, uh, from these study of the cognition of risk and probability from Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, that we tend to assess probability and risk by a shortcut called the availability heuristic. Namely, the easier it is to I dredge up an example from memory, the more likely we think something is. And so people think that a tornado's killed a lot of people, but they don't realize that falling off ladders kills far more people. I just. Because when someone falls off a ladder, it doesn't make the news, but when there is a tornado it guys.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       Yeah. Do you know the solar power kills more people? The nuclear power every year.

Speaker 2:          00:10:43       I did not know that, but it doesn't surprise me because nuclear power kills no one. And I suppose as installers,

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       fall off routes is full approves for example. Yeah, exactly. And well, so, so that's interesting. So you can imagine that. So good news or bad news is sudden it's dramatic. We're, we're tilted towards the processing of negative information in any case.

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       That's right. And we don't naturally computer ratio between, uh, occurrences and not occurrences, which is of course what goes into a probability and a rational assessment of risk and probability. So there's that, that it's, it's more than that in that because intellectual life in large parts of academia in a commentary caters and pundits, there is an ideology of a, of decline goes back to the 19th century, a part of the counter of light that arose in a, as a reaction to enlightenment, hope score for progress of rationality that said that the, that the holes that society is Western civilization is teetering on the brink or it's circling, circling the drain and it's going to collapse any, any time now. And it's up to the intellectuals and commentators and, uh, to, to, uh, point out how beckon into degenerate society is. And to people like that musical progress comes also sit in a front. The reaction is, hey, we've been, we've been warning all of you about how society is on the verge of collapse. Don't come around and tell us that, but everything's going fine. What are, what are we going to do now

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       with the romantic types like Russo? And when I was reading, I, I wonder to the, there's a, there's a powerful Marxist narrative that's run its course for about 130 years too, that's predicated on the idea that there is an oppressed class and the no pressure class and that narrative seems also to thrive on or to be affronted by the idea that the current, the current system might be producing benefits across the board. I think you do in fact, in one part of the book ask about whether or not these benefits are only accruing, for example, to the rich. And that doesn't seem to be the case as far as, as far as the data indicates, is that a fair,

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       quite the contrary. The most dramatic improvements have been at the, at the bottom of the machinery, uh, extreme poor where, uh, the proportion of the world's population living in extreme poverty, Scala and over the last couple of centuries from probably about 90 percent to less than 10 percent. And the United Nations has set as one of its millennia, elegant goals to eliminate extreme poverty everywhere by the year 20, 30. That's probably too optimistic. But the fact that it can be set as a, uh, as a, as a plausible aspiration is itself a Scottish.

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       Well, I know the UN had said as one of its millennial goals, the having of absolute poverty between 2000 and 2015 and that was accomplished by 2012. Exactly. Ahead of schedule. Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2:          00:13:59       Has a complicated relationship to progress because Marxist doctrine actually does a layout, a pathway to progress. Unfortunately, that pathway consists of violet class conflict. Uh, it isn't the light and the ideal of progress through, uh, through problem solving from the pro se a, a belief that a nature throws problems at us and that if we apply brain power, we can gradually chip away at them of progress. Is, is quite different. And you're right that there is a strong critiques of progress both from the left and from the right. But from, from the left, uh, is a, uh, kind of contempt for institutions like, uh, like markets like liberal democracy that deserve a lot of the credit for the progress that we've made in that we, to, at least in the academic left a, a, a despising of the very idea of progress. And I found that the only political faction is actually sympathetic to progress or libertarians.

Speaker 2:          00:15:03       There have been a number of rational optimist books in the last decade by people like Matt Ridley and Ron Bailey and Johan Norberg that, uh, that do have overlapping vision to the one that I took on lightening. Now namely documenting progress. Um, but both from the academic left and from the political right, there has been a, a, a contempt for the notion of progress or were there different reasons in academia? It goes back to the Romantics to Russo, as you mentioned, but also to Schopenhauer Nietzsche. Heidegger, the existentialists, the critical theorists of the Frankfurt school have large swaths of the academic humanities. Uh, actually detest the enlightenment, ironically enough. Not by no means all of them, but, uh, but there's a significant faction.

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       Yeah. Well, the questionnaire I guess in part is why, I mean one of the things that really struck me as I've gone through this material over the last years is that this is really good news. Particularly it doesn't really matter whether you're on the left to the right. If you're on the left, you think that the fact that the poorest of the poor are being lifted out of abject, absolute abject misery at a rate. That's just. I don't think you could hope for a faster improvement no matter how optimistic you were. And then on the right of course, the fact that the benefits of liberal democracy, let's say and free markets are driving this in large part, you take would also be a cause for celebration. So there's the. You talked about the availability heuristic and some of the role that the press might be playing, the stock that negative events stand out.

Speaker 1:          00:16:46       We can also see negative events all over the world now, so we can't think of all over the world. Whenever you hear about a negative event, it's as if it's happening next door and is not as a threat. So are the breadth of our news is exaggerated and the coverage is exaggerated, but there still seems to me to be this, this mystery at the bottom of all this, which is in the face of such radically good news. Why is there such an insistence that the system is corrupt, that we're going to hell in a handbasket then that, you know, human beings are a cancer on the planet and everything is heading towards the apocalypse. It's, it's so, it's so deep and it doesn't seem to be moved by the fact much. I kind of think sometimes that it's a hangover from the cold war, you know, that was so deeply pessimistic for so long.

Speaker 2:          00:17:40       It goes back before the Cold War. It certainly as a, as a psychological syndrome, it goes back, at least to the Old Testament prophets who combined kind of social criticism with a, uh, fortunately at apocalyptic disaster, absolute that syndrome, that combination of a moral schooling with predictions of doom. It's something that our species quite naturally falls into. Part of it is frankly a certain amount of, uh, uh, interprofessional competition that society has various elites. A, there's the politicians, the business people, the military, religious elites, the academics, the journalists, they're always kind of competing for status since intellectuals don't deserve a whole lot of credit for getting society to run, for, for putting food in the stores. And that keeping the peace and, and, uh, protecting the streets. It's very easy to, uh, to look down on other societal elites on, on government, on business and to say, well, you guys are all failing and we're the ones who are morally a refined enough to point it out. I wouldn't, I wouldn't put down just a sheer human competitiveness. I'm not the first to say this. One of my favorite explanations of the veneration of, uh, of the past of golden ages comes from comms hogs. You said competition of praise, inclined to a reverence of antiquity or men contend with living not with a dead.

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       It also seems that the, um, there's a certain amount of resentment that is driving that as well. And that would go along with the status competition because there's anger. I suppose if you're a member of anemia group to see that your paradigm, let's say isn't leading the charge forward, um,

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       that's what I did. And you talked about the astonishing decline in global poverty and a part of that story is it did not come about through massive redistribution, which for, for many people on the left was the only route to lifting up the poor, namely to, to redistribute resources. Now that have been, of course adjust adjustments either shocks the fact that China and India and Bangladesh and Indonesia have risen out of poverty, uh, came in part of the expense of manufacturing jobs in the United States. That's not exactly what people meant by redistribution. And it literally is a redistribution of resources, although it is a shaking up of the economies of many, many nations. But this massive increase in the wealth of that Asian countries did not come because it was, the horses were, were shipped from the wealthy west to the impoverished east.

Speaker 1:          00:20:29       Right? So that's also a threat to the doctrine itself, a direct threat. The fact that wealth is being produced and it's being distributed to people at the low end means that implies that that redistributive philosophy is likely an error, and you can understand that might be regarded as a catastrophic threat, particularly the people on the radical left,

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       well certainly, certainly for radical notions of redistribution, but at the same time, the more limited kinds of redistribution that have, uh, that are ubiquitous in wealthy countries. I have a graph showing that the amount, the proportion of GDP allocated to social spending a skyrocketed in the 20th century from about one percent to about 22 percent in every developed country. No exceptions. Uh, and, uh, thanks to, to spending on the cooler on children on the sick, uh, on the rates of absolute poverty have fallen in wealthy countries. So not only, uh, have, uh, developed developing world become wealthier and not directly expensive the developed world, but in the developed world, thanks to some amount of social spending, I guess you could call it redistribution. Uh, the, even as inequality has risen, poverty has not.

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       Right? Right. I wonder, I was just reading a book by Walter Shadelle called the great leveler is an excellent book and one of the things he did was an empirical analysis of left versus right wing governments, I think across the 20th century, but it might've gone farther back then now to see if there was any difference in the Gini Coefficient across the classes of government. And what he found was that there was no difference whatsoever. He makes a fairly strong case that the only redistributive techniques that work our pestilence and war essentially, and that's because they knock everyone down to zero, but you're making a different case like an incremental case in some sense, which is that governments perhaps regardless of their ideological proclivities in the 20th centuries as they've become more wealthy, they have incrementally devoted the larger part of their, uh, of their resources to incremental improvements in. You might think about it as an investment in the future rather than redistribution or investment in social capital education and health care. Those sorts of things that,

Speaker 2:          00:22:55       well, it's probably, it's probably some combination. It's a combination of investment in public goods because of course the whole society is better off if, if everyone's educated, uh, also in assurance, people support a, a, a, a safety net that's most popular euphemism for social spending because you never know whether it's going to be you or your or your mother or your brother who's going to be, who's going to be a need in the lottery of misfortune. And then part of it's part of it is, is, uh, his charity, he was the modern conscience, won't allow the little match girl to freeze to death. The jokes to, to, to Barry, grandpa by the side of route 66. And so I think social spending has been pushed along by, by, uh, all three. Uh, it hasn't necessarily in some countries it probably has reduced the Gini Coefficient in western European countries which have a more aggressive system of taxation. The United States or Canada, but more important than the ginny distribution is that it's reduced the number of people living in poverty which are morally relevant measure at any case.

Speaker 1:          00:23:56       Yeah. So those two things are complicated because obviously you want to raise people out of abject poverty. I mean, that's, that's a, that's a zero argument proposition and that seems to be happening very rapidly. The question after that I suppose is to what degree does the remaining degree of inequality that's generated by productive capital assistance also constituted social threat? Because there is evidence it was reviewed best buy in the spirit level that as inequality increases rates of male homicide, for example, increase in all sorts of other negative measures. So there's some weird interaction between raising absolute levels of wealth and ensuring that inequality doesn't, I don't know, exceed some hypothetical optimal that, that, that needs to be considered in social policy.

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       Are there, I, I signed some skeptical Ri analysis of the data in the spirit level. And probably absolute prosperity matters more than inequality in determining a social health include such as happiness, crime, um, other kinds of social pathologies like drug addictions. Uh, it's not easy to try to tease them apart.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       No, definitely.

Speaker 2:          00:25:12       You know, countries like Sweden are a very egalitarian, but they're also very rich that are more lopsided, but they're also very poor and so it takes a little bit of statistical wizard rated to tie them apart and my reading of the literature is that it's actually prosperity that is more important than that at any quality. But also, and this is a point that in the psychological literature rate was emphasized by Christina's Storman's and Paul Bloom that what people sometimes think of as a sort of aversion to inequality to people having different amounts. It's actually an aversion to unfairness to injustice. Yeah. That, but people would really infuriates people who said they think that the people at the top half ill gotten gains equal if they sense that the system is basically fair, that either greater effort, talent, or even luck, uh, result in an unequal distribution of an impartial lottery, for example, that they're okay with that. It's cheating. That really.

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       Yeah. And people are really good at remembering cheating and recognizing it as well. Yeah. So, okay, so there is something we could talk about for a minute because you know, there's a, the, the is political. What do you call rumblings about the fact that I think a lot of this is generated by the radical left types, particularly on the campuses that the system is rigged and that it's an oppressive patriarchy. And that the reason that people were at the top is because they played power games. You know, it's this, my sense is that the control is that we're, we're ethnic or racial or gender groups and we're competing in the Marxist manner and those who win have one because of oppression. But I know the literature on the relationship between the individual individual differences and longterm life success in the Western world and the literature is actually very clear.

Speaker 1:          00:27:05       So intelligence seems to account for about 20 percent of the variance in longterm life success. And then trait conscientiousness accounts for perhaps another, maybe 10 to 15 percent. And then there's smaller contributions of emotional stability. Um, and also have trait openness, which seems to be a good predictor of entrepreneurial ability. So it looks like in the West that you can attribute about 40 to 50 percent of the variance, maybe that's a little high, but it's not. It's not radical over estimate to the sorts of individual differences that are associated with productivity because increases an Iq Higher Iq at higher conscientiousness definitely make people more productive. It seems to me that you can use that as an index of the, um, of the, of the genuinely meritocratic nature of a culture and also as an index of its willingness to engage in fair play because you'd expect if a, if your culture is aimed at productivity and it turns out that those are the most pr and it turns out that the most productive people are in fact differentially rewarded.

Speaker 1:          00:28:10       That seems to me to be a reasonable index of the success of the society. Now that data is still leaves 50 to 60 percent of the variance and explained. And so you can in there, you can include racism and prejudice and the tyranny of the system and blind luck and physical health and all the arbitrary random events that make up that determined whether someone is successful or failures in life. But it does seem to me to provide a metric saying that not only is our society crazily productive and reasonably and reasonably good at district distributing the spoils, even though there's still some inequality, but a fair bit of inequality is actually generated as a consequence of differences in genuine productivity that seem reasonable to you.

Speaker 2:          00:28:53       Uh, yeah, it, it, it ought to be obvious and the now except for the fact that in a lot of intellectual life, the assumption is that the correlation between psychological traits and success at zero. So the fact that it's what, you know, let's say it's 40 percent, let's say it's 33 percent, that's a lot higher than, than most people are willing to acknowledge. What you said is exactly right. That leaves more than half of the variance not to be correlated with individual differences. And of course various inequities could go into that. And they're not mutually exclusive.

Speaker 3:          00:29:32       It seems hard.

Speaker 2:          00:29:34       We know that there's a lot of gaming of the system, particularly. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:29:38       by the wealthy.

Speaker 2:          00:29:40       Uh, and that should obviously be eliminated. It's not meritocratic, not fair. It's not productive. We could also ask another question is whether the rewards that go to untalented aren't necessarily in sectors that lead to what we might call a productivity in the sense of, of, um, increasing societal wealth and an argument can be made that there is some misallocation of intellectual resources that we have. Uh, the, the economy is too driven by, by finance that the, uh, there are too many lawsuits. Legal system is who each other. Uh, and so, uh, arrested by intellectuals, this does still leave a, a, a place for criticizing a number of the, uh, uh, the ways in which our economy is set up. There's always scope for improvement.

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       Yes. We were talking about why despite the fact that a fair bit of the variance or a third to half of the variance in life success is taken up by, let's say, individual attributes. There's still room for a systemic critique that's valid.

Speaker 4:          00:30:45       Yeah. One of the pathologies of intellectual life that I, I wrote about it in the blank slate of the denial of human nature was that, uh, the in, in polite company in intellectual circles, the amount of life success determined by a inherent and largely heritable psychological traits has to be zero. I mean, that's just the, the, the, uh, uh, only acceptable position. And you and I know it's not zero.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       Well also just send me interject for one second. I'm also, there's a fairness element there. But the other thing is, it seems to me that that's extraordinary extraordinarily selfserving of people too, because if you get together with a group of Harvard professors, for example, it's pretty obvious that their innate intelligence is one of the factors that determine their success and to deny the fact that heritable differences make a difference means perhaps to act as an Avatar of a social justice orientation, but equally to deny the role of, of the benefits of chance in your own success and to therefore lack a certain degree of humility that you might otherwise be required to have. So it's not at all. And I'm not claiming that you were implying this at all, but it's not all in the service of higher social ideals that people denied the contribution of, of heritable components. For example, the birth laundry. So, whoops, we just stepped. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:32:20       Uh, unfortunately the video just froze. And after you said, I'm not saying you claim this, you suddenly froze on the screen, so I'm not saying you're claiming this.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       Sure. Well, it's just, it seems self serving for people who are particularly bright, for example, to not be grateful for the fact that they won the genetic lottery in that, in that manner, and sufficiently humble to not know what the role of that arbitrary chance in determining their success. I mean, it's not like they don't deserve their success because of that. But claiming a certain degree of biological determinism doesn't necessarily make you a bad person even though it can be read that way because it makes you very sensitive to your own good fortune if you, if you think it through carefully.

Speaker 4:          00:33:13       Oh absolutely. In fact, successful people are the winners of at least three lotteries. One of them that you mentioned, of course it's the Connecticut lottery, the fact that some people were born with greater intelligence and conscientiousness and openness to experience. Another is that there's a, a second lottery in a human development that is not strictly genetic, but it is in a sense of constitutional or developmental. The fact that I might consider this, one of the most profound discoveries in the history of psychology that correlations between identical twins reared together are generally on the order of five point five and they share not only their genome, but uh, the vast amount of their environments, their parents, their neighborhoods, their older siblings or younger sibs. The number of books in the house, number of guns in the house, number of tvs in the house, they're not indistinguishable.

Speaker 4:          00:34:08       Identical twins are a correlate quite highly, but no one near perfectly. Which means that there is a second lottery that has to do either with just the way the brain congeals during development, which can be specified down to the last snips by the genes and perhaps by chance life events, which might leave unpredictable traces that we can't add a document store or systematically understand. Then of course there's the third lottery of what happens to you in your profession. Did you bet on the right sector? Did you happen to have a good relationship with the boss? Numerous.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       It's a matter of being in the right place at the right time,

Speaker 4:          00:34:55       the right time. So all that having been said, um, and, and you're, you're absolutely right. We have to acknowledge the role of a, of hereditary temperament. Untalent be known zero role of chance, and that still leaves a big chunk of the variants that could be due to a systemic features of the system that perhaps ought to be changed. There's just no doubt that the wealthy game, the system, particularly in the United States in a number of ways that don't work to the benefit of society at large. There are also aspects of the system that are perhaps fair but irrational. The fact that so much of our intellectual talent now gets sucked into finance. Now, of course we do need a financial sector and it's weird that they're smart people in it, but having a lot of our brain power devoted to figuring out how to act on financial information, Microsoft microsecond faster than ones competitors is probably not the best use of our societies. Intellectual capital. Likewise, there's no doubt that we have far too much brain power invested in a legal system in a corporation suing each other patent trolling a and another not so productive uses.

Speaker 1:          00:36:08       The funny thing is too though, that there's an erotica erotica of pathology in in a system. In some sense. I mean, one of the things that struck me quite hard for example, is that if you look at the creativity curves across the lifespan, they matched the criminality curves almost perfectly, and one of the things that make me think when I was doing that research was so as young men become more antisocial, they also become more creative. Even though those things might not be correlated, but they do map on top of one another. I was taking in a society like the United States, which has a fair degree of criminality, but also a fair degree of creativity. We have no idea how loose the system has to be so that malfeasance can thrive so that it can also be similar caneously loose enough so that creativity can thrive, right? Because you might think if you were optimistic that you can tighten up the system and get rid of the criminal behavior without adding a totalitarian layer to this system that would also simultaneously demolish, you know, individual variability and creativity. We just, our models just aren't sophisticated enough to see such things apart, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:37:20       Well, there, there I, I'm not so sure there. I mean, I, I do agree with you, there's a certain amount of, uh, risk taking or young men on the bake that might underlie both criminality and a productive creativity. But, uh, over the course of history, I think one of the accomplishments of civilization and indeed have a, uh, an enlightenment driven progress is that we have managed to tease them apart. Just two examples are the fact that the rate of homicide punished by a factor of about 35 from the Middle Ages to the 20th century, and that in fact that includes the scientific revolution, the industrial revolution lightened meant into all of the advances of the 20th century. So justice people were not stabbing each other. So for instance, if they were also coming up with the theory of evolution and the atomic theory of matter, and then again, 19 nineties when the rate of violent crime in the United States fell by half and they were also declines in Canada, Britain, other western countries. This certainly it was not a time of economic stagnation or.

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       No, no, no. Fair enough. I guess then the question starts to become is how in the world did those things get teased apart so that we are able to regulate anti social behavior without simultaneously making things excessively rigid, unregulated, totalitarian. We managed it. Maybe it's part of that same incremental process that you detailed out at the beginning of our talk. You know, another thing that struck me about your book that was quite interesting, I thought it was that you list the names of a very large number of totally unsung heroes and those are people in. We have a very interesting table near the beginning where you list, I think about 10 names, maybe 12 of people who've saved between hundreds of billions and billions of lives with their scientific, but they're incremental scientific productivity. And yet those are people that are by no means household names. That's another place where things don't make the news.

Speaker 4:          00:39:17       Yes, absolutely. And it's a, it's funny how our moral, a crediting our moral, our awarding of moral Brownie points doesn't quite correlate with how much good it often doesn't at all correlate. Uh, and the case of the inventors of synthetic fertilizer, vaccines of chlorination, of public water, supplies of the green revolution in agriculture are, are pretty much unknown. And they literally say billions of lives a. whereas various reformers and profits and agitators are a pretty well known. A number of, uh, uh, certainly people who are sanctioned by the Roman Catholic Church who have to perform a miracle that might resolve it, results in saving one life, of course, in fact did not because miracles don't happen, but the fact that that definition of saint has nothing to do with saving lives on skills of millions or billions to shows like human moral sense is not really well calibrated to morality as we would a defended by, I think it was stolen who said something like a single death is a tragedy, but a million deaths is a statistic. He actually didn't say it, but, uh, but it's, it's, it's a conventionally attributed to him. So let's say for good reason. I mean, I suppose I could have said it to or I guess maybe the same thing plays in reverse a, is that

Speaker 1:          00:40:50       the saving of a single life has a narrative punch and the incremental savings of 100 million lives, especially through prevention. That's another problem, right? Because prevention isn't dramatic because the terrible thing merely doesn't happen. And that's not,

Speaker 4:          00:41:06       um, I, I rather cheekily wrote an article on the human moral sense that began with a, who do you, who do you think is most morally praiseworthy, Mother Teresa or Bill Gates or Norman Borlaug. And this was before a gates is pivot from a computer technology to philanthropy was, was well known. It was about 10 years ago. And I set it up as a bit of a trick question because of course everyone would say mother Teresa, even in our field and in of moral psychology, whenever a speaker has to pull out at the end example of a particularly moral person, Mother Teresa is the stereotype. Even though if you ask people, well, what exactly did she accomplish? Uh, how many lives did she save? How many sick people did she actually cure? A, it's very hard to come up with our actual accomplishment. What does Bill Gates has already been credited with saving perhaps 100 million lives through his efforts to eliminate effective infectious disease loving world. And Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974. His role in fomenting the green revolution probably saved a billion lives, selective breeding of hybrid crops that required less fertilizer that could be grown twice a year, less water, higher yields, less susceptibility to disease, uh, which are countries like Mexico and India from, from basket cases to exporters of food in, in, in less than a decade.

Speaker 5:          00:42:32       Right. Do you think that would be a story that everyone in in elementary and junior high school would learn because it's such a remarkable, absolutely remarkable story and no one, I mean, I don't know what percentage of people would know his name, his name, but I don't imagine it's, it's, I suspect it's in the low percentages if that.

Speaker 4:          00:42:51       I, I, I'm, I'm sure that's right. I think it may have been a change. I seem to recall a, although I hate to begin any sentence with when I was young, uh, but we, we did read a heroic biographies of medical pioneers, like the discover of intuitive and that Thomas Edison, and I don't know if that kind of a heroic biography of the innovator of the inventor, a scientist is as common in children's education.

Speaker 5:          00:43:23       Yeah, I suspect I strongly suspect not. It certainly wouldn't be in Canada given the tilt that our education system has taken. So. Alright, so a couple of a couple of broader questions. Again, if you don't mind, you have a whole corpus of work and there are recurrent themes in some sense. One of them being things are getting better in ways that we really don't know and what are you, what if you could have what you wanted with regards to the impact of your books, what, what would you want that impact to be and also what do you think like one of the things I've done on twitter recently because I'm trying to figure out how to use twitter is to tilt my tweets towards people like human progress.org. Someone you site in your introduction and people who are purveying information while including yourself by the way, who are purveying information about how much better things are getting and so what impact would you like to have your books have and how do you see that playing out psychologically, politically, and what do you think people who are listening now say could do practically to get the good news out, so to speak?

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       Certainly intellectual life should be more data driven. How bad you shouldn't be allowed to say or talk about any reported trend based on an event that happened yesterday or this year because trend means change over time. And in so many areas we really do have data and it's just irresponsible not to cite those data, particularly since they have become increasingly available through websites like our world and data and keeping progress. So I'd like to see a replacement of ideological debate, which so much of our current debate is, it's whether the right or the left is more St Louis Moral, uh, praiseworthy correct. And more, uh, well, well, let's look at the data. It chances are that neither an off the shelf position of the left door, an off the shelf position of the right is likely to have it all figured out. No one is on this event or infallible.

Speaker 4:          00:45:31       These ideologies go back to the, to the French revolution, and they're unlikely to be the font of solutions to complex problems. What? Let's try to see what works and what doesn't and come up with the mixture of what is most likely to solve our problems. Spoken like a true proponent of the enlightenment. Yeah, I guess, uh, and stepping back even farther, I would like to see a greater integration of the, um, uh, the insights and mindset of the science into social and cultural affairs. As we talked about earlier in the conversation. This very idea is often met with horror. I don't just. The humanities types I suppose in some sense, aren't very happy with the idea that they'd have to learn statistics. And I can, I have a certain amount of sympathy for that perspective. But. Well, there isn't. Yes, there is a, a horror therapy, uh, expanding realm of five member in data.

Speaker 4:          00:46:29       And a horror, Epi, a thought that, uh, ideas about human nature from, uh, from science, from evolutionary psychology, from behavioral genetics, from social and personality and cognitive psychology might be brought to bear on our understanding of society, of justice, of, of art, literature, fiction. Quite contrary to be the mindset of the enlightenment where all of the enlightened few us off. We're a pretty serious psychologists. It'd be the field didn't exist at the time, so they weren't called that, but they a mind the observations from, from travelers and missionaries and, uh, and explorers, Opi ways of other cultures. They relied on their own observations and common sense. They tapped into what brain science existed at the time. So it's not a, it's hardly a radical idea that our understanding of, uh, of art and culture and society should be informed by our, of human nature. But now the disciplines have become so professionalized and they're housed in different buildings on campus and they're rivals for the money from the dean. Uh, there's a great hostility to the old enlightenment idea of consilience is often a, a, a, a paranoid fear that this means that the sciences we'll take over the humanities, which of course is preposterous. They wouldn't, they would want to, they couldn't there be good.

Speaker 5:          00:47:53       No, and I think the sciences can really inform the humanities. I mean, versa. Yeah. I'd been trained as a scientist. My appreciation for the humanities is actually substantially deepened.

Speaker 4:          00:48:04       So in here, and indeed in many fields, this is a complete my, what am I own fields of linguistics. It's just taken for granted that. And no one really cares where the humanities influences. I ended the scientific ones. Studies of philology of classical grammar, of a, of texts now blend into a statistical studies of Corpora of laboratory studies have speech and language processing. And uh, the where the science ends up in the ends off the humanities begins. No one even talks to him.

Speaker 5:          00:48:39       The science can also really change. Can really change your mind. Like I've looked at individual differences in relationship to political belief. And so I've learned three things from doing that that I think are revolutionary have been revolutionary for me. So the first is that I'm liberal. Lefty types are characterized by higher trade, openness and lower conscientiousness, and then conservatives, the reverse and I, I think, well that's quite interesting because it puts the liberal left types into creative entrepreneurial domain because that's characterized by high openness and it puts the conservative types in the managerial and administrative domain. And so that implies that the liberal left types create new ideas and new enterprises including entrepreneurial enterprises because the data there is fairly solid. Whereas the conservative types manage and administer those enterprises and so each needs the other. And so there's that nice polarity dynamic. And then there's also the idea that the reason that openness and conscientiousness unite to predict political behaviors because of borders.

Speaker 5:          00:49:44       So open people liked the borders between concepts to be fluid so that there's information exchange and they're not orderly. The liberal types because they're not conscientious. And so they don't see any utility in keeping things categorically distinct. Whereas the conservatives are afraid of the contamination of things because of the movement of information and they like to see the borders between things to to ensure that that's the case. So the reason that openness conscientiousness stack together as predictors of political behavior seems to be because of the two fundamentally different attitudes toward towards borders all the way from the conceptual to the political, so the right wingers think while borders are good because that stops and contamination is a real problem and a definitely problem often and the liberal lefty type state, no, no. We want as much information to flow as possible and both of those perspectives are valid and need to be discussed.

Speaker 5:          00:50:40       Then the other thing I learned from the American empirical data was that orderliness, which is part of the part of conscientiousness predicts conservatism, is associated with disgust, sensitivity and so that that feeds that desire to maintain borders so that there's no cross contamination that's associated with what's been called the behavioral immune system, and so those are actually quite revolutionary ideas from the perspective of political theory or political belief is temperamentally determined that the reason that the two temperamental traits determined political belief is because of a difference in attitude, fundamental difference in attitude towards the borders between things that you can make a case for open and closed borders on evolutionary grounds and that there's a. there's an association between conservatism and discussed, which for me shed tremendous light, for example, and the motivations of Hitler who was an extraordinarily orderly person and who used disgust oriented language all the time when he was formulating his policies of extermination. So those are revolutionary contributions of individual, different science to political theory. It's all driven by hard data statistically derived.

Speaker 4:          00:51:49       Well, I, I agree and I can sense the kind of paranoid reaction that these claims might elicit among some traditional political theorists and thinkers that, oh, are you saying that the conservative beliefs are nothing but an expression of disgust sensitivity, and of course it doesn't apply, that he's a fascinating findings. Don't say that the earned income tax credit is a good or a bad idea, or the Paris climate accords themselves. The issue still have to be decided on their merits the other hand, if you do, if you are aware of your own potential biases than that, that is a source of insight. It's a source of understanding. It could cause you to step back from your own convictions and be more receptive to arguments on both sides. Of course, that was definitely done. That for me, that it can't not be a helpful. CanNot be an important source of insight as to how political debates unfold.

Speaker 5:          00:52:48       Yeah. Well, if you know that the liberal left types are necessary for the fostering of new enterprises and the Conservatives are necessary to run them, then that certainly indicates why both groups not only are necessary, but are all of mutual benefit. Somebody has to maintain systems and someone has to expand them and those things are gonna work in opposition to one another because expanding a system often fragmented, so there's gonna be tension, but no system can remain static forever and, and, and completely untrammeled transformation throws everything into chaos. So there obviously has to be a dialogue between those viewpoints like a, it's like an opponent process issue essentially. And

Speaker 4:          00:53:30       yes. And, and, uh, all of us ought to be more aware, have more insight into how our own psych, psychological proclivities might, uh, affect the positions that seem to each of us to be obvious.

Speaker 5:          00:53:46       Well, and that is what they do, right? Because the temperamental variable or variables actually tell you what is self evident. That's how they operate.

Speaker 4:          00:53:55       My understanding from, from the literature that you're citing, is that the, the, uh, variance and opinions that is correlated with personality differences, uh, is also the hardest to get people to give up to, to persuade them.

Speaker 5:          00:54:09       Yeah. Well, I, no doubt because I think the, those temperamental differences are like axiomatic values, you know, and they're grounded and I think they're grounded in the hyper development of separate circuitry. So it's going to be very, very mean. And I also think that like, if you're an x, if you're an introvert, you want to learn to be an extrovert, you have to learn it. Micro skill by micro skill, right? There's no revolution, there's no revolutionary cognitive transformation that's going to turn you into an extrovert. You can pick up the skills, but it's bit by bit and it's incremental. And so I think it's the same with political attitudes is you can develop an appreciation for the viewpoint of people who are on the other side of the temperamental divide, but it's a, it's an increment by increment advance and it's very, very effortful but necessary.

Speaker 5:          00:54:59       It's necessary. You know, it's been really useful to me to see where the cognitive, sociological, political utility of both political temperaments lights and, and, and why it's so crucially important. I mean, with regards to disgust sensitivity, I mean, you might think, well that's pure reduct purely reductionistic with regards to the conservative viewpoint. But no, a lot of people in history have died as a consequence of cross cultural contamination, right? I mean there are estimates that up to 90 percent, maybe even 95 percent of the native Americans parish because of their exposure to the Spaniards. Right? And so the idea that contamination is a problem when, when two things that were distinct unite is, is, is a truism and it's a powerful evolutionary force and equally powerful as the observation that. Well, yeah, despite that, despite that though, the benefit of information flow, free information flow and trade is so overwhelming that you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Speaker 4:          00:56:01       Yes. It's the case where the, the, uh, evolutionary adaptive value of a, uh, of a motive or a, an emotion is explicable. And we can also recognize that thanks to advances in science and technology, the emotions themselves are no longer particularly effective defenses against, uh, this case infection by my pathogens. We have much better ways of protecting ourselves, but we are stuck with these ancient adaptations which are, are no longer quite so adaptive. It can be harmful, especially to treat other people on the metaphor of contaminants are pathogens. And you're certainly right that in, in, in Hitler's rhetoric, despite the fact that he is often a claimed to have used eugenic ideas to motivate a genocide against the Jews, much more of his language came from, uh, from pathology and histology.

Speaker 5:          00:57:01       Oh yeah. It's contempt. And there was a parasite

Speaker 4:          00:57:07       parasites. Exactly. Microbiology, not genetics that Hitler is

Speaker 5:          00:57:14       ideas. So I thought we might close by. I have a question for you about your, your derivation of these moral virtues specifically from the enlightenment. And I'm curious about that because. Well, first of all, you could make a case that it wasn't so much the enlightenment as it was the specifically the rise of empirical science. And then you could of course have a discussion about how those two things are related, but I'm also curious. I've been reading Ian mcgilchrist book, the master and his emissary and mcgill. Chris makes a pretty strong case. I would say that get the rationalistic enlightenment values are in some sense a consequence of the articulation of an underlying set of principles that are more metaphoric in nature, more narrative in nature. The case I also made in my book maps of meaning and to some degree in 12 rules for life that the enlightenment project and it's rationalities nested inside a deeper web of metaphor and ritual and image that would be associated with longer scale cognitive processes, some of which are expressed in religious thinking, but some of which are grounded in not so much rationality as in motivation and emotion and the way your book is structured.

Speaker 5:          00:58:28       And I think the way enlightenment thinkers think is that there was a miracle of sorts that occurred sometime in the last three to 500 years and people woke up and became rational. And then the question is to what degree was the ground for that awakening? Prepared by events that weren't the awakening itself, but there were associated with other processes and I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are on that.

Speaker 4:          00:58:54       Uh, there's nothing new under the sun and a good intellectual historian can find the antecedents of any intellectual movement in various precursors. Um, you know, it's hard to. I don't think there's a lot in the enlightenment that can specifically be attributed to, to, um, to a religion, particularly Christianity just based on the fact that it was already around for a thousand years and nothing much happened. So it couldn't be religion or Christianity itself. Although there are, as you say, there are strands that were carried over for in particular, and this is an insight that I got from my other half, Rebecca Goldstein, my wife, uh, who, who are, you've appeared on stage with winter. The one thing that the Greeks didn't have that, uh, the Christianity did was the idea of compassion for the week and, and universal human flourishing. You don't really have that for all of the brilliance of a, of ancient Greece.

Speaker 4:          00:59:52       That wasn't a, a big feat. But the enlightenment, of course, did not spring out of, out of nowhere, if I were to identify the emphases, what your why, what, what happened prior to the 18th century that allowed her to fold them as opposed to a couple of hundred years earlier, a couple of hundred years later, one of them was the scientific revolution of conventionally located in the, in the 17th century, which not only provided a kind of a paradigm for understanding, namely a testing propositions against the empirical world, seeking deeper naturalistic explanations for phenomena. And which, of course overturned a millennia, old dogmas reminding people that they're their own common sense, their own societies, convictions were fallible. So that was, uh, an essential precursor. Another one was the discovery of the, uh, of the new world, that there were entire civilizations, entire world, literally worlds in the sense that it had been a unknown, that the knowledge base that they had been part of a Western civilization for, for Millennia was radical, incomplete.

Speaker 4:          01:01:07       And technologically, I suspect that the greater, uh, exchange of ideas and people, uh, was a contributor of the prior to the, just prior to the lightning in the second half of the 18th century, there's a massive growth in the efficiency of a printing printing presses itself, but it was the democratization of books and pamphlets, the rise literacy, uh, and the movement of people. It became easier for, uh, for, for heretics and radicals to jump ship and move to where things were cooler, if things got too uncomfortable where they were. And it's amazing how many of the enlightenment thinkers were persecuted for their beliefs, who they were threatened with, imprisonment or death. Many of them ended up in Holland or Paris or London, or jumped around to wherever they had made the greatest freedom, but also just the sheer, a kind of precursor of the, uh, the web today. The fact that pamphlet can be introduced and within a few months and it will be translated into a dozen European languages and, and smuggled in. So the exchange of ideas, uh, I think it helped to accelerate the route, although since it only happened once in human history, we can never really know for sure why it happened, when it did. But those are three good hypo.

Speaker 5:          01:02:32       Yes. Well, and we're in an interesting time now where we can sit and make a video like this and publish it almost instantaneously and share it with half a million people. I mean that, that ability to share ideas rapidly as developing a pace and God only knows what the consequence of that is. We're, we're in a situation now which has only occurred to me about last year where the spoken word for the first time in human history has the same breach and longevity as the written word. And it's easier for people to listen. No audio books are becoming very popular. Lots and lots of people listen to podcasts. You know, I have working class people come to my talks all the time and say, look, I'm sitting in my forklift for three hours a day and I'm doing nothing but listening to podcasts, you know. So that's, that's a really remarkable thing.

Speaker 5:          01:03:18       So I think, I think I'm going to let you go. You've been very generous with your time. I appreciate the conversation very much. I'm going to close by showing your book again, Steven Pinker's, new book and lightened now, which is tearing up the bestseller charts and which is a guide to proper end intelligent optimism in the 21st century. And maybe I'd ask you just in closing, what do you think there are things that individuals, what do you think individuals should be particularly optimistic about right now and what do you think individuals could do to spread the message that things are getting better and that we can solve our problems?

Speaker 4:          01:04:00       The fact that there are new efforts to try transcend political divisions and find out what works. I tend to politicize and rationalize a problems like poverty, like climate change, a light like war and peace like crime. Those are very much worth supporting organizations like at a political. There are ngos that try to monitor the state of the world. There's effective altruism. There's just the general application of rationality to solve our problems that is responsible for the progress that we've enjoyed in the past and if there's going to be progress ahead of us will be responsible for what will enjoy in the future.

Speaker 5:          01:04:46       All right, well I'm, I'm, I'm would like to close to by mentioning to everyone who's listening that you know, things are getting better. They're getting better because people are facing problems and actually trying to solve them. They're doing micro analysis of the problems, breaking them down into their constituent elements, being humbled enough to use incremental solutions to solve them and to address them at, at, at a high level of resolution instead of a low level of or a low resolution level of ideological debate. And it's really working. And I would, um, what would we say encourage people to pick up Dr Baker's book because the world is getting better and we should know it and we should be happy about it and we should continue to foster that development in every way that we can. And I think this is an excellent book as an excellent contribution to that effort as well as your other books like are, are better, better, better, better angels of our nature. So thank you very much for spending the time with me today and for talking with me and it was a pleasure to meet you. Thanks so much. Thanks for having to Jordan. The pleasure was mine.
