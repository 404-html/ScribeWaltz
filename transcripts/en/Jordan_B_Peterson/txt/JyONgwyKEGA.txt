Speaker 1:          00:00:16       So I'm talking today with Nina Paley, who's a brilliant animator and she's making a variety of short films, which I guess are going to be joined together into a longer film about that feature, old testament themes, and she's the creator of the animated musical features. Sita sings the blues, her adventures in our broken copyright system, let her to join question, copyright.org as artists in residence in 2008 where she produced a series of animated shorts about intellectual freedom called minute means or recently she made this land is mine, which is absolutely brilliant, shocking, a devastating and also aesthetically impressive film about Israel Palestine, Canaan, the Levant, and that's intended for her new feature film sadomasochism. And you can find a lot of Nina's pieces of pieces of that film online. And I would highly recommend watching the wheel, a couple of them into this interview so that you can see what she's up to. So I guess there's two things that we could really talk about. I think that most important one obviously is your work, but I guess the second one is your concern for intellectual freedom and your feeling with regards to two copyrights.

Speaker 2:          00:01:47       Copying is not stealing and less less copying. It makes one thing. That's what toppings for copying is not the one for me and one for you. That's what God is doing. There's one for each of us. That is what we call copy sharing ideas with everyone. That's why it caught me,

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       but let's, let's start. Let's start by talking about you first tell, tell my listeners and tell me who you are and where you come from and what you're about.

Speaker 3:          00:02:46       You want to know about my identity. I guess that's, that's. Yeah, trust me to identify myself. I don't trust myself there. Well that's okay. You're the best source we have today. Actually. I'm not, am not sure about that. Um, I mean, I think most of us would agree that I'm an artist and currently an animator. I guess I've been doing animation since 1998. Uh, before that I was a newspaper cartoonist is still do comics from time to time. Not very often, I mean, I guess the thing is I've just been, I just came back from a bike ride and I've just been thinking about identity like all the time and how incredibly unreliable it is and how I don't respect it, including ways that I identify myself.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       Well I guess that's part of being an artist, you know, because people who are artistic or high in trait openness and that gives them a very fluid identity. I mean it's an advantage because people who are high in openness can think loudly and they're always coming up with creative ideas, but it does tend to make their identity rather pluralistic and sometimes unstable. And that could also be a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:03:59       Well, I guess I guess it's not even that it's fluid. It's not like, oh, I identify this way one day and this way another day. It's just, I don't really currently have much respect for the idea of identity at all. Uh, and I could say all kinds of things about myself, but you know, does that actually do me any good?

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       Well, let me ask you a couple of basic questions. Where do you live?

Speaker 3:          00:04:24       I live in Urbana, Illinois. That's verifiable. Alright, and where were you born? I was born in her band.

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       So you've been there your whole life essentially?

Speaker 3:          00:04:33       No, I left when I was 20. I moved to Santa Cruz, California and I wanted to be a hippie. I failed a. But then you know, I was already out on my own. So I briefly moved to Austin, Texas. That didn't work out. I moved to San Francisco in 1991. I lived there for 11 years. In 2002 I had followed my then boyfriend. Actually we were legally married, so my then husband to India, uh, which is the subject, one of the subjects of Sita sings the blues. And then later in 2002 I moved to Brooklyn, New York and lived in various places in New York for a total of about 10 years. I moved back to her Urbana in 2012 right after my father died. And here I am.

Speaker 1:          00:05:16       And so why did you move back to her band and after all that adventuring?

Speaker 3:          00:05:20       First I was done with New York. Even though I really love New York, especially know my first five years there, I was fantastic. I kind of achieved more than I even expected I would be able to and started to just get the love affair with New York kind of wore off and I wanted a little more peace and quiet and I wanted cooler summers and I didn't want to smell garbage everywhere all the time. Uh, I had an opportunity to move back here because my dad died. My mom was threatening to sell the house. I joined the occupy movement, occupy moms house, trying to keep her from selling that house.

Speaker 1:          00:06:05       You actually had a specific demand with your occupied movement.

Speaker 3:          00:06:11       Failed. She sold the house anyway, but I think in our new house, yeah, I was, I was dating somebody that lived here and uh, that has ended, but I actually really like it. It's much more relaxed and inexpensive. I get lots of fresh air. I take lots of bike rides and I don't really care about, uh, the less stressed out identity less.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       Yes. Well you have plenty of adventure, so obviously. So I guess it must take a fair bit of, I would think time of quiet and, and, and some isolation in order to work on your animation.

Speaker 3:          00:06:53       Yeah, well I achieved that quite an isolation in New York actually by just living in New York in an apartment by myself. I would rather live in New York than visit New York because when you live there you can actually control your environment somewhat and you can shut everything out. Whereas when you're visiting usually have to be out all the time being overstimulated.

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       Rick. Yes. Well it's definitely an overstimulating place. So you. When did you start doing your animation?

Speaker 3:          00:07:21       I started animating as an adult in 1998. Before that I had done some animation when I was 13 years old using a borrowed super eight camera and I just completely stopped because I was in central Illinois and there was no support for doing animation. There was no way I could have advanced beyond the neighbor super eight camera. Uh, but then in 1998 I was burning out of my daily comic strip and wanted to do something and borrowed somebody else's super eight camera and in 1998 it was easier to advance, especially in San Francisco where a lot of people were doing independent film and yeah, I just picked up where I left off. I did plasticine clay stuff on super eight and shared that film with a band called Nick Phelps in the sprocket ensemble that did live music to animation and that was really fun. I was being gratified by audience feedback and so I made another film on 16 millimeter and then my next film was drawing and scratching on 35 millimeter. And then my next film after that was drawing and scratching on Imax film, which is 70 millimeter. Really big frames. And then I got into flash, macromedia flash and I've been digital ever since.

Speaker 1:          00:08:45       Are you using macromedia flash now? What's your primary technology?

Speaker 3:          00:08:49       A lot of those clips for sadomasochism more animated in macromedia flash, adobe flash and crippled it and ruined it in the opinion of many flash animators. So I'm still using macromedia flash from 1990 2007. Is that when my copy of flashes from, I don't know, macromedia flash eight. It only runs on older computers actually I think it might be from 2006 or 2005. So I have this old Mac here, a running ios 10 point six because it won't run on any more recent machines and uh, you know, it's like impossible to integrate with a modern video editing system. So I have a new Mac as well. And the newer parts though Sadomasochism I'm using a program called Moho pro 12, which is kept up and runs on modern computers.

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       Yeah, it's funny how sometimes software peaks in terms of complexity and usability and then it goes downhill,

Speaker 3:          00:09:52       you know, I think we're seeing that not just with software but with computers altogether, like personal computers I think peaked around 2007, maybe 2010 and they've been getting worse ever since. Like any sort of upgrade to operating systems just means more surveillance and less user freedom at this point.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       Yes. As well as the steep learning curve. What annoying. If you happen to be an expert with the previous system,

Speaker 3:          00:10:18       yeah. Anyway, I don't know if I don't know if I can keep animating digitally, uh, because it, you know, like the software that I'm using now motto, I just found out that the person that created it and was an integral part of it's team this whole time just left the company. So, uh, you know, we'll host faith is unclear and I'm like, if I have to learn a whole other piece of software again, I just don't know if I can take this anymore. I mean, I'm so fluent with flash. It took me years to become fluent at all. Whoa. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       Yeah. Well that's another thing is that it takes a long time to become an expert user of a complex software program and then when it shifts the ground shifts from underneath you, it's rather disheartening because all of that expertise is essentially disappears. And I guess it's part of what we're experiencing as our technology advances fast enough so that our lifespans are too long really to keep up. You know, we get, we get outdated and superannuated on about a five year rotation and it does get exhausting.

Speaker 3:          00:11:20       Yeah. Well maybe I'll just die early. Won't have to worry about that. That'll solve the problem. Then you won't feel finished your film. And now it seems like a bad idea. Well, I'm going to finish this film. I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel for sadomasochism.

Speaker 1:          00:11:33       Good for you. So, so let, let me ask you something about that. So now you made this land is mine. When was that?

Speaker 3:          00:11:41       That was in 2012 I think it was. That's the first scene that I made.

Speaker 4:          00:12:09       God gave this to me. I see.

Speaker 3:          00:15:00       So it's going to be the last scene in the film, but it's the first one that I made.

Speaker 1:          00:15:04       I see. And what, what possessed you to make that?

Speaker 3:          00:15:08       So I knew I wanted to make a movie about Passover because I was ready to just observing Passover, although not much else. And so I was doing research. I'd never seen the movie exodus, you know, that movie. I'd never seen it. So I watched it as part of my research and I learned that the theme music had lyrics written to it by Pat Boone and that it was a really popular song in the sixties. Tons of artists did it. I'd never even heard it before. So I heard it and I just thought it was ridiculous. Right? This land is mine. God gave this land to me. I mean, any. Everyone would say that, right? Everybody, every group feels that way about the land that they're on, every single one. So the absurdity of it was just apparent in the song and no, there wasn't even really a process of coming up with a concept for it. It was just that was what the song evoked for me. It was just showing how every single person, or not every single person, but every single tribe has that attitude towards their land. And so saying that this land is yours and God gave this land to me, gives you no authority at all because every. I mean that's just what it is to be a tribe living on land.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       So what's, what sort of reaction did you garner from this land is mine,

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       this land is mine is the most popular thing I have ever made. It's been viewed on various channels more than 10 million times. Uh, and you know, many people like it in terms of criticism, the criticism seems equally divided between people that say that I'm a Zionist and people that say I'm an anti Zionist, so it's either a really anti Zionist film or it's a really Zionist film.

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       I see. So you can just add that criticism together in sum to zero and ignore it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:03       Yeah. Well, I'm really flattered by it, right? Because if people that passionately, you know, I'm on polar opposite sides are saying that, then I feel like I've really done something. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       Well, you've definitely done something right. I mean, I think that was the first film of yours that I saw and then I've watched many of them. I think everyone I could get my hands on since then and instruct me in a variety of ways. I mean, the first thing that's, let's say strange about your animation is that it's this. If first of all, you have great taste, didn't use it,

Speaker 3:          00:17:38       I'll get the best. And how do you get permission? How do you be done to? Good. Oh, you're doing. I don't really, really. How's that working out for you? Well, okay. In the case of this land is mine. It's pretty clear cut, fair use because the film is parody, like I said it, it's literally a parody of those lyrics and you know, that's fair use. Uh, I, I actually think most of my uses are fair use, their transformative, but a lot of uses are not as clear cut as parody. So that's actually a really interesting issue with the film and how is this film going to be released and how's it going to be shown because there is no, no way I am going to ask for permission to use this music, particularly music that entered my head as a child, uh, which I did not consent to and I had no control over it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       Of course nobody has any control over what goes into your head, right? Like you'd go out in the world and music is playing, it goes into your head, uh, and yet once it's there, that part of your head that it occupies belongs to a corporation. And I'm just done asking corporations for permission to use what's in my head, which they put there. Okay. So you basically solve the problem by saying to hell with it, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this no matter what. And you're going to hire note whatever difficulties there are with that as you move along. It's an illegal film. I mean, in the case of Sita sings the blues, I Made Sita sings the blues when I was, I was certainly questioning in copyright, but I didn't really see it as a completely bankrupt institution. So when that film was done, I cleared all the rights, which was an incredibly difficult process and required hiring intermediaries because the rights holders don't talk to normal people.

Speaker 3:          00:19:38       So if you do make a film and you don't have permission to use the music in it, you can't simply ask for permission. They won't talk to you. So you have to pay lawyers. And intermediaries, just for them to even listen to you to tell you how much money they're demanding, which is inevitably an absurd amount that you can't afford. But I ended up spending a mere $70,000 to make sita sings the blues legal to show for free and legal to share for free. If I wanted some other model, it would have been more than that $70,000 to be able to give it away. Uh, but I'm not doing that with a new film. The new film, I'm making an illegal film. All of my music choices have to do not with their licenses, but with the content and meaning and resonance of the songs. Most songs have a kind of cultural resonance that is related to the point in time they were circulating. For example, this land is mine, you know, refers directly to this period of the sixties. Yeah. It has a cultural resonance because of that. Which a new song. If I commissioned a new song, sort of like that, it wouldn't have the same meaning at all.

Speaker 1:          00:20:52       No, definitely no. Songs like that they pick up. It's really interesting to watch what happens to a song across time because it picks up again, it's embedded in the context and that context grows and develops and transforms. The song is really a mutable entity. You know, it, it transforms tremendously as it moves across time.

Speaker 3:          00:21:11       Yeah. And that. And that meaning comes from the audience. It doesn't come from even the person that wrote it, let alone the copyright holder. Right. The value of it comes from us.

Speaker 1:          00:21:21       Okay. So back to this land is mine. So when I watched that, it produced a lot of mixed feelings. I mean the first was that it was very blackly humorous and you know, you have this stirring propaganda stick anthem, light music in the background. It's sort of overblown. I'm the singer, he, he, he amplifies the emotional resonance of it and then you have this just nonstop carnage in the background to this, to this stirring music and then. But what's really strange about it as far as I was concerned is that it's eerily beautiful and that's something that's, it seems to be a perverse and remarkable element of all of your films is that they deal with extremely harsh realities, metaphysical and, and genuine, but you have this amazing capacity to generate these complex, beautiful images and to set them in a, in a, in an equally beautiful relationship to the music. And so, I mean, I didn't know and still don't know what to make of the film because you don't often see what you might describe as stunningly beautiful satire, stunningly beautiful artistic satire.

Speaker 3:          00:22:45       I don't know. Mad magazine was pretty stunningly beautiful back back in the day. It hadn't had like the best artists working for it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:54       Yeah, that's true. That's true. But you're, you're, there's an element to what you're doing, especially with the juxtaposition of the music that seems to elevate it, in my opinion, to something like the level of high art.

Speaker 3:          00:23:07       What's high? What's low? Well, thank you. I thank you for the compliment. I can't really respond to any, anything other than thanking you.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       So your aesthetic sense and the style that you've developed, do you have sources for that? Do you have influences that, that, that helped you, helped you develop that particular style? I mean, I know it's a foolish question, dial star artists where they get their ideas, but I'm, I'm wondering how it is that you came up with the concepts that you're working with?

Speaker 3:          00:23:38       Well, graphically, some of the style is determined by the software that I use. So this land is mine and all the song scenes and Sadomasochism, arch, flash and flash. The way I use it, it's what we call a cutout style. We're all drawing shapes and I'll, I'll move them in relation to each other, but the ships themselves don't bend or anything they're just cut out is an animation technique where people would literally cut out shapes from paper and move them around under a camera. So that's part of the style, uh, with this land is mine in particular I was looking at ancient Assyrian art and ancient Egyptian art. Some of that is reflected. There's like little border of flowers which comes from a Syrian art.

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       Um,

Speaker 3:          00:24:32       those are the main things, a cutout style and this Syria and stuff. And

Speaker 1:          00:24:37       when you, when you made this way or this morning, did you have the sadomasochism film in mind or did that emerge afterwards?

Speaker 3:          00:24:46       No, I knew, I knew I wanted to make this film about Passover and that's why I watched exodus and that's how sadomasochism, I mean that's how this land is. Mine came to be. So I just knew I wanted to do a film about Passover. I didn't know what it was gonna be because I had never read the Old Testament before. And reading exodus was of course an eye opener. Um, and the film, I don't, I didn't imagine what the film was gonna be like when I started it other than the topic I would work around. But the way the film is actually shaping up is a surprise to me.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       So we should probably walk everyone who's listening through the film itself. So you've created a variety of what appear at least to be at the moment, to be animated shorts that detail out different episodes in the biblical narrative surrounding essentially surrounding Moses. There's more to it than that, but certainly surrounding Moses and so does the film, does the film essentially concentrate solely on exodus or are there other elements of, of Old Testament stories that are you that you're including?

Speaker 3:          00:25:55       It's really just exodus, leviticus and deuteronomy and numbers all have bits of exodus in them.

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       Right? Right. So it's basically the story of Moses.

Speaker 3:          00:26:07       It's a story of Moses, right? It's the story of the exodus and then be establishment of the, you know, the Tabernacle and the priesthood and the religion. Right. That's sort of a mean. It's regarded as the birth of the Jewish people.

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       Right. Right. And so now you said that when you were growing up, you observed Passover but not much else. Yeah. So, but you're, it's not unreasonable, I think to observe that there appears to be something like a deep religious sensibility in your, in your work. I mean, you seem to be treating the stories with

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       a tremendous amount of respect. And so what, what do you, what do you think's welling up from inside of you to do that? Well, I'm glad you recognize the risk and the respect. Any respect for this was like I, I approached these stories with an open mind and an open heart and was expecting to find some wisdom in them. Uh, when I began this project I thought I'm going to explore the religion of my father. My father came from a religious Jewish family, but he wasn't really religious when I was growing up. Although he had, he, he wanted us to observe Passover. I guess as part of our, he want us to have some Jewish identity. He wanted us to be in touch with our heritage as Jews, but it was a bit muddled. Um, like we, we were forbidden from observing any Christian holidays. There was no Christmas in our house, whereas a lot of secular Jews do observe Christmas. There was like a really half assed Hanukkah and there were no other high holy days. And my dad was an atheist. So after spending years reading many different versions of exodus and commentary on it and things relating to it and trying to understand it and trying to find some way to connect to it.

Speaker 3:          00:28:25       What happened was I realized that I had found the religion of my father and that was atheism. So I, I became sort of a born again, atheist reading this stuff. My neutrality towards the religion changed to a kind of a boring towards it, um, which is, which is not to take away from.

Speaker 3:          00:28:50       It's important, you know, as a cultural foundation, right? Like I live in western culture and these texts are stories that everybody knows to some extent and you know, they're very important and I, I respect them for that reason that there were like a cultural touchstone for everyone. But I did not emerge from exodus within, you know, I had like less connection to God than I had ever had in my life. I actually had like a spiritual crisis, like, you know, it was really hard for me to have any kind of sense of a power greater than myself after reading this and, and working with it. And that's also been the case as a consequence of doing the animation. Yeah. Because you know, animation is like a meditation when you, when you made an old story, it's just a long out meditation on it and sometimes insights can pop up while you're working on it.

Speaker 3:          00:29:46       I mean, it's just like in your face everyday. I mean, I have there, there are insights that I have. One of them, a lot of them are comparative religion insights because the previous film with Sita sings the blues. So in this film I included Aaron a lot in Sita sings the blues. I left out Luckman who is a Rahm's brother. And I decided not to do that here even though with a lot of these stories when they're turned into films, Erin is made into this minor character and a lot of things that Aaron does in movies they show Moses doing, like casting the staff down and it turns into a snake that was, that was Aaron's business. But anyway, I showed Aaron in this and I fought about how both stories have these brothers, they have like the big important, memorable brother and the other brother who actually carries out quite a bit of the work.

Speaker 3:          00:30:37       Um, so that's a similarity and of course both stories also have a really gruesome scene after what we normally think of as the end. Like with exodus, especially growing up with Passover, I'd always thought the story was the Hebrews were slaves and then you know, they were free, right? Like the end is, they're free. They crossed the Red Sea to get away from the Egyptians for Ray. And of course what actually happens in the story after that is there's this Hebrew on Hebrew slaughter because of the golden calf and a whole bunch of those Hebrews who were liberated, they die.

Speaker 1:          00:31:16       Yeah. Well, liberation turns out to be a very complicated thing. Yeah. You know, it's funny when I, when I watched the Americans go into Iraq, you know, with her initial optimism and then the absolute disintegration of the Iraqi state, I thought, well, and then the failure to produce something, you know, stable. And as a consequence, I thought, well, a little bit of exodus would have gone a long ways. It was quite funny in some sense because in a black way, because of course the people who invaded Iraq who planned the invasion or we're at least nominally committed Christians and I thought, well, they took out the tyrant like just as the Hebrews escape from retirement, let's say, but you know, exodus lays it out pretty clearly is you escaped from tyranny into the desert and that's no joke and it's 40 years, right? It's three generations before the desert disappears and in the desert there's nothing but inter, inter tribal warfare and, and, and, and the, and the conflict around new emerging values, which is of course that the conflict between the idealization of the golden calf and, and the necessity for the new rules that Moses imposes.

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       It's no picnic and then meet. A lot of the old testament is like that. Even. I've been a series of lectures. I don't know if you know about this, but I've done 12 lectures on the old testament that have actually become quite popular. I think the first one has about three quarters of a million views and I'd been attempting to treat the stories with as much respect as I can because like you, I believe that their foundation stories and um, I would say that my respect for them has actually grown and, and, and my relationship with whatever you might regard as transcendent has been improved by that, but be that as it may even in the story of Abraham, you know, he's called forward by God to go out into the world. He's an old man by that time, right? He's 75 years old. He should have left his family, his father's house and, and his kinsmen long before. But God calls him on an adventure to go out into the land of the stranger and to leave his home. And you know, it just goes terribly badly. For Abraham, it means the first thing he encounters is a famine. And then he moves into the tyranny of Egypt. And then, you know, the Pharaoh takes his wife. So it's one of the things that you can say about the old testament is that it's not easily optimistic in any sense of the word,

Speaker 3:          00:33:52       but the Passover story kind of is as, it's as people observe it, like when you read the Passover story, it's just this nice part and that, like I say that other part, that later chapter, we never discussed that at Passover and you know, the closest will come as 40 years in the desert. Like I didn't know that the Jews wandered the desert for 40 years. I didn't know they kill each other. Right. And, and this is something that's similar to the Ramayana because the Ramayana is frequently told without the last chapter, without the authority Aconda, which is the difficult part, right. Which I think is the richest and most interesting part of the whole story. So I focused on it in Sita sings the blues. Um, but, but yeah, I mean I think that what the most valuable parts of these stories are the most difficult and other parts that are left out. Most people don't know about. You have to actually read them.

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       It will be the most useful parts because life is full of difficulty and so with you over, if you leap over the parts of the stories that are pessimistic and dark, then you missed part of what the stories are trying to teach you about how to prepare for catastrophe mean it says, obviously in the exodus story, the fact that the Hebrews escaped from tyranny is presented as a good segue and even as something that God wills, but it's by no means a straightforward passage from tyranny to the promised land. I mean, in Moses doesn't make it to the promised land right here. He dies before he gets there.

Speaker 3:          00:35:24       Yeah, and even the promised land is not nearly as much fun as it's been as we have been led to believe, right? Like they're, they're constantly the Jews that are constantly falling short. Right? They're constantly and God, they're never getting their shit together. You know, God just keeps, you know, God's ambivalence towards persists.

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       Yeah. Yeah. Well, well, and I also think that's very realistic because there are very few times in life where even if you're not suffering from the tyranny of other people or yourself, that it's very difficult to walk the proper, straight and narrow path and to keep everything organized and to keep things going. Property. And there's no, there's never any shortage of severe challenges. Yeah. So in that, even if you're chosen by God, let's say, there's no shortage of severe challenges, you also see that in all the other stories in the Old Testament. I mean, even when God is walking with someone, say like Abraham or Noah for that matter, it's pretty still pretty much nonstop carnage. I mean, noah, Noah has his family together and um, his generations are perfect, right? And he walks with God so he's properly oriented in the world, but he still has to build the Ark and, and get through the damn storm and, and, and, and be humiliated by his children at the end. And it's, it's, it's very rough business. So in the, in one of your, uh, shorts and I don't know the name of it, it's the one where the, I guess it's the one that specifically deals with the Passover where the Egyptian firstborns are all killed. Yeah. Yeah. What's that one called?

Speaker 3:          00:37:05       Death of the firstborn. Egyptians go, hold on.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       There we go. And appropriate title. I can't help but harbored the suspicion that you had a fair bit of sympathy for the Egyptians.

Speaker 3:          00:37:16       Yeah. Well, you know, they had some great art. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:37:23       Yeah. And you do a wonderful job by the way of incorporating that into that film. It's not wanting to spectacularly beautiful.

Speaker 3:          00:37:30       Well thank you. And they had religion and uh, so doing visual research for this project, there was not a lot of really great ancient Hebrew art possibly or probably because it's against the religion to make art. You're not supposed to make graven images. So in terms of coming up with a style that evoked this, I had to, I was looking at art from the region and I was like, oh, it's all Egyptian and Syrian. Those are the ones. Those are the people there that made the art fantastic art. It breaks my heart that that's supposed to be evil, right? That, that, that art, which actually moves me when I look at it, is what we're supposed to smash, right? Like, that's, that's what we're commanded to destroy because it's, it's all full of idols. Um, I, I'm not down with that. So I just naturally was going to sympathize with the Egyptians. This is all we'll do.

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       There's a real tension there that I think is worth thinking about, you know, because I understand why from a psychological perspective and understand why there was an injunction against making images and you know, you see the same thing, kept it out right now with isis say in the Middle East where they're destroying the world, for example, all the great Buddhist art and all those ancient monuments, which of course is an absolute and utter catastrophe, but

Speaker 3:          00:39:11       religion, I mean they were following it better than we do.

Speaker 1:          00:39:14       Right, right. Well, so, so the conundrum seems to me to be that, and this is also played out in the story of exodus with the golden calf, is that no, the idea of God is supposed to be something at least in principle, that you can't really grip, that you can't really encapsulate that know that you can't dogmatically represent because then it turns into an idol and an article in etiology are very much the same thing. And I think ideology is terribly dangerous. You know, because you take something concrete like an axiom of some sort, you, you, you, that's very concrete. And then you make that your highest value and it narrows you and, and restricts you and also makes you incredibly dangerous. And so the idea that there's a great danger in idolization I think is a, is a very, very powerful notion. And so I think that's what informed the restrictions against making graven images of God because you end up confusing the image with the transcendent reality.

Speaker 1:          00:40:10       Right? And then you think that you understand it and you have it in your hands, but it certainly does seem to have some pretty dramatically negative consequences when the consequence of that is the absence of visual arc in any profound sense. And also this injunction to destroy the idols of well of the foreigner or, or of the, of the person who's heretical or, or, and I, I'm not exactly sure how to. What would you say? I'm not exactly sure what the mediating path is between those two extremes and I think a real artist and, and, and, and I, I definitely think that you belong in that category is someone who isn't using idols as representation because you're using your artistic talent to push beyond what you already know. Like it's a form of exploration rather than a form of Canada [inaudible] or, or categorization, right? It's, it's a, it's a, it's a journey into the unknown and an extension of the way that people think. And I think of that as a way of uniting with the transcendent rather than trying to encapsulate it in some sort of formulate box. But there is a great danger of that kind of formula formulization. So anyways,

Speaker 3:          00:41:23       there is that danger and that's, that is of course the commonest interpretation of the injunction against idols. But I think, I mean it's, it's never borne out, right? It's like any injunction against that kind of a idolatry has never resulted in the absence of idolatry ever. Uh, and we can clearly do it with abstract concepts. We can clearly do it. You have a clearly don't need images to do this.

Speaker 1:          00:41:56       You could argue that you could do it with words just as effectively

Speaker 3:          00:42:00       you never have anything. And so if it doesn't work, I wondered while I was working on the film, whether it might have been a simple and misunderstood injunction against using Egyptian hieroglyphics and that it, it was a requirement to use submitted written language rather than Egyptian because Egyptian hieroglyphics are full of things that fly in the air and things that crawl on the ground and things that swim in the sea and men and women. All that stuff. Because I was working on these little animated hieroglyphs and I was like, maybe it was just this. Which would have made sense, right, because because anti-depression when when these stories were written down and they were promoting the Semitic language, that's what you were supposed to use.

Speaker 1:          00:42:50       Well now we've put it in some sense in the same categories, the dietary prescriptions, right? Because the best evidence for the reason for those dietary prescriptions isn't hygiene or anything like that. It's don't eat the food that you're, that the people who worship other gods eat. Right. And there's a variety of, of useful reasons for that. Certainly one of them. Is that it? Yep. Yeah. Well it's a price at an advantages that the people you eat with your kinsmen and your tribesmen pretty much by definition. And so if you share a pallet, if you share a menu and there and you share it restrictions, it's much easier for you to socialize with the people who have the same restrictions that you do. So it seems to be a reasonably intelligent way of keeping your culture cohesive. While it certainly, it certainly worked for a very long period of time so that that would be an idea that's in keeping with that, isn't it? You certainly don't use the idol representations of the people who you are not because then you integrate with them and your and your culture disappears.

Speaker 3:          00:43:53       Right. And you don't use their language and you don't use. You don't write down things that they can read.

Speaker 3:          00:43:58       Right. But so much of these books of Moses were about being different from your neighbors. Like don't let your neighbors corrupt you are different from your neighbors. And interestingly, I was raised with that, right? Like my father, the atheist Jew was adamant about not doing the Christmas things when I went to school. Uh, you know, they would have Christmas projects in the winter and he would say, just tell your teacher you don't have to do this project, you're Jewish. He never said you don't have to do the project because you're an atheist just because you're Jewish. Right. Right. And so we maintain some sort of difference in spite of not actually practicing Jewish religion. Really.

Speaker 1:          00:44:47       Yeah. Well that's one of the things that's always been interesting, interesting to me about Judaism, particularly in a mystery I would say. And you know, I think there are very many ways of believing in God and one way of believing is conscious and that would be the sort of belief that you can state as I believe or I don't believe, and I think in some sense that's the weakest form of belief and it's also the one that's most easily undermined. I think the more profound forms of belief or ones that you act out there like a dance in some sense and they're built into your behavioral coding and they're not so easily criticized and undermined because they don't really operate at an intellectual level. No. Like, like for example, watching your videos and it's not, they're not reduceable to an intellectual exercise. You know, I can't watch them.

Speaker 1:          00:45:41       And first of all I can't say exactly what it is that you're up to. And even if I could lay out a reasonably comprehensive description of what you are up to, which, which would be by no means complete. It wouldn't be easy for me to mountain intellectual attack on that. Because because of your use use of dance in some sense with the catapults and your use of imagery in your use of music, it it puts the entire discussion on a plane that can't be easily reducible to an intellectual discussion. And so in Judaism you see this, and this is the case, I think with the atheist Jews perhaps most self evidently is that the rituals are kept in. The division is kept and the encoded actions are kept and the person might say, well, I don't believe in God, and the proper objection to that might be something like, well, you might say that you don't believe in God, but you sure acted out.

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       It seems to me that, you know, people have asked me about my religious faith, which is a question that I find quite intrusive and I'm not that. No, not that people don't have the right to ask it because they certainly do. But I mean I'm, I'm sufficiently. I'm ignorant about my own orientations in some sense to not know exactly how to answer that. But one answer that I find quite useful and I think fairly truthfulness that are certainly act as if there's a god and then the rest of it I leave I suppose in some sense in a cloud of an, of as, of yet into bleakly explored ignorance because I do believe that human beings have a relationship with the transcendent. Now I see that manifest itself in, in great art, for example, where people seem to be able to reach beyond to produce something that's a spectacular, lasting, intense emotional and practical significance.

Speaker 1:          00:47:35       That's the realm of inspiration, you know? And I don't think that we understand that very well at all and I don't think that we understand consciousness very well as well at all in stockton. I think it is a fundamental element of being so. But, but it is interesting and it in, in your, in your work too, like I see it. It's interesting to hear you talk about it. I see a profound religious, what would you call it? Oh well I see a profound religious spirit at work and it's so interesting to me that your experience of reading exodus and also doing these animations has actually for you being an increased sense of divorce from the, from let's say the realities of the text.

Speaker 3:          00:48:21       Yeah, but you know that. So the word I use to describe it as I was bereft, uh, after spending all this time with them because the more time I met with the tests, the more time I spent working on this, the, the, just the other less connected to anything I would call God I felt. And after I finished those scenes, it took me a really long time to get inspiration for finishing the film. I guess I finished the last scene of it, of the Moses parts a year and a half ago and I just could not continue working on the film because I was thinking like more Moses, more old testament and it just made me feel sick every time I approached it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:11       Is it possible just out of curiosity that that was a form of something like spiritual exhaustion? Because it'd be. Your films are very, very serious and they're, and they're, and they're very complex and so I kind of wonder too, is if you just haven't like, drained yourself of, of, of inspiration as a consequence of working on this for so long. I mean, they're very complex, deep themes and you know, as you said, they do sit at the bottom of the culture and it's no joke to mess around with that kind of thing.

Speaker 3:          00:49:41       That's true. But I now see what I was missing. I mean, I've, I've, my Muse has returned so I, you know, I could say that I'm not religious, but I clearly practice like a religious person because I have a Mus and I'm inspired by my muse and I have faith in my muse and I even have prayer that I say to my muse. So, uh, that's, you know, that's, that's a sort of religious lifestyle or spiritual one anyway.

Speaker 1:          00:50:10       Yes. Well, you. Okay. And so you said that you even prayed to tell. Tell me, tell me about the muse.

Speaker 3:          00:50:17       Okay. Well, would you like to hear it? My Muse prayer? Sure, definitely amusing. Okay. Our idea which art in the ether that be named by vision come by, we'll be done on earth as it is an abstraction. Give us this day, our daily spark, and forgive us our criticisms as we forgive those who critique against us and lead us not into stagnation, but deliver us from ego for dynasty division, the power and the glory forever. Amen.

Speaker 1:          00:50:54       That certainly seems to me to be like, I would think of that as a, as a, a mantra to open up the gateway between you and this transcendent forest that allows people religious inspiration. I mean, and you're doing something like clearing out your ego and I think it is very interesting that it's associated with the, with the, uh, the Lord's prayer, especially with regards to, you know, you make this interesting identity between criticism and temptation. No. In one of the things, of course it does interfere with stagnation. Yes. But yes, but deliver us from criticism. I think you something you,

Speaker 3:          00:51:32       yeah. Faded, but deliver us. Oh wait, wait, but deliver us from ego. Oh boy. I will forgive us our criticisms as we forgive those who critique.

Speaker 1:          00:51:43       Yes, that that well and the criticism that that. That's a very interesting element of it too because it's often the case. One of the things that I teach my students when they're writing is to get a critical spirit the hell out of the way to begin with. No, because what people try to do is produce and edit at the same time and you actually can't do that. What you have to do is open yourself up to the to the to to the creative process and all of its errors because when you first start, it's going to be very much error written, but you have to allow yourself to manifest that ever written spark of creativity to begin with and keep the criticism at bay and also the ego element I think is extremely interesting because to the degree that you're trying to bend your artistic production to the proximal demands of your ego, then you actually. You've polluted you propaganda is it and you reduce it. I would say to something like an idol because it then it. Then it's to serve some other master rather than whatever it is that is supposed to be in some sense flowing through you.

Speaker 3:          00:52:51       That's a good way to put it. I have a real problem doing work for money. I love money and what I like to do is do my work and then encourage people to send me money. But the whole, this whole thing where somebody says, I'll give you this money if you do the work. I've done that. It's just called being a professional artist and it never works out for me. I mean, I did this, a segment of this commercial film. Um, ironically it was Kahlil Gibran, the profit, uh, all animated and I did it for money. I got paid well. I thought it was never going to animate again after that because it burned me out so badly. It was a really unpleasant process because the authority in this was not my muse. The authority was the people with the money. Really.

Speaker 1:          00:53:44       The money you subjugating the greater to the lesser.

Speaker 3:          00:53:48       Yeah. And if I do that even a little bit, it's, the feeling is horrible and I can. I liken it to how I imagine prostitution, like all the warnings about prostitution and what it, what it does to your soul, even if you think it's Hunky Dory. Um, I, I can relate to that when I do the work for money, it's really different than when I'm doing it. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       Okay. So which of your prayer. So now you've modified the Lord's prayer. Yeah. And so did you write that down? Like how, how in the world did you come up with this? Thank you for actually telling me. I'm quite amazed that you did because of course it's a peculiar thing and I mean that in the best possible sense, but it seems also to be quite a private thing

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       out about it since, I mean the thing with the blues is it was such a profoundly weird experience making that film and it was so much like the channeling and it was so much just getting out of my own way. Um, that I, I did want to share that. I mean because people would ask me these questions. So how did you make that? And it's like, I don't ever really know,

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       Jeremy, you said you got out of your own way, you know, in one of the things that, that, that I've been struck by with regards to both the prophetic tradition in the Old Testament and also the passion story in the New Testament, is that there's a tremendous emphasis in those stories are on getting out of your own way, you know, because the idea is supposed to be. This is part of the idea of the dying and resurrected hero of course, is that you're supposed to let everything in you that gets in your way, burn away and die so that whatever can flow through you that, that has true value and that's oriented towards the highest good, let's say. Which I think is what you're doing when you're establishing a relationship with your muse, is that there isn't anything that's part of the Ego, part of that critical capacity that's, that's inappropriate or part of, let's say, worldly concerns that's interfering with your ability to reach beyond yourself. And that's, that's a holy calling. I would say it's. And maybe it's the primary holy calling. I think, I certainly think it is, it's, it seems to me to be the case and I, I do think in some sense that's what artists act out when they're really being artists because they're, they're establishing a relationship with the source of inspiration, whatever that is. And it's not like we understand that we don't understand that it's something that's very, very deep.

Speaker 3:          00:56:22       Yeah, I do. Or I

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       do believe if I have beliefs, I do believe that regarding it as something that comes from elsewhere, something bigger than yourself is for me. Helpful. Uh, I don't, I don't like this idea that it's all me. I'm connected to other people and connected through culture and through language which is culture and through art, which is culture. I mean I'm just like a fish swimming in a sea of culture on a, what we call creating is really absorbing and processing all of this culture that I'm a part of and just expressing a little bit out. I'm very dubious. And the idea of originality. For example, I wrote an essay about that, the cult of originality. I think that's delusional. Maybe difficult part of the originality idea is that it's it, it's tied up with ego because I think that people can be spectacularly original, but I don't know if you give to attribute that to their ego, you know, Tibet part of them that you call me and the mind is a very strange place because there's obviously a part of it that we, that we identify with as ourselves.

Speaker 1:          00:57:39       That would be, to me that would be the ego and it's obviously it and it's the thing I think that is capable of generating eagle testicle criticisms and, and standing on principles for self defense or for dominance display or something like that. That's, you know, it's sort of a, it operates at a relatively low level of moral virtue. But then there's parts of us that are obviously far beyond ourselves, you know, and that's the part, for example, to generate dreams and visions and perhaps even ideas. Because one of the things I really liked about reading curl young, one of the things he made me really conscious of was the fact that. And nature of course talked about this in the same way. To some degree is that it's not so much that you have ideas, it's the one you could say, no, no, don't be so sure about that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:30       The ideas have you. So there's that, and then the next thing is, well, it isn't so much that you think up the ideas, it's that you encountered them if you open yourself up to the possibility of encountering them and it is like a process of discovery rather than a process of origination, let's say. And that's also so you could say, even if you're like a biological materialist, which I actually don't think you can be because biological materialism doesn't help us account for consciousness in the least. So far. We don't have a good theory of consciousness.

Speaker 3:          00:59:02       You're saying like a biological materialist theory of consciousness because I'm a biological materialists. Biology exists. Well, yes, of course.

Speaker 1:          00:59:11       I just don't. I just don't think that it provides. It isn't sophisticated enough to provide answers to some of the most fundamental questions about human existence that we're. Right. No, I agree with that. And you know, the idea that you just expressed that when you're in a creative, uh, when you're engaging in the creative process with whatever it is that you're praying to, let's say that you're opening yourself up to something that's beyond you. Now you could say that that comes from deep within the human psyche, which is a psychoanalytic way of thinking about it and, and I think a reasonably appropriate way of thinking about it, but I don't think it's any more reasonable in some sense than making the, generating the hypothesis that you're opening yourself up to unknown forces in the cosmos because I think that's just as just as intelligent and account for the phenomena as the, as the, as the former one, we are in contact with things that are beyond us.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       And I do think that that's a large part of what the artist actually demonstrates and keeps and keeps in front of people. I think beauty in particular is a powerful force for that. And that's, I mean, when I've watched your videos really, they are so beautiful that they, they virtually bring me to tears. Aw. Especially in combination with the music because I'm very sensitive to music, but you have this unbelievable capacity for, for grace and for color and for, and for deep respect for the music, which I think is also really quite remarkable. Like your noi often see movies that use good music, but they don't have much respect for the music. They'll, they'll cut it, you know, in the middle of a phrase or something like that. Um, I remember the movie Magnolia was a real exception to that, that, that move uses music beautifully. And a woody allen is very good at using music beautifully.

Speaker 1:          01:01:06       And so is, um, who is the director of the shining? I'm Kimra Kubrick Kubrick. Hey. I mean, he loves music and his, his, his, his, his work a clockwork orange has some of the same kind of perverse, but that some of your animation has, you know, because he, he used those great beethoven pieces that were, that were transformed into electronic music by Walter Wendy Carlos and uh, and set these brutal scenes of mayhem to beautiful music, which was also, I think, a very profound thing to do. It kind of, I mean, of course Germany is the home of Nazi-ism and it's also the home of Beethoven and Bach and so you really can't separate those things in some sense and so, okay, so let's go to the copyright issue to some degree now. Now you're, you're not a fan of the idea of copyright and, and that's, that's interesting to me because it has been arguably a reasonably efficient way for people to, let's say protect theft of they're protecting themselves from theft if their intellectual property. Although I would say that's broken down quite badly now for people like musicians because their work is so distributable. Are you against copyright for all forms of intellectual property or why don't you tell us a little bit about your, your ideas?

Speaker 3:          01:02:26       Well, you say that is if intellectual property exists, what is intellectual property?

Speaker 1:          01:02:33       Well, I guess to some degree I'll take the easy way out and say that's a legal issue, but I would, you know, I would say that at least to some degree, intellectual property is the consequence of abstract work when you. Because it's, it's certainly possible to work abstract, deconstructing something like you're constructing your movies or perhaps a book and it seems to me that it's not unreasonable to propose that that deserves some of the same ownership protection that a physical entity like, uh, I'm not, I'm not sure that there's, there's some level of similarity between you owning your house and not allowing other people then you owning the more abstract work that you've done. But I'm not, and I'm certainly not attempting to engage you in an argument about the benefits of copyright. I presume that you have a very well thought through stance on s and m.

Speaker 3:          01:03:27       well was it begins with. It begins with acknowledging that culture is not property. It just didn't. And what we were just talking about a few minutes ago where, where does this stuff come from? You know, it comes from something bigger than ourselves. We were just talking about, you know, we do not actually originate this. We certainly work, but I didn't originate any of the work that I'm putting out there. I mean, I just stated it. Uh, but we don't own children either. You know, we let our children go out into the world. If you, if you want to own your child for 96 years and you know, control everything,

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       well then that serves you, right? You get exactly what you deserve. If I do that,

Speaker 3:          01:04:07       you get a dead trial. Basically you get a crippled, you know, non human being. And the thing with cultural works is they, like I say, I'm a fish swimming in there, you know, it's like water. What happens when you enclose water? It becomes stagnant, it becomes nasty, it becomes toxic and you know, I know that for my own work it has to go out in the world and it has to continue circulating and for me personally, copyright interferes with that because you put a monopoly around something. If, if I, if one person or even if I am licensed my copyrights to others when when it's centrally controlled, it does not move. And I did a lot of experiments. The Sita sings the blues and by far the best way to get it into the world is to just let people carry it into the world.

Speaker 1:          01:04:56       Great. They have. That's certainly what I've experienced as well and people are also taking more lectures and cutting them into pieces, which is not something I expected and then putting up pieces of different length on, on, um, on the, on the net, and I've had companies contact me and say, you know, for um, for a fee we'll more or less hunt

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       these people down and it's forced your copyright. And I thought, well no one, I'm, I'm more thinking about the message in the bottle approach to this and I'm willing to let go where, where it to let the wind blow where it wants to blow, let's say he could put it that way

Speaker 3:          01:05:34       and I'll say if you're making more money that way because as you just pointed out, people are sending, people want to support you, they want to support you because they actually see your work. Right. If you were taking down all these, all these instances of your work getting seen because of copyright, fewer people would see your work. The audience is the most efficient distribution machine that exists.

Speaker 5:          01:05:55       It's definitely been a case for me and I've been fortunate too because I've been involved in some political controversy over the last year and some people that I know who, who, who have been involved in say let's say broadly similar political controversies have been demonetized on Youtube, you know, and I'm outside of that because everything I put up is free and people are perfectly willing to support me. But I mean it's also very fortunate that a new thing that this, these new platforms for direct support of creative people let's say have just emerged and developed, which is, you know, thank, thank God for that because it's very difficult for creative people to monetize their production. Yup. So, so now. All right, so

Speaker 3:          01:06:41       art is just to say something about more on this, you know, with, with my films going out for free, but benefit to me is that far more people see them that way than would see them if I were trying to control them and trying to get people to pay me to see the thing. So I made more money releasing sita, sings the blues for free than I ever had before in my career where everything was copyrighted, the consequences of all my comic strips being copyrighted is that people just don't see them. So yeah, so just releasing it as good, but the other assets, so that, that's the benefit to me, uh, the benefit to society is that you overcome like a form of societal brain damage when you ignore copyright. And I gave a talk called copyright is brain damage. You can look that up, but if you, if you look at all of us are neurons and a great mind and all of us transmit and receive information, copyright blocks that function or in an attempt to control that function. I mean, of course you can't, you can't have a brain with totally uncontrolled, you know, firing of sign apses, that's madness. But I really think that each human being shares work that they love. So if you just let humans share work that they love and you know, they naturally will not share work that they don't love, then you end up with a really healthy system. And you know, really good works are going to succeed in that system. Whereas controlling things with copyright, is this artificial damage to that system?

Speaker 5:          01:08:10       Well there's also been a Sarah bit. It's crooked tree in relationship to that. In recent I would say perhaps Disney is more responsible for that than any other organization, you know. And so it was Disney that was instrumental in getting copyright extended from 50 to 75 years. And I really did think that that was a form of crime because some of those early Disney movies and I would put milk in that category particularly are are incredibly culturally significant. And to forestall a proper discussion of those cultural artists. Alex I think is truly damaging. And it was a travesty that that copyright extension was granted

Speaker 3:          01:08:50       over and over again. And Disney is not the only one. I mean most of our cultural heritage is controlled by five big corporations. Almost everything now. I mean everything is owned by someone and once it's owned it can be sold to someone else. And it all ends up in the hands of, you know, buy a calm and Sony everything.

Speaker 5:          01:09:09       So now with regards to copyright, do, do you draw a distinction? What about patents and things like that? Do you think that they are technically different?

Speaker 3:          01:09:19       No, I have a problem with patents, although my expertise is not in the area of patents though the one legal concepts that is classified as intellectual property, which is a misnomer that is not completely fundamentally bankrupt. His trademark, because the trademark theoretically has something to do with fraud and you know, you need, you don't need or desire some mechanism to, to uh, control or punished fraud. So roof arc, trademark alone would be that. It's not usually used that way. It's usually abused is as much as anything under the intellectual property label, but at least it has some. You could make some excuse for it to exist.

Speaker 5:          01:10:05       Right, right. So yeah. Well, I mean, part of it, I guess part of the claim for the protection of originality, we might say it's also the protection you could argue for, for the, for genuineness you don't like, I might want to know that and maybe legal protection can help with this, that I might want to know that the thing that I'm watching or the thing that I'm consuming is actually produced by the person who said that they produced it. So if I go on your website and I've watched it, Nina Paley animated short, I want to make sure that it isn't something someone copying you and using your identity as a, as a, as a form. Well, it's a form of parasitism essentially. So

Speaker 3:          01:10:43       yeah. But the thing is I don't, I don't have a lot of need for that largely because I do free my work. So most people are aware of something that's by me is by me, the, you know, there's I guess some danger or the way I might invoke trademark law is if somebody edited something of mine, everyone's welcome to edit and redistribute it. But if they said that the edit and redistribution was mine, it was like, no, you know, like, like the work I did is mine. But you have to take responsibility for that edit and redistribution. I'm not responsible for your edit and redistribution. So if they add some message to it that is not mine, I don't want that attributed to me. And I suppose I could invoke trademark or something to do that, I don't know. Something, but really would do is just go and say, Hey, I never said that.

Speaker 5:          01:11:37       Yes. Well that's a lot simpler than engaging in legal battles were roughly the equivalent of a fairly serious disease.

Speaker 3:          01:11:44       Yes, I took a legal valid nonviolence. I don't want that system.

Speaker 5:          01:11:50       Yeah, well it's certainly a way of keeping your life simpler and unless, you know, unless you get attacked by something that's truly malevolent and of course that can happen from time to time. Okay. So let's go back to your masochism. So it's going to come out in 2018 and I'm, I'm very much looking forward to that. Yes, I bet. Okay. So we're a couple of things is, um, you know, it's so interesting because when I watch your, your shorts, I, I, I remember a couple of them that have Moses wandering through the desert with the pillar of light leading him on and cloud pillar of cloud. Yes, that's right. That's right. The cloud. Yes. And, and you've animated that very interesting way and it's got a kind of grandeur as well, which, which again spoke to me of something approximating a profound religious sensibility, which is partly why I was surprised by your comments about the, let's say, the intellectual effect of your endeavors on your, on your relationship with belief. But

Speaker 3:          01:12:54       this is the ego, the ego talk.

Speaker 5:          01:12:56       Well, you know, I think now and then we managed to make it a muse to muse talk.

Speaker 3:          01:13:00       Well maybe a little bit, but maybe a little bit. You're going to hear from my ego.

Speaker 5:          01:13:05       Yes, yes, yes. Well that's always the danger in talking to artists, right? Because I think generally when you speak with artists, you speak to the inferior part of them, not because their ego is inferior compared to the ego of other people. But because the part of them that you would like to communicate with is actually the part that's generating the art already doing it's communication.

Speaker 3:          01:13:26       Exactly. That's why I would rather, I mean in general it's like I speak better through my art than any other or an amendment anymore, right? It's whatever by his Dick Expressions, my talking head.

Speaker 5:          01:13:42       Yes. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. And I mean, part of the reason I wanted to do the interview though was to find out what your ego thinks of all of this as well as to take the opportunity hopefully to bring your work to, to perhaps do some people who don't know about it yet. And okay. So now you're making this magnificent, a production about exodus and about the old testament and that's a pretty strange thing to do. Let's say in the modern world, what do you have any sense of what you're hoping that will accomplish? I know, I know that you want to launch it and see what happens and that there's curiosity associated with that, but. But do you have. Do you have a hypothesis or a theory about what it is that this is doing in the broader sense, how you're contributing to the cultural conversation?

Speaker 3:          01:14:33       I, I'm sure that I do. I can't access those thoughts right now. Uh, but I'll learn a lot more once it, once it goes out.

Speaker 5:          01:14:43       All right. We'll sort of focus it a bit more in the, in the Pinocchio Movie, of course. Mrs. Very ancient theme in order for the puppet Marionette, whose strings are being pulled by forces beyond his control. In order for him to become real, there's a variety of things he has to do. He has to learn to tell the truth and he has to learn not to be a neurotic victim and he has to learn not to be an impulsive pleasure seeking, uh, a victim of totalitarian processes, all of those things. But then he asked to go down to the bottom of chaos itself and rescue his father. I can't help but think that that's part of what you're doing. I mean, you said it yourself in the interview, right? Because you said that you were attempting to make some connection with the belief of your father and to make some sense out of it and so you are in fact going into the void, let's say, to rescue your father from the belly of the whale and, and you know, it seems to me that we're in a period of, of chaotic instability in our culture that it actually has a fair bit of danger associated with it and that I've felt a strong impulse to go back to these original stories to find out what they are and to establish them, to reestablish them, let's say his foundation or whatever that might mean.

Speaker 5:          01:16:02       It might be my imagination, but it seems to me that that's associated, that that's akin in some sense to what you're doing with exodus.

Speaker 3:          01:16:11       Well, yes, and when I set out, I did set out to connect to my father, your rescue, my father. Uh, but what I have learned in the past year is that actually I'm looking for my mother and I think I found her.

Speaker 5:          01:16:29       Okay. Well now, now obviously I'm going to have to ask you to elaborate on that.

Speaker 3:          01:16:34       I don't know if I can in words, right, like it's still in the process of doing this, but it's like, it's like I have been seeking to connect with this, this father, this God the father, and also my own father, which I didn't have the best connection with. Nothing, you know, nothing really terrible or anything, just never really connected with him. And I, I've longed for that, right? Like a lot of my life because the culture tells me that that's really important, you know, like, and all the, all the psychologists say, oh, I need a really important thing. So my whole life it's been like, oh, you know, maybe I, I wouldn't be messed up about this or that thing. Maybe this is a daddy issue. Now I gotTa get right with my dad even though he's, he's dead. And I'm just like looking and looking there and it's like, wait, I missed something, right?

Speaker 3:          01:17:30       Like it's my mother. It's not, it's all of our mothers. And you talked about the original stories. You referred to the Old Testament texts, the original stories. Well, they're not, you know, we have most of the history of human religion was not these stories as far as as far as I have read or learned. The early human conception of the divine was female everywhere and we have broken the connection to that and actually the story of exodus to me, what it is is it's the solidifying of the that change that it was a long gradual process of moving from goddess to gods and Goddesses to just God just one God, but I'm reaching further back and I realize, you know, when I. When I found that and when I started working with that earlier religion where we have no text for it, all we have is some artifacts, many artifacts from all over the world and beautiful symbols and of course there's a book by Eric Newman, the great mother, which talks about all the symbols book. I read that sucker cover to cover

Speaker 5:          01:18:48       that. You read the origins. Have you read the origins and history of consciousness?

Speaker 3:          01:18:52       I have eight by Norman. I have not, but I did. I would highly recommend, but let me just, I'm with you. I liked the other. He writes like a lead weight. Uh, it was just good to immerse myself in that. So definitely that is what I was longing for. And back to the Old Testament. Those things are in the Old Testament. They're all portrayed as the other and the enemies and what we're trying to stop out, but they're in there. So, so in that way I relate to the Old Testament, not the heroes of the Old Testament. Moses and Aaron and them. I, I take inspiration from the stiff necked people now it's like, oh, it's too stiff. Neck people. They're disobedient. Yes. That's great. You know, those are the, if there's, if there's any history to this, which there probably isn't, but it's like those are the ones I'm descended from, the bad one. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:19:52       what was the, I don't know, it's interesting because in the Pinocchio Story and in the classic stories of, of journeying to the belly of the whale or journeying into the underworld, it's often but not always males who are doing it. And the farther, and it isn't obvious to me psychologically what happens when a woman goes to the underworld to rescue her father isn't clear what she's going to discover their, you know, when it seems to me that you're, you're, you're, you're using your creative pseudopods to sort of feel out that territory and discover what might be there. So that seems very important too, because obviously there's, there's a problem in our culture and the problem is how, what is exactly the relationship between femininity and women and these, let's call them patriarchal religions. I mean there's, you know, one of, one of your criticisms of, of Christianity.

Speaker 5:          01:20:48       And of course this is also evident in Eric moments work, is that there's, there's a trinity, obviously Christianity, let's say, and it's a fairly comprehensive. Well there's God the father and that's tradition and there's the Holy Spirit and that you might think about that is the news. And there's God in the Sun Forum, which is, you know, you take human being who's, who's vulnerable and mortal and who's destined to live on earth, that those are nice elements of the divine. But there's a missing fourth as far as you're concerned and he thought about as sometimes constituted by the figure of Satan, so that was where evil standard, but also sometimes constituted by femininity itself and, and that, those two things were often conflated as well because they were the other. And um, and that is a complicated technical problem because it's not obvious, it's not precisely obvious what the divine model is for women, especially now that they have control over their reproductive function because they're sort of half women in the traditional classic biological sense. Half the email, but also in some sense half male freedom now

Speaker 3:          01:21:55       control over the reproductive function. Sadly. I mean if we lived in that world we could, we could talk that way, but it's. No, practically speaking, women really don't.

Speaker 5:          01:22:04       Well because of it. You mean because it's unreliable?

Speaker 3:          01:22:09       Well, for one thing, uh, are you talking about like a hormonal pills? Birth control? I'm talking about birth control pills. Well, like I can't take them right? Like they, you know, they have horrible side effects for me. I'm quite a few women. Yes, definitely. So it's not like, it's not like, oh, we invented this pill. I mean, that's actually one of the, that's like a great example of, you know, our Patriarchal Society, right? Like that could be developed for men. Men wouldn't tolerate the side effects and back they weren't developing a pill like that for men. And then they cut the experiments short because men weren't, uh, weren't tolerating the side effects, which were worse than the side effects for women. But women are going to tolerate that shit because they're just, yeah, we're physically more vulnerable anyway. It never ends all the old. This is why I believe from biological reality. By the way, this is what biological materialist just because regardless of my identity, regardless of my ideas, you know, every month I'm doubled over in pain and you know, having like very real consequences of bright of my biology.

Speaker 5:          01:23:15       Well, you, you just did a short about the great mother and now you know, I wondered if you had read a book when I saw that because I know there's [inaudible] that, that is an absolutely great book and as I said, I would recommend or just history of conscious. Obviously it's, I think it would help answer some of the questions that you were talking about today. I believe you. Yeah. So, and you know, it was the book that you said he wished he would have written, which is hell of a thing for someone like him to say because he was a remarkable genius. And so, um, so, so I guess that the new film and what's it called when the feature is the great mother

Speaker 3:          01:23:53       godmother.

Speaker 5:          01:23:54       Yes, exactly. And so is that now that seems importantly related to this issue that you brought up about rediscovering the connection with your mother going to. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:24:05       My actual mother, the mother, the great mother, right. I live with my actual mother. She great and everything, but we're on a metaphorical. Yeah. And that, that actually is the first scene of sadomasochism. So I did the last scene first and then it took years for me to figure out what the first scene is. So That's interesting and there's gonna be no introduction and no explanation. It's just, that's gonna set the stage for the exodus story. Is that, that follow?

Speaker 5:          01:24:42       Thank you for talking with me. Thank you for being with me. I think that, uh, I wish you the best of luck with your film and I hope that exactly what should happen with it will happen and I'm going to steal liberally from your films to illustrate this interview if you don't mind, and I'll try to be very respectful and careful with the editing.

Speaker 3:          01:25:05       Excellent. But actually be copying not stealing. Oh yes. Okay. Well thank you very much. It was a pleasure talking with you. Thank you. Likewise. All right. Bye. Bye.
