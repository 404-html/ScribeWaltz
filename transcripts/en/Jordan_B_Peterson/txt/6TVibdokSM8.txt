Speaker 1:          00:03:06       Wait, she's actually trying to to improve the coherency

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       of this manuscript by all. I gave you the summary for the whole thing last week, week before, and now I'm going to write a summary for every chapter and hopefully that'll provide a structure for the more either elaborate or vague depending on your perspective arguments that fall. So, so anyways, what you have is the summary of the preface, which is very short and then a summary of the argument that I've been making through that it's reasonable to conceive of the world in two ways. Just trying to reduce that argument to its essential aspect. And then the last two pages contain a description of the instinctive response to novelty and the manner in which that response finds its representation and mythology. And maybe by next week I'll have like four more chapters, summaries or something for you. Then you look.

Speaker 2:          00:07:11       Okay, so where are generally. We've been discussing the possibility that the dangers that are inherent to group identity, which is the tendency of group identity to adopt that totalitarian stamps, which is a consequence of its of any groups propensity to try to maintain that structure over time. We're we're discussing the possibility that that inevitable tendency of the group might be heightened in its danger by certain types of individuals. Psychopathology, and I was trying to make the argument it's interesting, you know, this week in the Atlantic monthly, there's a discussion of William James and his, his inquiry into religious phenomenology, which was apparently motivated in large part by his use of nitric oxide, but there's an also an argument in there that elaborates upon shelly Taylor's findings in social psychology that positive illusions according to tailor foster mental health. Anyways. That idea has now spread right out into the mainstream press and the guy who wrote the Atlantic monthly article and just making the point that the validity of a belief might be determined by whether or not it makes you happy. She's a very, very, very dangerous perspective.

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       It's back to this, back to this minority might these and I brought that up is because of course that's a point that's absolutely contrary to the point that I've been trained in making this class, which is it's the individual tendency to deceive themselves, to deceive ourselves, but the deceit oneself about the nature of reality as it's defined personally. That constitutes the basic form of psychopathology attorneys with the group, which is a necessary but dangerous structure into something that's pathologically dangerous. Now the argument, basically I'll start, we'll discuss that argument today a little bit more detail, but then I want to flip to the last part of the course which is a discussion of the process and that hopefully will serve as an antithesis to this individual pathology so you can describe, you know, you can define thing something very well by describing its opposite and that's why we have anti heroes and literature at least in part because they're good, bad examples and you can infer the opposite of something from the description of that thing.

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       So it's perfectly reasonable to started description of identification with heroism. I suppose by discussing its opposite. You said, I wrote a quote from him on page 211. He said, who alone has reason to lie himself out of actuality and his answer to that was he who suffers from it? Well, that's an interesting statement because obviously it's not a description of an individual person or a way of drawing a distinction between those who lie and those who don't. Really. It's more a way of saying that since it's obvious that everybody suffers from actuality that everyone has sufficient motivation to lie and what we're going to try to get out a little bit today again, is precisely what that motivation is and then what the consequences, the inevitable consequences of following them additive and outpatient might be.

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       I made the point last week that it's difficult to get a picture of the process that serves as the adversarial counterpart to the mythological hero because the reason that that process has been described as a personality and mythology because it consists of a number of a number of things simultaneously and it's difficult to discuss something that consists of a number of things simultaneously. Because when we discuss anything, you have to break it down into its constituent elements and you risk over simplifying the personality or reducing it to something to one single thing that it's not and the tendency ally is a bunch of things at once that are all interrelated and it would be a mistake to try to reduce it to a single thing, but I think at least in part you can, or one of the essential aspects of the tendency to lie as rejection error. Now there's a quote I'm going to read you. A quote from Milton behavior described Satan's attitude and a I have a little comment on that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       He says, first which way I fly is hail myself, am hill and in the lowest deep, a lower, deep, still threatening to devour me, opens wide to which the hell I suffer seems to heaven. The Devil Who's traditional representation of evil refuses any recognition of imperfection, refuses to admit I was an error in my action or in my representation, accepts as a consequence of unbending pride. Eternal misery refuses Metanoia, which is confession and reconciliation's remains forever. The spirit that refuses and rejects this is a quote, oh, then at last, relent is there no place left for repentance now for pardon left, not left by submission, and that we're disdain for bids, me and my dread of shame among the other spirits beneath whom I seduced with other promises and other violence than to submit boasting. I could subdue the omnipotent I me a little. Know how dearly I abide that boast so vein under what torments inwardly I grown well.

Speaker 2:          00:13:01       They adore me on the throat of hell with dynamic sector, high advanced, the lower still, I fall only supreme and misery. Such joy, ambition, fines, but say I could repent and could have obtained by active grace, my former state. How soon should height recall? High thoughts. How soon unsay what fain submission. Swore. These would recant vows made in pain as violent and void for never can. True reconcilement girl, where were wounds of deadly Hayden peers so deep, which would lead me to a worse relapse and heavier fall. So should I purchase deere short intermission, bought with double smart vis, knows my punisher. Therefore, as far from granting heat as I from begging piece, all hope excluded us such refusal, the inability to say I was wrong, I'm sorry, I should change means the death of hope and existence and how it should be. This

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       right?

Speaker 2:          00:14:02       Rejection of fact means alienation from meaning from truth and life without meaning is suffering without recourse where the have nothing but construction in accordance with self definition. So the idea I guess what we're trying to do in a sense as to unpack what rejection of error means. You already know from looking at a picture we put together of the mythological portrait or portrayal of reality that the, that all new information is gathered as a consequence of contact with a known. I mean this is just a definition, right? You can't gather anything, any new information unless you're somewhere that you haven't been so to speak. You have to be in territory that's unexplored to gather anything that's normal. Now, the problem with that from a moral perspective, so to speak, since we're dealing with behavior and emotion, is that the only way that you can get to be somewhere that you don't know is by admitting to the existence of anomalous to the existence of anomaly and that's tantamount to an admission that you were incorrect.

Speaker 2:          00:15:05       The idea of having your vision of yourself and where you are and you're contracting with a vision of where you want to be. That's that's sort of your own definition of what constitutes the world and both of those polls are subject to modification, but you're the one who decides what the polls are. I mean you're. You're setting up the rules of the game and then if by your own definition, your actions which are designed to bring where you are to where you want to be produced, a contrary result, that's anomalous. That's an enormous piece of information. By your own definition, see you. I stress that because the problem with talking about something like error is that you might think that implicit in that discussion is the notion that there's some that you have to make recourse to an idea of absolute truth to talk about error, but you don't like. This model is predicated on the notion that you define the terms of the argument for yourself, which is to say you're the one who decides where you are and also where you're going. I mean you pull in information from outside to make those decisions of course, but still your game and if the actions that you've constructed produce results that you didn't intend, that's what constitutes an anomaly. So it isn't that you have to know anything about absolute truth, so to speak, to determine when you are in fact an error because you make the decisions.

Speaker 2:          00:16:32       Establishing a relationship or an aspect of that information that you get back in the context of that relationship when it contradicts information is coming from another source rather than rather than it being some sort of internal framework that you have established. Yes. It's a conflict between the meaning you're getting two different relationships. You have. I would say that that's. I would say that that's an equivalent, that's an equivalent phenomenon because it is one of the examples I'm using the text made about abortion because you can say, well, there's a lot of emotional intensity surrounding the abortion debate because it pits to cultural schemas against the against one. Another one says, the right to life is paramount, which is a perfectly no one position, and the other position says no, the right to freedom, right to free choices. Paramount. Now, under most circumstances, most people in this society except both of those, uh, moral presuppositions about abortion, happens to be one situation, assuming good will on both sides, so to speak.

Speaker 2:          00:17:39       I'd have to be one situation where the phenomena of the world presents us with puts those two positions necessarily at odds. So then a third decision is necessary, which is the decision to hierarchically arranged to preceptive presuppositions. So it can be the case that one philosophical stance that's done in most circumstances and another valid in most circumstances and meet in a third place and more in opposition. So then you get a situation where there there was an environmental phenomena which would be the possibility of unwanted possibility of abortion, that the two moral systems, which are modes of adaptation, do not properly address. And then what happens? Well that's, that's the eruption of an anomalous occurrence into a cultural structure and one of the things that happens when that sort of thing happens is that you get a war. There is a war in this country between those two positions.

Speaker 2:          00:18:32       It's just mostly still fought at the level of words, but not always. So that's the. That's a conflict of values. And you said, for example, that the most difficult moral decisions always come about when there's a conflict of duty. One valid principle says actually pattern a. another valid principle says action pattern be the two action patterns juxtapose, juxtapose what was producing Iran irreconcilable situation. Then then the question is what do you do? What can you do? Well, that's part of what we're going to get at when we, when we get to the end of the argument today, it's impossible here and it's impossible there. What do you do? That's the question.

Speaker 3:          00:19:17       Yeah. I guess I was wondering whether those two situations are analogous, but the emphasis was slightly different. Whether you've got to resolve it internally or when did you've got to resolve it in a sense of several hundred connections with one of those.

Speaker 2:          00:19:30       Well, that's an. That's an option. That's an option. I would say one of the things we're going to discuss today is consequences of response patterns to anomalous information and I would say well one common way of dealing with the normal occurrence that's so tight. It's just a fortify the position that you think is most appropriate and exclude the rest. Well, it's that sort of solution writ large and society. I mean it has its advantages. It's protected, but it's also that sort of solution that taken to an extreme causes. What causes the walls to rise up around communities. One way of eliminating anomalous information is to increase the conformance and within the group and to put more barriers up. Just stop information from flowing in. It's a good solution, but it has its problems, so anyone's is your idea that all the anomaly is personal error is experienced as personal level.

Speaker 2:          00:20:30       The asset. I mean that's basically the idea. Exactly. Is that the unknown? Actually, because the unknown, the way that we're construing it is a phenomena that appears cloaked in effect. It's always necessarily making its appearance on the scene of individual consciousness. So the thing is you're acting out. Your moral presuppositions, which you have determined by your own rules are the ones you should act out. Then a piece of information pops up its ugly head suggesting that your means are wrong, or in a catastrophic case, the manner in which you construe the present or your ends are wrong. In which case you're. You're really, you're really in trouble. Well, the question is what? Then? What do you do that? Well, that's part of what we're going to. There's, there's three alternatives. I think. One is that you can even just pretend the anomalous thing never happened and continue on in your path as if the world was the way you thought it was when you know it not to be the case.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       That's one. The other is to actively take measures to get rid of the anomalous information. That's a more extreme, very tough. That first position. The second is to give up your whole moral system and the underground advantage to that is the normal systems or hey, in a sense, I mean they they have a protective function certainly, but to adhere to the means that you have to discipline your behavior. So I made a comment in there at one point about the dark side of of liberalism as well as many comments about the dark side of conservatives.

Speaker 2:          00:22:11       One of the reasons to be extraordinarily to welcome novel information is so that you can dissolve all those structures to which you might have otherwise had to adhere. The problem with adhering to those structures is that it takes a lot of work, like if you want to be an optimal member of any given society. There's a whole structure of discipline that's necessary to adhere to and it's easy to say, I'm very tolerant when actually what you mean is I can't tolerate any of this responsibility. I'll just let it go and everything's okay, but you can get away with that for a long time because usually you're protected by other people who are adhering to the rules and who makes sure that like the unabomber, make sure that you stay alive. So okay, well the. Okay, so this argument always loops back onto itself because the processes are actually can only be described as in terms of feedback loop, so it's very difficult to get a handle on the origin of the story, so to say, so to speak.

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       But why would you reject the appearance of anomalous information? Say animals don't seem to do that. While I'm on the argument that I've been trying to present is that as you pointed out, we all have a reason to lie. She said, well, why would you bother on? His answer was, well, because you suffered from it. That's a good answer. Well, now it's a one sentence description of the process that I was trying to describe in the chapter on the development of self consciousness. The problem for human beings is that even for animals, the appearance of an anomalous piece of information is sufficient to activate the right frontal cortical circuitry that governs negative AFLAC. Sprite and a normal occurrence stops you in your tracks. So if you're a rabbit and you're hopping along the bush and you hear a noise that shouldn't be there, or you see a shape that's moving like a Predator, what will happen to you?

Speaker 2:          00:24:11       That's something that should not be. What will happen to you is that you will freeze, right? Because the systems that govern anxiety and inhibition of behavior gripped, gripped your critical apparatus. Same thing happens in people. Our first response to an anomalous event, it is anxiety and the cessation of ongoing behavior, which is exactly how it should be. Because if an anomalous event occurs, it's. It indicates by its very nature that the plan you were undertaking is wrong. Because otherwise the anomalous piece of information wouldn't have showed up. But the problem with us is that the whole domain of anomaly, which can be conceptualized as a place and is conceptualized that way in mythology, is contaminated by our knowledge of the potential consequences of air and those consequences. I mean you can kind of divided into two camps.

Speaker 2:          00:25:05       One price of admission of error is that you have to regard yourself as less than the group that you identify with it. Just to say that you look like a fool in front of people who theoretically you want respect and admiration. Prop knows can be actual people or they can be the people that live in your head. So the Super Ego Persona, persona five doesn't really matter either way. It's the same thing. You have to recognize yourself as less than you might be. That's one consequence and people are very terrified about that. We don't like exposure of our weaknesses in front of the social group. Even Freud pointed out in his interpretation of dreams, common anxiety dream was to appear naked in front of a crowd, which is basically you could say, to expose your vulnerability to to the world or to have that vulnerability accidentally exposed, but when you make a fool of someone that's exactly what you're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:26:00       It's like they have pretentions which are there plans. You just twist them appliance fall and you see the person behind the plans and while they turn red and turned away because their vulnerability has been made manifest to the group and also themselves. It's very unpleasant to occurrence. That's shaming part, so that's one reason. The other reason is that for us, the whole domain of it normally has a is contaminated by the threat of mortality, which is something that's not true for animals at all because animals can't conceive of themselves as an object. That faces is extreme limitations. The limitations of mortality, so we have real reason to turn away from anomaly. You know, you want to make it concrete. For example, I wake up in the morning, have an 18 year side that ache, which is an anomalous piece of information since you're always acting too as a general rule at least maybe if you worked out at the gym tonight night before you have already made reasoning and the ache is bounded by an explanation and it's an effect of Valence is basically zero.

Speaker 2:          00:27:02       I mean you might be able to sniff that day in favor the side, but you're not going to walk around in the state of terror. If you have already made explanation for the anomaly, then there's none. There's an. It has an unbounded potential significance. Now, under normal circumstances, you would like to think, well, it doesn't go that serious. I'll go on with my life and see what happens. If your hypochondriacal, which means that, well, it means that you're. It's easy for you to blow things out of proportion. We allow your fantasy too, which is a hypothesis generating machine to work on providing potential explanations for the egg, which might range from, I slept wrong too. This is the incipient incipient sign of the cancer that will kill me. I know someone, for example, who's father and grandfather both died of a heart attack when they were in the neighborhood of 40 and he's 35 and he's borderline agoraphobic, which basically means that he can't tolerate any fluctuations in his heart rate because that's one of the signs of anger phobia.

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       People of anger phobia, if their heart rate goes up, they tend to think, oh no, this is the event that will either lead me to make a fool of myself or that will kill me. Well, he's in a situation. It's pretty much like that all the time because every time he feels some unexplained internally then thanks. That's the end of me. I could see his. You can see why he would be neurotic in a situation like that. I mean he has good reason for doubting the intake, for doubting the easy explanations for the existence of this anomalous information because heart disease is hereditary. He's a little overweight. He drinks a little bit too much. He smokes a little bit too much. He works too hard. Is good reason for being afraid, but that's the sort of thing that the animals never going to experience because an animal can't use it's cortex against it's limbic system in a sense, which is something we can what your cortex is supposed to do, your frontal cortex, then anomalous piece of information pops up.

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       Your frontal cortex is supposed to map out a behavioral pattern that eliminates the valence from the phenomenon, but sometimes you can't do that because your frontal cortex basically says, oh no, this might be the thing that exposes my weaknesses to the group or kills me, in which case your limbic system response to that labeling as if that in itself is threat and out of control you go, which I think is an explanation for panic attacks, for example, catastrophic reasoning, but everybody has. For me, the x, for me, the mystery of panic attacks is more why people just don't have the time really, really, because the people who haven't had good reason for having them, but those reasons are very much like the reasons that we all have,

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       so

Speaker 2:          00:29:50       we're lucky is the answer. I think under most circumstances,

Speaker 1:          00:29:53       fine.

Speaker 2:          00:29:56       We're protected by our implicit theories of belief, it systems of belief, and most of us, I suppose we're taught as children. If a minor physical anomaly arises that the best course of action is to carry on at least as a motive hypothesis testing and that's affordable for lots of acquired adaptations.

Speaker 1:          00:30:23       Sounds awesome. Willing to consider explanations might be what?

Speaker 2:          00:30:31       Well, that's what sure, and that's one of the things you teach in cognitive behavioral therapy, which is. But the thing is most of us are lucky you see with most people who are neurotic, if you provide them with an alternative explanation that day five, it has no impact whatsoever on their symptomatology. So you take someone who has obsessive compulsive disorder, for example, camp which is often manifested in fear of contamination. So here's the line of logic. There was a garbage can, garbage cans are dirty, dirt contains bacteria. Bacteria might kill me or worse my children. So this is an example going from a case that I know were university educated woman. Nothing wrong with your intelligence, perfectly normal, unless she was encountered something that was contaminated. You do response prevention treatment, which is that you have personally encountered the thing that if you're the most dependent, stopped him from doing their habitual response passage, which for her was washing her hands until they were so raw, they were shiny anyways.

Speaker 2:          00:31:25       Um, she thought that there was a possibility that if she encountered something that was contaminated, which was a category that gotten broader and broader as her disease progressed, did she carry home and disease to her children? Um, problem. See, the problem with that line of reasoning is that it's possible and yeah, you could say to her and she could understand that the probability of such an event occurring was virtually zero, but the fact of virtually zero was not sufficiently satisfying for that to calm her because point zero, zero, zero one percent was too much. So you couldn't rationally reduce the probability to, to a small enough degree so that her thought of that probability could regulate your emotions. And the only reason we don't know why, those sorts of thoughts regulate our emotions. So you're willing to accept it on faith for whatever reason you jumped in the car.

Speaker 2:          00:32:18       Do all sorts of things that are dangerous without any real consideration. I knew another woman who was an agoraphobic first thing she used to do when she went into any new building when she didn't like doing. Let's check out little fire escapes. Why it might be a fire, right? There might be a fire. What's the profitability? Lots of low. She knew that. She knew that the probability was low just like the rest of us know, but the capacity of that information to inhibitor anxiety was gone. The only thing you can do under those circumstances is actually have people act out, not caring.

Speaker 3:          00:32:53       Then then then that works. Some people argue that her rationalization, that behavior is something that comes after her behavior in that something that causes in other words is it isn't necessarily it. Couldn't it be one of two things? Either she she will interest the building and things. My my dentist, there can be fire, I have to check fire escapes or maybe she walked into a building or anxiety rises and she says, I have to check.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       Sure, sure. That's possible. Some of these explanations or post hoc rationalizations and it's hard to tell like I'm not trying to specify a causal sequence. What happens in Andrew Phobia I think is the behavioral avoidance takes precedence over the cognitive rationalization, whatever they are, but how does the agoraphobic, because they go to the mall, something frightening happens and they run away. Now it's the running away that constitutes the point of origin for the pathology. Now they may say, I ran away because you know, here's my set of cognitive rationalizations. Many of which might be post hoc explanations for my behavior, but the thing is when you run from something, what you are doing regardless of what your thinking is, labeling it as something so frightened that I have to run away from and that's the most profound level of labeling that you can actually utilize it much more real than it will.

Speaker 2:          00:34:12       The secondary or even tertiary semantic labeling that we usually associate with categorization to run from something means to categorize it as too frightening to be to bear and also one more thing. It also means to categorize yourself, and this is even more important as something that's so small that in that situation the only thing that can be done is to run away, but the reason that the exposure therapy works is probably mostly because it. It counters that latter argument, which is that when you, when you teach someone exposure, when you use exposure to help someone overcome their fears, what you were doing is teaching them that they're not so small. That fear will devour them and that's what causes the generalization. It's learning that.

Speaker 3:          00:35:00       So can you tell us a profound social expectation in a situation?

Speaker 2:          00:35:04       Absolutely, absolutely no. Or that the therapist uses social pressure and everything else to to foster the notion that the person can withstand the exposure. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:14       Can I just translate something benefit that I, that I seem to be hearing in a sense from what you said today so far, if, if I May, it seems as if the thing that for Texas from ethology, the ability to, to attribute and multiple meanings to something that the ability that our prefrontal cortex gives us is the same thing. That can cause a problem also,

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       you've got a conflict and absolutely, absolutely. The thing about any religious myths, for example, myths of the fall state fundamentally that the development of self consciousness which is associated with tremendous expansion of cortical ability plus the ability to model the self as an object precipitated that catastrophe and emotional catastrophe, but the cure for the catastrophe is more of the same disease, right? So it's the problem is that a little self consciousness is terrible. A lot however, might might be redemptive and that's the notion that underlies, that underlies all sorts of redemptive mythologies and that's the notion that's underlying the argument that I'm trying to elaborate up today because if you know enough about yourself, then the consequences of a of a narrow self consciousness can be removed. And I would say, well, what myths are trying to teach you as if they're trying to teach you something, which they're really not.

Speaker 2:          00:36:40       I mean, they're just, they're. What they're trying to teach you is that your normal conception of who you are is much too narrow. Now you know at some level you know that's true because you're modeling yourselves wrong obviously because you're too complex for yourself tomorrow. It's like no one thinks that they have an accurate model of cosmological processes and it's certainly arguable that the processes that make up each of us as individuals are complex at a level that's exponentially greater than any cosmological process that we could possibly conceive of. So the notion that your model of yourself is inaccurate. That's just a statement of fact. The part that's not so factual is how you can get valid information to increase the breadth of that model. What I'm basically trying to point out is that mid you can do that is with Amanda, is a large part, is our accumulated attempt to construct a story that accounts for our behavior in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:37:47       We watch ourselves act and derive conclusions. As a consequence, your entire life is a lie and everything bad that happens to you, even though you recognize it, it's bad and you're miserable outside cause I never resigned with yourself. What? What? What's intrinsically rewarding about lying to yourself? If you know that you're making yourself miserable because look, any defined terror is better than any undefined terror because it defined terror has a boundary and an undefined. Tara has none, and that's the law. Here's an example. There's been some reliable studies of late that indicate that gay men who engage in high risk behavior for aids are less anxious after being diagnosed with aids than they were before because the possibility the possibility is worse than the actuality. No matter how bad the actuality is, possibility is worse.

Speaker 3:          00:38:47       So what about if your product because of pride and not fear, like if

Speaker 2:          00:38:51       it's just. I think those that that's always the case as far as I've been able to determine. It's not. That's why I said you can't say this is just one thing. These things conglomorate together, but people that I've dealt with who were severely neurotic enough so that their whole life was a lie and literally it was pride as well that was stopping them from letting go. They wouldn't say, well look, you understand? For example, he treated one patient who had an obsessional neurosis that lasted 20 years. He said, I cannot reconcile myself to the fact that I wasted two years. So you think of what that admission requires. You know, you have a finite time and if you've blown, not only have you blown out a big chunk of it, but in the course of blowing it out you, you've added to the cumulative misery of the world. You know, lots of people who are non physically, physiologically unhealthy use their neurotic misery to manipulate others around them to their own ends, to make people feel guilty, to get them to do what they want because they don't think they can just come right out and say, you know, would you please do this? They have to manifest some sign of weakness so that they force other people to take care of. All of that has to come up and be admitted before you can step away from this situation.

Speaker 3:          00:40:10       What was Satan afraid of eternity like you had nothing more to lose everything to gain because it, sorry. Groups and gets gotten sucked back into heaven. Like where did pride become fear for Satan in paradise lost.

Speaker 2:          00:40:26       I can't answer. I don't know. Like I don't know enough to answer that question specifically. I mean, the only thing I can, the only thing I can say about that is that these processes feedback onto one another.

Speaker 4:          00:40:36       I mean

Speaker 2:          00:40:40       the more low. Okay, let me go through this argument to some degree and maybe it'll. Maybe it'll shed a little bit of light on that question.

Speaker 4:          00:40:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:40:49       What happens? What's the consequence of injection of air? While we know that before you can engage in any sort of creative exploration, you have to at least admit that something went wrong and so you say, well, there's something wrong with my and let some level of analysis. That's the admission. Then the next process is to engage in some sort of creative exploration, which is basically the generation of hypothesis and they're testing. You find out you made someone upset, for example, accidentally, well then you think, well, maybe this was wrong with my approach, and then we talked to them first about that. See if that was right in. If that wasn't, throw it out. Hypothesis to side. Pick up another one and act it out and see if you get the information you want, so on and so forth to get the answer and let's create an exploration.

Speaker 2:          00:41:32       Say, well, what happens as a consequence of creative exploration? Well, look, remember we talked about symbols of the chaos that existed prior to the creation of the world, so to speak. That chaos was symbolized by the dragon as a general rule is composed of the union of all things that are now often it's the source of all things, not just objects, but subjects as well. So it's everything that we see as distinct, melded into some paradoxical unity, and that stands for the unknown. As such. Now Piaget said, when children that children construct themselves as a consequence of their creative exploration, which basically means that the child doesn't know anything about the world, it's a very bounded domain of knowledge. What it does is encountered the vast, I've known explore, generate information, and now that information constructs itself as a subject which means grants itself a self and also the world as an objective reality.

Speaker 2:          00:42:35       So that's what the notion that chaos also contains. The subject means that as you gathering like you build yourself out of the information you generated in the process of exploration, have you stopped exploring? Although that has obvious conclusions, it doesn't. It means you start building yourself. We already know that a system that stops growing because everything around the system changes of its own accord decays over time, and we know what the decay means. He's life comes to a standstill and the negative forces that are underneath order rise up. So that story basically says, reject anomaly. Personality stops developing. Then you're in the kingdom that's coming to a standstill where everything's paralyzed. There's no water and everything's dying. Well, what that means is that the mere fact of not progressing means that you go backwards and your life becomes well as those debt, a desert, nothing grows in the desert.

Speaker 2:          00:43:34       Everything's unbearable there. So you say if you reject the possibility of growth, what necessarily occurs is that all that's left for you is a life that gets worse and worse and worse, worse, worse. Now, if your life goes from bad to worse, over time, we know already. This is just addresses the comment you made last week. You punish an animal, you make me. That's one way of making meaning anyways. If you construct your relationship with the world such that over time the likelihood is that everything will go from bad to worse. The other consequences of that is that your attitude towards you existing Cisco and go from bad to worse as well, saying, well, why do people are people consumed with hatred and a desire for revenge, which has played out completely milk story.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       Once Satan determines that admission of error is completely out of the question, he turns his attention to taking revenge on existence. I'm trying to trying to provide an explanation for why that's a necessary consequence of this because if you stop, if you eliminate a priority and necessity for further deny yourself the possibility of positive change and adaptation, the necessary consequence of that is increased personal, suffered, and that it's a very likely given that you're narrowing your personality, which means you get weaker and weaker is very, very likely under those circumstances that you're going to become more and more full of revenge because life's so unfair after all and hatred because you're always being tortured even though you're doing it to yourself. We the rationalization is why do all these terrible things constantly happen to me? It must either be that everyone's against me. This is a perfectly common hypothesis, or the conditions of existence itself are so unbearable that everything should be eradicated, which as we talked about last week, is the essential. That's the essential Credo Mephistopheles, right? The world is so intrinsically so unbearable that the only proper course of action is to work for it. So elimination. How last week I tried to tie that into stalins reasoning. Basically. Yes, that's what it looks to me like. That was the philosophy that characterizes step. Everyone's against me, that's for sure. He was a real paranoid and he worked throughout his life to continually develop his capacity to destroy larger and larger swaths of people.

Speaker 2:          00:46:26       I don't think there's much difference really. See, I think like this is not always the case because suicide is motivated by all sorts of different reasons, but it's certainly the case and I said I think this is particularly true about adolescent suicide is that it's an act of revenge because. Well it and it also is an illustration of how deep the motivation for revenge can be because adolescents, suicidal fantasies are often go along the lines of old. All those people be sorry when I'm gone, and then there's a whole fantasy about how the funeral rule progress in all these people who paid in sufficient attention or being otherwise cruel will file by and think about all the terrible things they did. So on and so forth. And while the truth of the truth of the matter is that a suicide leaves a hole in a community that can be reconciled because the people who are leftover are always faced with the question of why did this happen?

Speaker 2:          00:47:20       And also what could I have done about it, both of which are essentially unanswerable. So the question that you're posing to some degree, this is one murder worse than a million for it. And I would say that they don't some in a sense just as just as you are, society is predicated on the idea that every individual is of incalculable worth when you can't. One thing of incalculable worth is worth as much as 20 things of incalculable work. So it's not. It's not an additive. Phenomenal. Sorry, I think you were saying sort of thing. The vengeful aspect motivates both. The Newman Newman conceptualized suicide is he felt that was the mythological explaining. Explination was regressive wish for incest with the great mother, which is a very awkward way of saying, if only I was gone, if only I banished back to the point that I had come from. Then all of these problems that I'm faced with would just disappear and that's also something that's character and newman imagined that to census, an attractive force pulling someone down below the earth, so that's just a desire for death as a, as a solution to the problems of life.

Speaker 2:          00:48:42       You can also say these things are complicated. Maybe you can also say that you thought that the collective unconscious produced conference Satori fantasies, which basically meant that if your conscious mind, so to speak, which was in part, your linguistically constructed itself, was failing to take certain possibilities into account than the collective unconscious, which you might think about as manifesting itself in fantasies that you really can't control. It just pop up like fantasies of death. For example. Often, although they may have a pathological aspect, they also hold out at least in possibility the seeds of a cure because you could say, well, if you were here

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       and you're convinced that this is unbearable, the notion that a death is necessary is a first order attempt to hypothesize that the thing that constrains your interpretation of meaning should disappear. Which is to say that the fact that your life has become so twisted that you regard it as unbearable is evidence that your motive interpretation is so outdated that it should die. No, that's a perfectly reasonable answer. Sacrificial Motif for, and I read the other day, I didn't know this, that the idea of sacrificing of fingers, very common throughout our camp mythology. I didn't know that my finger is something that's very important. That's the same idea as a sacrifice of a virgin sacrifice of heroes. That if things are unbearable, you either have to kill what's making it unbearable so that something new can come into being. That's one mode of the sacrificial hometeam, but the other thing is is another thing that underlies the sacrificial is the idea of the exposure of the hero to the forces of the unknown.

Speaker 3:          00:50:31       That's great. That's another segment on that diagram. Just one. It doesn't matter. You know, basically we about suicide. It's like returning to the source of, all right, turn into the world,

Speaker 2:          00:50:47       right? Because that, that unconscious chaos that precedes existence has a paradise aspect, right? Because there's no tension of opposites there, which basically means there's just no being at all, but which could be a relief knew under certain conditions. So

Speaker 3:          00:51:01       is that it? I'm just saying within that framework, is that. Would you say that's heading into chaos or is that going back a long time?

Speaker 2:          00:51:12       Well, it depends. You see, if you move from border, like where's, where's the source of all things? Where's the break? Can we put the great mother? Yeah, sure, sure. No problem. This is anomalous information here. So you say, well, chaos is not known as such. He never encountered that because you always encounter things that are more or less within a determinant framework. You never see what you don't understand and its entirety, or maybe that occurs to people who are having some sort of mystical experience. Mostly what you see are things that you can somewhat define that pop up in your day to day experience. Those are actual anomalous pieces of information that you have some definitional handle on what the great mother would be. The story you can think of, the great mother as the agent of chaos, which is a perfectly reasonable the way look at it because in the mythological progression, she's the first offs right there. Okay, good. The original chaos separates into the great mother in the grateful on. Alright, so she is the first child of chaos.

Speaker 3:          00:52:21       Subset essentially of class.

Speaker 2:          00:52:24       She's the form of the form. That chaos takes in your actual experience. So wouldn't it be more effort in that diagram to say the chaos there is really the great mother because what do you start going back? Well, you have talking about that. That's where the entire diagram comes from because that's the world split into it's conduct. It's complicated because for example, many figures of the great mother have a snake wrapped around. Well, that's because the. The association between the Dragon of chaos in the great mother is very, very close. So to say this is the great mother is true, but it's not just that. It's also the origin of the great father and also the origin of the hero. So the mythological figures are contaminated by each other because they're north tight category, so lots of like the Gorgon is another example. Great mother. Her hair is snakes, which is representative of chaos. Now when you look at her, you turned to stone, which means be terrified. So she's an agent of chaos. But chaos is more like that. That first order category is more than just the kind of normally that you encountered during your day to day life. It's the source of everything. So it's outside the whole process.

Speaker 2:          00:53:39       Okay. I was just saying, I mean I know that this symbol is mesh together on that level, but if we're, if we're bringing them into a more systematic framework, yeah. Then to to kill yourself, you will eliminate the self entirely. It would essentially be to send yourself into if you're nothing, what, where everything came. Right? Right. Exactly. So which is somewhat different from what you encounter if that. If that is the diagram of the way we encountered life, then I would say that the things that make you desire a return to nothingness are the the actual anomalous phenomenon, threatening for the women that you've encountered, like the sum total of all of them. So it's repeated appearances of intolerable information produced within you. The desire to advantage basically. So anyways, the fingers, the fingers are contaminated. That's why time at, for example, in the, in the Mesopotamian myth, I mean absolute.

Speaker 2:          00:54:45       He's known in the Mesopotamian myth, right? The concert, he gets very little press and that story is not for lions devoted to you. The gods killing your stupid me, and of course the anti map rises up, right? Because he's the thing that protected them, but that's all that's known about. Hammerhead timeout is female and the wife of absent and the mother of Marta, but she's also the serpent, the mindset, the bottom of the ocean. That's the mother of everything, the source of everything. So there you can see the overlap between the mythological domain. She's female, but she's also. She lives at the bottom of the ocean. So derive is a notion of what suicide was based on the fantasies for people who may come down to commit suicide or did he just follow a train of reasoning to decide that suicide was designed for? I don't know that I don't know the details of the conclusion he came to.

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       He wasn't practicing therapist. Is it possible he got so excited about the system that he was pulling together? Sure. That's always possible. That's all. It's just, it's more a story. It's more a way of looking at the situation. Maybe it's not. It's not unreasonable to suppose that people who commit suicide, wish for the cessation of their experience been since. That's what suicide producers as well as a lot of general, a lot of misery on the part of people left behind one of the like there's the psychoanalytic, this is a human Erickson actually a okay. If you can't tell what motivates that behavior, look at the effects. The effects are the are motivated. How you can say that's a pretty extreme position. It is an extreme position, but they'll tell you if your partner of your own life that produces very interesting consequences at least as a heuristic.

Speaker 2:          00:56:31       Like you can say, no, that's not always true. Fine. It's not always true, but if you do something and it has a certain effect and you say, well, I didn't intend that effect and you ask why did I do that? A first order hypothesis. The hypothesis is I did intend that, but I didn't know. And if you follow that line of reasoning, if you can, well it can have some have very salutary effects, especially if the thing that you didn't intend has happened like two or three times because then it's. There's some indication that of complicity. It's only one occurrence. Well, you know, mistakes happen, but if it keeps happening to you. Lucky I think the other state was, if it's pointing a gun at you, it's likely that it wants to shoot the same sort of idea and that was in reference to the Cold War.

Speaker 2:          00:57:19       Why were people conspiring to build weapons, to destroy the world? While the simple maybe too simple explanation is on some level that was the intent, but I buy that argument was certainly appeared to be 10th. I mean, he was practicing it all the time. Now the question is how much was that? The intent of the West? Well, that's not an answerable yet, but I would suspect to a large degree, does that apply to other people's behavior? Well, it's dangerous to apply it to other people's behavior, but it isn't the principal that I rely on as an absolute explanation, but it's a useful hypothesis. Especially like I said, the same thing keeps happening. See you, Elizabeth. You made the point, you know, neurotic people will find themselves trapped in in misery that they recognize clearly is misery without stepping outside of it, and I would say well that that fact indicates that they prefer the misery they have to the possibilities and they don't have to.

Speaker 2:          00:58:22       It's the only way to explain. It's not the only way to explain anything, but it's one way of accounting for the fact of resistance in psychotherapy, the underground where the point is made that separate is fun. It gets attention. That's, that's, that's the secondary gain hypothesis. That's it's an effective manipulative strategy has all sorts of self reinforcing a side effects. I mean that's why it occurs. Rejection of anomalies is very negatively reinforcing. That's one of the reasons why it's while it has this attracted aspect, so if you don't attend to all those things that indicate that you're in error, I mean to the degree that you're successful and no one attending to them, you're not anxious, you're not depressed, you're not confused, you know, but the problem is all that information that you don't process first of all isn't transformed by you into something usable and second bull as far as I've been able to tell.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       It accumulates over time and then what happens to you is that in a year are getting smaller and smaller just because that's the way things work. Basically if you stagnate, you get sicker and sicker and the things that you yourself have labeled as threatening because when you refuse to process something, what you're saying or what you're doing is that thing is terrible for me to contemplate. So what you're doing is transforming chunks of the world into the category of those things that are too terrifying to come to conflict or you're leaving them in that category, which is a more accurate way of looking at it. Sooner or later you're this high and the world that you've transformed into threat is everywhere around you and it's only a matter of time until you're weak enough so that the whole thing falls in on you.

Speaker 3:          01:00:13       Is there a difference between ignoring it and just interpreting it in such a way like the positive bias but don't know where nothing was ever your fault and like you're the martyr. Like anything bad that happens to you is because there's some evil force out there that we're. You're kind of taking it in, only putting such a spin on it that you're saying, here's this unknown thing. I'm making it known, but labeling it wrong on purpose that way.

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       Well, that's just a. that's just a variant of the same theme, but it accumulates well, but I think it's a. it's a. it's a feedback mechanism. That's right. There's a feedback mechanism at work, so you get smaller and smaller. You a new mislabeled the problem or. Well, actually I think really what you're doing is that you're not pulling the label off it because we already know that anomalous information manifests itself is threat. It's right. That's how your right frontal cortex works. Basically mistake comes up in the form of threat. That's how it's indicated on them, so it's already labeled as threat. Your job when you explore is to transform the threat into something irrelevant or something beneficial north to merely label it as something different, but to actually change it by altering your behavior into something that's usable. If you don't do that well, then what's happening is that the determinant world transforms itself back into terrifying chaos and you're just failing to stop that from happening.

Speaker 2:          01:01:37       It'll do that all by itself, but by labeling it an evil force, you've made an effort to get rid of forest and everybody making it even more. That's true. That's certainly at least worse for others, and I would say, well, yes, yes. Oh, that's right. I mean, but there's more motivation to that because as you're weakening yourself and your hatred for life grows, your desire for revenge accelerates. So then if you could take the next step and say, well, not only is this anomalous information intolerable, but it's evil, then I can kill it. Well then you've got everything set because you can remove the source of your trouble. You can act out your hostile fantasies and you can feel justified because you're patriotic or which is all rubbish.

Speaker 3:          01:02:22       Um, yeah. It's like, no, you're talking about stuff and the world is so terrible that it must be destroyed. Is it possible to distinguish that from like the world is so terribly fascism of it must be destroyed, are?

Speaker 2:          01:02:34       Yes, I would say. Sure. Absolutely. That's distinguishable because one of the hallmarks of the hero, and this is something that the night I was at pains to outline in the latter part of the manuscript is the hero has two functions. One is to transfer, transform, unexplored territory into explored territory which is just Marta battle against time, but also to update the social structure which has both manifested internally and externally as that becomes necessary, so the pro. Now we know the problem with updating a social structure is that sometimes that takes on a revolutionary aspect and then for all the adherence of that social structure who were either going and forest revolution, that heroic activity is going to seem like a demonic demonic force and that's why people are so irritated inheritance because they pop up the normalist information and for good reason. I mean careless hermeticism is very, very dangerous because it produces schismatic activity and break societies down, but it also, it's like a genetic mutation that's the best. That's the best metaphor. I know it's like a 999 revolutions are counterproductive, but the one revolution in the thousand dollars isn't counterproductive, is absolutely necessary and the problem is how do you distinguish between the two? I mean, if you just use the odds, the first thing you'd say is all revolutionary shouldn't be regarded. The skepticism like extreme skepticism, but not skepticism to the point where a priority they should be eliminated because one of them just quite the. Well, it just might be the hero.

Speaker 3:          01:04:10       So I, I'm, I'm still trying to translate what you're talking about into sort of a parallel framework and what I was just thinking of is there might be two ways to change the social system. One by coming back as a caring, advocating. Okay. The way things should be telling people what beliefs you're placing, they have.

Speaker 2:          01:04:39       The other thing is to come back changed, right? Right, right. Then with. Yes. Yeah. And then your relationships with other people change. Well that's, that's, that's the sort of the sort of path that the. Well, that I want to outline in more detail next week because one, I think one, one piece of evidence that should justify skepticism is the overt desire of the revolutionary to maintain their position at all cost and to transport everyone around them because then you think, was that revolution or is that, is that fascism masquerading as revelation? Which it almost always is. So like a communist ideologue, he wants to transform a capitalist society. Isn't the revolutionary just he's just a fascist on the left wing. There's no heroism map, but I guess I suppose the other thing that one might be skeptical of his revolutionaries in groups because that's sort of a contradiction in terms, right?

Speaker 2:          01:05:34       So not always for either of those, but that's still a sign I would say, but I think that the notion of coming back change, that's the issues. I think what these myths are trying to point out is that the only permanently effective form of social revolution is a personal revolution and then just acts itself out where that social change is just a necessary consequence of that personal change. It isn't something that's being enforced or even planned out to a degree. It's just let me know. That strikes me, is that what strikes me as a justifiable position, at least then you're also much less likely to make catastrophic errors because your primary concern is always, what am I doing wrong? Or here's the situation, how am I contributing to it? Not, you know, where are all the bad people? Who are really causing more trouble, so I mean I knew lots of this is kind of a sarcastic comment I guess, and I knew lots of environmental activists in graduate school who may be filthy apartments.

Speaker 2:          01:06:41       It's like they couldn't even keep their personal territory clean and yet they were willing to engage in activities that in terms of their own fantasies, had the potential impact of restructuring society. Practice what you preach. Well, at least. Yeah. At least at least act it out so that you can see on your own territory, one if it works, and two, if you can actually even acted out. So the thing is, while you know there's a lot nip, funny mythological statements, like the man who rules himself is, has, has a. I don't know the quote precisely. The man who rose himself has performed a more difficult task than the man who wrote the city.

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       It's hard to rule a city, but what it means is it is actually. The truth is you're much more complicated phenomenon than a city. And to bring yourself under some sort of control is much more difficult than. It's more difficult than bringing the given social structure under control because the social structure assemble, Harrison plus, it's also equivalent to bringing in social structure and control because what you're composed of in large part is the sum total of social structures. Now they as they be generated over a neck stretches of time, so inside you, for example, like if you want to reconcile the abortion debate, that's an internal reconciliation as well. You have to rethink the philosophical presuppositions sufficiently deep enough so that you come to a solution that brings the two sides together. That can hold, take place inside before it takes place outside. Go past it at some level.

Speaker 2:          01:08:18       The most powerful social movements bring these two things together. I'm like the, I'm not drinking in the early days of solidarity, which is one of the things that really impressed me about it. It was the way it translated to, of personal transformation or the way in which the civil rights movement evolved in this country requiring a personal change, uh, which was through it in a collective way created social change or in the women's movement. I mean, in other words, it seems like in these genuine social movements, change occurs both in the macro and micro level. They're brought in consonance with one another. Well, I mean, that's, that strikes me at least as a plausible hypothesis, you know, um, I remember, um, George Orwell, right? He was, he started out as a socialist ideologically, but then, well, one of the things that transformed him from a mere idea log into a writer of note and a political commentator of note was that he decided, he, he noted that in his experience, most academic socialists weren't all that fond of the poor.

Speaker 2:          01:09:27       This was particularly true in Britain where there a higher class structure, so they were from the upper classes and acted out there detests than the lower classes in all their action patterns while holding the ideological belief that the poor were in fact, morally superior. Somewhat. Orwell did was, well, he went to Paris and London and lived in Paris among dishwashers and in in Great Britain among traps and coal miners, forcing himself to overcome what he soon recognized was a very deep set prejudice against everything that the poor represented well. Then what happened to her well was he dropped his socialism very rapidly because he found that the ideological structure was nowhere near profound enough to encompass what he'd experienced. Plus it had enormously dangerous side effects, which he increasingly came to recognize. So maybe, I mean maybe that's a. maybe that's because one of the things that everyone would like to figure out is like how do you distinguish a pathological revolution from a valid revolution?

Speaker 2:          01:10:28       And I mean I would say if you're asking someone else to bear more of the costs, then you're actually bearing. Then that's one sign that it's. That there's some sort of pathology at the bottom of it, who knows, but that seems like a reasonable first approximation. So I guess you also have to see like who gets what out of it? The communist revolution as far as I've been able to determine, just replaced one tyrannical group that at least we're, we're bound by tradition with another tyrannical group that were completely unbound by tradition and, and even more tyrannical because the problem was, is that the only reason the Russian revolutionaries were more moral than the tsar was because they didn't have any power. They couldn't do anything. So when they look to themselves more, I'm harmless. I mean, I've put anybody in prison. Of course they don't have a prison, but when they got prisons they certainly put lots of people. Hang on. So what other comments, Daniel? No. Okay. So yeah. Okay. So we basically got to this point in the argument now, which you doing? Oh, I'm just outlining this argument so that I don't forget where I am. Basically it goes like this over here.

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       Okay. So the question is how to get out of this. I mean, if we're willing to take nature, if notion seriously, which is that everyone has sufficient reason to lie. Then the question is, given that as a premise, the conclusion is perhaps to a much larger degree than we believe. We're lying to ourselves. Now, one of the thing, shelley Taylor, she's the social psychologist who's been promoting this positive self delusion notion. One of the valuable things she's done, I think was although I don't think she drew the right conclusion from it, was that she noted that many people who we regard as normal and healthy in fact erect around themselves, barriers of positive illusions. Now she drew from that the conclusion that to be normal and healthy, well first of all, the normal people were healthy, which is. I have a real problem with that, but I mean you can see.

Speaker 2:          01:13:03       You can see how that necessarily emerges as a consequence of psychological methodology in a sense because okay, I made the argument to begin within the class that as soon as you apply a field like psychology or medicine, you're out of the domain of science and into the domain of morality because you have to make judgments about what constitutes the good if you have to now, but people who are in the domain of science don't like to admit that, so they try to figure out ways to determine what's moral scientifically without ever having to address the problem. And the easiest way to do that is by saying, well, here's the normal distribution, right? The optimal level is the midpoint. So you take the average person, you see how many positive sell solutions they have around. When you say those average people, they're normal. That defines healthy.

Speaker 2:          01:13:47       Therefore positive self lesions are necessary, but this is like this is a real problem because first of all, many things that are average, we don't consider ideal. I mean that's why the two words exist in opposition. It was like we know strive for average intelligence or average athletic ability or average beauty or average accomplishment at any level. We're always moving towards some sort of ideal anyway, so I think shelley Taylor got caught and trapped in a sense she got caught in her own unconscious presuppositions and said, well, normal people have to be healthy. By definition, normal people have lost a part of the self illusions. Therefore, positive self lesions are necessary. There's lots of flaws in that argument. I buy the argument that many people who are considered normal by normal standards erect barriers of self positive illusions around themselves, but the fact that they do that as no indication whatsoever that is necessary or desirable because the argument that I've been trying to outline this whole course is that to the degree that the members of the society, to the degree that a member or members of a society erect positive self illusions around themselves to protect their normality, they will make their group pathological.

Speaker 2:          01:15:00       Pathological it gets. The more likely it is to do something terrible. Other groups, the sickness is going to come out somewhere.

Speaker 2:          01:15:11       Our target, our timescale analysis in psychology is something really, but we don't ever question. It was like, you know, a given phenomenon can have a beneficial effect at at the level of analysis of a minute, a detrimental effect. If you look at its effect over the course of a day, I'm mildly beneficial effect. If you look at it over the course of a week, you know tremendously detrimental effect if you look at it over the course of a year in the same thing can have all sorts of different effects depending on your parameters of evaluation and generally psychologists pick one parameter evaluation and say, well, that's representative of the whole temporal framework and that's just. It's not a justifiable conclusion. Say people who are high in self deception may appear more psychological help psychologically healthy in the short term. If you define psychological health as the absence of anxiety and depression in the short term, but you don't know anything about what that means for their interpersonal behavior. You don't know anything about what that means. You don't know anything about what that means for the course of their lifespan or for the children. You have no idea what it means for the relationships with the group or between groups, so until you answer all those questions, you know you have to be pretty careful about saying about making it as radical acclaim as self deception is necessary for psychological.

Speaker 3:          01:16:30       Can we ask what types of self deception? Well, shelley tailoring, Jonathan Brown. My understanding is that these are the types of things that come from making down comparisons. So I'm. I'm better than average.

Speaker 2:          01:16:53       Yeah. She said, she says those are innocuous,

Speaker 3:          01:16:55       right? Right. That's my understanding. So when asked, for example, with you, ask people to read their ability on the multitude of trades. If everybody in this room rated themselves, we'd all, the whole group as a whole would be above average, above average. This is a positive illegitimate.

Speaker 2:          01:17:11       Thanks Garrison in Wisconsin where every child is above average, right?

Speaker 3:          01:17:16       That's true. But we can't. We can't by definition I'll be above that. So that sort of definition of positive illusions, but isn't it sort of a leap to go from that type of positive allusion to self deception that could have the content of which has to do with your relationships with other people in the truths about the world and in all kinds of other things being where's.

Speaker 2:          01:17:40       Well it isn't relief because called in the rewalk has just finished a study on people who are high in self deception and found that over the course of a five year period, those very people were in fact rated by their peers as much more dislikable ended more psychological troubles than people who are lonely. So

Speaker 3:          01:17:56       self deception the same as his. The people who were thinking that they above average or are these the same things? In other words, it self deception question sort of self perception would be the denial of information. Positive illusion would be,

Speaker 2:          01:18:12       yeah, that hasn't. That hasn't been completely sorted out because what if you told this person? No, the truth is you are at

Speaker 3:          01:18:19       and they accepted it. In other words, it seems to me that they're looking slightly different.

Speaker 2:          01:18:24       Well, like I said in the literature as as a whole that hasn't been sorted out. Even like where we're using one of the inventories of self deception in our lab right now, the trend is sort some of this element. It's got different. It's one scale with different factors, sub categories, one of which is self enhancement, which would be more like I'm more than average and the other ones, there's two others, one of which has to do with the denial of negative information and maybe one of those is more powerful, logical, and maybe one isn't pathological level. Although I wouldn't bet on, but I don't know for sure. I'm just really the difference because if you say that I. If you suggest that if you believe that you are better than you are, then that means you're not going to believe you need to fix. One of the things that we did with this, by the way, we've done an experiment with this questionnaire and we found that people who are.

Speaker 2:          01:19:09       He gives these people standard tests of psychological health. Well you can't tell because they might be lying because they lie after all, neurotic. Let's say they're not neurotic, so what we did was we took, we took people, we looked at your tendency to self enhanced, we divided them into high sulfur and low sulfur enhances. Then we gave them 20 photographs to rate. We use the neo five factor personality more to see how they would rate other people who were just. We took a census cross section of race and niche and then we call and we used five new adjectives per picture and I collapsed them all together to kind of get their average, their average personality influential more, which is imagine you force all those pictures together. You get a competent individual, plus you get a composite personality score. People high in self enhancement regard others as more negative because we put all the negative adjectives in one category and all the pauses and another has more negative than they regard themselves, so I would say no, there's no difference.

Speaker 2:          01:20:15       The mechanism from the positive illusions is making downward comparisons, which is exactly what these people did, right? Well, call it phone. The people who do that are rated by their peers as less, well, less socially as worse than people who don't over the long term short term advantages, but that's neuroticism. That's short term advantage because that's where people do it. People also tend to make a comparison to when they have their sights set, well this is something that Aaron is trying to work this out because she thinks that some of these, these inventories of self deception are contaminated with optimism and I think she's right. Is that optimistic? People who think I can make the future brighter than probability says it is likely to be, which I think is a perfectly reasonable stance and is dependent on your ability to work. She thinks those people get lumped together with the self deceivers proper because if they took as their reference group one level of accomplishment that I think I can do better for myself.

Speaker 2:          01:21:18       Right, right. Well a lot of this has to be pulled apart compared to their peers. Right? Absolutely. I mean, and it's not all that easy to pull out a positive belief in the future and its possibilities from. I've already got that positive future now, even though all the evidence suggests that the contrary is true, so that's right. A fantasy about how good things might be is not necessarily pathological unless you presume that things are already that way. In fact, you need it. He needed a fantasy like that to keep you going ahead. So which is exactly what we're talking about. Well, here's another example. We ran an experiment because we're very interested in this particular line of research because it contradicts everything that I'm trying to say in this course. So that personally irritates me as well as I, you know, for all sorts of other reasons.

Speaker 2:          01:22:13       I just can't believe that shelly Taylor's writing like 5,000 years of religious traditions gathered from all over the world are wrong. Just strikes me as highly unlikely. Anyways, test that has been used to discriminate psychopaths from non psychopathic. No. So think about psychopaths is that while they're not very pleasant to be around in the term, although superficially they can be very charming. In fact, they make a study of how to be charming. In fact, if you do group therapy with second perhaps, which is very bad idea, they become more effective psychopaths because they pick up the whole psychological vocabulary and an array of professional techniques that they would never otherwise have access to. So anyways, they're not very anxious and depressed, but they're also dangerous, you know, was a test that has been used to distinguish psychopaths from non second pass. It's called the Newman card playing task.

Speaker 2:          01:23:08       Daniel computerized it up for use in this study. It consists of an extinction paradigm. None of you are going to take this. You might mean well knowing it depends. You can't take it. If you listen to this, you probably shouldn't take it anyways because he'd been in this course, so you'll kind of know what the hell's going on possibly. So you wouldn't be a good subject. Okay. So stay out of my anyways. Anyway, so. Okay, so you have 100 cards and they're stacked. The deck is staff and in the first deck there's 10 cards and their face cards, every time you turn around and face you get a quarter, you start with someone, get a quarter, and then in the next deck of 10 the subject doesn't know this one out of 10 of the cars makes you lose randomly and in the next day, two of the 10 make you news.

Speaker 2:          01:24:06       Then three, 10, four, 10, five, and so on. All the way until the end. We're a 10 out of 10. Make loose, lose. Now the your instructions are. Do you ever ring again? Nope. It's an extinction paradigm. So you mean the first time you went you went in for the first 50 percent of the right because you went 10 times, then you went nine. Then you have the cards, either winners or losers. Now all you have to do is segway to stop. Now the object is to maximize your money. Obviously. Well, high self deceivers make half as much money as low self to seniors because they don't know when to quit and I think the reason they don't know when to quit is because losing is indication of error. It's labeled with negative apnic. That's what stops you. If you have essentially ignore all signs of there.

Speaker 2:          01:24:50       Well you're not gonna stop doing something stupid as fast as you should. So anyways, they make half as much money's low, self deceived. So wait, I'm sorry, I don't understand. So they keep going longer than they should, but do you. You start losing money or just stop winning every time. One of these sort. And maybe my explanation was confusing. Yeah. You either wait a quarter or lose a quarter. That's right. Right. So the ratio of wins, two losses decreases over time and you should stop somewhere in the 50 slash 50 range, right? Or maybe a little after that because whatever. But somewhere around there, when you're losing as often as you're winning and you can see the numbers total up on the screen and the quarters appear or disappear. So you can tell when you hit the maximum. So then that seems to be complicated with the optimism variable because if somebody just thinks, well I'm just kidding, keep going, you know, well it's, it's conceivable.

Speaker 2:          01:25:49       It's like this is, this is a hard thing to factor out and it's conceivable if it's contaminated by optimism, I would say that I'm to the circumstance. So the test optimism is unwarranted past a certain point. So to be up and you'd have to assume that isn't stacked and therefore it came back. But since the things that decreasing incrementally one by one and when you're going to figure out pretty quickly that it was set up, well, yeah. Well that's, that's the hope is you figure it out. That's right. Stop in. Lots of things in life are like that. I mean, you know, to do something and it's working, it's working and then it doesn't work so well and then it works even less well than you know. Sooner or later you should quit. Now obviously that can be contaminated, that fight persistence. The other thing we get, and you have these people put their finger in a pain device, minor league paid device you need is just a.

Speaker 2:          01:26:35       it's just a lever. It's kinda about a sharp dull butter knife and it sits on your finger and there's weights on it. When you first put your thing and you can take it off whenever you want, when you first put your finger in there, it doesn't hurt at all, but the pressure, some, the pain detectors, some of the pain and all always say is, well tell us when this hurts. So people are looking at it. Oh, it hurts. Now we also say, take your finger out when a reasonable person would do so. So you know, they usually stayed there for about 30 seconds or so and then they say, well, you know, that's enough. It's completely harmless, but the high self esteem is stay in there longer than the most up to now you might say, well they're persistent. Well they are. They are persistent and sometimes that's good and it's hard to tell when it's not good, but sometimes it's not good.

Speaker 2:          01:27:21       And I would say leaving your finger in a laboratory pain device longer than average. It's probably not good at immediate behavioral. If you're optimistic and you have these far reaching goals that can be healthy. If you apply those in small, like my immediate behavioral level, things like this should have been behavioral like you're not supposed to figure out cognitively. Okay. It's incremental. Absolutely. They will never. I mean by definition they're optimistic. Sense is why? Because unless you have the ability to adapt to the everyday information, you can't learn and get. Right. That's the yes. So that's, that's a good explanation for the phenomenon. The experiment. It's not a definitive experiment by means, but it's interesting because it even argues against the short term utility of a failure to process the information that indicates that you're in here and it is linked to self deception since we use this self deception questionnaire. So. So you're, you're putting the psychopathology of neuroticism with psychopathy?

Speaker 2:          01:28:34       Yes, I guess so. I guess what I should say though, having said that, is that this doesn't mean that I don't believe that there are genetic predispositions to different forms of psychopathology and it also, it also doesn't mean that I believe that everyone plays on the same field, so to speak. So it may be an if you say you have an extensive family history of schizophrenia, well that means that it's going to take a lot less to push you over the edge, then it would a normal person and the fact that you've gone over the edge, so to speak, is not any indication necessarily that your moral character was any less than the next person's. So the parameters of the game shift with genetic and environmental context, which is to say that I guess partly different people have different temptations and also different weaknesses and, but I do think that there's a moral aspect to illness. So

Speaker 2:          01:29:45       no, that's pretty troublesome. Okay. Before we leave the, uh, tailor for Shelley Taylor hardcore, real quick thing, it's important to point out that what she actually says, and it's been pointed out, I called the block. Another critique is not the positive illusions are correlated mental health, but positive illusions are correlated with the absence of depression and anxiety, which is a very different thing. Well, she takes the argument farther than that because look, she wrote a self help book for people telling them how to use positive self illusions to enhance the mental function. So there she's extrapolating beyond the mere statement of absence of depression and anxiety, which is not a statement I have a problem with because psychopaths for example, or low in depression and anxiety, it's taking the argument the next step. That's the problem. Right? So, so I do think she goes beyond just, well these, these restricted forms of psychopathology are less frequent among people who are high in self deception. That in itself is just an interesting phenomenon. It's the next step. It's sort of disturbs me. So is that so satisfying? Yeah, that's what I was saying. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry, I guess I misunderstood what you meant.

Speaker 3:          01:31:01       That's cool. Is it magical to have hope in the face? Like almost like hope against hope?

Speaker 2:          01:31:08       Well this is, this argument gets more complicated. They're like, one of the things that she's found is that people who say if you're diagnosed with intractable cancer, well she's found that people who overestimate their chance of survival live longer now this is, this is tough. I mean, you know, that's the piece of her evidence that's really compelling, but I would suggest, and hopefully I can do more than suggest at some point that that was because she has optimism. Her notion of self deception improperly incorporates this sort of optimism that we've been discussing.

Speaker 3:          01:31:47       It doesn't. That card there that I couldn't just be like, I'm going to be one of the, the psychopaths and play till the end because I keep hoping that the next car would be like the one that gives me a quarter. I hope I'm not pathological.

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       You don't

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       know how you behave in the task either. So you know, I wouldn't draw. Don't draw inferences about your behavior in hypothetical because you don't know. He might've stop. Right? I mean, I don't do either. Maybe you would play around with the Eq, but it's also possible that some of the people just didn't care about the damn quarters. Like the game, thanks quarters to play the games at the hurricane.

Speaker 2:          01:32:21       Awesome. It's kind of a dog game. We tell people you're supposed to win the money. It's like proper behavior during this test is winning the money. So the goal is set. So mean, you know, like I said, it's not, it's not, it's not a definitive cakes. So did you have, did you have another college

Speaker 3:          01:32:39       I wanted to ask? I'm talking about hope and, and, um, anxiety and everything. The words pride, fear, hatred and revenge. What's the neuropsychological valence of like rape, like fears, you know, activation of the right.

Speaker 2:          01:32:59       But what about pride in this? So, I don't know about this, but the, the, the negative emotions, they tend to clump, right? If you look at the neuroticism scale of the Neil, all negative emotional states are in the same subscale. Essentially. Egg Anger for example, correlates very highly with fear. So, but we know the name

Speaker 3:          01:33:21       anger is activation of the left cortex. And I was wondering if revenge might be the same way. I mean, it seems like there's an approach, there's an approach aspect rather than, uh, rather than avoiding.

Speaker 2:          01:33:35       Yeah, no, that's a good point. If I don't know, I don't know what we haven't. We haven't progressed very far in the study of sorts of higher order emotions. I don't know what the neuropsychological mean as you. Anger is not necessarily proactive, but active aggression certainly seems to involve approach, but so a lot of it may be in response to the become, the farther you go in terms of overt behavior, the more complex it has to be from the original impression. Okay. Well this is just to say that fear is one of the fundamental responses that happens that happens instantly in the right frontal cortex, but then as soon as you're getting into hatred and revenge or getting into plants, secrets is naturally going to be excavating systems in different systems to though that's a really good. That's an astute comment because when you say aggression for example, what you're saying is a word that contains 40 different categories of behavioral output because there's defensive aggression, there's instrumental aggression, anger just been just for starters, there's aggression that's socially appropriate. There's aggression that's socially inappropriate. There's aggression. That's punishment elicited aggression. That's fear elicited a aggression as a response to challenge to group identity and all those different things are under the rubric of one word, but as you point out involve activation of systems. It may be in complete opposition to one another at times.

Speaker 3:          01:35:13       It seems to to be something that like if it seems to me, if there's two totally different things in everyday life we call hope and one would be sort of equivalent to the hero and the other one would be equivalent to like an over rigid identification with a social structure because like if you say you have hope in the future that that look can be the kind of thing that keeps you looking for other alternatives and helps you find a way around. Messaging sort of motivates you forward into anomaly or whatever. Like the hero to encounter the new information. Or you can have a kind of thing that we don't distinguish. We call it home too, but it's the kind of thing where you say it keeps you from finding a way around things because you say this one though,

Speaker 2:          01:35:50       I felt like faith because hope I think you can actually categorically defined hope in a sense, and I would say hope is what you experienced as a consequence of the positive valence of an anomalous occurrence, which is to say that you experienced the effect of hope when you're faced with an acute or satisfaction with an incentive reward and that accompanies activation left from the cortex is I think what you're talking about is this and you're. I think you're making a distinction between blind faith, which is, oh, everything's gonna. Turn out wonderful. You know what? Even when the barbarians are at the gate, so to speak, and the faith that says, no matter what comes up, which means I know that things will transform. I can deal with the transformations if my attitude is proper and it's certainly the case that those two things can be.

Speaker 2:          01:36:37       One is adolescent phase. That's nice. It's all my. It isn't even faith in the sense its reliance on the group, like if I followed with a group of maintained or protect me from those things I can control. The other one is, you know, I know the world is a dynamic place. There's something in me that can respond to it. That's like an absolutely. I think that's the antithesis of the of the position that motivates the lock. It's also the case. See what other questions are trying to answer is we know the group has it protected nature. That's also necessary, but that can be pathologist, so the question is given that the group is necessary that it's maintenance is necessary that people have to identify with how is it that the pathological aspect can be reduced and I would say to the degree that you're able to move your faith from blind reliance on the group to have your own capacity to address anomalous information and transform it into unexplored territory.

Speaker 2:          01:37:36       You're you to the degree that you're able to do that. You can civil status when you're dependent ties on the group because you have this alternative standpoint. That's great. There's two ways. There's two modes of protection from the great unknown. One is well, dad will do everything. That's one way of looking at the other end as well. No now saying can do everything, but if I'm willing to meet whatever happens when it happens, I can heighten the probability of success to to its highest possible level that works out because first of all, you're always practicing and that's. That's psychological hygiene as far as I'm concerned. You know, I think that's why so many religious traditions concentrated on heightening attention to day to day processes, so there's little bits of anomalous information are always cropping up in your interpersonal interaction to your professional work and everything that you do and if you.

Speaker 2:          01:38:34       If you learn how to respond to those normal occurrences that are relatively small, well they're happening. First of all, you keep your personality, how you practice knowing how to do it, so you increase your confidence in yourself. You decrease the amount of territory around you, this contaminated by the unknown, and you increased the likelihood that when something really catastrophic comes along that you'll make the right decision. It's important, you know, because you see in places like Germany for example, and certainly not uniquely all sorts of people who we might have hoped would have been more resistant to the Nazi ideology fell over like sheep when paraded out the intellectual community seemed to have no better record than the community at large in Germany. So, which, which to me indicates that despite their accumulation of facts, there was no concentration whatsoever on the development of character. We can necessarily weakens the resistance of that.

Speaker 3:          01:39:41       Um, so I'm trying to think about what, how you can distinguish between the optimist and the psychopath and your experiments and what is used to be to me, uh, in my experience and my experience that, um, or maybe at least from requirements that the psychopath goes on ignoring threat. But even while being punished, I'm numb. I'm trying to figure out if it's been punished by the known or unknown unknown things. Because when he sticks his finger in the thing, that's something that's known that it's going to hurt you. You know, they stick it in longer. That's what I'm trying to figure out. The optimist, I think ignores the red but does not keep going on when being punished by, by the known or the unknown.

Speaker 2:          01:40:25       I don't, I don't, I don't. If it breaks down, it breaks down that straightforwardly. Payne. I'm the optimist is someone I think who's willing to endure and voluntarily meet threatening conditions in order to attain their hand, but who also modifies their behavior as a consequence of encountered. That's, that's the critical time is the optimist is who's healthy is, has, uh, an ideal that may even be impossible. In fact, I think in some ways, if you don't have an impossible, then your ideal is wrong. It should always supersede your grass. That's the whole point of an ideal. It's something that as you approach it, it receives but transforms you along the way. So you might say, well, that's a pathological fantasy consensus. It can never be brought into existence, but there's a difference between your conception of the future as an ideal place and your and your belief that despite all evidence to the present is that ideal place at least in so far as it's composed of you

Speaker 1:          01:41:24       art from all these other horrible people that have been surrounded. So like the distinction between persistence and stubbornness or hardheadedness or whatever. I'm trying to understand the distinction between a hope, kind of hope necessarily report to risk action and optimism.

Speaker 2:          01:41:45       Yeah. Well, again, I would say that I would say that's faith. Actually Cornell West talks about leap of hope. Oh yes. Okay. Required to sustain political activism face of. Right. In the face of evidence. This face of evidence that all your personal efforts are useless. Yeah. Right. Right. So that's healthy. Depends. Again, it's very. It's very dangerous to try to identify a definition of something that can be defined as healthy. Okay. That's all. Let me see if I can address that. Weren't particularly adaptive.

Speaker 2:          01:42:29       I mean our society is predicated on the idea that despite all appearances, something divine about the individual. I think what Cornell West is referring to is the necessity of acting on that belief even though it, even though number one, it's incomprehensible, and number two, it seems to exist despite the evidence. Now you say, well, what would separate that from a delusion? Well, I think there is evidence to support the notion that it's accurate because for one thing, those societies that make that presupposition seemed to work much better than those who don't. And that strikes me as a form of evidence plus, I mean what we consider evidence that's very difficult to to come to any agreement about. But it also strikes me that if you look at traditional wisdom in these myths, for example, what's constantly pointed out is, look, you don't understand the function of the individual.

Speaker 2:          01:43:19       There's more to it than meets the eye. The more to it being at the individual is the phenomenon that creates order out of chaos. So the incarnation of Martech, so to speak, plus the force that rejuvenates the archaic social system when it needs to be rejuvenated. And now those two things, account for the divinity of the individual, so to speak. And I would say, well, even though it may not be evident to you necessarily in your actions, how that is playing out, if you're doing it for the right reasons, then it will play itself out. Neat. You said, all revolutions start invisibly, which is his explicit recapitulation of a hero myth because the hero's always born under know trivial and threatened conditions. So Moses, for examples, he's gonna be he's threatened with death by the Pharaoh and let go on a river and in the Christian story, Christ is born in the stable, inherited, threatens him with Gaf.

Speaker 2:          01:44:16       And that's just a sign that you know terribly important things. Many have the May have the outside appearance, even a failure, but that's no indication necessarily that their failure, well then you say, well, how the hell do you separate that from delusion? Well, that ties into that's a good way of closing and that ties into this book. He can't tell using objective evidence if you're, if what you're doing is going to be successful, partly because you have the wrong timeframe. So maybe the thing you're doing is absolutely right. No one knows for 300 years. You're not going to know it because you're not going to be here. So how do you know? Well, the only thing I can say, the only way I can think of that you might know is by watching how your actions, by watching how your belief in actions slip. Say it again. What is it that you want?

Speaker 2:          01:45:06       Let me just get this right. The thing that tends to turn people against life is the fact that life is full of inexplicably tragedies. I would say that if you can develop a motive of an attitude towards the world that is characterized by an increase in the ability to bear, it's tragic circumstances, that that's evidence that your attitude is correct. Now, the only person who's going to be able to determine that is you, because it's not going to be evident necessarily the people around you and it may not play out the way you would want it to in the external world. So then the question is how is it that you can come to the state where you can trust your own judgment about your beliefs? Given that people's beliefs get out of hand all the time and they say, well, this belief is right, well that that ties back into this.

Speaker 2:          01:45:53       If you fill up your head with information that you know to buy your own definitions of truth to be false, then you can ensure that you're not going to be able to trust your own judgment. Now, the problem is there's going to be times in your life where your judgment is the only judgment that can even possibly be valid and it it better be the case that when you're in that circumstance that your head is free enough of lives so that you can be certain that the decision you're making is right. So I would say, and this is the thing that's going to underlie the last lecture in the course, is there's two poles of this. There's two. Paul's that underlie your ability to determine if you're on the right path is way one is you're doing something that you're interested in that's meaningful enough so that you say, even with all the tragedy of life, the fact that I can do this makes it all worthwhile.

Speaker 2:          01:46:41       And the second thing is, you better make sure that you're not diluted in what's making you interested in and the only way you can be sure of that is that you're not lying because you might end up developing an interest in the expert because that happens to people or in slaughtering, and then their interest guides them somewhere. It shouldn't have gone. And I would say, well, that's because they pathologize themselves by filling their brains, so to speak, filling their mind because the information they know too, they know is not vertical. So there's two poles. One is where something meaningful manifests itself. Follow it. Now people want to do that anyway. That's what makes your life interesting. The other thing is whenever you have the opportunity, make sure that you tell yourself the truth, because if you don't, your interest is going to become sick and then a lead you somewhere. You do not want to do it

Speaker 1:          01:47:35       anyways.

Speaker 2:          01:47:37       So our last classes next week,

Speaker 1:          01:47:41       hold everything up. I have your assets. Yes. Yes. Would you say that most of the time if a person continually the thing, no, it is. That they might have behavior so much in the days they don't like that. It continually create like the weight, let's say. Would you say that that's probably rationalization that most of it.
