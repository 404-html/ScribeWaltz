Speaker 1:          03:41          Creative people are getting a really rough or they're not getting a break at all and there are probably more creative people doing non creative work in the workforce than the other way around. Oh definitely, definitely, and the thing is, I don't want to paint too dismal a picture about being creative because one of the things that pays off big for creative people is that they get to be creative, right? There's great aesthetic joy in that in depth, and I've been privileged because I've worked with more creative people than than, than would fall to the law, let's say, of the typical psychotherapist because people often come and see me because they've watched my videos online and they deal with people who are interested in those subjects tend to be creative and one of the things I've really been struck by, first of all, I've learned that for those of you who are interested in such things that the reason human psychology works is because it works for creative people.

Speaker 1:          04:33          It doesn't work at all for non creative people. It's just false and slot for them. They're not interested in it. No, it isn't how they think. You mean as therapy? Yeah, there that it doesn't match. It doesn't match their personalities. Whereas creative people, man, they dream market typical dreams all the time. It's really interesting and also they die if they're, if they're not being creative, they wither on the vine. I had one client, I really liked him. He was, he was a brilliant architect and his rational mind was his worst enemy because it just criticized everything. He was hyper rational, criticized everything and really in a dark way and effectively, you know, is that if I could get him to not think and just create, he was a complete genius. He could. That's where all of the vitality in his life was. You know, that's where the sap rose up inside the dead tree that was sort of embedded inside of him and it's very common with creative people is that it's their life blood and it really is from a biological perspective. This isn't some EPA phenomena. It's, it's, it's built right into people in deeply.
