Speaker 1:          00:02          Hi Guys. So a quick update.

Speaker 2:          00:05          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06          now I'm going to be having a debate Saturday at nine 30 in the morning eastern standard time and it will be live cast on Jordan Peterson videos on youtube. The participants will be Mayo Moran, who's the moderator, she's a professor of law and the provost at Trinity College, University of Toronto. I'll be debating Mary Bryson, who's a professor of education and senior Associate Dean Administration and innovation at the University of British Columbia. And Brenda Cossman, who is professor of law and director of the bottom center for sexual diversity studies at the University of Toronto. She'll undoubtedly telling me that I don't really understand bill [inaudible] and the legislation that I'm commenting on, but we'll see about that.

Speaker 1:          00:52          So of course, since the debate has been announced, the PC authoritarians are in an uproar because, um, well as Huffington Post Canada blogger idle Khatri pointed out, the university met my demands for holding a public debate. Well, I want to just mention a few things about that because he, first of all, he doesn't know what the hell he's talking about. And so, well, let's just say that he's uninformed. I didn't demand that the university holds a debate. I met with the Dean after receiving two letters from the university warning me to stop doing what I was doing and I suggested given the uproar that surrounded the videos, that there was something that should be talked out in that the university could perhaps models civilized conversation about such complex topics. And so I was in no position to demand anything. So it's typical of of I would say the PC authoritarian ideology or idealogue misuse of language.

Speaker 1:          01:46          You can bend the story too to suit your perspective without really giving any second thought to the truth. And of course he commented the University of Toronto is providing yet another stage for spreading uninformed fear and hate. Well you can make what you want out of that. I don't know what exactly he means by yet another stage. I mean they certainly didn't provide me with my first stage and of course I wasn't spreading uninformed fear and hate to begin with. But I would say that's just typical of of the behavior of, of the people on the PC authoritarian part of the political spectrum. So what else is new? Well, Leonard Cohen died, so that really was too bad because he was great. That's the big news in Canada. And then of course Donald Trump was elected this week. Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business.

Speaker 2:          03:06          Copper

Speaker 1:          03:09          can. Why was that? Well, there were a variety of reasons, of course, but I think that the simplest explanation was that in in the mid seventies the Democrats, they abandoned the working class to play identity politics. And that's too bad because of the working class. Reagan needs a voice in politics. And part of the reason for that is that there is a proclivity in societies for, for the winter to take all fundamentally in in monetary circumstances. And so that accounts for the rise, not so much of the 1% but if the one 10th of one 10th of 1% and it is a constant societal battle to ensure that economic resources are funneled in some manner down to the people who were near the bottom of the dominance hierarchy. So the working class needs a voice, but it's not the Democrats and that's why the rust belt abandoned them and cost Hillary Clinton the election.

Speaker 1:          03:59          They identity politics. People are not interested in the individual. This is sort of their defining characteristic. And for them, group membership is all that counts. I was thinking today, if you told the Kentucky Coal Miner this story about people demanding their own pronouns, the first thing he'd think is, man, I'm voting trump. And you know, it's, it's hardly surprising. So anyhow, that's what happened in the u s so back to the, to the topic at hand, I want to review with a pc game again, and this is, this is the game that the Democrats have been playing, especially on the left. Instead of focusing as they should be focusing on the economic concerns of people who are disadvantaged regardless of their group identity. To play the VC game, you identify an area of human activity that can be any area of human activity from sports to economic activity.

Speaker 1:          04:49          You know that there's a distribution of success in that area of activity like there is in every human activity. There's some people who are good at whatever it is that's being done in some people who were less good and of course the people who are good at it do better in the people who are not as good do worse, so you identify the winners and the losers. Then you claimed that the losers are losing because they're oppressed by the winners. That way you can dispense with any such thing as competence, for example, or failed to notice the effect that say hard work has on fostering success. I know that there are campuses in the United States now where it's considered a microaggression to make the claim that people who work hard make more money than people who don't work hard anyways. You can also claim. Then once you've claimed that the losers are losing because they're oppressed by the winners, you can claim unearned allegiance with the losers.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Feel secure in your comprehensive explanation of the world because you've got everything wrapped up. You've got five axioms. That's all you need. You can explain everything with them. Then you can revel in your moral superiority and you have the additional benefit of being able to target your resentment towards your newly discovered enemies. So any rot or blackness that you happen to be harboring in your soul, you can vent towards these people that are hypothetical oppressors and that that means that you can be a terrible person and you can feel good about it at the same time. Then you can repeat that forever in every possible circumstance everywhere, and that's the PC gate. Now, we've been looking into that fair bit with our research. I'm working very hard with my graduate student, Christine Brophy right now, my phd student trying to get our first paper on political correctness ready for release, but I can give you some, some more, some information about it.

Speaker 1:          06:29          We did a video with rebel media about, we weren't as articulate as we might've been about it, so I'm going to give it another shot here. So, Oh, before I do that, another element of the PC game, this is part of the pc philosophy defined injustice as any equality of outcome. I would like to give you an update about the University of Toronto Human Resource and Equity Department's training material. They decided they were going to make antibiose and antiracism training mandatory for their staff and I made my second video back in late September about that and somebody slipped the training material underneath my door. And one of the things I found out that was absolutely distressing was that the consultant who was hired to do the antiracism and antibiose training was attempting to teach, let's say. But I would say indoctrinate the staff into how to analyze a, an organization to decide if it was a oppressive.

Speaker 1:          07:20          And so basically what you do is you take the organization, imagine that it's a pyramid and it has different strata. Then you assess each strata, you assess it demographically, so you assess it by group identity, race, gender and so forth. I suppose sexual preference and all the other things that the PC authoritarians like to go on and on about constantly and defined people. And then you match each strata of the organization against the general population. And if the demographics don't match exactly. So if there aren't say 51% women and 2% gay people and maybe 6% native people and whatever, whatever makes up the population, then you define the organization as inequitable and regarded as corrupt and in need of modification. There's obvious problems with that. Not least. That being, that quality of outcome is perhaps the most pernicious of Marxist doctrines. And the attempt to impose that on entire populations in the Soviet Union and in Mao's China resulted in the deaths of millions of people and we collect the Cold War to stop claims that he, quality of outcome was the, was the optimal metric by which to measure society's progress.

Speaker 1:          08:27          So that's the University of Toronto hr department. They're not at equity. Not only are they taking advice from a group of radicals who won't disavow violence in their pursuit of social change, but now they're basically pushing what can only be called communist propaganda from like the 1930s on their employees. It's absolutely appalling. Kelly Hannah Moffit, who's the vice president of human resources and equity should promptly resigned. So a little bit about the historical basis of these, uh, ideas. I would say that the political correct authoritarian types are fundamentally influenced by two philosophers. One, Karl Marx, uh, who was the father of communism and his basic principle was from each according to his ability to each according to his need. Now that sounds good. And it was a good enough slogan to attract the attention of intellectuals everywhere in to other people as well. The problem comes in its practical application and the problem is who determines what constitutes need?

Speaker 1:          09:28          Because it's very, very difficult to decide if my need say, because I have a father with Alzheimer's is greater than your need because you have a daughter with cancer and a wife who's an alcoholic. So who the hell parses up need? And, and the problem of course also is the need is infinite. And it's also no easy matter to determine whether or not each person is contributing according to his or her ability. And that's partly why we have a free market because these sorts of things cannot be determined by central authorities. And as soon as they are, then all hell breaks loose. And the other part of the PC philosophy horror show is Jacques Derrida and Jacques Derrida, I think was the most dangerous person who lived in the 20th century. Well maybe not because he had to compete with Hitler and mio and Stalin. So maybe that's a bit of an overstatement.

Speaker 1:          10:13          It probably is. Darin, I think. I think you might describe him as a philosopher of extreme resentment and he's a real trickster. He basically claimed that human categorization is for exclusion. And so the postmodernist, he's a postmodernist, basically claimed that there's no truth, there's only competing power games essentially. And that the reason that you categorize the reason that human beings categorize is to further their power games. And so categorization is for exclusion. You don't form a club so much to keep people in as to keep people out to, and that's part of your power game. And that's of course absolutely ridiculous because one of the things that happens when you categorize is for is that you exclude things. Otherwise every category contains everything that exists. And so what the hell good is a category like that. Obviously categories exclude the idea that that's why we categorize is preposterous.

Speaker 1:          11:03          We categorize to simple simplify the world so that we can operate on it properly. And so we generalize across discreet entities so that we don't have to deal with every single discreet entity. And the reasons that we categorize are quite complex. We tend to categorize things in the same category if they can be used for the same purpose because we're basically tool using creatures. We don't so much categorize because things have the same objective properties because things have many objective properties and so, but we do tend to categorize things as similar if they can be used for similar purposes. That's an extension of our tool using capacity into the cognitive domain and dare to also claimed essentially that there's nothing outside the text and so for the postmodernists everything fundamentally is interpretation. Everything is subjective and you can see that reflected say and legislation like bill see 16 which which insists that gender identity and identity in general I would say is only subjectively defined which is of course also observed because your identity is something that you negotiate with other people.

Speaker 1:          12:03          If you're older than two, and I mean that technically because two year olds are egocentric and they have a hard time negotiating anything with other children and they can't really learn to do that until there were about three and and most kids are pretty good at it by the age of four but if they don't get it by the age of four, then it's very difficult for them to make friends for the rest of their life. They, they get excluded from the peer groups and then they don't stay abreast of their peers and they end up up alienated and often antisocial. It's really not good to construe. Identity isn't only subjective, is unbelievably psychologically and philosophically primitive. And the other thing about identity that should be noted is that identity also has functional utility. So if you're, if you have a genuine identity, so if you're an artist, say, or a lawyer or a businessman or a plumber or a nurse or a physician, you're identity is something that, it's a set of skills that you use to operate in the social and the natural world. And so there's plenty outside the text. Anyways, I was thinking today about who Karl Marx and Jacques Derrida would produce as a, as a child, as an offspring, if they ever were able to meet successfully. And this is what I came up with. Yeah, it'd be the joker. And, and here's why. Here's a great scene from the Batman movie that's each herd Heath Ledger, who really had the horror of resentment down to a, to a science.

Speaker 3:          13:25          Oh, so could I say I? So look, I told you I'm a man of my word. Where is he? Italian. Well, I'll talk to [inaudible] to verge on the location in 20 minutes. I want auxiliary units to cover all possible get away routes.

Speaker 2:          13:42          Please don't go to mind what you'll go with all your money. You see how the guy have simple taste. I enjoy, yeah, dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline and you know a thing that they have in common. Eric sheet all I am, I'm only burning my half. All you care about is money deserves a better class. I'm going to give it the don't tell you're mad thing work for me. This is my setting

Speaker 1:          14:32          so you can see that when the joke or does get his share of the money, he doesn't want to use it for anything. It's not the point. The point is to gather it so that it can be destroyed. Just to show that all he is is a destroyer and there are plenty of people who were only destroyers and I certainly regard the malevolent and of the Pc Authoritarians as fundamental destroyers. They want to bring down everything because the resentful, they're resentful right to the core and that's a very powerful human motivation. You see that reflected, for example, in the biblical story of Cain and Abel, which is really the story of the first two human beings because Adam and eve were made by God. So the story goes, Cain and Abel were the first genuine human beings and they instantly lock themselves into a murderous embrace where one was very resentful of the other success and uh, ended up in fact killing him despite the fact that he was his ideal.

Speaker 1:          15:24          That's a cautionary tale for everyone. So I want to tell you a little bit about our research. So we took 192 political items, uh, that we gathered by analyzing what had been discussed in the media as elements or instances of political correctness. We tried to be agnostic about it and gather as many statements as we possibly could. And then we subjected them to a statistical procedure called a factor analysis, which helps sort beliefs into their categories. And two beliefs go in the same category. If, if you agree with one, you're likely to agree with the other or if you disagree with when you're likely to disagree with another, you can see patterns of covariants it's called, but patterns of similarity within data sets and it's an agnostic pro process because it's, it's purely computational. It's an eight I would say it's about as atheoretical approaches can possibly be.

Speaker 1:          16:13          Matt managed in in a science, we found that there were two clumps of politically correct belief. We called one pc liberalism and here's a couple of examples of things that pc liberals particularly belief. Other question would be rate the degree to which you think the following constitute evidence of an unjust system. If you're a PC liberally, you believe that societies in just because or unjust because only 5% of the fortune 500 companies have women as ceos. Because in 2013 the poverty rate for blocks in the U s was 27% well for whites it was 10% and because 64% of physicians and surgeons are men in the United States. So that means that societies unjust pc liberals agree with such things as the world is warming because of the human species burns too much fossil fuel believe that racial, ethnic and gender quota should exist in employment. Believe that government interventions should exist in schools and companies to ensure equality and professions where there's a historically large inequality.

Speaker 1:          17:12          So that's partly quality of outcome. That's the beliefs that clump together to make the set of beliefs that we described this pc liberalism. And so here's what the PC authoritarians look like. They are in favor of censorship. So they believe that books, including the dictionary, movies and art should be censored for offensive slash racist slash sexist discriminatory language and ideas. So they're pro censorship. They believe in punishment. For Racist, sexist, or homophobic slurs. And they also believe in retooling the justice system. So for example, they believe that an alleged perpetrator of sexual assault should have to prove his or her innocence, reversing the standard western legal doctrine of innocent before proven guilty. They believe that students suspected of sexual assault should be suspended pending further investigation. So that means that a suspicion is sufficient to disrupt someone's life. And they believe that is wrong, to criticize the status and rights of women under Islam because that is racist and disrespectful of multiculturalism.

Speaker 1:          18:13          So that's the PC authoritarian set of beliefs. Here's what predicts whether or not you believe those things. So if you, if you're going to believe the set of beliefs that characterizes pc liberalism, then the best predictors were that you had attended a politically correct seminars. So that shows you exactly how powerful propaganda is. And, and the answer is very, you're verbally intelligent. So the more verbally intelligent you are, the more you believe the PC liberal line you're hiring openness. And that's a big five trait that's associated with creativity. You're agreeable, particularly compassionate. So agreeableness is another big five train that's associated, I would say with maternal behavior, especially on the compassionate and you're more likely to be female, you're more likely to be educated and you're more likely to be gay. Whereas if you're a PC authoritarian, you have low verbal intelligence and and low intelligence in general, high disgust sensitivity.

Speaker 1:          19:06          And that's been associated with conservatism in the past. So the pc out there tarion's or are weird, a hybrid between agreeableness say which, which puts them on a pc spectrum and the same kind of orderliness and disgust sensitivity that seemed to characterize right wing authoritarians. Ah, you're more likely to be nonwhite religious with a low income female diagnosed with an anxiety or mood disorders. So that might account for the desire for space, a safe spaces and such things. A agreeable, compassionate down, polite. And again, the best way to think about agreeableness is as a maternal dimension. And that's I think why pc people treat everyone as if there are children and you're conscientious but orderly, orderly, not, not industrious. These factors are only correlated at 0.12. So these are not the same people. And we think the PC liberals are basically apologists for the PC authoritarians, so I want to read you a letter that I received recently, the details that I just wanted to say.

Speaker 1:          20:04          Thanks for standing up for your beliefs for others and for free speech in the face of what I know must be a very continuous and publicly attempted shaming. I'm a liberal and a feminist in my late thirties until a few weeks ago when I begin checking out your videos. I would have described myself as a third wave feminist. I graduated from the University of British Columbia with a major in biology and a minor in women's studies. I believe I was part of the early wave of this pc authoritarian indoctrination. The difference being I remember being encouraged to have open dialogue back then in my women's studies classes, we didn't have trigger warnings are safe spaces that came later. I ended up finding myself working in entertainment, which I now believe is influenced heavily by academia. For the past 15 years or so, I've managed careers of Comedians and I've always been drawn to comedians with a message having adored folks like Bill Hicks, Richard Pryor and George Carlin.

Speaker 1:          20:54          Overtime comedians with a message eventually came to me comics who are living in this social justice or your bubble as am I. For almost 20 years I lived in this echo chamber and watched as social justice academic concepts grew to mainstream influence, which I applaud it but at some point it started realize that in these concepts of equality and inclusion, at least in my online world have morphed into this strange cult of belief that discourages descent discussion or free speech and thought. As I mentioned, most of this came after I graduated so I saw it unfold online. I think social media for all of the good is it has brought us, has allowed us to become more isolated than ever before possible. My entire facebook and twitter feeds are full of sjws. This is the echo chamber I self selected and most of them are in an all out assault on differing opinions and on each other.

Speaker 1:          21:43          Right now perhaps because of the result of the U s election. There are a few of us within my echo chamber who are trying to share a thoughtful articles that attempt to answer the question, how did trump get elected? No matter the nuanced and intelligent content of these articles or the pains too, which I'm seeing folks try and present them in a non offensive way to anyone who may not agree the sjws are cannibalizing these folks. To be clear, these are also liberals who have been considered a part of the same community until now who are being thrown out, unfriended and ganged up on in this social media public shaming way. Now you see that's a good indication of why I'm reading this letter. It's because our research indicates that there are two clumps of belief in the pc cap, the liberal type beliefs, but but they're strongly influenced by trait agreeableness, which is not the case with with let's say normal liberalism and the PC authoritarians and there are strange bedfellows, let's, let's put it that way and they don't really agree and given the opportunity, the PC authoritarians will eat the PC liberals.

Speaker 1:          22:46          So this is a warning to upc liberal types. You should stop apologizing and acting as intelligent and articulate mouthpieces for the PC authoritarians. They are not your friends and they're pro censorship and this throwing people out cannibalizing as as mentioned in this letter is precisely the attempt to impose a censorship on their so called allies while they aren't your allies. And that's exactly what you're seeing. These are allies doing their best to try to understand why trump won so we can best change course and sway people to our liberal point of view and they are being told that they need to check their privilege, that they are only posting these things because if they're unconscious racism. Yeah. That's the sort of thing that the University of Toronto is trying to train their staff out of, that they are part of the white supremacist culture and that they are not allies, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          23:33          It saddens me because I now believe it's this kind of censorship and divisiveness and willingness to write people off by putting them in a bigot box that caused the trump backlash to begin with. I think these folks unconsciously actually, yeah, well I'm not so sure it's unconscious, but it might be pushing more and more people out of the left and ensuring the trump will win again in 2020 ultimately I think they are ensuring that our country will only become more polarized into this us versus them mentality. Yeah. You see the reason I don't think that's so much unconscious as the women's studies websites all say, if you go read them, they're out to destroy the patriarchy, which is basically indistinguishable from Western civilization, so it's not so sure to clear me that it's unconscious. I think they are propelling the very old right that they see to oppose for many of these people in my timeline, this is their career.

Speaker 1:          24:23          They are all churning out online article after article right now about how racism is to blame for the election and if you think anything else, you're a racist about how white people need to wear a safety pin to show their allies about how white people need to take the safety pins off now because it's embarrassing and only shows that they want validation for being good white people. Piece upon piece about something so trivial as a safety pin and I see countless privileged sjws in my timeline wringing their hands and posting long status updates, asking how to be the best ally they can to more marginalized folks and how these contradictory articles or confusing them. Well of course they are. If you're only waiting to be told how to be a good human being because you bought into the idea that you're privileged, presents you from your right to your own opinions and choices, then you will be pulled by each and every contradictory and incendiary opinion piece like this.

Speaker 1:          25:13          I'm sorry for the long winded email we started off as a simple thank you. I started watching your videos a little before the election because I saw folks in my timeline labeling you a transphobic and I looked a little deeper only to be surprised that I disagreed with them. From there, I started listening to some of your lectures while at the gym. I particularly enjoyed the tragedy versus evil talk and the Cain and Abel. Ella. Gloria stayed with me for weeks now in almost every choice I make ass as it should and I am learning to live well, being vulnerable to unravel what I actually believe about things independent of this sg w ideology I have been subscribing to for so long. I now see that it's not so different than the conservative fundamentalist ideology I was raised in and took several years to shed in my teens.

Speaker 1:          25:55          I don't think I understood the full meaning of that Nietzsche quote. He who fights with monster should be careful lest he thereby become a monster and if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss. We'll also gaze into the, until I began listening to your lectures and reflecting on the actions I've seen in my community slash echo chamber recently, so thank you for that to finally, I am sure you have many people assisting you and I'm going to contribute to your patriot, but if you ever need additional help, especially on any of the sjw magic words and conversation stopping tactics, let me know. I have lived without ideology as my religion for so many years and I know the language well. Well that's an excellent letter and so thank you very much to the writer of that letter who I've taken some pains to disguise. Here's something that Milton Friedman said about inequality.

Speaker 1:          26:42          Uh, Milton Friedman was someone, the Economist magazine called the most influential economists, the second half of the 20th century. He's often put into the conservative camp of, of economists, a society that puts equality before freedom will get neither a society that puts freedom before he quality. We'll get a high degree of both. Well, something to think about. Now I should also say that the anti pc stickers are still for sale. I'll put the link back below the apse in development and that was the APP that will help us locate where the bulk of poster activity is that's associated with politically correct activity. And we have a web page and development. The idea for the web pages to allow people to upload policy documents from companies and other institutions as well as governments that are fundamentally politically correct in the origin, and to track their developmental course so that we can start to figure out who's behind these sorts of things and what might be done to stop them. So anyways, that's all for now. I hope that you are able to tune into the debate. Uh, just a reminder that's Saturday, November 9th at 9:30 AM eastern standard time, and it will be livecast on Jordan Peterson videos. Thank you very much for watching. Bye Bye.
