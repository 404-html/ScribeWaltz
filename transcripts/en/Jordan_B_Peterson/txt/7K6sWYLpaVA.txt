Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, so I'm speaking with MFA and you may remember that Dr Jay had invited me awhile back to speak at Ryerson University on a Saturday and that's been a rather popular youtube video and um, he's been defending me and, and making comments about free speech on the Ontario Psychological Association listserv. That's correct. If I got the details right, but maybe you could tell everybody what's been happening. Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:28          sure. So, uh, back in November, one of our members that will put out her name, but she wrote a piece where she basically, I'll just say what I wrote, um, she basically said that, um, that you shouldn't have a forum for discussing what you were supposed to discuss and that was the top of you. We're going to have the University of Toronto, the debate, the debate. Exactly. And so she wrote a, uh, a piece, um, and put online and she posted it to the list serve and I essentially wrote in my email to the list or whatever. I've written a number of comments about this. Uh, and mostly I've been saying every time I'm, one of your stories comes up or another similar story comes up, I'm posting it, they're saying, look, this is what's going on, this is not some mad ramblings. This is a legitimate concern about ideology run amok. And either I get met by silence or I get people, you know, ask me why I'm so angry or why I'm taking it so personally. Or I get people emailing me back channel, mostly older people, most of the oldest psychologists who say we support you completely over, afraid to say anything because of the consequences.

Speaker 1:          01:33          And what do you think they're. What consequences do you think they're afraid of

Speaker 2:          01:38          that? I don't know. I mean, I, some of them work with these colleagues, um, others may be trying to get professorships or trying to get tenure and they were afraid that uh, these people who do a hold positions in academia could hold them down. I think that's the biggest,

Speaker 1:          01:52          it's a perverse effect of the tenure system because it tends to silence people before they have tenure. And so then of course they practice being silent and by the time they do have tenure, if you've practiced being silent for eight or 10 years, then, or six years for that matter, then it's going to be pretty hard to break that habit. So, so what, so what are they objecting to with regards to your postings?

Speaker 2:          02:16          So whenever I post something, it starts off pretty neutrally and I've written a long a message to the Ontario Psychological Association. I sent it to the president. I asked them to read it to them, uh, they are convening or they had convened a meeting, uh, to deal with this issue. And, um, it was very, very long. And I said, I have not actually done anything wrong. I post links to stories such as yours, like the last Friday one at mcmaster. And then somebody goes one of two ways. Either somebody will impugn my character or my motives. Uh, recently somebody had implied that your message is full of hate. They actually use that word and someone who has hate in his heart, you know, so and by extension myself or they will ask a question and I will address it, but for the most part they're mischaracterizing what I'm stating. And so I will simply say, look, I did not say that. Show me where I said that. And more often than not they're not picking on any specific issue. It's just the, the theme because on the Old Pa, apparently if you're on one side of an issue it's okay. If you occupy a different position they won't accept it.

Speaker 1:          03:19          And so what, what do you think has is going to happen and what have people, like you said that they've convened in our so called emergency meeting about this issue. And so do you have any idea why it's an emergency and, and, and what, what they're planning to do?

Speaker 2:          03:35          Well, I think they consider an emergency because I'm one of the board members. She's the one who wrote that piece saying that you shouldn't have this debate. And I, she took umbrage at a post that I wrote where she's from noisy. And you know, I don't say this like they're not being facetious, she doesn't always eat. And another person from Boise

Speaker 1:          03:52          instituted this studies in education. For those of you who don't know, you might, if you were feeling charitable, you would recall it regardless as ideologically possessed.

Speaker 2:          04:03          Right? Right. So, um, so she's from and she's the one who wrote the piece and then somebody else will always. He wrote what anybody, any reasonable person would say. It was a, um, a fair comment, which is basically trying to say, look, can we all just be a bit more polite in our tone, more respectful. And she listened to five points that we should all aspire to, which I don't disagree with, but the problem is she's also from noisy and there's a subtext to the message, which is basically this message is directed at me. So what I did was I wrote, and by the way, she posted this after the president had already shut down the discussion. As soon as he shuts it down, I really attract, I'm not going to say anything but to other people put postings on and they directly, uh, you know, basically, like I said, they, they mischaracterize me and they looked me and tried to make me look bad. And so I spoke out and in one of my pieces I said to her, if you really believe in what you're saying, I said, please make sure you apply this to the people who are on the other side, the ones we're calling to shut down this discussion. I said, you know,

Speaker 1:          05:03          the president of the OPA shut down the discussion. What exactly does that mean? How does he, I believe, how does he do that? Why did he do it?

Speaker 2:          05:13          Well, he sends out an email and says, please, this is getting a bit out of hand. Will you please not talk about this? That's about the extent of it. And reasonable people will refrain. I shouldn't even say reasonable. Let's say, um, people are trying not to cause conflict will, we'll stop posting, which I have done. And their concern is, I think that the tone gets out of hand. And again, I don't think there's any tone. The worst she can say about my tone is it's blunt. There's no name calling. It's literally every single time I say, show me where I said this, you know, or if you, you know, you're mischaracterizing that. Or I say your argument is irrational, irrelevant. Basically, uh, you know, don't appeal to emotion. We're dealing with facts here. Let's deal with them. And, and you know, and the team. And

Speaker 1:          05:54          do you have any examples of this sort of things that you've posted that you could share with us?

Speaker 2:          06:01          Certainly. So in one of the postings, so this woman who again, posting something that seemed reasonable, um, I basically said to her, I said some, I'll just read this, a couple of paragraphs. Some members might find my direct rational, logical and fact based fact based messages not only with respect to the issues themselves, but also with respect to claims made by those who disagree with me. For instance, when I respectfully state, please show me where I said or did this to be rude, offensive or inappropriate, which to me is a gross misuse of such terms. However, some of those same people have directly stated or implied that I am a misogynist. I transfer a big, get, hateful, reprehensible, unreasonable, and unwilling or unable to engage in respectful discourse. The next step is where I got where things got heated. I said moreover, and I mentioned the, uh, the colleague I alluded to a few minutes ago.

Speaker 2:          06:47          I'm explicitly stated on this with a survey in November that she did not believe that Jordan Peterson should have been given a forum to discuss what any reasonable person would agree is far from an unequivocal issue. She posted a link. I posted it to an online article she co wrote, and this is critical, uh, that stated her reasons for what most objective people should find a concerning call for censorship of not only non hateful ideas, but also scientific investigation and discussion as well as civil debate about poorly conceptualizing worded legislation that could potentially cause unforeseen harm. I wrote that and her response was she actually posted a response and I hadn't heard from her for quite some time and let me just read it. She posted or an annotate. I have just as much right to express my opinion as anyone else. I already put you on notice once, but I will say it again. Please leave me alone. That's what I think led to the emergency meeting and you know, look at the context I have every right. I have just as much right to express my opinion as anyone else. I agree with that. But why would she be calling for other people not to have that same? Right? They bought prosy is astounding. And so Carolyn,

Speaker 2:          07:57          I really don't know. They may ask me to, uh, you know, to leave the LPA. They may ask me to leave the LISTSERV. I'm one of the OPA strongest advocates. I just, you know, every time I'm in the media I will mention the work that they do. They do a lot of excellent work, including the presence so that he's. He's done excellent work for homelessness and for promoting psychology. So the worst they can do is, is try to pick me out. I know that this member in question was trying to enact something against me. So, you know, some sensor like more formal censure it, it never happened. Aside from a public review.

Speaker 1:          08:33          Precisely. I mean, you read some of the things that you've written. I mean, why is it that you're being targeted? Well, first for an emergency meeting, which seems a bit like overkill, but perhaps it isn't, but what is it that they're, what is it that they have on you? So to speak that would result in centering of that sort?

Speaker 2:          08:54          They literally have nothing because I've not called anybody names. Um, you know, even when I called the a member immature, I didn't name them at all. So the worst they can say is the tone might become a bit hostile. But this is what worries me. I, again, I might be forceful, I might be blunt, I might be repetitive and verbose, but I stick to the facts. Uh, and right. And the problem is those facts are on the wrong side of their ideology and that's what's propelling them. They can tell you them and the other thing is that, so as I mentioned that he receives quote unquote dozens of complaints from members who this is what is incredible, who are basically saying that they do not want, they can't tolerate the distress that comes along with knowing that I'm writing emails to the LISTSERV and that they might give up their membership. This is a kind of issue that's going on and again, if you look at my posts and I've written to the OPA and every time someone criticizes me, I specifically write, show me one thing that I've written that's inappropriate or offensive.

Speaker 1:          09:53          No one's ever called and they can't and you have a record of all these postings. I presume I have them all. Yes, there. Is there anything in them that you would be. I mean that you've written that you would be unwilling to make public, assuming that you could get rid of names and so on that might identify people. Is there anything that would make you uncomfortable about revealing publicly?

Speaker 2:          10:13          The only thing I'd be concerned about is making sure that we're not violating some ethical code, which I guess would be portraying a psychologist or a psychologist in a negative light. Um, I don't know if this qualifies as that. I think this is having an honest discussion about a personal.

Speaker 1:          10:31          You would only be, I would suspect, responsible for portraying psychology in a negative light if your portrayal was unfounded from a factual perspective. I would presume, I mean reasonable leeway in a, in a, in a policy of that sort. Although the problem is those things are subject to interpretation.

Speaker 2:          10:53          Right? And that's my concern is, is that interpretation I will seek legal counsel. I don't know if our coverage applies to such a situation. Um, but I will ask the lawyers that we have insurance for and see if this would count as that. I really don't.

Speaker 1:          11:12          What's happened to you, if anything, as a consequence for hosting me at Ryerson. I mean, not a lot of attention.

Speaker 2:          11:20          The only consequence is that people have been thanking me for being someone who's standing out and saying you're standing up and saying we need to have this discussion. Nothing so far.

Speaker 1:          11:30          Oh, well that's good. Yeah. That's two.

Speaker 2:          11:33          Now the thing is, um, my next contract is coming due at Ryerson. I'm cinema, sessional lecturer. I've been teaching it for 15 years. Um, I always get the positions I applied for it because I've taught so far off on a total of 160 courses at universities. Excellent reviews. And um, if I find this term, that's the first time ever that I don't get the positions I applied for, that's the consequence we will find out. I don't think that they would do that. I think we have a pretty strong union, but I don't have tenure as we were talking about. I don't have a secure position and I've got a very busy clinical practice, but to stop teaching, to be not to be able to communicate with students who want to learn, who wanted to learn about critical thinking and being motivated to challenge ideas that be, you know, a horrible consequence.

Speaker 1:          12:15          Yeah. Well, there's always youtube, you know, what facing you, but it is certainly possible with you've got something to say that people need to hear and it actually constitutes reasonable quality education that in in a, I would not say precisely in a pinch, but it certainly is an alternative and you have full control over that. Well, it'd be very interesting to see what happens with your, with your contract renewal and we can certainly have another talk at that time whether it goes badly or whether it goes well either way. So what do you think's going to happen to you? What do you think's going to happen to you overall as a consequence of this? What are you afraid of, if anything?

Speaker 2:          12:58          I mean the worst that could happen is that somehow the college decides that this is, you know, this warrants some kind of heavy sanctions. That would be, you know, somehow I lost my registration over this.

Speaker 1:          13:08          That's the college of psychologists got involved in Ontario rather than just the Ontario Psychological Association because the college for everyone who's listening to colleges, the body that regulates our clinical side, clinical psychologists licensure in Ontario, and to have them make any action against one of their, one of the, one of the licensed psychologists and Ontario, that can be a very, very serious thing. That was definitely something that worried me while it still worries me to some degree, but certainly worried me a lot back in October and November when, when the remote was more negative, when the university was responding negatively, for example, to what I was doing and sending me those warning letters. I mean, so far nothing, nothing has come of that. But um,

Speaker 2:          13:52          yeah, I mean, and that's the only real yes it is know. And practically speaking, let's say the Ontario Psychological Association Listserv, the LPA lists or um, a lot of people send out referrals. And so if I'm qualified to deal with one of the cases that they send out to you can be guaranteed that certain people will not pass that referral by way of, I met my practice is busy enough as it is, but you know, that would be a potential consequence. This is why other people might not want to speak out. And again, if I'm applying it

Speaker 1:          14:19          is, it is this sort of thing that, that is why people don't want to speak out. And it, it also, I mean, I get letters, hordes of letters, dozens of letters from people who say exactly that if they're afraid to speak their mind, students and students and people from all other walks of life who are afraid to speak their mind because they're targeted by my people who have censorship on their mind and malice in their hearts, I would say. And who are willing to use whatever means necessary to intimidate people whose opinions they don't agree with. So exactly, it's really not good.

Speaker 2:          14:55          And the thing is though, this is what's worrying me is that the, uh, the OPA OPA. And what I can tell from the comments that people don't see what you're saying. I mean, I think they think you're being hyperbolic reactionary. Um, you know, they say, show me one case and now the thing is they always apply it to the transgender issue. And I say, please try to see it at a different level. It's not just to put transgenders you, that's just the context under which it happens. But the actual issue,

Speaker 1:          15:20          look, this was about preferred pronouns. It would've died out in about a week and it hasn't died out at all. Quite the contrary. Everyone with any sense knows perfectly well that this is about far more than and preferred pronouns. That just happened to be the issue. Does your, so to speak?

Speaker 2:          15:39          And. Yes. But I have to say though that the most recent, uh, when I posted the talks that you had on Friday at mcmaster university where they shamefully a shut you down and you weren't able to speak. When I posted that somebody wrote me and again, and they wrote to me privately and then publicly on the lists are asking me about why won't you just say they are focusing on that even though we can cruise is a deeper issue. This is the rigidity with which they're seeing this issue.

Speaker 1:          16:09          A reaction. The reaction. Why won't he just say they to viewing what happened at mcmaster university is a little bit on the peculiar side I might say. So, you know, it's, it's, what do they say? Swallowing a camel. Well, straining at a nap. I think that's how that saying goes. So, um, all right, well, so is there anything else that you wanted to talk about tonight or is that, does that basically cover your concerns and describe what's been happening to you reasonably well?

Speaker 2:          16:40          I think it does. I mean, and I'll, I'll look into it and see what I'm able to maybe post publicly so that people can see what kind of discussions are being had. It, you know, I won't put any names, it will just simply be no, this, this is the manner in which we're, we're, um, we're communicating. And again, I

Speaker 1:          16:56          managed to, that would be that people can judge for themselves, you know, because at the moment it's sort of he said, she said, which is not great. I mean it's not like mean certainly I'm listening to what you say and believe that you're portraying it accurately, but it's much better for people to be able to make that judgment themselves. So that would be, that would be a useful thing to do. Assuming that you can do it without compromising yourself or anyone else in any unreasonable manner. But I also don't think it's unreasonable to make things like this public because quality can make something public. You really have to wonder what's going on. So if there's a restriction against sharing what's been happening on what's more or less a public, it's more or less a public forum. I know that it's part of the Ontario psychological association, but it's not exactly private communication and if you're going to get, if you're going to get in trouble for what you're posting and it's unreasonable, it would be useful for people to be able to see that. But you can decide that so.

Speaker 2:          17:59          Well, I'm sorry Jordan, if I can say one more thing just because I do want to be fair to, to sell then. I mean, as I alluded to earlier is concerned is that it might be violating some OPA. OPA is hosted by the APA, the American psychological association lists or for whatever reason, and he's concerned that, you know, that it might be violating that. So for him shutting things down, I have no problem with that. If he's worried about that reason. It's the, it's the, um, I guess the message coming from the other members, which is essentially they themselves are saying they shut it down because we don't want to hear it and they think I'm being just to again too arrogant or, or forceful. But again, that's not the real reason. The real reason is that they don't like what I have to say and um, but, uh, but again, I understand the, uh, you know, the ostensible reason for which, uh, they're, you know, they're, they're shutting down the discussion. I just want to make sure I'm clear on that and I don't want to misrepresent that. That's what they're saying.

Speaker 1:          18:52          Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean it's hard to hard to know what to say about that. I appreciate, I appreciate what you're saying about it. I mean, it still seems to me that the whole point of a list service so that people can communicate their ideas and I do believe that we're entering an age where forceful discussion is going to be regarded as somehow will oppressive and violent. And the problem is it's very difficult to discuss anything of importance without a certain amount of forcefulness, which you know, is also directness and bluntness and speech. That's to the point. And we certainly don't want to interfere with that and otherwise. Well, for obvious reasons, for obvious reasons. Alright. Well thanks very much for talking about this and I, I guess I'll know. We'll know very soon exactly how this went and maybe I can talk to you again when we find out.

Speaker 2:          19:41          I'll give you an update to find out what, uh, what they decide.
