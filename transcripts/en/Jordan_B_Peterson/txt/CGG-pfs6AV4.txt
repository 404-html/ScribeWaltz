Speaker 1:          00:00          So here's a brief note to tomorrow's student demonstrators. For those of you who don't know, there's a demonstration plan for tomorrow. They call it a rally and teaching, um, at Sydney Smith Hall, that's 100 St George Street, Toronto, 479 people are interested. Two hundred and 32 people are going in. 1,100 people have been, have had this missive shared with them. And so this is the call to action released by people who are planning the, um, the rally. And I'm addressing that for a number of reasons. Um, but I'm only going to, I'm going to stick to one very briefly. The people who are putting out this call to action say, have said the following, Jordan Peterson, University of Toronto professor and practicing psychologist has released the first of a plan three part video series of attacking political correctness and academia. And this video he declares this proud unwillingness to call transgender people by any pronouns he does not believe apply to them.

Speaker 1:          00:59          His disbelief in the very existence of non binary people and his belief that any attempts to challenge him or anyone else on these points, amount to Marxist fash fascism. Okay. So the first thing I would say is that I do not regard any of those three statements about what I said as accurate representations of what I said, but I don't have time at the moment to do a detailed refutation of them point by point. So I'm going to have to make this very straightforward and simple. I don't disbelieve in the existence of non binary people. Okay. Do you want me to say that again? Obviously people who don't fit into standard binary categories of sexual identity, uh, however you decide to construe that broadly or narrowly. Obviously those people exist. I never said they didn't exist. What I said instead was that biological sex, gender identity and gender expression do not vary independently and they don't vary independently. And we'll just leave it at that for now because I don't have enough time to go into the rest of it all the way will in the future. So if you're going out tomorrow to this demonstration because you want to indicate your discomfort with my disbelief in the very existence of non binary people, you might as well just stay home.
