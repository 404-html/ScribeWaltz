Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I'm actually supposed to be talking to you about constructivism today, but I'm not going to continue to talking to you about what I was talking last time and I'll collapse the constructivism lectures into one lecture so it'll keep us on track. I want to tell you a little bit about a little bit more about this image and what it probably means and then then we're good. We're going to continue with our discussion of shamanic transformation and its relationship with personality transformation. So the first thing, if you look at the picture on the right, the first thing you'll see of course is that it's a tree and the tree is associated with snake. Now I believe I told you guys about Linnaeus bells research and the relationship between predatory state prevalence, acuity of human vision, that you remember that. Okay, that's good. So, so to me what the image on the right looks like is, first of all it's like the ancestral home of human beings for tens of millions of years or our that's tree with the snake, with the primary human environment maybe 60 million years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       It's not human at that level, but it's, it's, it's, it's part of our evolutionary heritage. And then it's also part of why we have a sense, especially that large trees are sort of statement that's one of the senses that drives environmentalism, for example, because environmentalists are often very interested in protecting old growth forests, which is actually kind of weird because old growth forests are ready to burn down and they're also kind of biologically dead. There's no light can get to the bottom and nothing grows down there. So they're just trees and they're almost dead treatment. So, you know, from, uh, from uh, from the perspective of biological diversity, they're not wearing that and environment, but human beings still have some real kinship with those gigantic trees. And we feel that there's something, you know, natural sacred. So superimposed on that is I think something like the next stage of human evolution.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       And so, you know, these, these representations were made by people who are trying to represent the sort of, the ultimate reality of mankind. And so super imposed on the tree is a is a mile and a mountain is a nice representation of a pyramid. And The pyramid is a nice representation of a dominance hierarchy. Of course, I already mentioned to you that human beings live in Darwin. It's hard because in that there are very permanent part of our environment being at least 300 million years old and possibly older than that. So when, when the human imagination is trying to conceptualize what constitutes ultimate reality, that's a reality that's often beyond what you could merely see because the things you see that are directly in front of you are not necessarily the most real things in that many of the things that you see are transforming fairly rapidly.

Speaker 1:          00:02:37       They're not permanent in any real sense. I mean automobiles to see all the time, but they've only been around for 80 years. You know, it's not like we've adapted biologically to their presidents. So you have a mountain in the middle and the mountain is sort of sitting in a circumscribed territory. And the idea there is that there's a dominance hierarchy that human beings inhabit and it always occupies a particular. And the dominance hierarchy is like the culture, the place of culture that mankind exists within, that surrounded by the chaos outside and the chaos outside is represented by the two snakes and be in the picture on, on your, in the snake in the middle isn't zero growth, it's a snake that eats its own tail and it's representative of the chaos that's outside of the familiarity of your culture. And so that's, it's a very, as we've mentioned already, it's a very intelligent perspective because it says, well man, I'm kind always lives in culture and surrounding culture is the unknown, and that's the internal habitat of, of man.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       So human beings. So, and then I showed you this picture briefly and that's the picture that was derived by a German researcher who was examining the visions of the Peruvian Amazonian Indians, the Shaman. And you can see it's almost staggeringly same perspective right down to the snake that eats its own tail, which by the way is an extremely common ancient symbol. So it's quite remarkable. Um, now what might unite, and then I talked to you about my, my son's drawing. I haven't given to get to this one though, or what might unite these different visions say that Scandinavia division in the Amazonian romantic vision are the methods that the people who had divisions use to induce them. I'll talk to you a little bit about that, but first of all, I'm going to tell you about this picture because I think this is one, a couple of variations of this picture that I found.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       I actually don't know his name, but I think it's one of the most amazing images I've ever come across because in some ways sums up Christianity in one picture. And that's no easy thing to do. And the reason I think it's important to, uh, to, to talk about the Christian representation, for example, that we've already talked about some Dallas representations is because if in so far as we're embedded in western civilization, the roots of Western civilization are, they pushed themselves down into Christianity and then deeper, there's deeper substrata under that. The religious structures that preceded Christianity. But if you want to understand the western notions of the person and the ideal person as well, you have to look at the structure of the systems that Western civilization, Rhoda, because the religious systems, for example, or the systems in which the idea of the ideal emerged and so you.

Speaker 1:          00:05:23       You can't come to grips with the idea of the ideal or the idea of mental health, which is which is an ideal without understanding the ground out of which these ideas emerged. You can't come to terms with it many fundamental sense. And the thing is, if you're doing clinical psychology, for example, you have to come to terms with it in a fundamental sense because a lot of the time when people come and see you, the reason they come and see you is because their sense of life's meaning has been shattered and and they're unable to proceed without the restoration of that meeting. So maybe their belief systems fell apart and they faced some sort of tragedy that's just blowing them into pieces and they have no idea how to orient themselves. Because life always presents us an existential question. And one that will deal with later, which is life is difficult because it's characterized by suffering and because of that there has to be a reason to stand up against them.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       And so the reason has to be made coherence, so you have to know in some sense, but you're the sort of creature that can voluntarily face the tragic conditions of existence and prevail. And that's a religious presuppositions fundamentally because it's based on, it's a hypothesis in some sense that human beings are like that. So let me tell you about this image is. It's staggering images. So brilliant. So the first thing you'll notice is that of course there's a tree in the middle of it and sort of looks like the tree that you know, little kid withdraw, they sort of looked like lollipops or something like that. So it's a scheme of history. We'll see of course, that the snake is wrapped around the tree. The snake and the trees come along together unbelievably often. So asclepius his rod. For example, Asclepius is the Greek God of Haley.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       And you see the symbol of the Greek God of healing, which is that Asclepius, his rod are all steel used to represent physicians and it's a rug with a snake wrapped around the two and the state represents transformation because it can die, it can shed its skin, sort of be reborn and and for many other reasons besides, but in this representation, which is partly derived for genesis and then partly derived from the development of Christian ideas for thousands of years after that, there's a particular idea that's being portrayed now you don't want to set up in the tree. There are little things that looked like fruit and one of those things is a skull right now. So the idea there is that the fruit that the tree produced is in somehow is in some manner equivalent to death. Now in the, in the genesis story, what happens is that eve tempts Adam with the fruit from the tree, so she offers him this fruit.

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       Now that's a very interesting thing because women historically speaking, have been gathered like men do the hunting, generally speaking in archaic societies and women do the gathering and human beings have also a subsistent for large parts of their evolutionary history. Before we were human beings, as we ate fruit and are we the reason we have color vision by the way is so that we can detect right fruit and right fruit is also tightly associated with sexuality. So like if you look through the ads that women's magazines, the makeup adds the associations between ripeness of fruit and say women's cheeks and women's lips are always very much. They're much put forward, you know, and, and so there's a tight association between sexuality and food for a variety of reasons. But so eve basically tamps Adam in some sense, into a conscious relationship with her by offering him food.

Speaker 1:          00:08:41       And in the case of the genesis story, it's rich ripe fruit. And so that's an enticement and she also entices him into self consciousness, which is quite interesting because number one, women do make men self conscious. I mean, that's like that's the ultimate truth of the, of the nature of the relationship between men and women and rejection in particular is something that makes men self conscious and they're much more what exposed to that that women are in this sort of sexual dance because women are sort of on average, quite quite successful at seeking out sexual encounters where men are on average, very unsuccessful at doing the same thing, so they suffer a lot of rejection. It's a very fundamental form of rejection, right? It's like, well, you're. You know, you're good enough to tolerate being alive and all that, but your genetic material shipped by no means be allowed to move itself into the future.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       It's a really fundamental form of rejection and rejection is, well you don't measure up and that's certainly the ground of self consciousness and so there's a lot of weird things tangled up together in genesis story. So even gives Adam the fruit and what happens is that wakes them up with the stories is, is that the scales fall from his eyes and then the first thing that happens is he realizes he's naked. And that's a very interesting kind of realization because to be one of the very common nightmares that people have is that they're naked in front of a trout. So you might say, well, what does it mean to be naked in front of a crop? Well, it means to have your vulnerability exposed to the arbitrary judgment of, of the cultural mass. You know, it's a nightmare for most people. And human beings are very weird animals because most animals wander around on four legs.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       And of course that means the armored part of their body is what shows right? Their spine and their ribs along the back, which is pretty tough and hard, but human beings are standing up. So the most vulnerable parts of our body or broadcast straight forward. So and so. When human beings woke up during our evolutionary progress towards the kind of consciousness we have, when we became self conscious, that was essentially equivalent to recognizing our naked vulnerability and that's what the genesis story is trying to relate. When it also points out that it says snakes, women and fruit played an integral role in the development of human self consciousness. And so here the fruit. That's the equivalent to death and that's why there's this in the tree. And so because what happened was when people became self conscious, like consciously self conscious, we, we started to understand the full nature of our vulnerability.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       And so what does that mean? Well, for human beings and in part it meant that we discovered time like, and that's a great thing to discover because then it means you have the future to think about, but it's also an absolute bloody catastrophe because you also understand that the future is finite and that your life is bounded and that you will end. And as far as we know, human beings are the only creatures that have to contend with that knowledge. And once you have it, like once you wake up like that, there's no going back to sleep like it's a qualitative transformation in the nature of experience. And you know, the genesis story pushes the idea farther. It says, the fact that we've woken up when they're are aware of our vulnerability is also what makes us fallen creatures. It makes us alienated from existence in a way that animals aren't.

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       And so what that also means that this is sort of an existential idea, is that the rise of self consciousness in that manner, which is in part the knowledge of death is also what's made people, um, well, one of the things that happens, for example in genesis, it's quite a funny story. So he makes Adam a self conscious and then they wander off and cover themselves up, right? Which is sort of the first entry into of cultural artifacts into the paradisical state. That's right. The first thing you do, once you realize you're naked, covered yourself up. Now you know, that story is often interpreted in a sexual way. And there's elements of that, but it's more, it's more pragmatic. It's like, yeah, once you figure out that you're naked and you're going to freeze to death and then it's cold in the future, it's like the first thing you do do is cover yourself up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       You know, when people have been wearing clothes for a very long time, we've been wearing clothes for so long. The body lights are adapted to clothing and so it's been tens of thousands of years. So you know, and obviously human beings are also the only creatures that were closed, which is, you know, and it's a human universal by the way. People were clothes everywhere that virtually everywhere that human beings have been discovered. So you cover yourself up and that's the first indication that you're aware of your vulnerability, but you're also aware of the necessity of taking care of yourself as a, you know, as a separate entity, which, which animals. Animals don't really seem to have that notion. I mean, they get hungry and all of that, but it's not obvious that they know that they can extend the idea of hunger into the future so that you know, so, so that they're, they're caring about times that are not here yet.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       Now what happens after people become self conscious to cover themselves up and then God comes into the garden, which he's always doing. You have a walk with Adam and Adam can be found. And so God says, you know, well, you know, where are you? What are you doing? Hiding away in Adam's cowering behind a bush, which is really stupid. These, there with eve, you know, thinking, I suppose that God can't see through the Bush or whatever it is that he's thinking, you know, he makes a case that God asks him what in the world he's doing hiding. And he says, well, I make it. And God says, well, you know, how'd you figure that out? And of course Adam being heroic figure he is if point Steve and says, well, it was the woman's fault for me, but you know, it was her that tempted me.

Speaker 1:          00:14:19       So it's really quite a comical story. It's, it's often being red being read by sort of Patriarchal Christian interpreters as a story that implicates implicates eve in the initial destruction of mankind. But from, for my way of reading it, it's just as hard on added, were even worse because he's such a cringing powered when things really start to go wrong. I mean the first thing he does is hide because he's naked. And the second thing he does, as soon as these pushed on it a bit, it's like, it's your fault. It's your fault. You know, we won't take responsibility for it. And that's also an extremely complex story because one of the things that implies it's brilliant, brilliant idea is that like, if you can imagine metaphorically that walking with God means something like, you know, uh, staying in close contact with the divine nature of being or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       And having ultimate faith in the positive nature of reality. Things that might damage. If you became self conscious, what, why would you stop believing in that? Which would be to stop walking with God. And the answer to that is, well, you become aware of your own vulnerability and your own finiteness and that makes you afraid, so you'll hide. And that is what people do. They do that all the time. It's, it's a chronic state of human existence that in many ways you hide from the best parts of yourself. But I mean adolescence is usually like the painful acting out of that process over a protracted period of time. And people often never really recovered from that. They won't bring their best forward because they're afraid and they're afraid for good reason. And so God says, Oh, well now you've done it. You know, we can't undo this.

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       And so now out you go, you're not going to be in paradise anymore, which means you're no longer going to be unconscious like a happy child. It's like you've screwed up completely. You know your finite. Now you're going to have to work because you're aware of the future. And so you know all these things that can go wrong, so you're going to have to work because you realize that the future could be dangerous. You have to fix things up and he tells the women that they're going to suffer dreadfully in childbirth very well. It's very interesting because there's a reason that women suffered childbirth and the reason for that is that your child's heads are too big activity both about that. The last time we met, you know, and so the story there also associates cortical expansion with self consciousness and with the difficulty of birth.

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       It's bloody brilliant story. It's just unbelievable how much information is packed into it and then that's, that's very characteristic of archetypal stories that also helps you see how the, you know, another manifestation of the kind of tree symbolism, say that's characteristic of the Scandinavian stories and approving an Amazonian and stories and enroll snake. No trees without snakes, no paradise snakes, no ability of mankind to ever produce a bounded environment that's safe without something chaotic managing to come inside of it. There's no way you can do it. It's a very paradoxical element of existence. So that's pretty. That's pretty interesting. So that's what's happening with teeth. On the right side of the picture, you see this skeleton at the back there. Representing depth, so that's good. We'll leave and then on the on the left side here you have the embodiment of the church and the Christian tradition.

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       Now she's also handing out things that are from the tree and so this is like that. The, the religious stories in general are stories about tragedy and redemption. That's sort of what makes them religious stories. It's like the outline, the terrible things that can happen to you, like in the most brutal possible way. And then they provide a theory about a mode of being that might help you address stuff. So that's the redemptive part. And so the redacted part here is you see in the tree there's also a crucifix. It's sort of a counterpart to this call and getting the tree. They're all these little fruits and some of them are obviously the apple skulls that eve are handing out, but what they are on the left hand side, our hosts and the host is the little thing that the Catholics eat during the mass and the host is hypothetically part of Christ's body.

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       And so that's what's. It's a derivative of the last supper. And so there's an unbelievably archaic idea that lurks underneath that because it's basically basically a cannibalistic ritual and the idea is essentially that if you can identify something that's an ideal and you can incorporate it and you do that most basically by eating because that's how you incorporate most basically, then that can become part of you. So you can take on the attributes of something by incorporating it. And so part of the Christian drama is an attempt to inculcate in its followers the idea that you should imitate the ultimate ideal. The question is, well, what's the ultimate ideal in different religions handle that in different ways. So food, if for example, is an ultimate ideal for Buddhists, Christ isn't ultimate for Christians. So then you might say, well what exactly is this thing that's ideal?

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       Okay, so the host is part of it. So partly it's the body of Christ and partly it's a wheaton wafer. And the reason it's made out of wheat, just because we was regarded as a dying and resurrecting crop, because it's a, it's a, it's a crop that you know, disappears in the fall and then comes back in the spring like most agricultural products too, so it's kind of an eternal miracle. So it's like the dying and resurrected corn God. And so that's a pagan idea that sort of assembling the Christian idea and then there's something that's more profound than that, which is that the idea is that the part of the human spirit that can accept death and die and resurrect itself, which means to continually transform in the face of tragedy, is the thing that's the antidote to the painful catastrophe of self consciousness. It's a staggering idea.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       I mean, I've studied personality theory for a long time and the first thing that I've discovered relationship to this as almost all the personality theories that we have that involved movement towards a state of improved health are predicated on the idea that people transform through well through a process of painful transformation. It's like disillusion of part of your personality, which is painful in chaotic, and then the reconstruction of that into a, into a more fulfilled form and the reason that's associated with acceptance of vulnerabilities. It's van, it's brilliant. This is why the military is a virtue from the religious perspective is that you cannot change until you admit that you're wrong and that part of you has to go. So you have part of admitting your insufficiency as being willing to sacrifice that insufficiency to let it go so that something new rise out of the ashes.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       And sometimes that can be your whole personality. You know, to the degree that your pathological in your fundamental structures, man, there may be things that you have to give up that are huge chunks of your life. So the alternative is to be in pain and suffering and misery and that can turn into cruelty and murderousness and, and things that are much, much more terrible than me are suffering. So that's the idea here. That's a whole whole story of human redemption in St Louis. Mindboggling brilliant. And you know, it took people like took people thousands of years to think about this image or meeting ends of thousands of years. So there's so much thought packed into that image is beyond virtually beyond comprehension. Remarkable amateur.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       So here's, here's some other representations of trees that I think are quite interesting. So the first one here is a sculpture, a living sculpture that's a representation of a complete. You can see how the trees, the curvature of the trees and makes this beautiful arch that is echoed in the Gothic Cathedral. So in the gothic cathedrals are stone trees essentially being the treats. And so in some sense they're representative of the forest. It's human human beings private home, but they're representative of something more than that too. Because the gothic cathedrals are these interesting trees made out of stone that are also places of light. Because what the gothic cathedrals are, basically they're what they're made of our is the interplay between tree like stone and light. This big glass windows of course, are the light. And so there's this idea that the ultimate structure is some tree, like call them.

Speaker 1:          00:22:31       That's invadable limelight. And in some ways that's an analog of the body and its and its function. So when you say symbols that are associated with is. Well first of all, when you see, sorry, these are echoes, these are echoes of the tree like structures that are with him because the tree structure is a structure that many biological farms statements. So you know there's the, that's the nervous system tree we're meditating on for a bit because most of us are convinced that our brain is in our head. And really that's not right. It's just not that accurate. But look at the. Look at the dissemination of your nervous system throughout your body. You know your brain is distributed through your body, your spinal cord. It's pretty damn smart. It can walk by itself. So for example, if you take people who have, who are paraplegic but have only, they've managed spinal damage at a point that doesn't, they're no longer able to voluntarily controlled their legs.

Speaker 1:          00:23:28       If you heist the off and put them on a treadmill until the floor with their legs will walk by themselves. So because your spinal cord is smart enough to walk, I mean you need your brain to tell it where to go, but in some people who are paraplegic have been taught to walk in a controlled fall. So it's quite interesting. So you know when your spine isn't stupid, it's part of your brain. It's just a lower part that's more associated with movement. But you know, your whole body is full of central nervous system. There's more neurons in your autonomic nervous system, which is the part of your nervous system that controls your internal organs that the reason your break so you know you're, you're stuck right into your body and the idea that you're, you're in your brain in some ways. It's like a hangover of the sole theory.

Speaker 1:          00:24:11       You know, the Cartesian duality that makes minded body something separate didn't united. I mean I believe something do that, you know, it definitely underestimates the degree to which you're an embodied nervous system and that this and that. The structure of your thought is predicated on the fact that you're in a body. Like you're in a body cognitive creature and you wouldn't think or be the way you are without the body. It's not like an appendage to your brain. You know how it works at all. You can see the brain and the spinal cord as and you can see the neurons themselves as tree. So the tree like structure Echos at different levels of the nervous system. These are very interesting representation, so they have a man in a lotus position. Why Lotus position? It's another tree metaphor. So a lotus is a very interesting plant.

Speaker 1:          00:25:06       So what Lotus is is that it grows on water, so the water steve and maybe the top of it's clear, but then the bottom of the water is very, very murky and deep and dark, and so it represents the dark elements, sate of the unconscious mind or the unknown, that art that we aren't privy to and the Lotus grows way down into that and then into the soil below and so it comes out of the darkness, the soil and the darkness, and then through the dark water and then up into the, into the clear light and on the surface of the water it blooms and it. So it opens up like, like a Mandela, like the stained glass window on the right. It opens up like that. And in the middle of that, the Buddhists sits in his trying either position in the Lotus position and that represents enlightenment.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       And what the whole image represents is the coherent ordering of multiple levels of structure all the way from the primal material up to the highest level of consciousness. And so the Buddha is like the ultimate flower of the, of the Lotus tree. So to speak, just as in Christianity, Christ is the ultimate, the ultimate manifestation of the, of the tree, of the knowledge of good and evil. The very, very analogous ideas and there's reasons for this to it and part of it is part of it is something like if your psychophysiology was properly adjusted so you weren't working at cross purposes to yourself so that you are nicely aligned, straight up, physically healthy and not defeated lobster scuttling around the information flow through your nervous system, through your body and your mind would be optimized and that would enable the reality that you're attached to and part of, to through you sort of in an untrammeled way.

Speaker 1:          00:26:45       You know, instead of you're, you're all full of bricks and trouble and problems and, and places that are badly aligned and you know, you haven't got the opportunity as a consequence to sort of get access to your own wisdom as you're sort of a bit representation of who you could be. And so part of this and also the like the stone and glass that's represented represented in the cathedrals is a representation of the idea that there should be a balance between structure and light in you. It's like it's the metaphorical idea and that you should be properly oriented physically so that, so that, so that you're in touch with the ground of being in a way that makes you why isn't solid. And that's one of the things that enables you to take on the tragedy of the existence without becoming weak. I mean these are, these are roads, so this is a, this is an eastern Mandela and me.

Speaker 1:          00:27:35       What, what it is, is it's a tunnel into this tree like structures, like a cross section of the tree, like structures and if the hip you're looking into the tree like structure down to the micro elements of Ba and there's representation there about how perfectly aligned and everything is at every level of, of, of resolution and every level of manifestation. So he's back that are docs. That's another way of looking at it. It's the same representation on the western side of things. It's like that stayed last window is like a cross section of the trunks that make up the cathedral. All these buildings like the medieval people spend a lot of time building those cathedrals, you know, those things were massive works of culture and some of them took hundreds of years to build. I mean, can you imagine modern people building anything that would take like even 100 years.

Speaker 1:          00:28:26       It's like we want things to be up in six months. You know, at most those medieval people would work away for like 300 years on the cathedral if they were really serious about what it was, what it represented, you know, they were trying to, to produce, uh, uh, the embodiment of the highest ideal in architectural form. You know, and we've lost a lot of that even on the campus. You can see that because if, you know, if you go over to the sort of classical side of the campus, it's all, you know, cathedral like in beautiful. And there's, there's some, there's some attention being paid to the aesthetic element of the wisdom that's embodied their knee. Come over on this side. It's a bloody like, it's hideous. It's a factory, you know, the, the aesthetic is so terrible. It's, it's appalling. All the buildings that are built to last for 50 years and then they're outdated and completely cheap and hideous and cinder block.

Speaker 1:          00:29:17       You don't want fluorescent lights. It's like come on, you know, and that they have you guys sit in these things that are so uncomfortable that you wouldn't put your dog in and then you know, it's, well, it's the loss to lose this sort of thing. You know, there's a big difference between a medieval cathedral, a Gothic cathedral and this flooding place, you know, but what you're supposed to be in a university is something that's like a medieval cathedral. You don't want to say it's a testament to the best that mankind has to offer. You don't put it in a box like this. It's appalling. It's appalling. There's no excuse for it. I actually think it's a conscious effort to subvert the values of the university because it's not a factory. You're not factory products. You know, the university is here to teach you how to be human beings and that's the highest thing that you can aim for. It's and to subvert that to a lower orders. It's the worst thing that can be done. It's a crime against humanity. There's no excuse for it. And the ugliness that goes along with it as part and parcel of the subversion, it's like a hatred of the highest values. Terrible thing.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       So you know nobody, none of you are going to go home and say, I feel proud that you were sitting in this room know, alright, so now the Sharman are very strange people and it's very difficult to know how long our kick people have been practicing shabbat rituals, but we know that it's tens of thousands of years and we also know that most of the shamanic rituals and the visions that accompany them are induced by some kind of hallucinogenic substance. And it depends, like it depends on the culture what the hallucinogenic substances. But one of the things that's interesting about them is that they all have basically the same chemical structure. And I'll show you that in a minute. So the sharpen people are chosen to be shown on our. Basically you might think of them as the repositories of the oral tradition of the culture, you know, because most cultures have for it to be a culture, first of all is it's a culture and it's living, it's been around for a tremendous amount of time, you know, and non knowing literate cultures have to carry that wisdom that they have with them in oral form or an embodied form.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       So in ritual for more in oral form it somebody has to be the fundamental repository of that kind of wisdom. So this sort of the storyteller of the tribe and the keeper of the flame so to speak. And that's usually the role that the shaman have. And they're the people who are contacted when something's gone wrong with you, if you're sick or if you're having real trouble mediating with another tribe member or someone like that or, or you know, when you're maybe overcome with all because you're looking at the night sky, you know, it's the showman who's supposed to be dealing with the realities that are outside of day to day reality. And so they're like masters of sacred space. That's one way of thinking about. And sometimes they're that way because their father was a or maybe their mother and sometimes it's because they're kind of peculiar, you know, there are people who are visionary as, as part of their temperament.

Speaker 1:          00:32:16       And we know that visionary penis, so to speak, is an element of temperament. It's associated with trait, openness and that's associated partly with intelligence, but also partly with creativity. And those things aren't exactly the same. So some people are more imaginative and visionary than others. And in our culture, those would be people who tell great stories. Like j Dot k rowling is a really good example of that is she's been a shamanically intermediary for, you know, for an entire generation of young people with these massive books that she's written that you know, have a mythological core right down to their rate, down to their essence. And Stanley who ran marvel comics. There's another person like that, you know, has had an immense cultural influence because he's brought these ancient stories back up from the depths and put them into modern form, you know, and the writers of these things are quite consciously aware of what they're doing with regards to the relationship with the underlying this.

Speaker 1:          00:33:09       They're not stupid people. And even if they were, their readership rapidly informs them if they're deviating from the, you know, proper narrative arc of the store because those, all those superheroes have their dedicated cults of followers and they make bloody sure that the new writers don't mess around with the story. And so not only going to only is it top down from the writers, but it's also bottom up from the readers. So they're all participating in the construction of it continuing cultural apparatus. So spontaneous vocation, while you're sort of designed for hereditary transmission, well you know, it's a familial issue and then there's the personal quest issue too, so that sort of associated with spontaneous vocation. So, and the personal quest element with me, there's always people in every culture who are fundamentally obsessed with the pursuit of meaning, you know, that's their essential orientation towards life and not particularly practical like a conscientious person would be.

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       He was a conscientious person, works you know, and their, their head isn't in the clouds, but there are types of people who are, are not like that at all. Their heads are in the clouds permanently and all. They're extraordinary and magical. There've been creative and there are thought leaders in many ways for the culture because a lot of what culture is learned in an articulated sense. A lot of what they become conscious of is presented to them by artists in somewhat unconscious farm long before the full meaning of the, of the, of what's being portrayed as articulate. Just like that. You know, I just showed you that tree image with Mary and the church, you know, on either side of it. It's not like the person who drew that knew what they were doing. They knew more about what they were doing. Then the people who couldn't draw that sort of thing, but they were.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       They were existing on the edge of their knowledge, making this representation, thinking, I'm trying to get at something here. I'm trying to get at something here, but they didn't really know what it was because the idea is so complex that you know when, when people have are coming up with it over these thousands of years, your periods, they don't realize the full impact of what it is that they're revealing and just as you don't realize your own full important by whatever this is from Eritrea Eliana, but by but by whatever method he may have been designated, a showman is recognized as such. Only after having received two methods of instruction. The first is ecstatic dreams, trances visions. The second is traditional shamanic techniques, names and functions of the mythology and genealogy of the plan. The secret language, the two full of teaching and is by the spirits and the old master Shaman constitutes initiation.

Speaker 1:          00:35:46       And so that, that's very interesting. Uh, that's a very interesting representation of the manner in which personal revelation becomes knowledge. So, you know, let's say you know, you're beset by like a very frightful series of nightmares. I mean, what that's going to do is to drive you to try to understand how to represent what you're having nightmares about in terms of the cultural elements that you have at hand. Because that's what makes you saying, you know, if you're having experiences that are beyond the norm, unless you can incorporate them back into your culture, you're alienated from your culture. And that's a terrifying thing. It means like you might be the only person that's insane like you and you know, it's very, that's very intolerable for people. It's bad enough to be different, but to be so different that you're incomprehensible. It's like, can you. That's the sort of horror you don't want to encounter.

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       So the Shaman or people who are are possessed by like a rich inner fantasy life, but who are simultaneously capable of taking that and weaving it into the cultural mythology that they're part of it. That's what makes them saying rather than insane. Because schizophrenia is someone who's has visionary experience which often auditory, no, they hear voices and they're possessed by spirits in a sense. You see them wandering down the street, you know, monitoring to their, to their own internal voices. But they can't integrate any of that with the culture. So they're just, they're gone. They're lost souls. So the Shaman is someone who does both of you know who, who has the vision, but to incorporate it at the same time. So someone who is master of the visions of not victim of. And so there's technologies that allow people to do that. A lot of them are associated, as I said before, with the use of various solution agentic substances in Siberia.

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       The youth who's called to be a showman that attracts attention by a strange behavior. For example, the Sikh solitude becomes absent minded, loves to roam in the woods or unfrequently places, has visions, and sings in his sleep. In some instances, this period of incubation is marked by quite serious symptoms among the yakuts. The young man sometimes has fits of theory and easily loses consciousness, hides in the forest, feeds on the bark of trees, throws himself into water and fire and cutting themselves with knives. So those are ordeals in a sense, you know, a future show among the Tongass as they approach maturity go through a hysterical or history crisis, but sometimes their vocation manifests itself. At an earlier age, the boy runs away into the mountains and remains there for a week or more feeding on animals which tiers two pieces with his teeth. He returns to the village filthy and blood state, and it's only after 10 or more days have passed that he begins to babble incoherent words.

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       So you would think from the perspective of modern human being says, this is something like descent into the unconscious structures that underlied normative cognition. Just like you descend into that at night when you dream. So very peculiar process that you are all perfectly capable of engaging in, have most of you have virtually no control over it. I me, there are people who dream lucidly you know, and who can exert some conscious control over their dreams. Most people can learn how to do that to some degree, but in our culture at least most people dream unconsciously and it's just something that happens to you and not something that you're actively engaged with. Strange behavior of future Sharman have not failed to attract the attention of scholars and from the middle of the past century by which he meant the 19 century. Several attempts have been made to explain the phenomenon of shamanism as a mental disorder, but the problem was wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:39:12       We put from the one hand, it's true that Shamans are always are always have to be neuropathics or neurotics are people who are not well put together mentally. On other hand, those among them who had been able became shalman precisely because they had succeeded in becoming cured. So what that means is these are people who have undergone some kind of existential crisis, sometimes one that's induced. You know, as part of the process that turns them into Solomon, but they were able to undergo that existential crisis and then put themselves back together and so that's what makes the masters of of the chaotic ground so to speak, and so you're starting to fall apart and you don't know what to do while the best thing you can possibly do is find someone who's been there and come back and that idea of going somewhere and coming back is also a very, very common mythological story.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       So that's the story of the hobbit. Truths at the audit goes off on this quest and he undergoes all sorts of trials and the encounters that dragon that lives underneath everything and he gets the gold from the Dragon, which is the information that the dragon stores and then he comes back to his community and he's transformed, but he's strange like he's going off on this big adventure. Now. He's like, well, put together a tough. And he's also rich, but he's also peculiar. When bill, Bill, Bill, Bill goes back to the Shire. You know everybody. No one's exactly sure what to do with him because now he's contaminated with everything that he's gone through CCS, like an agent of chaos himself, you know, and someone who's somewhat terrifying but you know, useful if you have to have a consultation about how you might deal with the next dragon.

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       So now I said that a lot of the shamanic initiator editorial ritual seem to be associated with a loose use of hallucinogenic drugs and so the most common ones that we know about our mushrooms, so for example, there's this mushroom which many of you've probably seen in fairytales, right? That's on the cover of fairytales very frequently and now it's called a nominee to miscarry a mushroom and it's generally viewed as extremely toxic and there's some. There's some reason for that because it can, it can make the people who eat it very sick and now and then people do die from, but mostly it's extraordinarily hallucinogenic. The Vikings, for example, this is quite a terrifying story. The vikings used to take as needed miscarrying mushrooms before they went on there and pillaging trips and they use the mushrooms to transform themselves into the equivalent of predatory monster, so they usually, they're, they're sort of target was wolves or bears and the word Berserk, which is what the vikings used to go ma'am bear shirt and so they would train their young men to eat these hallucinogenic mushrooms and turn themselves into pain free predators and then they would take them before they went onto pillaging rated.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       So you just imagine, you know, you're sitting there in northern England and you're in your village and it's all peaceful in these bloody crazy fight cakes come all feel out of the ocean and boats, you know, the open boats that they've traveled across the North Sea it and they're all like stoned out of their gourd on Amanita must carry a mushroom mushrooms, an old convinced that they're like predatory bears and that's exactly how they're acting and they have no pain whatsoever. It's like, ha, that's not a good seed. That's not a good scene. You know, when the vikings come through and they just destroy everything, it's like, so that's they're used. They were used for Marshall, but there, there, there, there were a drug that's used very commonly by he goosing shamonic experiences among themselves across the whole northern part of Europe in Asia, and they grow almost everywhere. So those are the original magic mushroom, magic red and white dots. And if you look in, you can see these things in drawings everywhere, especially in fairytales, very common representation of fairy tales.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       There is some evidence that religions that are I suppose in some ways more articulated and sophisticated in that they're more articulated like Christianity say, compared to the more shock traumatic, uh, religions. I have also have their roots in hallucinogenic experience. And this may be true to a degree that we really don't understand. So for example, this is something, this is taken from the manuscript which is 11th century, fundamentally 11th to 13th century because there were copies of admitted at different times. What you see here is my mom and really the, that the snake is associated with siliciden mushrooms. And that's a very characteristic representation. And the silicide as much a minute and the fruit that eve is feeding to Adam is part of the siliciden mushrooms for speculation, you know, among people who are sort of at the fringes of, of evolutionary theory that part of the way that human beings levered themselves up into increased consciousness was by the use of machines.

Speaker 1:          00:43:55       We can see in the, in the representations over there, some of them are absolutely remarkable, like the one on the top right hand corner there, that's Christ. And he's standing there like, like this with his hands up. And then underneath the bottom half of that circle is a psilocybin mushroom with a head, uh, the, like the main body of the machine is in the same position as Christ's head at me, like the offshoots of the mushroom or in the same position as his hands. So, well God only knows what that means. So that's, that's a very strange and remarkable thing. We really don't know what to make of it. And there's a lot more investigation to be done on that. This is an Osca vine and it's part of what the Amazonian shamans use to prove their hallucinogenic mixtures and no, none of the Westerners who've gone to study the Amazonian showman configure it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:51       How the hell they determined how are they ever going to make their mixture because it's virtually impossible to make. You need to take the vine and then you need to take another plant that doesn't grow in the same place and you have to mix them together in the right proportions and then you have to cook them together for 72 hours and you have to do that without breathing in any of the vapors. And you know, there's thousands and thousands of different kinds of plants in the Amazonian jungle and it isn't obvious in any way how the people who are using these mixtures figured out how to make them. And if you ask them, they say, well, the plants told us how to do it. You know that for modern Western people, that's not much of an explanation, but it's certainly the explanation that the tradesmen seemed to stick to.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       And you know, God only knows how people gather the information, you know, chimpanzees use medicinal plants, you know, they're, they're capable of finding plants in their habitat they could eat that are in math maker. So one that helped them deal with diseases and it's not clear at all how they figured that out. So there's lots of mysteries about the origin of human knowledge, that's for sure. So the three sources of potential visionary experience, and this is very interesting. So here's the biochemical construction of hallucinogenic chemical. So the first thing you see on the bottom right is a serotonin molecule. Now serotonin is in some ways it's the major brain neurotransmitter. The reason I say that is because during the embryological development, your brain grows out, you know, sorta, sorta flowers for and it's guided and its development by the serotonin system. That's the system that uses Serotonin as its primary neurochemical transmitter.

Speaker 1:          00:46:28       So it's not only in our very archaic system and it's so old that you share it as I've mentioned before, with crustaceans, but it's also the system that sort of puts you together as you emerge out of nothing. And so you see it continuing your chemicals structure there, and then you see these are all different hallucinogenic substances. Um, this one is suicide, for example, and they're all at the empty. It's a very weird chemical, very illegal. He entity it produces if part of IOWASCA, although Iowasca is made with a plant that contains dmt. And then something called an Mao inhibitor which decreases the rate at which your body breaks it down, like parody. It produces an instantaneous 10 minute, a hallucinogenic high that people were. People constantly report contact with aliens. And there was a psychiatrist who spent years documenting DMT experiences. Every single person, he, he couldn't, he, he walked through the experience with recorded the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       They're shot out of their body and they're immediately in an alien landscape, full whack. You know what that seems to indicate is that from a, from a purely rational perspective, is that these chemicals produced characteristic experiences that are so associated with visionary experience. They put you in something that's like a dream state. Now, oddly, the dream state seems to be somewhat similar from person to person, but there are ways that in some sense that the young, the contents of the unconscious mind can be made manifest to the conscious mind at least for for brief periods of time. Sometimes that can be clearly horrifying because sometimes people take these, these, these chemicals and have like the worst experience of their life and part of that seems to be associated with the sort of thing that might happen to you in psychotherapy. So for example, if you were convinced that your psyche wasn't very well ordered and you are harboring sort of dark secrets and lies and all the sorts of things that might complicate your life and all sorts of femineity millennial pathology and cultural baggage and like the horrors that sort of live inside your brain, you know, in psychotherapy, sort of confront those one by one in a hallucinogenic experience.

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       You might confront all of those at the same time. You know, and for, for many people that's exactly equivalent to a quick trip to hell. It's not something they'd rather repeat. So why, why things are set up that way? Well, who knows? I mean we don't really understand these things so we don't understand the relationship between the parts of the brain that are articulated and conscious and then the lower parts that are sort of the repositories of traumatic information and there's deeper mysteries that we don't understand too. So it turns out, I don't feel if any of you are familiar with the term fee genesis, but there, there are studies of epic genetics now that show that there are certain experiences that alter your genetic structure and while we know that partly because when like if you put yourself in the new situation, a radically new situation, new genes will turn on inside of you and they'll coach for new proteins and they'll build new structures for you.

Speaker 1:          00:49:24       So new neurological structure sometimes. And that's part of how you can adapt. And it's also part of the reason why banging yourself against various obstacles, you know, in a, in a kind of what systematic way is a good way of expanding your range of capabilities. So we know that experience can turn new new genetic processes on that are there sort of a latent prior to that, but what we didn't know was that some of those experiences transform your genetic structures in a way that you can transmit to your children. So in that that's the Lamarckian evolution and no one ever ever hypothesized that that was possible. But you can look it up. It's, it's mainstream science now. Although you know people are still not really sure what to do about it, how to think about it from a conceptual perspective because that sort of thing wasn't supposed to be possible.

Speaker 1:          00:50:10       So No. So we have no idea to to what level of being your experiences can be encoded and we really don't know how you encode experience anyways. We don't know what the fundamental structures of your memory are, how that's associated with your conceptions of time and space are and how that's related to your ongoing experience. Like those things are deeply mysterious to us and what happens, at least in parts of the gins is that they seem to take all the horrors and terrorist that you haven't dealt with it, just put them in your face now. And that's part of the shamanic experience. And so it's not something for people to take lightly and you know, and generally generally people don't. So. But I've often found that it was very strange that these chemicals produced experiences that are so strange that our culture instantly deemed illegal.

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       You know, for me it's like looking at what happened back in the Middle Ages when the Catholic church we went after Galileo because he had something strange to say about the mood. It's like these experiences have tapped into something that's a very, very primordial element of human existence and associated say with the shamanic rituals that have been going on for tens of thousands of years and that human cultures have always used to orient themselves. They're so added there. There's so much anathema to our current culture that, you know, we, we punish people severely books with very, very peculiar behavior. So although there is no doubt that this sort of thing is dangerous and very peculiar, but you know, so the seanad report relatively constant types of experiences when they're undergoing their transformative experiences. And here's a couple of them. One is climbing the world, treat. We've already. We've already talked about the world treat and what that seems to be if you look at the reports of the Sharman is that they seem they're consciousness seems to be able to to move itself up and down levels of analysis that aren't necessarily available to you in your normal state of consciousness.

Speaker 1:          00:52:08       Now, whether or not that's a real phenomenon or whether or not part associated with the dream isn't exactly clear. So I'm. Part of it is for example, that you know, when the show him with become convinced that they can communicate with things like plants at a very fundamental level, but they are also capable of when they climb up the tree for example, of entering sort of the realm of their ancestors and communing with them. And I just read a book here recently about the revival of Mongolian shamanism and the Mongolian situation is kind of interesting because it was a pretty archaic culture and then the Soviets came in, they're like carbonized it, you know, which was sort of economically useful, but socially it was napster catastrophe because the Soviets were murderous beyond belief and then in 1989 and they just left and so the Mongolians like they were completely up in the air then because their traditional culture, it'd be fragmented and you know, the whole communist thing was a bust and they reverted back to shamanic practices and the shop and told them that part of the reason that they were all suffering was because they had lost contact with their ancestral spirits.

Speaker 1:          00:53:08       And partly what they meant by that was that the continuity of the culture had been disrupted and so people were identity. This knowing. It was funny because when Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote about the Soviet Union and he wrote the volume volume he wrote extensively about about the, the Soviet experience, his eventual conclusion. Was that the best route for the Soviets to take after the collapse of communism would be a return to the sort of evolutionary process of development that characterized their exploration of Orthodox Christianity because you have to fall back to something you know, because people need a meaning structure and you know a modern people have a hard time with incomprehensible religious meanings. Structures because we demand a certain amount of rational clarity, but there's a problem with that because the absolute mysteries of life cannot be formulated with rational clarity. You have to kind of encapsulate them in a mystery that's partially understandable because because otherwise they stay completely out of your grasp, you know, and you have no answer to the question.

Speaker 1:          00:54:14       You know, well, what's the ultimate purpose of life? You know what? You're not going to be able to get that answer in a really tight box. You know that you could open up in this, just going to provide all the answers. It's going to be murky because partly because it has to apply to everyone, but the fact that it's murky and symbolic in a sense and sort of multifaceted. It doesn't mean it's unnecessary or wrong, and you know, the more I've studied the theories that underlying personality theory, the more I've become convinced and for me convinced beyond a doubt that that connection, our connection to the, to the archaic structures of the past that defined our culture. So like without that, you're without roots, you know, and that makes you a week. That's the big problem. It makes you weak. There's nothing to you. Every whim can possess you. Every stupid political idea that comes along is instantly you're gone. You know when you're certainly capable of going crazy with masses of people and all sorts of insane ways. It has direct consequences. Do you have to be grounded in something?

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       According to a Yakut informant, the spirits carry the future to hell and shot him in a house for three years. It doesn't sound very pleasant. Here he undergoes is initiation. The spirits cut off this, have they set off to one side, for the novice, for the novice must watch his own dismemberment with his own eyes and they hack his body to bits which are later distributed among the spirits of various sicknesses. It is only on this condition that the future Sharman will obtain the power of healing. His bones are then covered with new flesh and in some cases he is also given new blood, and so the the fundamental structure of the shamanic ritual seems to be that the death of the, of the experiencing personally, they seem to experience that as a physiological transformation. So it's, it's the conscious experience of their own depth and their dissolution, right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:01       Great. To you know, the, the dust and ashes from which from which human beings originally arise. What are the specific characteristics of shamanic initiations aside from the candidates? Dismemberment is this reduction to the state of the skeleton. We are here in the presence of a very ancient religious idea which belongs to the hunter culture. Bone symbolizes the final route of animal life. The mold from which the flesh continually rises. It's from the bone that men and animals are reborn for a time. They may entertain themselves in an existence of the flesh. Then they die and their life is reduced to the essence concentrated in the skeleton from which they will be born again. And that, and then people who undergo these experiences seem to, as I said, they seem to experience their own death in a conscious manner. That's a very difficult thing to understand. You know, it's not obvious either for people who aren't,

Speaker 2:          00:57:02       what would you say who,

Speaker 1:          00:57:06       who aren't accustomed to those sorts of extremes of experiences. It's not obvious at all how much of this sort of thing you have to become conscious of, you know, because death is obviously one of the things that terrifies people deeply and it's not obvious how you should accustom yourself to that. So I can tell you a story that's quite quite interesting. I had a client at one point who was a vegetarian and that actually turns out to be irrelevant. Part of the reason that she was a vegetarian because she couldn't even go into a like a, a, a what? A grocery store where there was a butcher's department. Like she couldn't even look at the array of neat. It just horrified her and it was associated with something that was like a sleeping beauty complex for her because when she was a child, your parents treated her like she was a fairy princess and they really protected your from, from everything you know. Remember, how many of you have seen Walt Disney's sleeping beauty? Yeah. Well that's interesting and that so many of you would. You remember there's a. When the girl is born and sleeping beauty is born, they don't invite someone to the, to the Christie, who do they not invite

Speaker 1:          00:58:08       the wish, right? I think it's maleficent in sleeping beauty. I think that's her name. She's the one that turns into the dragon of chaos at the end of the story. Well, there's a, there's a message in there. It's like, do not shield your young people from natural catastrophe because it makes them unconscious and it'll come back and revisit them when they fall. Especially, you know, when they grow up, when they hit puberty and come back with force and if they're unconscious, like if they're not prepared, the horror of that will make them unconscious. And that's what happened to this girl, like she was sleeping 22 hours a day when she came to see me. It's like she was a fairy princess until she hit puberty and then she was like an evil slopped as far as their parents were concerned. It was like bang, things that switch, things switched completely.

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       Of course that was horrifying to her, but it was also tangled up for her with kind of the horror of life in general. And that was one of the things that made her so sensitive to the saint at these displays of these displays of me, which are of course quite horrifying, you know, it's kind of remarkable that you can wander through the, you know, you know, maybe a little bit of discomfort, but you know, it's slaughterhouse stuff and you know, to be normal is to be able to tolerate that. And that's quite strange. She couldn't tolerate it at all. So, you know, I took her to butcher shops. Now Amanda, because you do that with people, if they have an identifiable feared, it's actually quite easy to start the psychotherapeutic process because you start to expose them voluntarily to the things that they want to avoid.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       So you know, I took her into a butcher shop and cheesy, don't just flipped her over, you know, she sat in the car afterwards and cried for 20 minutes and told me about how terrible life wasn't that she couldn't live in the face of all this dismemberment and constant death. And she was also very, very inclined towards identification, you know, with the little cute animals, which is generally a fairly solid feminine trait, right? Because females are very attracted to things that are cute and cute. Things are basically infant tile and helpless. Right? That's sort of what activates the cute detection. You know, it's part of, of maternal behavior. It's really an part, you know, because if you didn't find your baby's cute, you'd really be in trouble because there are a lot of trouble, you know, and they. And they push you because they require so much care.

Speaker 1:          01:00:11       So they bloody well better be cute and smiling, you know, make friends with you. So, so, but, but she would like was this hyper identified with like little vulnerable animals, you know, and, and that's not good because she wasn't just a little vulnerable Annabelle, she was also partly a Predator and human beings are partly predators and you know, maybe you think that's terrible, but that's how it is. And the predatory part of yourself better be incorporated and used because otherwise, first of all you'll be weak without it. And second of all, if you don't incorporate it, believe me, that doesn't make it go away. It will just go out and have fun on its own in ways that are unconscious that you don't control. So she was a really good dreamer. This girl. And she could, she actually had lucid dreams quite remarkable. And sometimes she could either ask her dream characters what they symbolized.

Speaker 1:          01:00:59       Right in the dream, you know, is the only time I've ever seen that. Although I've had some lucid dreamers in my practice and one day she had this dream because she was really having a hard time finishing university. It was like their sixth year, seventh year or something like that and that was partly because she slept all the time and then she wouldn't get anything done like she was trying to sleep to avoid consciousness, right. To avoid being alive because consciousness was too painful for her and so she had a dream one day that she met. Actually I'm mixing two dreams here together, but it doesn't matter because it's just sort of just sort of collapses the narrative. She, she dreamt that she met at Gypsy that was traveling through the forest and the Gypsy told her that unless she was able, unless you would be willing to work in a slaughterhouse, she'd never finished her degree.

Speaker 1:          01:01:39       So she came. She came and told me that dream and I thought, well slaughterhouse, that seems a little bit difficult to arrange. When she wasn't sure she could handle that anyways. And I said, well, is there anything that you can think of? If you imagine something, is there anything that you can think of that might serve as a substitute? And she came back to me about a week later and she says, she said, I want to see an embalming. And I thought, wow, that's, that's rough. That's no, no, no doubt about that. That's rough. So I phoned around to a bunch of different funeral homes and I told them that I had a client who was so terrified of death that she couldn't even live and that, you know, I want her to bring her to the funeral home and walk through it and if it was possible to see an embalming preparation and um, they were very understanding.

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       It was quite interesting because of course, funeral parlor people are kind of strange people, right? Because they're dealing with death all the time. It's like they're daisy life, you know, and they get so it's, well they're not dying of horror every night, you know, that they are able to deal with it, which is a good thing because we'd been knee deep in bodies otherwise. Right. Someone, someone has to do with this sort of work. So. And apparently you can specialize it. And so what that all means, unless you think, you know, funeral partners, directors are like completely gone human in some fundamental way clearly indicates that it's possible for a normal person to become so conversant with death that it's daily business and you know, emergency department people are in that sort of situation. And people who drive ambulances, like human beings are bloody tough. You know, we can take something like facing death and turn it into an everyday occurrence.

Speaker 1:          01:03:20       It's like, it's kind of horrifying in a sense to think that you could be that harsh in a way, you know. But by the same token, you know, you don't want to run away screaming the first time there's an emergency in your life. You know, what the hell good are you? If you know someone close to you gets really sick and all you can do is whine and sniffle about it because it's so hard on you. It's like it's not your attorney for that. You should be strong so that you can help them. And that means that we have to be able to face these sorts of things. So anyways, we went to the funeral parlor, which is quite a weird thing for me too because I actually have rather squeamish stomach kind of disgust sensitive. And so it's hard for me, especially odors just, they're just not good for me at all.

Speaker 1:          01:03:55       But um, you know, so I could have never been a surgeon or anything like that. But we went to the funeral parlor and I found it extremely interesting because first of all actually need to know how these things operate because at some point you're going to be called upon to deal with. Maybe it'd be nice if you had a little knowledge beforehand so that, you know, you didn't only have the grief that was knocking you over, but all the novelty that was associated with trying to orient yourself in that space. So we talked to the funeral director and we talked to him about how he sort of managed his day to day encounters with death. And you know, he said he, he sort of saw it as his role to shepherd people through the grieving process and that for him and had made them in some ways more acutely aware of the affinity of life obviously, but then also made a more conscious of, you know, of each day of the passing of each day.

Speaker 1:          01:04:44       And you know, that might be one of the things that salutary about facing your own mortality. It's like waste time. Like here's, here's a good question for you guys. How many of you waste more than four hours a day? Okay. Okay. So, so I would say the reason you do that is because you haven't really faced the reality of your own death. If you had done that, you would stop doing that. You would not waste time, you know, and we could do a quick economic analysis. I'd like to do this with people. So what do you think your time's worth an our. Yes. We know it's at least 10 bucks, right? Because that's the minimum value society puts on your labor is $10 an hour. Okay? But you know, you're, you're smart and healthy and young and so each hour is an investment in the future, so it has to be considered in that matter because you're one of your hours is worth more to you than one of my hours is worth to me because you have so much of your future life still depending on it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:43       So that's a big deal. So I would say $50 an hour. It's probably reasonable for what you guys are worth at somewhere between 10 and 50 anyways. So you know, let's assume 50, hey, it's 200 bucks a day. It's 1400 bucks a week, it's 5,600 bucks a month, $65,000 a year. It's like you want to waste it, go right ahead. But that's what it's costing you at minimum, you know? And you know, you might think, well no because I'm not getting paid. It's like wrong. You're paying for your studies. You just get paid 10 years from now. It's just deferred income. And there's a huge difference between people who have bees and aches, you know, like these door shut his doors open. And so you know, you wasted that time, you will bloody pay for it and you don't get it back either. So you know, if you're, if you're awake and you know that this is waiting for you, and if there's only so much time you have that can bloody well wake you up and stop you from wasting your time because you don't have that much of it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:41       This is a medieval representation of the representation, obviously, because it's a crucifix and it has a snake on it. It's not. But it's a tree snake thing, you know, and it's actually an echo. There's a story in the Old Testament about Moses leading his people through the desert and it's sort of a, you know, they've escaped from tyranny. So that's the previous place of order and now they're in chaos because they've left here at eight. So they're all wandering round, sort of without their heads. They don't know which way they're going. They're trying to run away from something that's bad at, toward something that's good, but they don't know where they are. And so they get all kind of, you know, fighting and break into factions and then they start worshiping false gods like golden calves and fragmentation under pressure. And so, um, God gets irritated at them and he throws a bunch of poisonous snakes into the desert because, you know, he's such an easy guy to get along with say, throws a bunch of poisonous snakes and they're nickel run biting all these people who are not being faithful.

Speaker 1:          01:07:36       And so all the people who are doubting Moses are starting to freak out because they keep getting hit by all these poisonous snakes. And so they finally called them Moses to ask. I'd be like, you know, call off the poisonous snakes. There'll be, hey, I'm just calling all the poisonous snakes. And God says to Moses to build up like a, a staff with a brown snake on it. And that if people will come and look at this name, then they'll be immune to the snake's poison. Or the snakes will stop biting them. I don't remember which. And it's a lovely story because it's another exposure story and sort of means that if you're willing to gaze upon the thing that is most poisoned to you or that you're most afraid of, that that can help you overcome it. And that's sort of like this and second patient of, except it's more complex because this surface pale sort of stretches down anything infinity that representations sort of it sort of the manifestation of the unknown right from the beginning of time and space that's without even to represent something that's sort of the problem of humanity in some sense is that there's an infinite number of troubles stemming from a new source.

Speaker 1:          01:08:43       Remarkable representation. I think you heard about near death experiences. I imagine the old idea that people see the light at the end of the tunnel and then you know, wouldn't make get through the light. They see all their ancestors there. Something that vaguely resembles God and you know, and that's conditioned for some group by their cultural background. It's a very common experience. And this is actually a representation of that from the twelfth, the twelfth to 13th century. Anything by Hieronymus Bosch and this, so it seems to be the sort of thing also that's characteristic of the traumatic experience post reduction to skeleton, so the showmans dies and then as a consequence of that, he ends up in the space that's characterized by the presence of the ancestral spirits. Whatever that means and me. You can think about those as each of you are embodiments of ancestral spirits, right?

Speaker 1:          01:09:32       Because all the ideas you have, for example, are all. They're all, no there, none of them are your ideas or virtually none. It's almost impossible to have an original idea. All the ideas you have or like the ghostly remnants of brilliant philosophers are theologians who've lived, you know, hundreds or thousands of years ago in your whole head is populated by these states and they're sort of embodied things because they tell you how to act. You know, they're, they're not just cold dead ideas and you know, you're, you're, you're a mixture of all those things. And I don't know if they ancestral spirits that these visionaries encounter are like personified representations of the spirits that live inside their head or what they are. But, but part of the experience seems to be, um, what would you call it? It's like a rescue and the dying father from the, from the depths.

Speaker 1:          01:10:19       I'm. Many of you seen Pinocchio, right? So, you know, the fundamental theme there right now, don't use a marionette so anyone can manipulate him and he's wouldn't head. He's not awake, he's not conscious. He's not alive. And so he can be led astray in 15 different ways and you know, finally his father disappears to go looking for them and for, for reasons that aren't exactly clear as father ends up being inside a whale that to bottom of the ocean, which is, you know, not the first place you think of looking for your father, but especially if you're a puppet and you. I like it. A cricket was leaving which was all observed stuff. Although one thing I could tell you is what's the cricket snake? Yeah. Yeah. What's the initials? Right. So fake, right? Yeah. Jimminy cricket is sending US Slang for Jesus Christ. And you know the animators pick that up as a joke, but it's not a joke because of course the cricket serves as the conscience and the spiritual guide on this, on this quest vision, and it's the cricket that leads the pocket deep underground.

Speaker 1:          01:11:17       You actually attended to the ocean to the deepest depths of despair, right in death, like a Chabad disintegration to find the spirit of his father. And why does he need that? Well, it's because without incorporating the spirit of his father or his forefathers can't be real. And that's because human beings at puppets apparently, you know, we're cultural creatures. It's not like there's you and there's your culture. It's like you are your culture and so you're either the embodiment of your culture fleshed out and made whole or you're just a fragmentary thing and you're only half alive and worse than that, you can cope with tragedy. I mean, the way that Pinocchio becomes real as he rescues his father from the whale, which is also a dragon, right? The whales that dragon. How do you know that? What happens to the whale? He spits fire. Yeah, that's weird behavior for a whale.

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       That's Pinocchio. Lights a fire inside of, but of course you know that's how human beings have always escaped from chaos is by using fire. So he's the master of fire and that brings them up from the depths and he has to rescue his father and it actually kills it, right? His father says, no, no, let me drown. Save yourself. Don't give. It doesn't. And he dies in the effort to bring them to shore. But then the, you know, the blue fairy comes down and says, well, because you're such a good puppet, now you're awake. You know, it's a, it's a, it's a remarkable story. It's an amazing movie. I mean, it's a, it has themes in it. There's thousands and thousands of years old, like the idea that the hero has to journey to the, to the darkest depths, to, to reclaim a treasure. The treasure can be lots of things.

Speaker 1:          01:12:51       That can be the dead father. It can be a princess, it can be gold. It doesn't really matter. There's this idea that you know, the thing you want most is to be found where you least want to look just a lovely little. That's a. that's no chemical dictum by the way, that the sort of reanimated buddy. So anyway, that's the idea in the show conditions is that past death. There's this opening up into the ancestral landscape and that's the place where you can commune with while the ancestor gods or maybe the spirit of the ancestors themselves, which is something like God. You know, if you look at the Christian representations, for example, one of the elements of God is God the father. And so God the father is sort of like an amalgam of all the great fathers of the past. You know, because you might say, well, what makes person a person a great father? Well, careful, devoted attention would be part of it, right? That's a transpersonal thing. It's like if you're a great father and you are too, there's something about both of your actions as a great father that are the same. And you can think of that as the spirit of the great father and you know, that sort of shines through individuals. And so that's a way of communing with God through the ancestors and that's part of what these rituals are about.

Speaker 1:          01:14:05       I would like even now to stress the fact that the psychopathology of the romantic vocation is not profane, it not belong to ordinary symptomatology. It has an initiatory structure and signification in short, every produces a traditional mystical pattern. The total crisis of the future Sharma sometimes leading to complete disintegration of the personality and to madness can be evaluated not only as an initiatory death, but also as a symbolic return to the pre cosmo mechanic chaos to be a morphous and indescribable state that precedes any cosmogony. Well, that's a mouthful. So one of the things I mentioned about this, there's some suggestion on the part of the artists. This is a monster of origin point. That's like the beginning of time. It's a symbol of the infinity that stretches on the fourth and that emerges from that. And so part of the initiatory process is the dissolution of the personality.

Speaker 1:          01:15:06       The question is, well, what state of existence exists at the level where your personality dissolved because you're. You see the world through your personality and the world has given, formed through your personality and then when it starts to dissolve and disintegrate, say when you sink into depression, said you're sinking into a state that sort of before consciousness itself. So let me tell you something that William James said about this. So it's very difficult thing to get to, to communicate and we'll, we'll touch on it a bit more when we moved into constructivism. So part of the idea here is that you, that reality itself is extracted from the unknown and the unknowable and you know, you do that as individuals because there's all the parts of the world that you understand and then there's parts of the world that you don't understand. You can't even conceive of now.

Speaker 1:          01:15:56       And then you encounter them, especially when you fail. And then you interact with them. And by doing that you make them real and describable and experienceable. And so it's like there's this late possibility that surrounds existence that you can interact with and pull up into actuality and that sort of the. That's like the action of consciousness on reality. That's why, by the way, in the beginning of Genesis Genesis, it's the word of God that produces order from chaos. Right? And so that's the initiative. That's the initiation of a reality. And then later in Genesis, God makes human beings and he says, you're made both of you in the image of God. And the question is, well, what does that mean? Well, it might mean that God has two arms, two legs, but what it seems to mean more accurately is that whatever it is that makes you conscious has this divine quality and it's capable of extracting order continually from payoffs.

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       And by doing that, by being conscious actors in the world, you're bringing about the creation of reality. And that's a remarkable thing. And you know, there's, there's nothing, there's nothing mystical about that you know perfectly well that you can make tomorrow one thing or another, you know, and is that freewill? Well, who, who knows that question will never be solved, but it certainly seems phenomenal, logically like there's an option here for you and there's an option here for you and there's an option here for you. Those are all potential and you can just choose which one of those you want to head towards and make actual and that's consciousness. Doing that consciousness is something we don't have a clue vote and this is William James. William James is the father of a pragmatic philosophy, but also with modern psychology. He did a fair bit of experimentation with nitrous oxide, which is this sort of inert gas that, that the dentists use, for example, as an animal analgesic, but that also has quite profound hallucinatory and mystical experience inducing properties.

Speaker 1:          01:17:47       And so William James used to play with this. This is a poem he, he wrote, um, I'll read the description description first from William James and then the poem he said, pure experiences, the name which I give to the original flux of life before reflection has categorized it. Only newborn Babes and persons in semi coma from sleep, drugs, illnesses, or blows can have an experience pure in the literal sense of that which is not yet any definite what they'll ready to be. All sorts of what's full, both of oneness and of meanness, but in respects that don't appear changing throughout yet. So confusedly that it's phases, interpenetrate and no points either of distinction or of identity can be caught.

Speaker 2:          01:18:40       Sorry, I.

Speaker 1:          01:18:51       Yeah, well it's sort of an incoherent, but what William James is referring to is this idea that what the ground of reality as something like a potential from a potential full of many possible actualities from which single actualities can be drawn and that that's what consciousness is doing would it makes decisions and it's. It's a brilliant idea and I think you know, and I expect you to take this with a grain of salt because I know this part of what I'm telling you about what you may think this about. A lot of what I'm telling you is sort of out on the fringes, but the quantum mechanics believed that the most accurate way to portray the ground of reality is as something that striving to manifest itself. It's not there yet. It has to be interacted with something that's a conscious observer before it takes on tangible reality.

Speaker 1:          01:19:39       And so the ground of being seems to be something like, like a multidimensional potential from which many things can emerge. And I think I actually think that is what we see when we look at the future, you know, because what the hell is the future? What is it? You know, we certainly treated it as if it's real. The future is a place of potential wild, right? Well, what does that mean? Well, it means whatever it means is real enough so that you orient yourself by it and you take the future seriously. You believe your choice is bringing future a, future b and two being you don't really know the limits of that. You know, like if you really got your act together right down to the core, you know, you have no idea what sort of glorious future you might be able to bring into existence.

Speaker 1:          01:20:21       You know, it's, it's an an resolve question. If you diligently work with all of your effort, you know, to perfecting the things around you, you have no idea how far you might be able to go. You don't want it to. It's a real open question and I think that's part of what human beings have to bring against the sort of horrors of existence. It's like you have a lot of potential and if you made the right choices, if we're awake and careful, God only knows what you might be able to manage. So here's this poem. He sounds like a sixties hippy from Greenwich village, really written in like 1890. No verbiage can give it because the verbiage is either by which he means that whatever this potential is exists in a place before articulation, right? Once it's articulated, it's not potential, it's all of a sudden something actual.

Speaker 1:          01:21:08       That's actually why the ancient Jews didn't want to use the name of God. You weren't allowed to name God because as soon as you named God, he was no longer God. God was the unnameable. You know, in the and the, and the Muslims have the same sort of idea about Mohammed in many ways. It's like you don't, don't want to make out concrete representation because then you take the ideal, the ideal space, and you start to make it something that you can like our human construction. So you know, it's an idea of this quarter. It's merit. No verbiage can give it because the verbiage just other incoherent, coherent the same and it fades and it's infinite. It's infinite. Don't you see the difference? Don't you see the identity constantly? Opposites united the same me telling you to write a note to write extreme something other than that thing. Intoxication and other. This intoxication, every attempted betterment, every attempted other men. It is, it fades forever and forever as we move. Alright, let's start there. Obviously.
