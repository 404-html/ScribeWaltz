Speaker 1:          00:00:02       So we're going to continue with our discussion of clinical personality theories today, moving away from the psychoanalytic or depth. Psychoanalytic theorists are the depths psychologists. We're just start to talk about the phenomenologists, send the existentialists. And so I need to lay down a little bit of background first and I think we'll start with a discussion of phenomenology and existentialism. Now for the phenomenologists, this is a tricky concept to grasp. I think I'll actually start by telling you that something you've taught, something that Carl Jung wrote about in the last book he published, which was called Ms Dot Miriam Shin us, which means mysterious conjunction. Um, he sort of believed posited that there was some extensions of moral development past the higher levels of moral development that piaget identified. Um, and there were three of them. And he said they could be symbolized by masculine, feminine to junctions or that they were in the literature that he had researched, which was mostly l chemical literature from the late Middle Ages.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       He said that one of the goals of moral development or of psychotherapy with the producer union, between the emotions and the motivations and rationality. And you can see that that's actually been a theme for all of the theorists that we've talked about so far, made partly what psychotherapy or personality development seems to be about is the continual integration of the personality so that the person's psyche isn't at odds with itself and it can move forward with a minimum of conflict at something related to the Piagetian idea of an elevated state. So if you're in an equivalent rate state, you don't have the sense that there are parts of you warring against other parts because you've been able to weave everything together into a coherent identity that covers the past and the present and the future. So the first stage in use vision of what constituted higher development was the union of the of rationality with emotion and motivation.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       And he saw that that was symbolized in the literature that he had reviewed by masculine spirit, feminine emotions and and motivation bank together in one thing. So that then would be the united mind and spirit in a sense. And then the next stage which was symbolized again by the masculine, feminine symbolism. It was the union united mind spirit. With the body and so what that would mean is that once you got your act together, so to speak, you would implement it in your behavior so that there was no contradictions between who you were in terms of how you thought, how you felt and what you wanted and what you were actually doing. Modern philosophers that describe what they call a performative contradiction, which they've formally described as it another type of of light, essentially another type of deceit which is that you say one thing and do another and it and and it's interesting because it's not.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       It's not a logical. It's not a form of logical deceit in a sense because your conceptualizations are abstract and your behavior is concrete, but there can still be a contradiction between the two, especially when you start to understand that most of what your psyche is representing our Schema for action rather than for representation. So the point is is that once your emotions and your motivations are working alongside your rational mind, really that your rational mind is property nested within them because that's. That's a much more accurate way of looking at it. Then the next thing you should do is act consistently in accordance with who you are. So that stage to both of those stages are pretty easy to understand, but the third stage is actually a phenomenal logical stage. You have to think phenomenologically to understand it. So here's, here's one way of thinking about it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       So imagine that you go home and let's say you set up a room and uh, in that room, it's not a very nice room. You know, maybe you've got some posters on the wall and they're sort of hanging a little cockeyed and you know, there's dust bunnies are making underneath the bad. Then you have piles of paperwork that you haven't done and you know, homework and you know, maybe there's the odd cresta brand or so forth lying about when you walk in there, it's you in the room. That's one way of thinking about. But another way of thinking about it is that when you walk in there, you are in the room just like you're the room when you're here because the room makes up a part of what you're experiencing. And the phenomenologists would say in a sense that the best way to conceptualize the self in its totality is what you experience, like everything that you experienced as you.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       And so what that would mean is that there's no difference between putting the posters up on your wall properly and cleaning underneath the bed and maybe making it and finishing your homework and putting the room in so that you feel confident and calm there and maybe even enjoy being there or maybe even so that it's beautiful there. There's no difference between that and fixing up your own personality. So then you could say, here's another way of looking at it, and I do this. I believe that this is a very profound way of looking at things. So then imagine that you could extend that you, but it's kind of easy to understand when you think about it as your own room because you're in there quite a lot. And so maybe let's say you're in your room 10 percent of the day. So we could say that the experiences that characterize your room are 10 percent of you, at least for the time being.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       And that you can have a low quality experience in their high quality experience in there. Um, no, don't say that you start generalizing that to the whole house and also then you can start thinking, well, are their problematic places in the house or they're problematic relationships among the people in the house and those problematic relationships are also you. And you can tell when there's a problem because you encounter undesired negative emotion in, in relationship to some relationship or in some physical locale within the house. And maybe you could fix that, you know, little incremental bit by incremental Beck you could work on that. You could note that the negative emotion that you don't want to have a rise signifies something. It signifies that that situation in some sense non optimal. And then you could work on strategies to optimize that and you don't do that until you stop making the presupposition that there's you.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       And then there's the house. It's like, well, the distinction between you and where you are is a very unclear distinction. So then let's say you're walking down the street or you're going into a store and maybe your managers aren't as good as they could be because you know, to be really socially sophisticated is a real art. You can learn, it can take you decades to learn how to do that properly. And people who are really, really socially skilled have a much, much higher quality existence because no matter where they go, they immediately established a relationship with the people that they're talking to. And then it's not an impersonal and, and Dan doore aggravating interaction. So, you know, maybe they'll walk into a store and the first thing they do if someone comes up with, helps them as they look at the person and you know, ask them how they're doing and how their day has been.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       And they make a little relationship and you know, the person is kind of happy about that because it sort of pops them out of their persona role. And then it can have a little discussion about what they're doing in the store and what they want. And then all of a sudden it's a high quality experience. And that person, everywhere they go, if they're skilled blight, that so they're awake and they're attentive and they're listening, everywhere they go, they can have a high quality interaction. You know when people who learn how to do that, learn to do it partly by noticing when they're in an interaction with someone or somewhere that if it isn't going in an optimal manner or if it's producing undesired negative emotion, then there's something wrong with the way that they're being in that situation and they pay attention to that and see if they could figure out how to modify it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:20       A lot of it is attention and listening, which is there are key components to say that Rogerian psychotherapist, 10 attention and listening so you might say, well, so so you can go into your room and you can identify little problems that are in your room that you could fix, that maybe you would fix. And so then you can start fixing them and that improves the quality of that particular environment. And then you could start to generalize beyond, you know, the locales that are more specifically under your control. Because if you're walking down flora, for example, and you go into a store and you talk to a clerk, well the probability is pretty high that the clerk is at least reasonably functional, so you shouldn't be able to get beyond their barriers in a sense and have a genuine interaction with them without too much difficulty, but then maybe you're wandering down bluer and you run across someone who's schizophrenia and maybe alcoholic at the same time and while that's a part of your experience, that might supersede your ability to transform.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       Right? The phenomenologists. People like Rogers aren't making the claim that you should be able to solve every problem that you've come across or even that you should try because there'll be things that you experienced that are so complex and problematic that you might make the Morris. If you fiddle around with them. You know you gotta. Be Very careful not to extend yourself dramatically beyond your skill level, but you can certainly start in isolated locales and if you stopped presuming a priority that there's some radical distinction between you and the environment that you happen to be in because it's all your experience. If you start making that subject object distinction, which is one of the things that phenomenologists really objected to because they concentrated on being in such, which was sort of lived experience as the ground of reality rather than the objective world is the ground of reality.

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       If you, if you, if you allow yourself to step outside that dichotomy and you start to understand that wherever you go and including the places that you're in a lot that there's no distinction between fixing up those places. When you notice that there's something wrong with them and you could fix them up and fixing yourself up, it's, it opens up a whole new avenue to getting your life together because you know people always think they have to work themselves. It's like it's not. This is one of the things that the psychoanalysts I think didn't get quite right. Although young touchstone, it is later words, there's not all of you, isn't inside your head for the psychoanalysts, a lot of what the work that you're doing on yourself, on your own, on the relationship, say between your conscious and your unconscious mind, but tremendous amount of that was sort of inside your skull, so to speak, but the phenomenologists, the phenomenal logical approach enables you to start reconceptualizing the psyche if as something that extends beyond you and always will and so that you can work on it's reconstruction at any level of analysis where your own nervous system is signaling to you that there's a problem.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       The way it does that is well, it's a variety of ways, but to have the most reliable ways. Our negative emotion. There's a new paper, for example that shows that conscientiousness is quite tightly associated with proneness to guilt, so that's the negative emotion that seems to go with conscientiousness. So guilt and anxiety and shame and no sorts of emotions which are unpleasant also simultaneously signal the presence of a problem and so you and and and what resentment. That's another good one. So you can, instead of having those emotions as entities, he'd say, well, I just want that to go away. You can think, okay, there's my, my, my being I embody being is signaling to me that something is not optimal here. And then it's not an enemy. It's, it's because it's, it's something that's trying to improve, say the quality of your present experience on your future experience and if you don't push that aside, you're pretending it's not happening or assumed instantaneously that it's the fault of the environment or the person that you're talking to.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       Then that can be incredibly instructive. Negative emotion is incredibly instructive, but you have to adjust your attitude so that you understand that it's signaling to you the presence of corrective information. If you could just figure out what that information is and that can come from anyone, a person or a place or a thing or, or, or yourself or you don't need to make the distinctions, you know. And so if you're having an argument with your partner and it's not going very well, I mean it. There's a tremendous tendency among people to try to win an argument with their partner, but you can't win an argument with your partner because then you win and they lose and then you have a loser on your hands and if you do that 100 times, maybe you're better at arguments than they are, for example, or you know, or maybe they think more in an intuitive way so they can't dance on their feet quite as fast as you.

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       Or maybe the situation is reversed. If you in the bloody argument 100 times, you're not a winner. You just someone who's beat up your partner 100 times. What you want to find out is what the hell is it that they're talking about, and sometimes that takes a tremendous amount of patients. They should be doing the same thing to you because very frequently the things that people are arguing about are only the tiny. It's like the snow on the surface of of a glazier. The real argument is deep, deep, deep underneath, and unless you listen intently and for a long period of time, you'll never figure out what it is you're arguing about and then if you win, the person won't be able to talk about it and that problem will be there for the rest of your relationship and maybe for the rest of your life unless you solve the problem, it's not going to go away.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       Now, I'm going to start talking about Roger specifically by by going over some of the things that he had to say about listening because I think I've learned more about listening from Rogers than for many other personality theorists or or psychotherapists that I've encountered. Now we could go back to the fundamentals of psychotherapy. Mean really what you're doing in psychotherapy is trying to help the person become a better person and that's not exactly a scientific formulation, better person. No, and it's a tricky thing to get at because people can be bitter persons in lots of different ways. Nearly the fact that your people theory in their temperaments indicates that you know your way of being a better person and your way of being a better person wouldn't necessarily be the same way. You know, because you. It's like maybe someone's grade on the violin and another person is great on the piano.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       The grades the same but. But the instrument is different and I think and that's a good way of looking at it. And so part of what you do in psychotherapy, and I think you do this in any genuine relationship, is not only is the dialogue about how to become a better person. That continuing dialogue is also always about just exactly what constitutes a better person. So you're talking about the goal and the process at the same time and what you're doing is working it out so that the people go into the conversation with the specific orientation and the orientation is generally with client and therapist is the client comes with it with a problem. Their life isn't acceptable in its current form and they come with one more thing which is the desire to make it better. And. And something that you should all know because this will stop you from tangling yourself up in your life to a tremendous degree.

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       You cannot help someone who hasn't decided that they want things to be better unless they make the decision that they want to make things better. Forget it. You're wasting your time and all it will do is hurt you. And I should also tell you that that was one of Roger's necessary preconditions for psychotherapy and other one was honesty and communication, but the person who was coming in for the therapeutic process had to be there. And it's a weird thing and I don't know how to account for it, but I don't think that you could talk to someone who doesn't want to have things be better into warranty, that they have to come to that decision on their own. So they come in with having made that. So it's, for example, it's very, very difficult. Maybe it's impossible to do psychotherapy with someone who's been remanded by the court, you know, because they're, they're in voluntarily and they'll just put a wall, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:18:18       Not always, but a lot of the time they'll just put up a wall and just wait it out, you know, you're not going to get in there with a screwdriver and pry off that Shell so the person has to step forward in a sense and say, well, you know, there's something not right about the way things are going for me and it could be better and I and someone else might be able to help me figure that out. So. And that's a really good attitude to have. By the way, when you're listening to someone because disagree with them or not or agree with them or not, there's always the possibility that they will tell you something you don't know. And like lots of times when people are talking, what they're trying to do is to impose their viewpoint on another person. In your conversations like this all the time, their arguments really.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       And they're often ideological arguments. It's like you're right and I'm wrong, or sorry, that never happens when I braid in, you're wrong and I'm just going to hack it you until you shut up or you agree. Really, you'll never agree because you just don't get someone to agree that way. It's, it's not possible, but you might be able to allow them into silence or anger and but that's a dominance hierarchy thing. That's not a real conversation. It's just all you're doing is establishing that you're, you know, a lobster with bigger claws than than the person that you're trying to pick out. A therapeutic conversation which is a genuine conversation is one in which both the people in the conversation are oriented towards a higher state of being well. They're conversing and you can tell when you're in a conversation like that because it's very, very engaging.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       In fact, if the conversation isn't engaging, then that's a sign that you're not having a conversation and that's really useful thing to know too because here's another thing I can tell you that if you take to heart will save you an awful lot of grief and misery. If you're talking to someone and they're not listening, shut up. Just stop. It's like you can tell if they're not listening and if they're not listening, quit saying words. It'll take. You'll just feel like a fool anyways because you're, it's like you're throwing ping pong balls against the brick wall, you know, you're not getting anywhere. If they're not listening, that's a sign that the system, the situation isn't set up to allow you to progress on the path that you're choosing. And so then you have to stop and you think, okay, well, what's going on here? Why is the person who's listening, you know, am I being too forceful and my, do they not understand what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          00:20:45       Is it too much about me? Um, do they want to talk? What's going on? Maybe they don't want to be here. There's all sorts of possibilities, but that's when you have to wake up past what it is that you're trying to impose on the situation and explore and see what's there. And that's way more interesting than trying to impose your viewpoint. The other thing is that if you're talking to someone, you know, I like to talk to people whose political beliefs are very different from mine because I can really understand how someone's political beliefs can be really different than mine. You know, because I got kind of a coherent representation of my beliefs, but it's very interesting to talk to people who have radically different because they'll tell you things that you haven't considered. It doesn't mean you have to agree with them, but it's.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       It's much more informative to walk away from a conversation having learned something that you didn't know then it is having won the stupid argument which you can't win anyways, and that's especially the case when you're dealing with people who are close to you, that you, that you will have around for the rest of your life. You cannot win an argument with them because all that will happen is if you win, they'll get you back. Sooner or later they will listen to you. The next time you have something to talk about or or they'll get resentful and then they won't be helpful. Or if you just can't win an argument with someone that you will have repeated contact with. What you can do, however, is you can have a conversation that's a real conversation and maybe you can come to terms about the thing that you're discussing and that's negotiation, you know, it's like, well, what do you want?

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       But you have to really want to know. It's like you're having an argument, okay, what is it that I would have to do because we're having this argument, what would I have to do in order to satisfy, you know? And then at a personal thing, there's not going, you can do to satisfy me because you know, I'm so bad at you. It's like, that's not helpful. The other person has to think, okay, what are the conditions for my satisfaction? You know, so maybe you know, your partner says you're not paying enough attention to me. It's like, all right, what do you want? Exactly. You know, you want to talk for 15 minutes at breakfast or do you want to talk for 20 minutes at lunch or do you want to spend an hour at night watching tv or, or like, do you want me to act differently when they come home? And I'm at the door, it's like you're feeling unattended to what do you want? Well then they'll say, well, if you love me, you should be able to figure that out.

Speaker 2:          00:23:19       That's

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       wrong because you're stupid. You won't be able to figure that out because you know, what the hell do you know? So the other person, unless they want to corner you into just being the kind of loser who can figure things out, which is why are they with you? Then you know, they need that to think about that. It's like, oh, what is it that I want from this person? What would constitute more attention? Right? And that's making that argument much more high resolution. And then it gives the other person a chance to actually respond. And then you have to allow your partner to be a moron because of course they are. So once you've killed them, what you want, you have to let them do it badly, like 10 times because they're never going to do it right the first time. So sometimes when I'm, I've seen, I've helped people sometimes with marital problems and one of the things I often recommend is that they, they go on a date, you know, they take each other away from the home where the kids are usually, or maybe not, maybe they don't have kids, it doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          00:24:23       And they do something that's just focused on each other, you know? And of course, first of all they tell me they don't want to do that. It's stupid. It's like, it isn't by the way, it's not stupid. It's like through, Oh, you don't want to go out and have an enjoyable time with your partner. Do you think your relationship's gonna survive when all you do is snipe at each other and do horrible things together. It's like, well no, that's not gonna work. So then they'll finally say, okay, well go on a date, we'll both look disgusted by the whole idea. And then they go and it's like, it's just miserable, right? Like one person says something to the other that immediately sets them off when they're out in the date because they're kind of mad about going anyways. And then they come back and go, well that just didn't work and we're never going to do it again.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       It's like, no, you're so, you're telling me you're never going to go out and do something enjoyable with your partner again because it didn't work very well. It's like people don't think about it, you know, it's like. So maybe when you take your partner out and you haven't been getting along, it takes you like 10 times before you have a relatively okay time, but 10 times if you're going to go out with them, let's say, well let's say you go out with them every two weeks is 25 times and let's say you're going to be with them for 30 years. If you manage to, you know, get your act together. So that's 30 times 25, that's 750 times. So if you practice 10 times then you might be able to have 740 good times out together. You know? And that's an underestimate. So 10 times of practicing is hardly a problem for, for that kind of return.

Speaker 1:          00:26:01       So this is all part of this Rogerian. Like following this path is all part of this Rogerian process of listening and listening is trying to figure out what the hell the other person is telling you and understanding at the same time that they don't know. Like, especially if they're upset, they're not even sure what they're upset about and they don't know what they want, you know, because you can, you can corner them by saying, well you want to be attended to more, what do you want? And they'll try some weird defense like, like I told you already, like if you love me, you already know which is a cliche and it's a foolish cliched. So you can't let that stop you. I should, I should tell you the sorts of barriers that people will put up if you listen to them too. So. So for example, let me, let me see if I can think about it for a bit.

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       Yeah. Well usually what happens is if you're, if you're pushing someone say this is in listening sort of way, it's like, what do you want? Why do you want that? What would be the conditions of your satisfaction? You're pushing them fairly hard to clearly articulate their concerns and sometimes they're afraid to do that and if you're trying to hash out initial, people usually have like five routines they can go through. One is they block you with some cliche or they say something annoying and then maybe they've got one other verbal trick after that and then once you push through that, then they cry or they get angry and if if you still don't stop them, they stomp off and so if you're going to have a successful conversation about something difficult, you need a routine for each of those. It's like just because the person's angry doesn't mean the conversation is over and just because the person price doesn't necessarily mean that you're a sadist.

Speaker 1:          00:27:52       It's often a law. Often tears are a trip. They mask anger, so and what the person is doing in part is they're using their emotions as it exploratory technique to find out how important is this? What happens if I just break down? Will the person shut up and if the person shuts up, they think, oh, that's not that important. Right? Because they been able to use a technique. I'm not saying this as conscious, it's it's, it's deeper than conscious, it's just how people rub up against each other when they're trying to figure out how things are structured and so if you quit when they get upset, then they think, oh, well this thing isn't so important that it's worth this much upset, but if you continue to, well then they'll run away. Well, one of the things you have to do if you're in any kind of relationship did you got to make a rule, which is you can leave, but you got to come back, but we're not done with this. You can't run off because it's not. It's, it's, it's, it's breaking the contract of the conversation. You go to stay and hash it out. So now, okay, now I'm going to read you some of the things that Rogers

Speaker 2:          00:28:59       talked about.

Speaker 1:          00:29:04       All right, so one of the things he talked about is this

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       idea called

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       unconditional positive regard. Now I don't think that's a very good phrase because unconditional positive regard is one of those things that can be turned into a new age, cliche two seconds. It's like, well, no matter what you do will love. You know, there are lots of things you could do that, that, that, that is just, that's just not gonna Garner a lot of love, so unconditional regard that it's not like there's not an idea behind that because there really is an idea behind that. But like, like, like I said, it's not all new agey. After Roger's formulated it and it sounds like, well all you have to do is be consistently positive towards the person and you know, they'll flourish. It's like, first of all, you're going to have unconditional positive regard for Hitler. It's like, no, and not only that, you have a responsibility not to have unconditional positive regard for yourself or for other people because what you're trying to do is to make things better.

Speaker 1:          00:30:16       And so that means that the things that make things worse or bad, right? If there's better, there's going to be worse. And if you're in favor of better than you have to be not in favor of worse. So I'm going to untangle unconditional positive regard of it. And like I said, I think Roger used to, his word choice wasn't very good. Here's, here's a different way of thinking about it. So if you're in a relationship with someone, and this could even be a very short relationship, it could be this sort of relationship that you have when you go to talk to someone in a store. Like I said, if you get sophisticated about it, but let's assume it's a longer term relationship, you have to decide what if, if you're going to have that person's best interest in mind when you have the conversation, you got to have that as sort of the top value in your value heart.

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       But the reason we're talking is because I want things to be better, not better for me, you know, maybe better for me too, but, but the better for me is a subordinate part of the better. The reason we're communicating is because we both want things to be better. And then we both aren't absolutely sure what it would mean for things to be better. We've got to exchange information until we figured that out and neither of us are sure about how we're going to get there and so we have to exchange information until we figured out how to get there. And that's, that's the initial axiomatic precondition for a true conversation and that's unconditional positive regard. It's like I, I regard the person I'm talking with as someone who could transform in a positive direction and who's willing to attempt that and who will communicate to that end even though they might screw up and you know, there's going to be things in the way and the sorts of things that the psychoanalysts talk about as resistance and then they're going to regard me the same way and you know, I'm also going to make mistakes along the way.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       So

Speaker 1:          00:32:11       now Roger has pointed out that in order to, to communicate with someone in that manner, you had to be willing to put yourself in their shoes essentially. And he said there you had to comprehend the alternative phenomenal field. So, which is okay. Well, I'm, I'm here, this is my viewpoint coming out from this place and now you have a viewpoint and they're similar enough so that we can communicate about them, but they're different enough so that they're not equivalent and the differences are actually meaningful. So now I got a sort of pop myself out of my framework, put myself in years and figure out where you're coming from and that's the goal of the conversation. So sometimes that can even help you figure out where you're coming from, you know, because you can say, well, it sounds, it looks to me like you're really angry, and the person will say, well no, I'm just, I'm just A.

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       I'm sad. It's like, well, they're all ready. They look like they're going to bite you and say, no, no. It really looks like. I think you might feel also a little bit angry and there'll be angry about you saying that of course, but it led to may also be that their emotions are so jumbled together in this sort of chaotic jumble that they don't actually know what it is that they're experiencing because it's this terrible on articulated chaotic bodily state that is signaling something, but that hasn't been articulated and so they're kind of a mess and you're careful observation, as long as they trust you and they should trust you. If they know that you have their best interests, whatever that is in mind, or at least that you're trying, that then they can trust you and then you can help them clarify what it is that they're feeling. You know what sort of coming up from the body and what that's associated with and what they'd like to do with it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       Roger says, real communication occurs and the evaluative tendency avoided when we listened with understanding. Now the evaluative tendency he's talking about is, well, let. Let's simplify this a little bit. Let's say I'm radically left waiting and I'm talking to someone who's radically right way and we start talking about something like a, um, income distribution and the right wing person says, well, let's say the left wing person says, well, there's all these people at the bottom and they don't have a lot of money and a lot of the reason that they're there is because, you know, they, they've encountered very, very harsh circumstances or maybe they have an illness or something like that. And uh, you know, there's a real distribution of intelligence and so lots of times people are at the bottom because they just don't have the cognitive resources to climb. And the right winger goes rubbish, rubbish.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       The reason that they're at the bottom is because, you know, they don't work hard enough and they don't take any care with, with their longterm thinking. And so the last one year says, well, that's just prejudice. And the rate when you're says, well, you're just a bleeding heart liberal, and poof, that's the end of the conversation. And that's the evaluative tendency. It's like you just come away the same as you were when you entered the conversation. There's be no exchange of information whatsoever. All there's been is a hardening of prejudice and you can walk away feeling morally superior because you know you demonstrated what a scum rat your opponent is and how morally upright you are. Well, that's the value of a dependency. That's not a conversation. That's gonna lead to progress. If anything, it's going to lead to increased feelings of prideful arrogance on your part because you know everything and on their part too and like increased polarization.

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       It's not a helpful way of communicating, you know, in this sort of thing as we'll see when we moved into the more social and political consequences of a failure to communicate. It's like that's a microcosm of what goes wrong in society when it really starts to fall apart. You know, when the individuals within the society who have different viewpoints can no longer communicate the whole society shapes and trembles. And you can think about this from a democratic perspective too because you might say, well, what's the purpose of elections? Well, people who are aligned with a particular ideology think, well, we need to win the election because our viewpoint is right, but then you might ask yourself, well, why are there these other viewpoints and why do things go so bad when one viewpoint dominate so heavily that everyone who had the other viewpoint, you know, gets shot.

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       That seems like a bad thing. So what exactly is going on in a democratic state and what's going on is that there is all these different viewpoints and a lot of them are temperamentally informed. So we know, for example, that liberals are higher in openness and lowering conscientiousness than conservatives, and so the conservatives are conscientious, but they're not very creative and open, so they're good at running things. They're really good at running. You're good at being managers and administrators for example, but they're not very good at being innovative. The liberals are good at being innovative because they're open, but they're not very conscientious, so like and that they have to be less conscientious in some ways if they're going to be creative because conscientiousness can constrain creativity and so for the society to work properly, the people with the liberal temperament, the conservative temperament has to interact with each other because the Liberals State Cup, all the new companies and the conservatives run them so and then in the political state per se.

Speaker 1:          00:37:43       It's like conscientiousness is a virtue. Although with if it's exaggerated too much, especially the orderly part, then it can become tyranny and openness is a virtue to but you don't want every bloody thing changing every second. So there's got to be some constant negotiated peace between order and innovation. And the way that that happens is that the two sides communicate. It isn't that one side wins and the other side wins. It's the dialogue stays open so that the viewpoints can be represented properly and so that as the environment moves to sometimes maybe the environment is such that being conscientious is going to be better and sometimes it's going to be environment is moved so that openness is going to be better because the environment moves, the conversation has to track those movements so the society stays healthy across time and then the same thing applies in any kind of longterm relationship.

Speaker 1:          00:38:39       It's like you marry someone, now you've got two brains and they don't work the same. It's like you want to have two braids or do you want to have one? That's the first question you're going to do a lot better with too. So and then so how do you optimize the functioning of the two braids? While obviously they've caught a communicate, you know there's going to be freedom of expression and there has to be listening. So that's the evaluative tendency, which is you're wrong. Before I even know what you're talking about, at least I should know what the hell you're talking about before it decided if you're wrong. And so back to the poverty issue. It's like, well, what predicts poverty? Well, the sorts of things that the left way your talks about that predicts problem poverty, so to the sorts of things that the right way here talks about.

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       So if you're really unconscientious and that makes you kind of makes you the sort of person that will rely on others to do the work. If you're unconscientious you're much more likely to be poor. And so that's a real social policy problem too because you have this horrible problem where you have to sort out what's causing the poverty, you know, and who's taking advantage of the attempts to alleviate it as well as figuring out. So, so that's more of an individual temperament problem, which is what the conservatives they're concerned about. And then you also have to figure out how to address it on a social level, which of course the conservatives don't like to think about, but it's not like either side has nothing to say. There's information in both. Those perspectives is problematic though because when you put them together, the phenomenon becomes paradoxical and then it's very difficult to come up with a solution.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       It challenges your cognitive resources and what the conservative and the liberal want to do is just simplify it down to one explanation. It's sociological. That's the liberal, it's temperamental. That's the conservative, and so then they have one answer to how it can be fixed. We should fix society. That's the liberal. Those people should just get their act together. That's the conservative. It's like, yeah, well fair enough. Except probably the problem is complicated to now, so there's more than one solution necessary since it's not even ad problem. Right. Poverty is not our problem. Poverty is like 10,000 problems and some of them aren't even associated with each other. You know, like there's the poverty that's a consequence of alcoholism. That's not the same poverty. That's a consequence of say very low intelligence and that's a completely different poverty than the non conscientious poverty or the abuse poverty or.

Speaker 1:          00:41:09       And there's no reason to assume whatsoever that those should be amenable to the same solutions. Real communication occurs and the evaluative tendency avoided when we listen with understanding. Understanding. That's an interesting word because you might ask yourself, well, what do you mean when you understand and it's got this sort of physical aspect to it, right? That's the stand and then there's the underpart which sort of implies that to understand something is to be under it and standing and so partly what happens is if, if I can listen to you with understanding what that means is that I get a clear enough picture of what you want so that I could change the way that I am, that I am. Maybe the way I look at things like the perceptual scheme through which I view the world, but also my actions and if I can extract it from you, then I understand I would be able to take what you told me and change myself if I felt that was appropriate or maybe it would just happen automatically because now I have the deep understanding of you.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       People are afraid of that, right? Because of say you've got yourself all hemmed in with some ideology and you're feeling pretty secure about that, and then you listen to some dim who's got completely the opposite perspective from you and you listen hard and all of a sudden you've got cracks in your system, you know, and then you have to think, oh, maybe things are more complicated than I thought they were. Everything isn't all tied together in this neat little package that can be unsettling. It's unsettling fact. If you're listening to someone and you're really listening and you're not being unsettled, the probability is pretty high either that you're not listening or that you're not talking about anything of real consequence because if it's important and you're listening, it's gonna Shift. You know? So there's this, it's going to set you into that at least a little bit into that state of chaos and what you're doing then just so you know, is that instead of identifying with who you were, which is the person that you were at before, the conversation you're identifying with the person you could be as you move through the conversation and that's a way better thing to identify with, you, know you to identify with your beliefs.

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       This is a phd and idea, or you've been identified with your beliefs or you going to identify with the process that allows you to generate beliefs and often those things are in contradiction because if you identify with the process that allows you to change your beliefs, then you're. You're, you're assaulting your beliefs even though you might be correcting them, but it's, it's, it's demanding to do that because you're reconfiguring your physiology and there's an intermediary period of uncertainty that goes along with that. What if they're right? Well, that month, so like, yeah, well then what we'll communication occurs in the evaluative tenancy avoidance. When we listened with understanding, what does this mean? It means to see the expressed idea and attitude from the other person's point of view to sense how it feels to him to achieve his frame of reference in regard to the thing he is talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:44:17       So there's also rogers is very emphasized is very much the idea of embodiment. So you can listen to someone, you can listen to their arguments with your mind. It's a very logical process. It's of a rational and logical process and in some sense that's what you're taught to do. For example, when you debate and the idea there is that you know, the argument is it's a cognitive phenomenon and that the, the logic is structured in a logical way and that the way that the argument is settled by is by the exchange of information and the relative coherence of the two perspective. It's a very rationalistic perspective and it's very useful to be able to debate, don't get me wrong and, and have your mind organized so that you could put forward a logical arguments like that's why you're in university. So to learn how to do that, believe it or not, and but it's not the same sort of thing that rogers is after because when Rogers talks about the interactions between people, it's embodied.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       So like if I'm really watching you when I'm talking to you, paying attention to your face, you're going to be like expressing emotions with your face screen because that's what it does, right? Your face expresses emotion so that other people can infer what it is that you're up to even more than you know. Because if you knew that you could just tell them you wouldn't even need emotions, but what the hell do you know about what you want? That's why you're having a conversation with someone to figure it out. So you're watching them like mad and you're watching their posture and maybe you're mirroring them and you can do that consciously to some degree, but it's probably better if you just do it unconsciously. And then when you're mirroring them with your body, then you can feel what they're feeling and then you can start to draw inferences about what it is that they want.

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       By noticing how you're feeling, this is often one of the things that will stop people dead in the source of a conversation because the other person will get upset and then you'll watch that and then that'll make you feel upset, and then you go, oh, I can't deal with this anymore because it's too upsetting. It's like, well, maybe the fact that it's upsetting is actually an indication that you really should deal with it. You know you can't just run away if it's upsetting, upsetting. Something's being flipped over. That's why it's upsetting when you don't want to fail out just because you're upset. It's like you no clue in. That's not the time to quit. We want to maybe detach a bit from your emotion so you don't get drowned in them, so you can use them in an informative manner, but you don't want to stop.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       That's. You've got things going then stayed in so briefly. This may sound absurdly simple. Well, I didn't state it so briefly, but it's not. It's an approach which we have found extremely potent in the field of psychotherapy. It is the most effective agent we know for altering the basic personality structure of an individual and improving his relationships and his communications with others. If I can listen to what he can tell me, if I can understand that, how it seems to him, if I can see it's personal meaning for him, if I can sense the emotional flavor which it has for him, then I will be releasing potent forces of change in him. Well, so you can imagine like your brain is always trying to figure things out. Well, let's extend that a bit. It's not just your brain, it's your cycle physiology. It's your whole body is trying to figure things out.

Speaker 1:          00:47:38       Right? And you can't just think about it as a logical and mental process, like your emotions are there. Evaluative processes. They're trying to give you information, but they're not very articulate. You know, it's like you come home and you're all angry and you're touching. Your partner says something that's, you know, pretty mundane and you know, you just explode. It's like, well, they say to you, why are you like that? And they say, well, I hate it when your boots are in the way of the door. It's like, oh, that's why you're having to fit. Is it because the Buddhists are. Well, they're always there. It's like you can be sure that there's a big mess underneath that and it's going to be hard to approach that person because angry people are also kind of, you know, they're kind of, well, they're irritable for sure, but they also have this kind of shadow on them that is touching.

Speaker 1:          00:48:24       They're touchy. So you touched them, you know, they'll get irritated at you. And so if you mirror that, if you're listening to them and watching them, then they can start to figure out that they're angry and that maybe there are two or more angry than the situation demands. And if you listen to them be angry for a while, which is very annoying, right? Because maybe there'll be angry at you. Then maybe they'll calm down and they'll start to differentiate that emotion into articulated statements. It's like, well, I had a really terrible day at work. Well what was so terrible about it? And it'll tell you a little story and then they'll say, well, that's happening all the time, and then you asked them about that and then they say, well, my boss is unreasonable in his demands. And so then you ask them about that and you find out that the person either has a pilot for a loss because sometimes that happens, right?

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       A real bully, which when, and then the answer to why they're mad about the shoes is because they should change jobs, right? Or maybe you'll find out that, well, they have no idea how to say no to their boss. They just say yes, no matter what he or she says, and that needs for too agreeable. And then maybe you have to figure out how they can learn how to say no and how they have to sort of check with their resentment to figure out when they're being taken advantage of. It's like, it's very, very complicated and it's no wonder people want to avoid it, but you know, that's another sort of truism. If someone's overreacting, well they're not reacting to that thing. They're reacting to that thing plus a whole bunch of things that are unrelated to that thing sorted and they don't know what it is and so then if you listen to them and they talk about it, they're actually thinking because what you might think when you're talking is that you think and then you say what you think and so you don't have to park.

Speaker 1:          00:50:06       You could just think, but that isn't right. Most people don't really think like they're not. They don't sit down and meditate and think logically through a whole sequence of problems. The thought sort of appear in their heads, you know, spontaneously sort of like a reverie, but they're not really. They're not. You know, they don't have that kind of command of the language. And so then when they're talking to you, they're actually thinking they're thinking out loud and for all we know, maybe thinking is more effective when you say it out loud because my. Maybe I'm wired up so that my brain assumes that if I'm willing to tell it to you to make the troubling that it's more true than those things I'd like to keep to myself. And so one of the things you're doing in a psychotherapeutic session is you're just letting the person talk

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       and you know, I've had clients, they don't want me to do anything for the hour that I'm with them except shut up and listen and maybe now and then I can just clarify something. I have one client in particular who's very isolated, socially isolated and this person has come to see me for a long time and they just want this person comes every two weeks and what they want to do is talk about the last two weeks and they won't be listened. And so I have. I have to be engaged, right? I'm listening. And, and that's a communicative process. This snake, right? Because your face is changing and you're nodding. You know, you're reacting so you're in the communication, but this person just wants to talk and then they sort themselves out. You know what? Figure out what it is they're upset about and then that's good and they can go off and operate in the world for two weeks. That's all just listening. Well, just listening. Listening is hard and people aren't taught how to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:54       If I can listen to what he can tell me, if I can understand how it seems to him, if I could sense it's personal, meaning that I will be releasing potent forces of change in him. If I can really understand how he hates his father, that that could be a conversation that go on for months or hates the university or hates communists. If I can catch the flavor of the sphere of insanity or a sphere of atom bombs or Russia, you could tell that this is a little old. It will be of the greatest help to him and altering those very hatreds and fears and in establishing realistic and harmonious relationships with the very people and situations towards which he has felt hatred and fear. So for example, let's say someone comes into a therapeutic session, they say, Geez, I just. I was just having a conversation by for my father.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       I just hate my father. Every time I talked to him, it just makes me angry. I'm like, that's all. That's a low resolution representations, right? It's like one pixel farther equals anger. It's not differentiated and that's a problem because their body's responding as if this person needs to be taken out. Like you might take out a prey object or something like that or destroy it because that's where danger is light, right? Anger sort of like you're an object to be destroyed and it's. There's truth in that because it wouldn't be elicited by the farther unless there was something necessity for the anger, but it's so generalized global, it's not helpful. It's like, okay, let's talk about your father. Well, how would you do that? Well, what did he do recently to upset you? And then you listen and you don't give the person advice about what they should have done because what the hell do you know about what they should have done?

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       You might have to listen for 50 hours before you could offer a helpful suggestion. Even then it probably won't work. So you listen and then they tell you some stories about, this is almost like the Friday and psychoanalytic approach. They tell you some stories about what their father was like when they're in their childhood and then a bunch of things that pop up in memory and you know, they start laying out the story, it's like their land cards out on a table and they just lay out all these cards. There's like a thousand cards and they're all representations of the father. And then they started to exhaust themselves. They're out of angry stories about their father. And then maybe they say, well, you know, there wasn't all bad. Then they started laying out some things about him that, you know, he drank all the time, but he was really.

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       He always took care of us and he wasn't, he wasn't an angry drunk, you know, and, and he stayed with my mother and you know, so what's happening now is the picture of the father's getting differentiated, right? It's not just one pixel, it's differentiated. And then you might say, well, okay, here's all these angry things. How many of them are still relevant? Like how many of those do you have to deal with and the person will say think, well these, you know, 80 percent of these anger things or dad there in the past and you know, 70 percent of these good things weren't good enough to make up for the rest of this mess, but then you get a smaller pile of specific things and then maybe you can start figuring out ways that or the person can start figuring out ways that those might be addressed moment to moment in new conversations like it's a strategic plan.

Speaker 1:          00:55:06       What's the situation? What exactly is going on here? Lay it out and the emotions are a great guide to that because the first thing you want to do is everything that makes you emotional. Those are the things that aren't dealt with yet. They're not fully articulated. You don't have a strategy. You don't have a full develop representational system. That's why it's still emotional, so it's like your, your body and your mind come up with emotional representations first and only as you worked through them, which means to talk about them essentially strategically. They don't even turn into words until you do that, and that's where I think Freud went wrong. It's those things aren't repressed. Although if they can be, they're not repressed. They just never made it all the way up to articulated representation and lots of things are like that. Whenever you're in a bad mood, it's like, I'm in a bad mood. What does that mean? Well, you don't know. Why don't you know, or you repressing it. No, you just too stupid to figure it out, and so then you're going to talk to someone you know I'm in a bad mood and you know, well, you know, how are you feeling now? They'll get all spiteful and tell you how they're feeling and then you know, they start to differentiate it. Maybe they'll remember something that happened at work and then you can kind of map out the mood starts to loosen it.

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       We know from our research that such empathic understanding, understanding with a person, knowing about him is such an effective approach that it can bring about major changes in personality. Some of you may be feeling that you listen well to people and that you have never seen such results. The chances are very great indeed that you're listening has not been of the type I have described. Fortunately, I can suggest a little laboratory experiment which you can try to test the quality of your understanding. Okay, so this is. This is lovely because you don't often actually get it. Tell me from a therapist that actually work, you know, you get sort of vague techniques like help the person lay the cards out on the table. You know, it's, it's kind of at a high level of abstraction, but this exercise you can actually do and you can do it a lot and if you do it and we'll teach you, listen.

Speaker 2:          00:57:21       So

Speaker 1:          00:57:23       the next time you get into an argument with your wife or your friends or with a small group of friends, start the discussion for a moment and for an experiment institute this rule, while you also don't have to be that formal about it, you can just do it. Once you know the the team, each person can speak up for himself only after he is first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker accurately and to that speaker satisfaction. Now, that's so cool because here's the typical argument, so we're arguing, I want to win, and so you're telling me a bunch of things, and so then I take those things that I turned them into the stupidest possible representation of those things. You know I wake in your argument and make you look like a fool and then destroy it and that's a strong. That's fine that you're making your opponent into a straw man Max.

Speaker 1:          00:58:14       The Straw man argument, right? You take, you take what they're telling you and your caricatured and that way you can make them look absurd and make them be ashamed. And then of course you've set up this skinny little opponent that you can just demolish with one punch. It's really crooked and it shows that you're a coward because what it means is you have to have an opponent that's crippled in and thin and starving and and inarticulate before you could possibly win, before you could possibly progress. It's a pathetic way of having an argument. What you should do is listen to the person and help them make their argument as strong as you possibly can and then deal with that because then you're sure that you're, you're taking them seriously.

Speaker 2:          00:58:56       So,

Speaker 1:          00:59:00       and to that speaker satisfaction. Well, that's so cool. Okay, so we're, we're having an argument. Well, I don't know. Maybe we'll have an argument about who's gonna be responsible for grocery shopping or for doing the dishes or for cooking or any of those domestic things that continually caused couples to be at each other's throat. It's like, so you'll have some arguments about you should do whatever it is that you're going to do and in order for the argument to progress, I have to tell you back what you said and you have to agree that I put it properly. Well, that's so annoying. Like it just runs so contrary to what you want to do because of course you want to make another person sounds stupid so you could meet them this way. You can't do that because you have to listen well enough so you actually understood what they said and then you have to formulate their argument so that they're willing to agree that that actually constitutes their argument.

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       Well, that's really, it's difficult, but it's so useful because first of all, it does mean that you understood them and second immediately indicates to them that you're not just trying to, when you're trying to listen and then they're much less likely to get all irritable and angry at you because at least you're trying to listen. You're not making them into a fool. And you know often when people are trying to tell you what they want because they're all afraid of telling you what they want because you know, maybe they never got what they wanted in their whole life. You know, if they've had a history of bad relationships with poor parenting and that sort of thing, you're just blooded terrified to tell you that they actually want something and so as soon as you indicate to them that you actually heard what they said and you're willing to take it seriously enough to formulate it properly, well then it's like one step towards trust.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       I see you didn't listen. You at least know where I'm coming from. It's like, that doesn't mean you agree. You know, just because you understand someone's argument doesn't mean you have to agree, but at least you know what the argument is. You see what this would mean. So one of the things, Roger's got us continually his therapy and I do this a lot. It's like I listen to the person and they kind of go through a narrative at spontaneous narrative, often following a chain of associations as pointed out, you'll come you spontaneous narrative and I'll say, okay, it sounds to me like this is what you said, and I'll try to lay out the argument and maybe now and then I'll, I'll ask for clarification if there's a part I didn't understand or if I see that there's a part that seems contradictory, you know, they said this thing here, this thing there, and I don't tell them that, you know, seems to me that you said this here and this here.

Speaker 1:          01:01:30       I'm not sure how to put those together. I don't say, well, that makes your argument, you know, incoherent. I say, well, I don't get how to understand that. And they go, oh yeah, there is. Because people will admit to that if you just pointed out flatly. No. It's like, I'm not involved. I'm just listening. It's not my problem. It's a problem. And that's another thing that's useful to the other person is entitled to their suffering. You don't get to take it away. It's their destiny so you can listen to their problems without having to think that you know you have to take them on as if they're yours. You have to mirror them like it's their problem. It's like they have to figure it out and they and that's good. You need a problem to figure out. It's not necessarily a terrible thing that they have a problem.

Speaker 1:          01:02:18       It would simply mean that before presenting your own point of view, it would be necessary for you to really achieve the other speakers frame of reference to understand his thoughts and feeling so well that you could summarize them for him. And that's useful too because you know the way we remember things is if you tell me a long story and I tell it back to you, I do not tell it back to you. What happens is I listened to it and I try to figure out what the thread of the argument is and then when I dial it back to you, it's way shorter and tighter and that means in some sense it's, it's got all the essentials, but it's got less of the baggage. Right? That's what you're kind of doing when you ask someone to get to the point, so they tell you this long story, it's like this tree that is full of dead branches and it hasn't been proved and they're extending their and you know, the maybe the living branches you can hardly even see, but you're concentrating on them and then when you tell it back to them, you just tell them the part of the story that's alive and they listened to that and they think, Oh yes, that's what I meant, and then that means you've changed the memory, right?

Speaker 1:          01:03:25       If they have, you've changed the memory, you've, you've divested of all the excess baggage, just like pruning and that's what you're doing. And so that a dialogue is mental hygiene and that's what people do. You know, you've got to wonder, well, why don't we talk? Well, it's to exchange information. Yeah, there's utility in it. You know, like if you know how to do something and I don't, you can tell me, but that, that isn't the sort of thing that people are doing most of the time. Most of the time they're telling their stories, this is what happened to me right in there, and then not a person will say, well, this is what happened to me, and there's this mutual attempt to organize. That's how people are organizing their brains. We organized our brains by talking, and so if you don't have someone to listen to you, well, especially if it's over a few decades, you're going to have a brain that's like a whole forest of trees that it needs.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       A forest fire doesn't need just some, you know, trim and it's really in trouble. So you need to have someone to listen to you and best way to hit someone like that is to find a bunch of people and listen to them because you know, of course then now that's a friendship. That's a real friendship, you know, because you're both trying to move towards a better place. Whatever that place is, and it's a great relationship. Then sounds simple, doesn't it? But if you try it, you'll discover it's one of the most difficult things you've ever tried to do. However, once you've been able to see the other person's point of view, your own comments will have to be drastically revised. Well, that's partly because now there are sort of vague complaints is tightened up to a specific problem. Then you have to reconfigure how you're responding to address that problem. You also find the emotion going on with the discussion, the differences being reduced and those differences which remain being on a rational and understandable sort.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       If you were really willing to understand a person in this way, if you're willing to answer their private world and see the like the way their life appears to them, you run the risk of being changed yourself, which is good. That's a good thing. If you're involved in a real conversation, the way that you will change will be beneficial to you, but it's. But it's, it's a challenging thing because it will mean that you can't stick to the little, you know, rigid framework that you had entering into the argument. You have to loosen that up and be willing to open the door and you know, change the walls of your house.

Speaker 1:          01:05:55       You might see it his way. That wouldn't be good. You might find yourself influenced or you're in your attitudes or personality. The risk of being changed is one of the most frightening prospects most of us can face. Well, imagine so when you're trying to build yourself into high fully fledged you. Well, here's one way of doing it. Just hang around with people like you who think the same way you do and then whenever you talk they just reflect back what you have to say. Or you can start putting yourself in situations that you're uncomfortable with, you know, pushing yourself a little bit and you go out where there are people that aren't like you and then you think, well, how am I going to get to understand these people? And the first thing you do is you got to pay attention and you got to listen and then maybe you'll be able to interact with them and then who.

Speaker 1:          01:06:39       That's another environment that you've mastered and then there's more of you because now you can operate here and here. And then maybe you think, well that was kind of fun. So now I'll go here and we'll try this, and you go there and you listened and you pay attention and all of a sudden bang, you can operate there and if you do that over like a 15 year period, you'll be someone who could go anywhere and not fit in exactly that. That's like you're invisible. It's not like you're fitting. Yes. It's like you can operate there, you can talk and listen. You can gather information, you can trade your useful there and then you're not gonna run up against people and you know, risk, unnecessary conflict. Because if you listen to people, you just cannot believe what people will tell you if you listen to them.

Speaker 1:          01:07:24       It is absolutely. And you can. If you can listen to people, they will tell you profound things so fast that it just makes your head spin. You know, because people are really weird creatures. They're like Dostoyevsky characters there. There are peculiar. They think in weird ways and they have weird experiences and bizarre dreams and ideas about the future political theories. They're just as crazy as you could possibly imagine. And if you listen to them, they'll tell you why they think these things and it's. It's not boring. That's another issue is if the conversation is boring, you are not listening because if you're listening, the conversation will change so that it won't be boring. So you can tell if you're in a conversation that's foreign, you're someone at least is not listening and it could easily be you. If I enter as fully as I enabled into the private world of the neurotic or psychotic individual, isn't there a risk that I might become lost in that world? Most of us are afraid to take that risk. The great majority of us cannot listen. We found ourselves, we find ourselves compelled to evaluate, and the evaluation is, I'm going to keep you away. I'm going to pigeonhole you, classify you. Make the classification negative. Describe you as irrelevant and push you aside because then I don't have to pay attention. I don't have to listen and I can stay in my box of certainty, my little narrow box of certainty.

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       The great majority of us cannot listen. We find ourselves to pell to evaluate because listening is too dangerous. The first requirement is courage and we do not always have it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:09       Okay. So Carl Rogers, he's a phenomenologist. So think it's your experience that's real. You need to represent that experience and you need to communicate it to other people and you have to communicate it within a frame. And the proper frame is we're trying to make things better here and you know, in order to adopt that frame, that's not just a simple statement, right? I mean you can tell yourself that, try to put yourself in that state of mind. But to do that you have to really think through your heart. You have to decide like, what are you up to? Are you here to make things worse or are you here to make things better? And you know, you might say, well clearly I'm here to make things better. It's like, yeah, sure, no, that's hard and people are full of resentment and fear and anger and they'd be hurt and all sorts of ways that they want to take revenge and like they're just full of contradictory impulses.

Speaker 1:          01:10:06       And so to weave all those contradictory impulses together to overcome all those hurts and disappointments in and reasons for revenge and resentment, you have to do all that before you can say, well, I'm here to make things better. Because if you're still possessed by those sorts of experiences and contradictions, you're going to be motivated to make things worse all the time, just out of revenge and spite you know you. You've been hurt, you're going to hurt, and so do adopt. The framework that Rogers is talking about is it's difficult enterprise and partly it'll come about the more you listen because the more you listen, you have the chance to exchange information, the more you will deal with those inner contradictions in that sort of collection of hurts and irritations that, that are corrupting you in twisted you in the wrong direction.

Speaker 1:          01:11:03       So the rigid perspective is extremely useful. It's very useful. The reason I concentrated on that one quote of his today is because it's such a useful thing, you can try right away the next time you're talking to someone, maybe have a friend who wants to talk things over. It's like listen to them and then when there's a pause say, well, it sounds to me like this is what you meant, and they'll go, yes, that's exactly what I meant. Maybe if you were really listening, they'll be real happy about that because they didn't know what they meant. They're just telling you the story about why they're annoying and so then you'll think, oh wow, I got it, and then there'll be happy and they'll tell you something else and like they'll walk away from that conversation much lighter and you will too. Even though it's a weird thing because you might think, well if you listen, people are going to dump a bunch of trouble on you.

Speaker 1:          01:11:49       It's like, well, yes, but if you're willing to listen despite the fact that there might be a bunch of trouble dumped on you, then you've also pulled yourself that you're the sort of person who can tolerate having a bunch of trouble dumped on yourself and that's like, that's. That's an extremely positive attitude to take towards yourself. You don't want. You're not just saying you're acting it out, and so that's a sign of faith in yourself and you're not. Well. I said you were stupid like you are in relationships, but you're not totally stupid. You know, you'll be able to notice that you, you, you've been willing to expose yourself to a risk and when your body and your mind you're watching that, they'll think, oh, I'm the sort of thing that can voluntarily expose itself to a risk. Well, that's like the secrets to making yourself strong.

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       It's exposure and so you can do that in every conversation and that toughens you up as well as informing you. It's a very powerful technique, so I would recommend try it, see what happens. It's really, it's also fun because it's like you're following a thread of the conversation. If you're really listening to the conversation will continue and it continues in a meaningful way and then you know that you're in the right place and it's like a challenge to your capacity to pay attention and then you get engaged in the convert. All conversations. You get engaged in them and then you're in engaging conversations all the time. That's a good thing, so. Okay, we'll see you.
