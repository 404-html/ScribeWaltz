Speaker 1:          00:00          One, one person who visited me during the break had a question that was a good not, but all the other questions weren't good. But this one is a question of good general relevance. So do you want to repeat your question?

Speaker 2:          00:18          People having but then dose those religion, right?

Speaker 1:          00:35          Yeah. Well it's a really good question. So the question is, Nisha said God is dead and he believed that things would fall apart as a consequence of that. And I'm claiming, for example, that people have an implicit religious structure and they act it out. Okay. So there's actually a lot of things happened as a consequence of the fact that that's a reasonable issue. A good question. So one of the things you might think about is that, so nature is claiming Dostoyevsky's claim were quite straight forward. They said that once you took the foundation out of something, it would fall out. It might take a long time to fall, especially if it's a big thing. So, you know, you could make the claim, for example, that the Soviet Union basically fell in like 1970 but it took 19 years to topple over because it's a big thing, right?

Speaker 1:          01:24          It's, it just doesn't crumble all at once. And so Nietzschean Dostoyevsky's claim would be once you hack out the basic assumptions and question them, that it's only a matter of time until the entire structure decays. And you could think that perhaps, you know, if you have a habit and then you become conscious of the habit and you practice a new habit, then you can have a new habit. And so what that means is that you can use your conscious mind to restructure your implicit beliefs. It's hard. Or you can use your conscious mind to destroy your belief in the value of those implicit actions and demolish them across time. Okay. So that could happen. And I think to some degree that has happened, it's certainly happened enough so that people are very confused about what they believe or even about what belief means. Cause there's a contradiction between what people think and there's a and how they act. So, okay, that's one.

Speaker 2:          02:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Tangent. So to speak. You, and he actually took that question very seriously in some sense because the nature, here's the floor niches argument. I think it's like, I hesitate to ever say that because like I said, he was a staggering genius. So, but nature believed his proposition was that once the religious edifice fell that people would have to create their own value. So he believed that the over ma'am, the superman so to speak would be a new type of human being, like an existential type of human being who would be able to accept the fact that there was no ultimate meaning, but create their own values. Okay. What the weird thing about that is you don't actually seem to create values. That's what, that's where is flawed. And I think that's where he implicitly accepted the presuppositions of the rationalists. Because if there's no real source of value, then it stands to reason that you create values, but you don't, not easily like, you know, think about your own life.

Speaker 1:          03:23          You know? So let's say you make a new year's resolution. You say, well, I'm going to study like three hours a day. It's like you're trying to create your own value structure, right? But then you find out it's a lot harder than you think because you don't listen to yourself. It's like you wonder off and you know, play video games or watch something on youtube, you know, and, and you know, why are you doing that? Well, it's because you're led by values. You don't create them. Now maybe there's a cocreation, you know, because it's not like you can't change yourself at all. But we should be very careful before we jumped to the conclusion that values are or even can be something that people actually create. Now the phenomenologists like heidegger and young well would say, no, no, let's, let's just not get too hasty about making the presupposition that we can or should create her own values.

Speaker 1:          04:18          Now, one reason you might be hesitant to do that is that Hitler created is value, so to speak. And so did the Soviet communists and the North Koreans. You know, they're trying to impose a rationalist value structure on a society and the consequences of that, it'd be, you know, people debate about how many people died in the Soviet Union as a consequence of internal repression. And as the Marxist revisionists rally back to the original beliefs, the estimate keeps going down. But you know, it was tens of millions of people. So, and in China, who knows, it was maybe it was 100 million people, it was a lot of people. And then of course there's the Nazis it, you know, so the, the, the act of attempting to rationally constructed value system and then impose it that it doesn't seem to work out very well. So, you know, on a sociological level, we seem to have evidence that that's dangerous.

Speaker 1:          05:17          And then on a personal level, it's like, yeah, you're so sure you create your values. I would say to a large degree you discovered them. And so, you know, here, here's, here's an experiment. You can try one, I told you last week I think to try to watch yourself speak for, I think you should do it for the rest of your life, you know, because words are very, very, very powerful and they lead you places. So you should be careful how you use them. But like here's another really interesting experiment is watch what you're interested in. Try, don't try to control it so much. Just see where it is. Because like in the phenomenologists certainly made much of this is like for them, like for Heidegger, value is something that manifested itself in the world and attracted your attention. You know, it wasn't something you precisely created.

Speaker 1:          06:08          Now I believe you have a hand in creating it. We'll talk more about that later because you're not, you're not a deterministic entity. Precisely. So it's like you can participate in the construction of a value system, but you know, you have to take your biological nature into mind and you have to take your cultural nature into mind and you'll have to take other people into mind. And so you know, you have, you can vary the game, but I don't think you can really change the rules. That's a reasonable way of thinking about it. Now what you did in many ways was he said, well, maybe we have to go back down into the deep symbolic substrata of the human psyche to find the origin place of the ideas that we used to hold as religious. It was a hypothesis in some sense, and so there, the psychoanalytic hypothesis is something like, it's the, it's the psychic substrata, the pre linguistic psychic substrata that is the source of ritual symbol and religious ideas. And so that you can go back to the source in a sense to revitalize those ideas. And that strikes me as a wiser approach than the rational approach, which says you can just create your values. It's like we tried that. It didn't work. It really didn't work. It was murderous. So, and then the, the alternative, the no value proposition as well, then you're going to be nihilistic. And that's not, I think nihilism is a form of mental illness. It's a sociological, it it, it's caused by sociological conditions, but fundamentally it's a mental illness,

Speaker 3:          07:54          right?

Speaker 1:          07:57          You revise what you mean by believe. That's part of it and that's what we're going to try to walk through. You know, this is a very, this is a linear argument in some sense, although there's going to be a lot of tangents. I want to, I want to show you how that might be done and what it might mean. I mean, who knows what it ultimately means, right? There's just no going there. But my experience with these ideas have been that once you understand them and it's a different way of categorizing Shin, I would say all sorts of things that you didn't understand all of a sudden light up for you. And it's really helpful, you know, because for, let me just give you a couple of examples. You know, I would say that it's a unspoken proposition of much of today's sociobiological thinking that there's something pathological about human beings.

Speaker 1:          08:51          You know, like I've heard people say like human beings are like a cancer on the planet. It's like I went to a talk at Ted talk at Queens, a Tedx talk where one of the professors who was a radical environmentalist of sorts, you know, he told the whole audience, they were all people about your age, that if they had any ounce of ethical, if they had any ethical standards whatsoever, they wouldn't reproduce. It's like, you know, really he said, well we've only had one child. And for me I thought that was one child too many for him. But you know, I thought that's bloody pathological. When you stand up in front of a whole bunch of young people who have their whole future in front of them and you say, well, you know, you're such a horrid creature in your very core that it would be a moral violation for you to propagate.

Speaker 1:          09:40          Its like, you know, so I mean one of the things that that happened to me is like I kind of like people, you know, there are peculiar and weird like hippopotamuses and, and rhinos and penguins and all that. But you know, I certainly don't think that we're some sort of cancer on the planet. I really think that's a, that's a pre genocidal idea as far as I'm concerned. It's like the planet would be better off without any people on it. It's like, Hey, glad you're not near the old thermo nuclear button. Yeah, really, really. You know, it's like that's an archetypal idea. Fire will cleanse everything. It's like, that's what Hitler believed. That's why all Berlin was burning when he committed suicide. It's like that was what he was after from the beginning, the cleansing fire. It's like beware of those ideas, boy. You know?

Speaker 1:          10:30          And so I, I can see the intrinsic dignity of people and, and their intrinsic value and how that can be expressed across time. And you know, and I value that. It's, it's, it's, it's something pristine and, and remarkable, you know? And, and understanding, I believe that understanding these ideas property can give you that kind of orientation, you know? I mean, everybody's flawed and useless and half crazy. I mean, obviously, but you know, that's not exactly the point. There are reasons we are flawed and useless and half crazy. You know, life is hard and we're finite and we know. So we have big problems that confront us. It's like, I don't think any sane person cannot be crazy so to speak. But having said all that, the idea that there's something intrinsically pathological about human beings like that is an absolutely, what's the word? Apocalyptic idea.

Speaker 1:          11:24          It's like beware of people who tell you such things, you know? So, and it's certainly not something you should be thinking about yourself. God. It's like who knows what you're up to. You know? Maybe some of you will be great people, you know, good luck with it. So, so I want to walk you through what I think these ideas mean. And I'm not asking you to believe anything I tell you. It's like don't hack away at it, man. See if you can see where it's flawed. I can't, I've tried. So cause I don't want to be standing on sand. And so what I've tried to do is to look at human history and prehistory and to see what it is that we need to move forward. And we have to be united with our history. Human beings are historical creatures. And so if there's a divide between us and our history, then all sorts of weird ideas are going to invade us.

Speaker 1:          12:16          You know? It's like, it's quite funny because again, with the rationalists atheists, you know, they basically think that if we dispense with religion, everybody would turn into Rene Descartes. You know? It's like we'd be all rational. It's like, are you out of your bloody mind? Look at the new age people, you know? That's where we'd be going first. It's like we'd be like, Shirley, what's your name? Mclean who I read once believed that the reason that there were so many allergies in San Francisco was because of aliens. It's like, oh, that's a much more likely place for human belief systems to end up. Then like, poof, we're all rene decartes. Like, that's not going to happen. You know, one of the things young said, which I just loved, he said, the purpose of religious structures is to stop people from having religious experiences. That's a smart, that's smart saying.

Speaker 1:          13:06          So anyways, so we're going to walk through this and, well, you know what I, what I've come to believe is that the archetypes we're going to talk about, because I believe they archetypes is pretty good way of thinking about them constitute the fundamental presumptions of human being. You, you can't not presume them. That's why the religious, you can't escape from them. Now that doesn't mean they're right, but it means that there as right as we are. And how right are we? Well we don't know. You know, I mean there were people that I read, somebody's in the 1970s he was a journalist, he wrote a book called the ghost in the machine. You know, and, and this was a fairly common proposition at the time. His idea was that, well, you know, we're animals that have become self conscious and that may be strictly drove us incurably insane.

Speaker 1:          13:56          And so we're like an evolutionary dead end and it's only a matter of time before we extinguish ourselves. It's like that's possible. You know, no other animal has ever become self conscious. It's a big burden, you know, and it does drive people kind of crazy and no wonder, you know, cause you have to contemplate your mortality all the time or at least some of the time. And also you're completely aware of how useless and ugly and you know all these other things you are compared to whatever the ideal might be. It's a lot of burden. But it seems to me to that human beings are peculiar in that we can actually choose, we have some facility for choice. I think we could decide whether we're an evolutionary dead end or not. And I also believe that grounding our thinking in these ancient ideas makes it far more likely, far less likely that we're going to fall prey to ideological possession, which is extraordinary dangerous.

Speaker 1:          14:45          And it'll also give us the metta framework to conceptualize what might constitute ideal and well. So you know, that's cause I wanted to, I wanted to find out what's an alternative cause videology and nothing is the wrong answer because people can't live on nothing. Life is too hard. You have to see that your being is justifiable in order to thrive. And given that your being is characterized by suffering, that's no easy matter, suffering and limitation. That's the basic truths of life. It's a Buddhist doctrine for that matter. Right? And it's, it's not, it's certainly not something that the Jews would disagree with. And it's central to Christian thinking as well. You know, most religious structures thing, you're doomed and there's going to be a lot of pain along the way. It's like, yeah, that's true. Okay, now we've got that out in the open. What do you do about it?

Speaker 2:          15:42          Well,

Speaker 1:          15:44          that's the question. So let's see, what do we have for time? It's three 45 is that about right? This old computer? I'm not sure it's accurate. Yeah. Okay, so question.

Speaker 2:          15:54          Yeah, I guess now that we've conceptualized it as a problem, it is.

Speaker 1:          16:03          Oh yeah. Well the thing is, you know, sometimes conceptualizing a problem brings it into focus. There are multiple ways things realize themselves, right? You know, you know how it is. If you, if you learn something complex, you think you've learned it, and then a little later you articulated more. Or do you think, oh, I, I didn't understand that completely. And then you know, you think you've got it. And in three years later you think, oh no, I really didn't quite have that. I'm going to articulate it more. So knowledge comes into focus and so, okay, so let's move away from, from the this philosophy, philosophical, evolutionary discussion for a moment. I want it, I want to start again with a series of propositions. So

Speaker 2:          16:38          330

Speaker 1:          16:40          it's three. Oh, okay, good, good, good. Three 38 all right, fine. So now when I first started to construct this representation, I'd been reading heavily a book called the neuropsychology of anxiety that's written by Jeffrey Gray. Jeffrey Gray was one of hands ising students. And Isaac was one of the other founders of modern psychometric personality theory for a long time. He was the most cited psychologist in the world. And Jeffrey Gray was no, Jeffrey Gray who died recently was a, he was a literate guy. Man. The neuropsychology of anxiety is a tough read because he was sort of a master of neuropharmacology neuro anatomy, neuro psychology and animal behavior. So he's a behaviorist and cybernetic theory, although I don't really think he knew exactly that he was a cybernetic theorist. He sort of knew it. It took me a long time to figure out that he was a cybernetic theorist. Cybernetics emerged as a consequence of the work of someone called Norbert Wiener, who was an, who was at mit and he wrote a book called, I think he wrote, I think the book was called cybernetics actually. Anyways, you can look them up. Um, and there are cybernetic principles that I extracted out of gray and it started to utilize and then I only found out later that they were actually

Speaker 1:          18:09          consequences of whiners thinking now. And he infected lots of people. So luria who was a great Russian nurse, neuro psychologist was basically a cybernetic system. There was a couple of other Russians, Sokolov and vinegar Dova who discovered the orienting reflex, which was like, that was like discovering a new planet or a new continent. It's like an important discovery. They should've got the Nobel prize for it. As far as I'm concerned, it's a big deal. And so Norbert Wiener cybernetic thought really spread everywhere and it like pops up. Piaget is cybernetic in many ways. And there's, there's modern personality theories that are fundamentally cybernetic. So this is basically a cybernetic model and cybernetics, cybernetic models hypothesize that active organisms, they basically perform according to the following.

Speaker 4:          18:56          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          18:57          Schema. They paused at a target and move towards it and then they regulate themselves so they don't deviate too much from the trail. So that's what this is as far as I'm concerned. So, so here's, here's the basic framework within which you live as far as I can tell and I don't think you can get out of it. And you carry this frame with you all the time and you're looking at the world through it. And the framework has a couple of substructures and one is you have some sense of where you are. And that's like a theory. It's a theory of where, who you are and where you are. It's a theory of the present. These are the present conditions. Now you might think you observe the present around you and those are factual observations. And so your conceptualization of the present isn't a theory.

Speaker 1:          19:47          It's a fact. But don't be thinking that, you know, it's a theory. You might be wrong about the present. The person you're in love with might be having an affair, right? So there can be massive gaps in your assumptions about the present. You know, you think you're healthy, but maybe you're not, you know, you think your boss likes you, but maybe they don't. You think your degree is going to be useful, but maybe it isn't. You know? Well it's just, it's just, it's just a straight forward observation. But it's an important one. You could be wrong about now. Okay. Cause one of the things we're going to try to figure out is where is it that you could be wrong and what does it mean that you could be wrong? All of those places. And what should you do about the fact that you could be wrong?

Speaker 1:          20:30          All those places. And then we're also going to try to figure out what happens if you find out that you're wrong. So, for example, you're going out with someone you love them, perhaps they've made promises to you and you know, poof, you find out that they'd been having an affair with three people for the last five years. It's like, hey, you're wrong. And so now where are you? What does that mean that you're wrong? Well, it means a lot of things. It means you're means a lot of things that you, it might mean a lot more things that it means, which is a very strange thing, might mean that you're so clueless as is just mind boggling, you know, and that you're blind as a bat. So that's one possibility and that you're like that and you've always been like that. You better do something about it quick.

Speaker 1:          21:11          That's a possibility might be that you hooked up with a psychopath, right? Which is also something that you should avoid. And but that would mean you don't understand people well enough to know when they're psychopaths or not, or maybe that your fatally attracted to them in some bizarre way. You know? It also means that whatever future you were envisioning that was really a delusion because that's gone. And it also means that you've blown out most of your past, at least in so far as that relationship was part of your past because nothing that you thought was happening was what was happening. So then you might think one moment you're somewhere, then you get the realization and the next moment you are somewhere else. And so one of the things I would propose to you is that those are actually two important places. The one place is the place you are, when what you're doing is working.

Speaker 1:          22:02          And the other place is the place you are when what you're doing is not working. And I would also say in some weird sense, those are permanent places. And I'll tell you why I think this, but I think they're akin in some manner to explored territory and unexplored territory. And that's their sort of biological basis. Because we know that animals are territorial, right? Almost every animal has a sketched out territory. Um, if social animals have to organize themselves within that, toward territory with other creatures like them. So part of their territory is almost always a dominance hierarchy, but they have a territory and they don't like going outside of it. So I can, I can give you an example. So my, my parents have that dog and a cat and a that my dad used to take the dog for a walk all the time, but the cat really liked the dog.

Speaker 1:          22:50          And so it was kind of irritated that the dog would leave. And so the cat started following my dad around on his walks. And so it was really interesting because the first thing the cat did was when it was following, it wasn't right behind the dog. There's no way it was going to do that. It would slink along all of the building. So it would follow about 30 feet behind and it would keep one side right against a building. And then it would sort of zip across the intervening spaces of the houses. Right. And you might think, well, why was it doing that? And the answer is it didn't know where the bloody predators were. Didn't know where the big dogs were. It didn't know anything about the new places it was going. So it was going to stick inside against one hard wall so that the complexity was cut in half and it was going to go really slow on the off chance that some massive hound came out and ate it.

Speaker 1:          23:36          So it was being very careful. So that was pretty cool. So it did that for quite a while and then because nothing massive jumped out and ate it and because it started to understand that territory knew where it could hide. It got a little braver and over a couple of months it got to the point where it actually follow the, the dog because it had mastered, it's expanded its territory and mastered its knowledge of the territory. But then I was walking with them one day and they had a route, Hey, and my dad had the dog and he wanted to take the dog a little farther than he would normally go with the dog. And so he was taking the dog across the street, but the cat just stayed on the corner and cried because it, you know, it was meowing obviously, but it was very upset because it wasn't going out into that weird new place that it had no knowledge about.

Speaker 1:          24:20          And so it was, you know, making its fear really known and animals are like that, you know? So here's something to think about. This blew me away when I first conceptualized it was one of the things that made me understand that psychologists are always asking questions backwards. I, I'll give you an example. It's like, why do people take cocaine? That's a question, right? I think it's a good question. It's a stupid question. The question is why doesn't everybody take cocaine all the time? That's the question. Because we know what cocaine does, right? It, it activates the primary incentive reward systems and almost everything you do is in an attempt to activate the primary incentive reward system. So you've got this white powder and it is, it's like you should be, knows deepen that stuff nonstop, but you're not, why? What's wrong with you people, you know?

Speaker 1:          25:15          So, so that's one example of where psychology is got, it's got it backwards. We know why people take intoxicating drugs. It's dead simple. Sometimes it reduces their anxiety, sometimes it reduces their pain. Sometimes it cranks up their incentive reward systems. You know, it hijacks the system, it does it biochemically, perfectly obvious. So that's one example. Now another example is this. How do animals learn fear? It's a prime behavioral question, right? It's the wrong question because it presumes that the, the standard animal is calm. Why would you presume that? Why wouldn't we presume instead that the standard animal is terrified and that the animal only learns how not to be terrified with difficulty and under very restricted circumstances? Well, that's a much better way of thinking about it. And it makes a lot more sense because the animals in danger, especially if it doesn't know its territory.

Speaker 1:          26:16          So, so here's how you teach an animal to be afraid. If you're a behaviorist and I am not making fun of behaviors, a lot of what I've learned about psychology that's actually real has come from behavior. It's like they're rigorous scientists and, and they learned an awful lot from analyzing animal behavior that was incredibly profound. And they laid the ground for modern neuroscience, the real stuff, not the FMRI stuff. You know, the real stuff. So, okay, so basically what you do to train an animal to be afraid is you take a rack, let's say, and the rats in this cage, and you put, you put a little electric shock pad in the rats cage, so maybe electrifies the bottom a little bit and you turn on a light and you electrify the bottom and the rat jumps into the air and then you shut it off. And then you wait a while and then you do the same thing, turn on the light, then you turn on the electric electric shock mechanism and the wrap jumps in the air and you do that 10 times. And then when you turn on the light, the rat goes like, this freezes because it's learned, right? Light equal shark. Everyone knows that, you know, that's basic conditioning. Um,

Speaker 1:          27:22          so the rats learn to be afraid. Okay, that makes sense. Except,

Speaker 4:          27:29          okay,

Speaker 1:          27:30          here's your experimental box, right? You got the electrification going on in there and you grab your rat and you dropped me in the cage. What does he do first? He freezes because he's afraid. He's afraid. As soon as you put them in the new environment, that's the normal route. The normal rat. It's like this. And why is that? Because things like to eat rats. So you know they don't like light. They like it dark and they don't like being exposed and they don't like being the new damn cage because God only knows what's in that cage. And so the a priori rat is this. So then what is the wrap do? Well it's like this for quite a while. It can be really a long time. I'll tell you a story about that. He's like this and then maybe he sniffs cause rats mostly knows.

Speaker 1:          28:20          Most animals are mostly smell oriented, right? Human beings are weird because we're visually oriented, but almost all animals, it's all smell. Their whole brains are organized around their olfactory system. So it sniffs and if it can't smell anything, rats, man, they can smell. So there's experiments indicating that if you take a rat and you poison it and then it gets sick and another rat has smelled it's breath, that rat will not eat the poison that the first route eight. Now that's why it's hard to get rid of rats. They're smart and they have great senses of smell. So the rats checking out like is there anything here that smells like something that might eat me? So cats for example, rat doesn't ever have to meet a cap to be afraid of it's odor. Rats, hate cat odor. And so you can take rats in it like a box and blow a fan over a cat so that the odor wafts into the box and let's like the rats are all like this because God only knows what a cat smells like to Iraq, but it ain't good.

Speaker 1:          29:17          Whatever it is. So the rats like this, then he sniffing and he's looking around and if nothing happens then he starts to relax a little bit, but not that much. He still crouched down and he's still at the attended of rat. And then he starts to look around a bit and then he starts to loosen up and then maybe he starts to move. And his theory is possibly it's safe enough here. So Iraq, that's careful, can move and nothing painful or damaging will happen. And then he starts to move and nothing happens. And then he spends a bunch of times sniffing around every corner of the cage. And you know, sooner or later he thinks

Speaker 1:          29:53          rats aren't going to die here now. And then he's sort of a relaxed rat. And then the behavior says, you are now a normal rat. We can teach you to be afraid. It's like you don't have to teach me to be afraid. I know how to be afraid. I have to learn how not to be afraid. Now that's a good way of thinking about your brain. So you could think about the underlying motivational and emotional systems in your brain as default on systems. They're like a nuclear reactor, like the core of a nuclear reactor. You're ready, man. Except when other parts of your brain you're telling you just to keep it calm. So, but you don't need to learn to be afraid any more than you need to learn to be hungry. You need to learn how to be calm and secure. And that's really worth thinking about because you got to ask yourself, for example, why are you calm and secure in this class? What are the preconditions for you not being afraid here? So we'll think about it. Why are you not afraid?

Speaker 1:          30:54          Well, the floor is solid. That's a good one. The roof is probably not going to collapse. Why? Well, it's actually because you could rely on the structural engineers who built the building. That's kind of interesting. Why? You know, in the Soviet Union they used to make cinder block buildings out of old radioactive waste. And then of course they put way too much sand in them so that if the earth went like this once, it'd be like collapse. And so the typical Soviet couldn't be reasonably fearless in this room because the walls were radioactive and if the earth moved a little bit to this whole thing would collapse. And so part of the reason that you can sit in here without fear is because the system that regulates our construction enterprise is actually not very corrupt. So that's pretty cool. So you know, also we can think about that.

Speaker 1:          31:41          That means that one of the preconditions for your relative fearlessness is your implicit belief that the builders who built this building can be trusted. And that's really unlikely. You know, if you look around the world, how many countries are there that aren't corrupt? I mean, you know, the West is corrupt too. There's no doubt about it. But compared to our really corrupt place, you know, we don't even register as corrupt. So what else? Well, look at the people around you. You know, you guys look a lot the same. All things considered, you know, none of you or have painted your face in rainbow colors and you know, you're not decorated with ostrich feathers and you're not wearing some outlandish victorian costume and none of you are stark naked. And most of you aren't foaming at the mouth than you know, like fundamentally you're in a uniform and there's some variation of the uniform allowed.

Speaker 1:          32:30          But not much. How many of you are wearing jeans? Right? It's like 50% of you. Why are you wearing jeans? It's so other primates think you're insane. That's why I'm telling you it's a big part of it. It's, it's acceptable. And so most of you are wearing clean jeans, I presume, or they're cleaned enough anyways so that if they're not clean, it's not detectable, which is another sign that you're not completely insane. Right? And so you're manifesting markers like mad that you're basically a normal primate and that you live in accordance with a set of well understood implicit rules. And that for the purposes of this set of interactions, you're not going to violate them. So everybody can come in here like the terrified primates. They are the first class and they can look around. They see the desks are all in order. So that means order prevails here.

Speaker 1:          33:23          The desks all facing this way. So it's a standard lecture theater. You know what's going to happen here. People walk in, they all sit properly in their tables, most of them don't talk. There's another rule. How many of you are sitting in the same chair that you sat in last week, right? And you know pretty soon you're going to figure out which chairs years. And then if someone comes in here and sits in your chair, you're going to think that person's in my chair. And you know the reason for that is is you're trying to stabilize the environment. You've learned that that chair is safe and so are the people around you. And so now you feel kind of comfortable in that chair. You sort of think it's your chair. And so we do everything we can to structure the environment so that signals that you're safe are radiating at you like mad.

Speaker 1:          34:08          And that way you can be calm enough despite the fact that you're a crazy chimpanzee. You can be calm enough to sit here and not be distracted by fundamental motivational systems that are out of control and maybe listen and attend. And like you just think about how much work. Just think about it, how much work went into building this room for you to sit in? You know, it's like they're being universities for about a thousand years. So there's a thousand year conceptual history of the university. That's one of the preconditions. And then we had to figure out how to make all this stuff and then people actually had to put it together and then you all had to be socialized for like 19 years so that you could sit here relatively quietly while you're listening to a lecture. And you know, we had to build the idea of the university into our culture and you know, somebody's got to keep the lights on and look at this technology that works.

Speaker 1:          35:00          It's like there are people out there just slaving themselves to death to make sure that this little box that you're sitting in is sufficiently predictable so that you don't have to be terrified. It's like good for them, you know? And it's all happening so invisibly that, you know, you're probably irritated because your Internet connection doesn't work that well or something like that, you know? So, so it's really, really useful to know that it's a, the idea that your normal state is calm and well regulated is highly debatable. It's highly debatable. I would say there was very limited pre conditions under which you are going to feel safe. And then I would also say you're highly motivated to maintain those conditions and you're also highly motivated not to go somewhere where those conditions don't apply. Right? You're just not going to do it because that's a different kind of place.

Speaker 1:          35:58          And I would say that place is chaos. The place where the rules do not apply, that's chaos. And it's a real place that's unexplored territory and peep you have, you're hardwired at an instinctual level to deal with unexpected exposure to unexplored territory. And you do that by going like this. It's a startle and fear. You're frozen. And the reason for that is you're a prey animal and you have sub circuits in you that are millions of years old that are there to protect you from becoming prey. And that could be prey of other people, that's for sure. But it could be prey of anything that would like to meet you. You know, and part of the reason you might understand is that it's not, there aren't that many large predators around anymore. You know, what's part of the human despoil nation of the planet is that mostly people don't like having their children eaten by tigers, you know?

Speaker 1:          36:57          So, and it's, it's not because there's something wrong with us, it's because that's actually a rather unpleasant experience. And so if you could have a tiger around or not have one, you might well choose not to have one, especially if you have some, you know, certain amount of love for your children who, although lovable also happened to be delicious. Right? So, well, okay, so it's a proposition I want to undermine because I want to start with the presupposition that fundamentally as a biological creature, you're like a wild animal and you're like, uh, uh, uh, a prey animal, things might happen to you and you're ready for them. And then what we do with societies, we construct up an edifice that has multilevel, some of it's actually instantiated, right? And the rest of it is cultural and ritual and behavioral so that you don't have to be a prey animal. You can be relatively calm and assured that nothing terrible is going to happen to you in the next 10 seconds and that's worth fighting for. So, alright, that's probably good enough. So now we've got, we've got some basic presuppositions lead down, you know, and so let me just review them briefly. One minute.

Speaker 1:          38:08          Stability is not your normal state. It's an abnormal state and it's very, very difficult to maintain.

Speaker 4:          38:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:19          You maintain it at least in large part as a consequence of being inculturated.

Speaker 1:          38:26          And to be enculturated means to adopt a value system that works for you, but that also works for everyone else. It has to fulfill those criteria. Furthermore should be the kind of value system that allows you to move up dominance hierarchies if you can manage it. A lot of constraints on your value system. If your value system is producing the kind of behaviors that fulfill those criteria, you don't have to be terrified. Now, it's not just terror. Cause I've also learned that a lot of what culture is controlling is discussed. Now it's actually not in the book because I just learned that. So, and I want to talk more about, I want to talk to you more about disgust because we've learned for example, that people who are orderly temperamentally, which is an element of conscientiousness, are very sensitive to discussed. And I think part of the issue is that it isn't only that things can eat us, it's the things can infect us.

Speaker 1:          39:19          And so we're just as prone a Priori to repel anything that's disgusting as we are prepared a priority to keep at bay. Anything that's frightening. Um, one of the things I learned, which was terrifying to me, I read Hitler's table talk, which was a collection of his spontaneous dinner speeches that were taken down by a secretary. It's a very interesting book. But one of the things I realized once we kind of made the disgust orderliness connection in my lab about two years ago, after looking for the biological basis of conscientiousness forever, Hitler basically used a bodily metaphor to under pin his entire political philosophy. So for Hitler who was hyper orderly bordering on obsession, all he bathed four times a day for example, and he was a vegetarian, which actually is relevant, um, because he didn't want animals to be hurt, you know, he was sensitive to discussed and that was part of what underlying is vegetarianism.

Speaker 1:          40:19          Um, he construed the area in race as a body. Like that was his metaphor. It's a body, it's a pure body, has pure blood. So there's purity ideas that, that, you know, made part of what he was saying motivationally significant. And it was under assault from parasites and the parasites were, well for him it was anyone who wasn't part of that body. So it was discussed, gone mad. It was really was, you know, and so that forced me to modify my theories, the theories I'm going to present to you because for me a lot of what society did was control anxiety, you know, in hunger and a lot of other things obviously. But I didn't realize to what degree society also controlled, discussed and how powerful disgust is as a political motivator. So there was a paper published in Kloss one about three months ago, five months ago, maybe more than that now.

Speaker 1:          41:15          It showed that the correlation between totalitarian beliefs in any given geographical locale and the prevalence of infectious disease was about 0.7 and that was true not only across countries but within countries. If you divided the places up by how there were to be infectious diseases in the relevant states, 0.7 so prejudice, xenophobia, fear of foreigners, all of that huge chunk of that is discussed. Sensitivity Gone Mad. So anyway, so we're going to talk about that too as a part of a control mechanism. Yup. What's that? Applause. One P l o s one one. It's a public journal. You can find it. Look up infectious disease. And a totalitarianism. Here's a lot of work done on that. Now.
