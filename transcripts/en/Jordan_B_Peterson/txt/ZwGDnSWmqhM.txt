Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00          When I had talked to people about doing the future authoring program, they often put it off. And it's not surprising because it's hard and, and b, but it's more than that. They think, well, I don't know how to write. I'm going to do a bad job. I don't really like assignments. I'm going to have to do it perfectly. I need to wait till I have enough time. And like one of those is enough to stop you cold and all five of them you're just done. And so I tell people, do it haphazardly, a tiny bit at a time and badly because you can do that. I tell my students when they're doing their thesis master's thesis, write a really bad first draft and then we have a little conversation about that because they don't think I mean that because it sounds like a cliche in some sense. It's not a cliche, it's not a cliche at all. It means

Speaker 2:          00:51          you're a terrible writer. But, but if someone put a gun to your head and said, you have to have your a hundred page thesis done by next Monday or I'll shoot you. But I don't care how terrible it is. You would sit down and write it and the thing is, then you have it right then, then you have something and then you can fix it. You can iterate and fix it. That bad first draft. That's the most valuable thing. And so that's what you need. You need a bad first draft of yourself. And there's, there's an idea that young developed about the trickster and the gesture, the comedian, right? That the trickster is the precursor to the savior. And that's one of the things I learned from young that was just, it's so unlikely you'd never think that it's so amazing that that might be the case.

Speaker 2:          01:34          But the, the, the, the, the, the satirical in the erotic and the, and the troublemaker that the comedian, the fool, the fool is the precursor to the savior. Why? Because you're a fool when you start something new. And so if you're not willing to be a fool, then you'll never start anything new. And if you never start anything new, then you won't develop. And so the willingness to be a fool is the precursor to transformation. And that's the same as humility. And so if you're going to write your destiny, you can do a bad first job. You're going to get smarter as you move forward. That's the thing is that, so something beckons to you. That's what happens here. Maybe the star that Japan wished on was the wrong damn star, but at least it was a star, right? At least it was in the sky.

Speaker 2:          02:17          At least it moved him forward. And so you say in your life or something grips you and fills you with interest and you think, well, should I do that? And the answer is, if not that, then something. What if it's a mistake? It's a mistake. Rest assured, what do you know? You're going to stumble around, right? And what's going to happen is this, you're going to move to, you're going to not stay in stacy's. You're not going to wander around in circles. And I see people like that. They said, well, I never knew what to do and now I'm 40 it's like, that's not so good. That's not so good. And you might say, well, and there is literature to that suggests that people are a lot more unhappy when they look back in their lives about the things they didn't do than they are about the mistakes they made while they were doing things.

Speaker 2:          03:06          And so that's really worth thinking about too, because there's redemptive mistakes and a redemptive mistake would be a mistake that you make when you go out try to do something. You know, you actually, you think, okay, I'm going to try and do this. When you're not good at it and you make a bunch of mistakes. It's like what? What's the consequence if you pay attention is you're not quite so stupid anymore. That's the thing is you've been informed by your, by the results of your errors. And so what happens is you're, you, you follow the beacon, you follow the light and you're blind. So you don't know where the light is. It's, it's dimly apprehended only and you're afraid to follow it. But you decided to take some stumbling steps towards it. And as you take stumbling steps towards it, you become illuminated and enlightened and informed because of the nature of your experience. Because you're pushing yourself beyond where you are and you're going into the country that you have not yet been in and you learn something. And so what happens then is the star moves, you move 10 feet towards it and you think, no, that's not right. I didn't get it right. It isn't there. It's actually there. And so then you, you see it somewhere else and you shift yourself slightly and you move forward. And that's what happens is that

Speaker 2:          04:16          you continue as you change the thing that guides you forward moves, right? It's like God in the, in the, in the desert, in Egypt, the pillar of light that you're following, it's moving. It's not a permanent thing. You move towards it, it moves away, it guides you forward. And so you say, well, is what I'm aiming at paradise itself. And the answer to that is no, because what do you know you, you couldn't see paradise if it was right in front of you, but you might get a glimmer of it. And so you move towards it and you grow, and then the next time you open your eyes, you see a little bit more clearly. And that's what happens is that just happens over and over, right? It keeps moving.

Speaker 2:          04:59          And so you move like this, but the thing that's so cool is that all those zigs and zags you say, and each of those zags is and Zags is a catastrophe. I hit a wall, my God, and then I had to die a little bit and I barely got back up. It's a phoenix transformation at each, at each turn, and it's painful. But the thing is is that even though you've, you've traveled 20 miles, let's say on that road, and you've only moved three miles forward, you've moved three miles forward instead of falling backwards. Because that's the thing too, is that if you stand still, you fall backwards. You cannot stand still because the world moves away from you. If you stand still and there's no [inaudible], there's only backwards. And so if you're not moving backward, back forwards, then you're moving backwards. And that's more, more of the underlying truth of, of the matthew principle, to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing. Everything will be taken. It's a warning. Do not stay in one place. Well, as you zig and zag, maybe the, maybe the cataclysm of each transformation starts to lessen. There's not so much of you that has to die with every mistake

Speaker 2:          06:21          and maybe you end up oriented at least reasonably properly. And if you were sensible, that would have been your trip, but it wasn't right. It's that, and perhaps it's a lot worse. Did Not. Perhaps there's no shortage of backtracking, but it doesn't matter because as you stumbled forward, you, you eliminate and inform yourself. And perhaps that's partly because the world is made of information and if you encounter it and tangle with it, then it informs you and then you become informed and then you're in formation and then you're ready.
