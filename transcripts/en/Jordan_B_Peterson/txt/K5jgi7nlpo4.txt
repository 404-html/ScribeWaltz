Speaker 1:          00:01          Hi, I'm here at the airport in Portland, about 50 cities into what is going to be 100 city tour. It's going exceptionally well. Audiences in each city and the people I've met afterward and being very enthusiastic. There seems to be a rapidly developing market for relatively long form intellectual discourse driven by Youtube and podcasts which have none of the bandwidth limitations of traditional media forms. I just had two evenings of productive discussion with Sam Harris in Vancouver who going to post my notes from those talks on my blog@JordanPeterson.com. We talked about the relationship between facts and values and the role that narrative and story might play in bringing the two together for better or worse, the Vancouver event sold out. The next discussion was Sam the third, which will also feature Douglas Murray will take place in Dublin, Ireland on the 14th of July at the three arena, followed by the final fourth discussion at the o two arena in London.
