Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So it's

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       July 18th, Tuesday, July 18th, 2017, and I've been working for the last few days on the eighth lecture in my series, the psychological significance of the biblical stories and I'm planning to talk about the abrahamic stories that immediately follow the stories of Noah and the Tower of Babel. I'm not as familiar with abrahamic stories as I am with the stories, the earlier stories in genesis say from the beginning of the Bible through the stories of Noah and the Tower of Babel. And I'm not as familiar with abrahamic stories as I am with the stories of Moses that begin with exodus and continuing to succeeding chapters. So I've had to do a lot of reading and a lot of thinking and, and some conversing as well. And as part of that process, I spoke once again with Jonathan Patio, uh, a carver of stone icons and an Orthodox Christian and student of religion. And also this time, who I did a video with a while back, you might remember called the metaphysics of pepe, where we discussed the psychology of the stranger and also some of the stories, abrahamic stories involving lot in Sodom and Gomorrah, and I also had the opportunity to meet his brother Matthew Palio, who's been working on a book on the Bible for the last three and a half years.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       And so we spent 90 minutes talking about the abrahamic stories and the conceptual background that's necessary to understand them. And that's what I want to show you today after this introduction. So I hope it's useful. So I'm going to introduce both of you. So Jonathan is a carver of icons and I've spoken with Jonathan a number of times already and he now has his own youtube channel as well, where he discusses issues that are similar to the ones that we're going to discuss today. In Matthew is his brother who I haven't met before in Matthew, has been working on a book for the last. How long?

Speaker 3:          00:01:55       Two and a half years.

Speaker 2:          00:01:56       Three and a half years. And do you want to tell everyone very briefly about the book?

Speaker 3:          00:02:02       Well, it's a book about symbolism, but it's basically, I'm trying to rediscover the world view that was present in the time of the Bible or at least actually not that long ago because modern, modern interpretations of reality, materialists interpretations of reality aren't that old, right? The world view that was there when traditional societies were still there. Um, and so I'm trying to rediscover that worldview and a, basically there are basic patterns, heaven and earth time and space, things like things like that. Uh, so it's like a, a cosmology that's been completely lost as far as I'm concerned. Some people have glimpses of it, I think a lot of people do, but it's very general patterns that we have to re re understand. So we can understand the Bible, for example, in other, other storage. They get interested

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       in this. Like what is it that compelled you to do this?

Speaker 3:          00:03:04       Oh, I don't know where to start. I mean, my whole life has been about that. So, uh, I mean, you read the Bible, you can take it literally, you can take it figuratively or you can take it both ways. And I'm trying to take it both ways. I'm trying to get rid of it, the economy, the dichotomy of symbolism and factual description. I think there is no such dichotomy. If you understand what the words mean. If you have the right perspective, there's no more metaphors in the Bible. There are no okay. But it takes a while to get there because you have to adopt a completely different perspective than, than the materialistic when obviously you got to be a materialist and, and a Christian or we can be a religious and a materialist. That's what I think.

Speaker 4:          00:03:50       Okay. And one of the things we're hoping is that, you know, we've been getting. I've been getting a lot of questions and I know you probably Jordan, me getting a lot of questions about this question of metaphor and a lot of people have been asking me how do we reconcile, how do I reconcile metaphors with what's in the Bible? How do I reconcile these metaphors with how I'm supposed to live in the world and I think that would, matthew has been with his writing and what I've been, I've been reading it, I'm reading it right now, is that he, he's really able to answer that question in a way that I think will be one of the most satisfying answers that we've seen in in awhile. So we're pretty excited to see how are we going to get that out

Speaker 2:          00:04:26       to people. So let me start by telling you what I've been thinking about just briefly and then you guys can comment and I'd like you to do most of the talking if we can manage that. Although I'm so damn talkative, it's hard to imagine that'll happen, but. So I've been reading this book called the disappearance of God and I've been using it as a. it's a body guy named Richard Friedman and it was published I think in 2005. I think that's right. It might have been earlier than that, but he makes a couple of interesting points about the all the braiding in the old testament and and they're parallel points and so the first is that the closer you are to the beginning of the Bible, the more God is present and and as you progress towards the end of the Old Testament, God sort of vanishes in stages until he only manifests himself if at all, in prophetic visions.

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       And at the same time the parallel development is that the stories of individual human beings become more and more well developed. So it's like as the idea of the individual personality emerges or the fact of the individual personality emerges. The the presence of God as a, as a detectable entity like an external entity even seems to decline proportionately. And so I'm trying to puzzle that out in a variety of different ways. Partly neurologically because there's some evidence that the domain of experience that you might associated with my associate with the divine is a consequence of suppressed lemons. Left Hemisphere function and augmented right hemisphere function. And then I'm trying to also consider that in relationship to the effect of chemicals like silicide been, which obviously can produce powerful mystical experiences, so experiences of consciousness that are really have a different type than normal waking ego consciousness, and I've also been reading humans mostly commentaries about humans read book and his attempts to use active imagination as a as a means to explore the contents of different forms of consciousness, which is something that modern people just really never do.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       Although he did it for years and and the consequence of that was the red book, also the black books, which hasn't been published yet, but the red book, which was a, which was I think published two or three years ago. That was a collection of visionary experiences in his. His continuing discussions with figures of his imagination, which he regarded as the most important work he did in his life. So, so what's, what does that all boil down to? It's. It's definitely possible for people to have non can have to have experiences outside the domain of their normal consciousness that produced the intimation of the divine. That seems to be factually indisputable. Those were not exactly sure how those experiences manifested themselves in the periods of time that are associated with the early biblical stories.

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       the BIP, the Bible talks about those sorts of experiences very forthrightly in the earliest abrahamic stories and also in the story of Noah and obviously an Adam and eve and all of that. God is very present and then he disappears over time and one of the things that that I'm the guy who wrote the disappearance of God Friedman. One of the things he pointed out was that the fact of the disappearance of God in the Old Testament, the fact that that's a. that's, that's a continual, like it has narrative continuity. That fact, he already remarked on both those things because of course the books were written by different people and then they were aggregated, but out of that came to elements of narrative continuity and one was the gradual disappearance of God and the other was the gradual rise of the increasingly well-defined and powerful individual. So anyways, associated with that is the idea that as God withdraws, he also starts to manifest himself more through the idea of a covenant and that the Covenant is something that's established with an individual all obviously also with the nation in the case of Israel, but it's mediated through individuals. And so, well, that's a brief wander through the sort of cloud of associations that make up my thinking about the topic at the moment. So,

Speaker 3:          00:09:13       well, what you described sounds a lot like what would you see in the Bible? I'm not so sure about the god is more distant part in, further on and goes, um, from what I understand, there are two kinds of consciousness in the Bible. One of them is it's called inhabiting the land. That's when reality fits the fact, the theory. Okay? So the principal and the fact that grief, so their loss and people follow the laws or there's an idea and reality fits with that idea. So that's called inhabiting the land. So it, it, it's familiar space. Okay. So when you live in that space, things make sense because your ideas match what's happening, right? And then you can fall away from that. That's the covenant. A covenant is an agreement between theory and practice. That's what a covenant is in the Bible. I'm so God gives laws and the people have to agree to follow the law basically. So the law is, is, is an identity. It's not just like you do this, you do that. It's, it's, it expresses God's identity in practice. So when the facts match that identity, that's like a soul and a body that are, uh, that a great. Okay? So when you fall away from that, you fall into exile. That's the other mode and it looks like, um, that's what you were talking about before. I'm not so sure until you've talked about a coconut, but, um, that's when the meaning and the fact that do not know. Touch.

Speaker 2:          00:11:01       Okay. So, so let me, let me ask you a couple of questions about that. Yeah. So, you know, I've been describing the cosmology in the Bible as mappable onto the domains of order and chaos. And I actually think the best way to define the order, his order is the place you are when what you're doing matches what's happening. It's very, very, very similar to the idea that you just expressed. And then that's exactly it. Okay. Okay. And yeah, that's a state. There's a state of harmony between preconception and actuality. And that's also, I think the circumstance under which people's emotions remain regulated. And I thought about that neurologically to. I think that what happens is that under those conditions, your left hemisphere stays in charge and there's some evidence for that kind of thing too. Especially from the writings of this neurologist. I think he's a neurologist. His name is Ramachandra and he's quite a famous brain scientist and he's an another, another neuropsychologist named El Conan Goldberg, who's also talked about hemispheric function in the same way. And so when things are going according to plan, let's say, and then the individual ego consciousness that's, that's focused and specific stays in charge, but that also keeps negative emotions regulate it because there's no need for them because everything is working properly. And so then you can fall out of that and you called that, you called that exile?

Speaker 3:          00:12:30       No. Uh, when, when you fall away from it. Yeah. When you fall away from the. So that would be equivalent. It's also the flood. It's like. Yeah, fine. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       So I was like the wandering in the desert.

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       Yeah, it's the, the idea of exile is, it's exactly what we said. It's about serving strange things so you're not in charge anymore. Fax something else is what you're in. You're in that you live in a world where you are not in charge or your identity is not in charge of the facts and they're not. They don't fit with reality. So that means something else is in charge. And so you're serving that. So the idea of serving strangers in exile, it simply means, oh, that's really your identity doesn't match reality. Oh, that's funny. I never thought of it

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       both that, that idea of serving strangers in exile. So, so. Okay. So I'm going to branch off that a couple of different ways. So one idea there is that there was an idea from young, which is paraphrased something like if you don't, if you don't act out your own myths and you serve a bit part in the myths of others, okay, so that would be in keeping with that idea of serving the stranger in exile and then the next part would be when you're in a chaotic state and your emotions are disregulated, your personality fraction aids and the fractionated personality personalities, some personalities fight for control over over over behavioral output so you, you, you dissolved from a unity might have. Think about it as a pyramid, a pyramid with with a unifying conception at the top that disintegrates. That would be like the Tower of Babel to some degree that disintegrates and then sub entities, you could think about them as spirits or think about them as psychological entities regulate your behavior. That would be equivalent to a movement from the left hemisphere to the right. Because I think the right is dominated by subcortical structures route. I think that's how the animals exist, is, is it's sequential domination by subcortical structures rather than some overarching conceptualization from the top down.

Speaker 3:          00:14:46       I think that, um, what you call it, the left and the right is exactly the opposite of the traditional left. Right? I'm not so sure yet, but when you say left hemisphere, what do you mean? Well, like what's the left hemisphere governs the right hand. Okay. So the left hemisphere is the one that's when it's. When it's in charge and when everything works. Yes. Okay. It's exactly the opposite of the, of the traditional imagery. Usually the, it's the right. That's. Well, yeah, because they're using the hands.

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       Yeah, exactly. So the right, the right would be mapped onto the left hemisphere. Okay. So that's fine. That's fine. Now. And, and the traditional imagery I think is associated with the hemispheric specialization as well because the idea of right now I want to ask you a question about that. You said that they, the, the, the living, what was it you contrasted exile with? What was the other conceptualization inhabiting the homeland inhabit? Inhabiting the homeland? Sure, absolutely. Working on working on the homeland is another way to say, okay, now tell me again how you conceptualize the relationship between God and and his people. Let's say in the homeland.

Speaker 3:          00:16:07       Uh, well, God, like I said at the beginning, there's the idea of heaven and earth is that the basis and everything in the Bible. So heaven is meaning and earth is fact. So in that relationship, there's God, it's always the name of God. By the way, if you look, if you look in the way it's described in the Bible, it's, it's, they're talking about the name of God. So that means the meaning of God. So God is not just meaning, but when they talk about it in the Bible, it's always about the name of God. So the name of God is an identity. It's like a principal in axiom or something like that. And um, it has to embody itself in a physical reality, flesh or in matter. So the, the role of the nation of Israel is to embody that identity. And it's also to embody it in reality, not just in themselves. So basically there are a mediator between heaven and earth, right? They're trying to make God's identity, um, practical or concrete or that's why it's all about laws because you take a nap, it's like mathematics. You've taken that an abstract principle that's really extremely simple. Uh, it doesn't seem like it. It contains much information, right? If you take an axiom in mathematics, but then you have to derive all the implications, right? So that's making it practical, that's making it concrete, that's bringing heaven into the earth. So that's their job. It's like a cosmic mediator. Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       okay. Follow you so far. So, all right, so the, the, it looks like there's two ways maybe in the biblical narrative that that will, is instantiated in, in reality, and one would be as a consequence of individuals aligning themselves with the word of God and the other is the instantiation of the word of God into the state of Israel seem seem reasonable. Okay? And that seems to begin that that has its origin in the, in the first abrahamic story. So Abraham talks to God and God talks to Abraham and tells him that he's going to be the father of the nation essentially, and then

Speaker 3:          00:18:41       you'd like to inherit the land to order. It's the same thing actually. Those two things have the same is going to inherit the land and he's going to become the principal of a great many people. So that's like he's fleshing out an identity, right? It gives a nation instead of just individual. Right? And he's going to become the identity of a nation.

Speaker 2:          00:19:06       Okay. And so how do you understand the description of that in the, in the biblical narrative? Because one of the very. One of the things I find very strange about abrahamic stories is that immediate presence of God and God shows up to Abraham and tells them this. And then Abraham makes an altar, if I remember correctly, once he gets to the land where he's supposed to be, he makes an altar and then. And then God appears to him again.

Speaker 3:          00:19:40       Yeah, I'm not again, not again, appears to him the first time. It doesn't appear. I think I'm pretty sure the first time God speaks to him. Okay. See that's, that's important. Okay. The second time

Speaker 2:          00:19:53       distinction important.

Speaker 3:          00:19:55       Well, because he's just, he's just, he's not physical. He's not a into practical reality yet. It's invisible. So God speaks is he's not manifest. It's just an idea principal at word. Okay. And unmanifest word or it's like the minimum of manifestation. It's just language, just word. And then. So what he says is go to this place, go to this land and you'll inherit the lead. And then he goes there and then it says God appeared to him. I see. So,

Speaker 2:          00:20:31       okay. So there's a, there's a progression. Progressive Progressive Appearance of God and it's partly a consequence of Abraham's original, um, obedience to the initial idea.

Speaker 3:          00:20:43       Yeah. Which was very abstract. Me Go here. You can be more simple than that. Go there. So it's, it's like, it doesn't mean anything, but it means everything. It's a very. Everything we do is I go there, go there and do something. So it's like the principle of all things appeared to Abraham saying, just go there and you'll inherit. That doesn't really mean anything if it contains everything humans do.

Speaker 2:          00:21:15       Yup. Okay. That's an interesting observation because I think of human beings as other very directional. They're always going from point a to point b. they're always aiming there like archers. Right. And it's definitely the case. Like I had someone write to me. No, I was doing a Patriot interview with one of the people who's been supporting me, a young guy and uh, we were talking about the idea of Christ as redeemer and judge and he was, this young man was unredeemed, let's say for a long period of time because he didn't have any direction. And to have direction you have to know what's good and what isn't. Because to have direction you have to go towards what's good. And so the judge is what helps you figure out what's good and if you don't know what's good then you can't be redeemed. Because to be redeemed as to be is to be moving towards the good and away from let's say evil. And so the judge and the redeemer have to be the same thing. And that fits in with what you're saying because the judge is the thing that makes qualitative distinctions, let's say, and you need to make a qualitative distinction before you can move ahead. Okay. And so your point is that the principal that Abraham encounters to begin with is the principle of directionality itself, qualitative directionality. It's something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:22:38       That's correct. Yeah. It's. Well, it's, it's the positive identity of anything. Like it's, it's like a seed. It's the seed of a tree. That's the traditional way to understand it. It's just a seed. It contains everything in it, but in itself it's just something like go there or something go there. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:58       That's it. Okay. So one of the things that's been interesting, I think for me to learn personally as I've moved through my life was that if I ever actually did anything, it was worthwhile. You know what I mean? Is that something would come of it. It wouldn't necessarily be what I expect it to come of it, but the act of going and doing did bear fruit.

Speaker 3:          00:23:20       Yeah. And that's pretty much the story of Abraham in a nutshell. Actually what you just said, because God says, go here, you only inherited the land. Abraham doesn't inherit the land. He could have been right away. It could have gone there and it's yours, but no theirs. That's why it says as soon as he gets there and says there's already people there, there's the land is already owned by other. There's a famine. Yeah, exactly. And, and that means, it means, like what I was saying before, the facts support the theory. Okay, and here is going to the land. That's the theory you will inherit. That's the theory. And the facts don't support it. That's a fun. Okay. The earth doesn't support you. The earth doesn't give you sustenance to make it reality. It doesn't give you matter.

Speaker 2:          00:24:11       Yeah. It gives you at that in Egypt, and I mean his wife is separate essentially because he lies about her. But then it's so strange because. So he tells the federal and the Pharaohs man that his wife is actually a sister. That's Sarah. Sarah, is that how you say that changes? The name is actually his sister and that's to protect them and so the Pharaoh takes sariah and then it can isolate something. You bet there is

Speaker 3:          00:24:43       meaning to all of those things. There's a meaning to it. Okay, so the idea is that when facts, facts, support the theory, okay? When, when the flesh supports the identity or the matters, heaven. Earth supports having things are square. Okay? That's just the traditional way of understanding. That basically means that what you see is what you get. Okay? It's, it's truth. Things are true. That's the definition of meaning matches fact. It's true when pragmatic definition. Yeah. When, when the other side happens, then things are around there. They're cyclical. Okay. And it's. It's. It's essentially, it's time. It's space and time. That's what it is. Okay? One of them. You're falling into time. Things are not square. That means things do not. The meaning doesn't mask the fact. That's why it's all lies. Okay? When they go into exile, it's all about lies and it's all about dreaming, okay? Because they are in that domain. They're in a domain where meaning in fact doesn't match. So everything happens through lies and deception and even the whole idea of saying, my wife is my sister, but that represents a cyclical paradox that's supposed to happen. Well, why cyclical? Um, you're a parent has a son and a daughter and they get married.

Speaker 3:          00:26:21       It's like a regression. Okay? It's like you're, you're producing different things and then you're joining them back together and that's supposed to join back together because when you joined them back together, it's like you're going, you're regressing. When you, when you build something, you start from principal and you develop it. Okay? You make specializations. That principle, when you start to mix them up again, it's like a regression. You're, you're going back to something more primitive than before.

Speaker 2:          00:26:55       How do you see that in relationship to Abraham's insistence that surgery, his, his, his, his sister. Sister. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:27:04       Because you're not supposed to marry your sister. And I'm not saying that as a moralistic thing even though it becomes one, but the reason you shouldn't marry your sister is because you're undoing the work. The specializations is that your, your, your father or your mother Ha have created. It's like going back, it's like regressing, so like if you married your father or your mother or depending, you're going back, it's a cycle. You're not speaking to that because it's like your annihilating something that was specified. Hey look, I'll give you an example of like an imagery of that that's pretty important in, in, in the story of the flood, there are traditions that the giants created. Hybrids. Okay. Yep. One of the things that giants like to do is create hybrids. They are hybrids themselves, but they created hybrids. They took the species and they confuse them back into who knows what. Okay, and that's very significant because it actually means that you are regressing in it confused manner. Okay. That there's a connection between the flood and what I just said, making hybrids and causing the flood. It's actually considered one in the same thing.

Speaker 3:          00:28:29       Does that make sense? It makes some sense. Yeah. It's about returning to confusion. Yep. Look, I'll say it this way. Adam named the animals had an adam named the animals. God asked Adam to names and it. It's his first job in the universe, so he's asking him to specify different things that are all, all have the same source, the same as you differentiate. That's the idea of incarnating a principle into practice yet differentiated. Okay? Now, if you reverse that process, you're going back to a more primitive level. You're going back to the flood because the flood is the most primitive thing in, in that cosmology, right? It starts with a flooded world. That means everything's in confusion. So what'd you have to do is specify things out, but if you go back, does that make sense?

Speaker 2:          00:29:26       So let, let me, let me reformulate that and tell you what popped into mind. Alright? So God gives Abraham the word and then Abraham follows it and God manifests himself more completely to Abraham. And then what happens? Abraham is twofold. He ends up in a barren land, so nature rebels, and he also ends up in a tyranny, right? Because he is not only, not only does the land not produced, so it's in a famine, but Egypt eventually. Egypt is generally speaking, assemble for for tyranny throughout the initial parts of the Old Testament. I mean you see that with the Pharaoh, for example, and the symbolism in the mosaic story of, of the, of Egypt always being associated with stone instead of water, and so you could say that God gives Abraham the command to move forward, but he has to contend with the intransigent sea of nature which rejects him because there was a famine and then he becomes subjugate some. It becomes subject to both tyranny and deceit,

Speaker 3:          00:30:31       and so, okay, c, two, c, any are a look. Okay, I'll say it this way. It's more about the tyranny, okay? But the thing is, when you're not in charge, I mean there's a tyranny. That's it. When you're you or whoever you identify with is not in charge, you're a slave to some other principle, right? You're embodying some other wheel that's not you. I mean, that's tyranny, right? So, right. In that sense, it's really directly relate to the idea of tyranny. You serving strangers,

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       right?

Speaker 3:          00:31:08       It says it all.

Speaker 2:          00:31:10       So motivates. That also motivates Abraham's deception, right? Because he's terrified that the strangers that he's serving will kill him.

Speaker 3:          00:31:18       Yeah. For his wife,

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       for his wife, and that's why he likes it. He's afraid that he's going to be treated very badly.

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       Yeah. Because he doesn't want strangers to have his wife. His wife is like the earth. His wife is how he will incarnate, can self or express itself in the world. He's like the seed and the wife is like the, the, the earth, something like that. So she's the. She is like his earth. It's like a major version of heaven and earth. The male is, is, is, is the heaven and the female is the earth. In that case, that's the whole idea. He's not in charge of facts anymore. That includes his wife, that ingredients. So he doesn't want other men, other principals to control his wife. Right. Does that make sense?

Speaker 2:          00:32:12       Yes. Well, it also, it also seems to me that because he's, the land isn't fruitful for him and because he's serving strangers in a strange land, he's also correct to be afraid for the loss of his wife.

Speaker 3:          00:32:28       Yeah. And how does he get out of it? By being deceitful, because he's in the cycle is in that. I mean are you supposed to be truthful? Your adversary usually know, especially when your editor series hostile and if you're an enemy territory, your morality changes because all of a sudden it's not about being truthful, it's about surviving. It's about. It's like the most primitive existence there is. The more primitive states of existence are more about the seat than about truth. It's an advance. It's an advanced state to talk about truth. It's when we all agree, we all agree on at least something, but before that it's every man or woman for him or herself. It's all about the seat. It's all about survival.

Speaker 2:          00:33:19       Okay? Okay, so now. Now the next thing that happens essentially is that the pharaoh gets played and he's wondering why. So because. So the story indicates that the Pharaoh has broken some natural law, let's say, or some divine law and things go very badly for him. And then he discovers, I don't remember how he discovers that he's taken.

Speaker 3:          00:33:46       I think it, it doesn't say how it's right.

Speaker 2:          00:33:50       And, and he discovers that he's taken Sarah, but Sarah is Abraham's wife. And so then the pharaoh gives Abraham all sorts of goods and sends him on his way. Okay. So that's also quite confusing. So Abraham is rewarded for his decision.

Speaker 3:          00:34:07       Ill ill gotten goods. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       Right. It'll go. Good. That's part of her story is interesting because you also see, I think in not account, some of the complexity that's embedded in the old testament accounts is that it's not a simple morality tale. It by any stretch of the imagination. You especially see that in the Abrahamic accounts because it's Jacob who who so deceitful with Esol. I mean, Nissan comes off. I mean he's, he's gone. He's gone out unconscious. Esau. Yeah. He gives things up too easily. He's too easily deceived and he's a bit primitive. I guess he's a bit too primitive in a bit too naive, something like that. But Jacob plays and Rachel place some really nasty tricks on him and yet they come out ahead. Yeah. And so that's also a very difficult thing to contend with.

Speaker 3:          00:35:02       Well, there's, there's this idea, at least in, in, in traditional interpretation, there's this idea that in Esol is actually supposed to be that the key it should be the only reason he isn't is because there's something wrong. That's pretty much describe the whole Bible in its entirety. The there's, there's the theory and the fact the fact is supposed to be king. Okay. Do you know what I mean by that? Like at matter is king it, that's what it's supposed to be, but it's not. And the whole, all the stories are about redeeming. Redeeming that problem, taking care of that problem. It's like the facts don't match the theory. We have to redeem the facts. That's, that's pretty much all the stories in the Bible are about that and that's pretty much what lock represents in the story of Abraham as well. Okay. You represents a material reality. He represents facts, but there's something wrong with it.

Speaker 2:          00:36:08       Let's go into the large story now. So. Okay, so Abraham leaves and I believe he leaves with lot and, and lot also becomes quite wealthy and they go back to where Abraham had built the altar initially, but lot large men and Abraham's men start to fight so they decide they're going to separate and they basically do that somewhat arbitrarily could, could have gone either way, but a lot ends up going to sort them.

Speaker 3:          00:36:42       Well actually there is something you should be aware of. Well that's the thing. A lot of the stories in the Bible are based on a really ancient way of thinking that we don't really following you more. But I mean in the Bible there is a reason why, um, the directions of the travels that they're not just random, like Egypt represents the earth. And um, what's the name of the city? What's the name of the place of both her and I think the place where he goes to meet. I'm leaving. Uh, it's in the north. Okay. I, I'm not, I'm not sure I remember the name of this. See, I think it's Iran that represents heaven. Okay. And there's a reason. It's not just arbitrary, it's because Egypt is south and south is going down.

Speaker 2:          00:37:33       Right. We still say that when, when, when you say that someone's gone south, we say that means that they've gone to seed or they've gone down.

Speaker 3:          00:37:40       Yeah. So, so in the Bible, and especially in Genesis, especially in finances, um, the south represents the earth and the north represents that happens. Okay. And like I said, it's not arbitrary it, it corresponds to the geography of the region. One of them goes uphill and the other one goes downhill. And the north there's mountains, snowy mountains. In the south there's a Egypt which is like the low, a low place and yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       Right. So north literally is up.

Speaker 3:          00:38:07       Yeah. It's not a metaphor. Yeah. Literally is close going, getting closer to heaven and the other one going into the earth. So when they go and excited to Egypt there, it's actually means they're going into the earth. It's like a descent into the earth. So it's like death. It's death and they say it a few times in the book of Genesis it talk about your, it's like dying. Going it, going to Egypt is like a death.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       Okay, so then now. So then we moved to the story of the strangers. Right. Weight, not who you were going to say, why the separation of the land with lot and uh, and Abraham. Yes. Right. The idea is that lot takes the, the, the south, right. And then Abraham.

Speaker 3:          00:38:59       Yeah. That was the whole point of that. Yeah, a lot as a reason why he takes the south. It's the lowest place on Earth Sodom and Gomorrah that, that place. It's the lowest place. Okay. So literally the lowest place on earth, right? I'm not sure about. I know. I don't know. I think that region actually is the lowest place on earth, but in the story that that's how, that's what it means. It means it's the lowest plates.

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       So it's a place that's farthest away from heaven. Yeah, it's the, it's the idea that Milton develops with regards to Satan when he's thrown from heaven because the hell that Satan inhabits is the furthest possible away from heaven. That's how it's defined essentially.

Speaker 1:          00:39:43       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:39:44       Yeah. It's like a journey into the earth. It's, it's the same as, um, it needs the same thing as, as falling asleep, exiled and sleep are the same in the Bible. Sleep is, is a form of exile. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       So, so the next thing that happens is that we get the first warning about Sodom and Gomorrah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:40:08       That's just a very brief sentence. It's like a foreshadowing. And then the next thing that happens is that there's an episode where there is a war among kings and the kings, if I remember correctly, it's the King of Sodom takes a lot and Abraham has to go rescue him.

Speaker 3:          00:40:32       Actually, I think it's the other way around. I think it's things from the north. They come down and uh, take Sodom and Gomorrah and lot is part of that. And so is the king. The King of Sodom and Gomorrah. They have to flee.

Speaker 2:          00:40:50       That's what I remember. Do they flee with, do they flee with lot?

Speaker 3:          00:40:54       No. Law is taken by these chains from the north and I'm the King of Sodom. I think hides or something like that. Fleece

Speaker 2:          00:41:05       the king, the King of Sodom at the end gives gifts to Abraham to thank him that he rescued. Yes, that's right. So what happens is that, yeah, it says in and it came to pass in the days of Amarillo, Elle, king of Shinar, et Cetera, that these made war with Barbara, King of Sodom and with Burger King of Gomorrah, et Cetera, and these were all joined together in the veil of cinnamon, which is in the old seat, which is the salt seat, so I presume that would be the Dead Sea and that would be the low point that you're describing is the dead seat. That's pretty interesting. And the veil of cinema was full of slime pits and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there, and they took away all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and older victuals, and they took lot Abram's brother's son who dealt in, dwelt in Sodom and his goods and departed. So

Speaker 4:          00:41:58       you can really see this whole geography that matthew is talking about. When they say that Sodom and Gomorrah, they had to flee and fall into pits. It's almost like they're laying it out for us that they had to almost kind of go even further down into the earth, the hide from these, these, uh, these invaders of the north that are coming to take their land.

Speaker 2:          00:42:16       So. Okay. So Abraham goes and rescues lot and he does not successfully. And the Ndaa also, there's, there's kings, but he. Did he freeze as far as I can tell? Yeah, probably. Then the kings wanted to reward him and Abraham says to the King of Sodom and he doesn't want any reward. And the reason he doesn't want any reward except for what is men have equal. He doesn't want any reward because I will not take anything that is thein lest thou should say I have made Abraham rich save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of men which went with me and it looks. See God has already promised Abraham everything in some sense. And it looks like he doesn't want to take anything at Abraham. Doesn't want to take anything from anyone else because what would it do? Would it interfere with the purity of his accomplishments? Something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:43:20       Yeah. Well, I, I don't know for certain because, um, that's just a line I guess, but in the, in the story, I mean, it's not that much of a big part of the story, but the way I see it is I think he says, I don't want to take even this shoe lash to latch for me. Okay. So there's a reason why he says that because the shoe is the lowest part is the lowest clothing, right? It's on the feet. So it's all related to the idea that the earth needs to be redeemed. Need, needs to be rectified. And it in that situation, it's not like he's not allowed to accept it. It's the same thing is not eating the forbidden fruit. There are things in the world that are poisonous to humans. We can't eat them because they don't agree with, are our patterns, our, our, our, our mind. So if you eat poison, you go into that place where things don't agree, your mind and your body don't agree. I mean, if you, if you, if you take, if you drink alcohol, um, that takes you into the where your mind and your body don't agree. The theory doesn't match the fact and then you go into that whole confusion.

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       Yes. Those, could it be that when, when, um, he doesn't, he doesn't want to take from Sodom because Sodom is already what we know saw them to be. I mean, it already represents kind of the, the land that can't hold and will be burned off.

Speaker 3:          00:44:54       Yeah. It's something he can, he can integrate something. It's like, that's why I said the forbidden fruit. You don't want to eat. You don't want to accept mattered that you can't handle, that you can integrate. So there's something in that place that he doesn't know how to deal with, what to do with it and he doesn't want his riches to come from that place.

Speaker 2:          00:45:17       He doesn't write, he doesn't want his riches to come from that place because it would compromise them

Speaker 3:          00:45:22       because he doesn't know how to deal with it yet. Maybe someday he will. That's right. That's the whole idea. And actually, here's an interpretation, lot represents that place that will one day be redeemed. Okay? The reason why they talk about lots so much in the story of Abraham is because he represents King David. He is the ancestor of the nation that will give rise to King David. Okay? It's like a secondary story within the story, but it's like a. it's meant to be interpreted in terms of a future redemption of that place that he can handle, that Abraham couldn't handle at that time. And that place will be redeemed. I'm giving you a lot of tradition here, but this is what I would. I would, I've learned. It's King David. Okay. It's the future king.

Speaker 2:          00:46:20       Okay. So the whole story of luck is about King David. Well, and of course Lord is Abraham's descendants as well because he's his nephew. Yeah. So Abraham's nephew descends into the lowest place essentially.

Speaker 3:          00:46:34       Yeah. Well, look it, the story that starts out pretty clear, it starts out there's three sons to a tear up. One of them is harass. The other one's not horror. And the other one's Abraham. Okay? Heroin dies. That's how the story starts. That's like the beginning of this story is Aaron dies and he has a son called lot. See, that's what I was it. The idea is it's the same idea. The son of this heroin, he represents death. He represents the thing we can't handle. You represents the material facts that we can explain with the, with our theories or with our identity is the thing we is the matter. We can't handle it. And that's why in the story starts with he dies the father of lot dice. It a

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       lot represents some fact that we cannot correctly, okay

Speaker 4:          00:47:35       integrate into our universe. This could be interpreted in so many different levels. But um, that's basically what it is. I don't know if that makes sense, but the idea the. I mean, the idea is that I think we need to see it. The idea is that an orphan or a widow, that's what they always represent. They represent something that have lost their, their principle that unifies them. They're here. They're kind of disconnected from the hierarchy of the family. So, so, so a lot losing is the fact that losing his father died me, that he loses the thing that gives him identity and so he's like this, he's like a, a, a piece of birth that is lost attachment or last meeting or.

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       Well, that, that reminds me of what happens to know his son

Speaker 1:          00:48:24       who

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       sees him naked. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And, and because, because to see, it seems to me, I'm going to talk about this a little bit tonight, that to see noah gets drunk and then which, which son is that have pam ham. Yeah. I'm really first sees him but doesn't respond properly. The other sons, when they see no one naked, they cover him up and they don't look. And so it's like they're not exposing their fathers weakness. His mortality is his, his insufficiency, right? They didn't retain respect, but ham doesn't do that.

Speaker 4:          00:49:07       But there's also more what matthew was talking about before they're in that story. There's two things that are implied of what matthew was talking about before, this idea of wine that brings you into this cycle where causality ceases to be a direct. And then what happened to the faction? Yeah. Yeah. And the fact that he sees his father naked, he discovers his nakedness is also a kind of suggestion of incest as well. The same type, the same type of, of, of inappropriate causality that you see in the story of the two, of, uh, of uh, Abraham's sister marrying his sister, luck with his two daughters, two daughters. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:49:47       So it's transgression. It gets some funding. Transgression against some fundamental boundary.

Speaker 4:          00:49:53       Yeah. Against the, the hierarchical relationship. And have a family, right? Yeah. You're not supposed to make loops. It's a tree. You're not supposed to make loops in a tree. So you can say like that. It's really simple and that's supposed to regress and I supposed to. You produce things, you're not supposed to turn back on yourself. You're not supposed to go back.

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       So, so maybe that's why lot's wife has turned into a pillar of salt

Speaker 4:          00:50:23       because she lives back, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It has to do it. Looking back to the mental

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       and, and, uh, and, and pines for something that it was terrible. It shouldn't have been. And so, and she's commanded not to look back once you, once you escape from that catastrophe, you don't get to be nostalgic for it. And the same thing happens in the story of Moses because what happens to the Israelites when they were out in the desert is they start to become nostalgic for Egypt, for the tyranny. Right. And that's also, I think when God starts to send poisonous snakes among them, because right though, don't they, they, they start to pine for Egypt and complain about Moses and then they start to worship other idols. So that's part of that confusion that you were talking about. And then God gets irritated and throws a bunch of poisonous snakes in there to give them a good chomping.

Speaker 3:          00:51:12       Yep. So that's the snakes come as a result of them wanting to go back.

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       Yeah. Yeah. Well, right. That makes perfect sense. So, and you see that nostalgia for tyranny. You know, you see that the Soviet Union in Russia right now with regards to stolen. And so the question, the question is, I think this is one of the things that I'm the guy who wrote the disappearance of God mentioned this. Do you want to be well fed as a slave or hungry and freedom, something like that. And the choice. Well, fed as a slave is not a good choice. Yeah. So, okay, now. So when Jonathan, you and I talked a fair bit about the story of Abraham and the strangers before. So I'm. So God decides to reward Abraham and he tells him that just like he told him before, but he repeats it, that he's going to be the founder of a nation and he, and he tells them that Sarah is going to bear a child. And Sarah of course is not. Doesn't believe that. Let's see. Let me, let me just find this here. Yeah. Yes. Okay. So that's what happens is, is that God's God, God's word comes into Abraham in a vision. So what's the word again? Saying that his reward will be great and that he's going to be the father of nations, but he doesn't have any children. And so isn't that when he takes

Speaker 2:          00:53:00       you take Sarah's servant, Hagar? Yeah. And, and that gives rise to Ishmael. And it wasn't until later that Sarah is informed that she's sorry that he went fancy your question. She wants one.

Speaker 3:          00:53:19       Answer your question. I'd be curious to know what she has found you.

Speaker 2:          00:53:27       She closed her down. Yeah, I know. It was pretty strange. Intermission there. So. Okay. So, so Abraham has to take kind of a detour in order to have a child and he lays with Hagar and Hagar, uh, we don't know much about her, but she gets he right away and starts to despise Sarah. And Sarah actually beats her as far as I can tell. It says Sarah delk hardly with her and then Hagar fleets. And she ends up by A. Well, we're an angel. Appears to her. And uh, the angel tells her that her son, her child is going to be the father of the nation as well. So, so the first question might be, why is it that Abraham, at this point in the story, why is it necessary for the story that Abraham takes a detour and has a child with Hagar? What do you think that signifies?

Speaker 3:          00:54:36       It's, it's, it's always the same problem in the Bible. It's always, it starts with confusion and it has to develop towards something that is clear. So you're saying that yourself, when you say detour? Yeah, it's a detour. Exactly. That's exactly what it is. It's a detour.

Speaker 2:          00:54:59       Great.

Speaker 3:          00:55:00       That's not necessary, but it happens. Does that make sense? Well, D two is teach. Detours are the doors are things that are not necessary, but at the end

Speaker 4:          00:55:11       there's something also in that detour, the fact that he gives birth to Ishmael, which has to do with this, this turning because God kind of promises that Ishmael is going to come back and he's going to be a big problem for you. He's going to be a father of a great nation, but he's going to be a big problem for you later. Like it's going to be. There's going to be fighting between between your sons basically.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       Yeah. There's that idea. Yeah, of course. I don't know if it's in that story, but

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       yeah. Well, it seems to be associated with an idea that you might take about as success of approximation to an ideal. No. So one of the things that that I've conceptualized sort of visually is, and this is associated with the idea of Jupiter wishing on a star. It was so what's your who does when he wants to facilitate the transformation of Nokia was lifted his eyes up to the highest thing that he can conceive of and Orient Yourself with that. But the thing is is that as you move through life, let's say you're oriented by the highest thing you can conceive of, but as you move towards it, you transform and then and your conceptualization of what's the highest shifts as you transform. So you're aiming at the highest thing but, but your perhaps your ability to conceptualize what's the highest thing develops as you move towards it. And so what that means in practice is that you do take detours because you aim at something, but you're aim is off and you move towards it and then you get to a point where you can correct your aim. And so it's not like you've made a mistake. Exactly. It's, you're farther ahead than you were and you've corrected your aim, but your aim wasn't. You weren't aiming at exactly the right thing to begin with.

Speaker 3:          00:56:53       Yeah. And so

Speaker 2:          00:56:56       yeah, go ahead. Well, maybe that's what's happening to Abraham is that, you know, you could almost say, I don't know if Ishmael is a practice run, something like that. So. All right, so then you were going to, you matthew, you were to say something about that.

Speaker 3:          00:57:15       Oh yeah, I was going to say that

Speaker 3:          00:57:19       exiled in the Bible. Um, there's always a reason for it, but it's not necessarily a logical reason. It's, it's, it's just like what you described. You think, you know, something, you think you'd know what you're aiming at. You think you know what you want, you think you know what you're doing. Something happens that you didn't plan. That doesn't look like it's part of what you were aiming. It makes you take a detour. Well, this, this site is all about detours. It's all about turning around. You don't know where you're going. You're lost. So, but in the end it, it brings about something that maybe you weren't even aiming at in the, in the, in the first place. What might be better than what you were in yet in the first place. So it's not all bad. So I think that's the idea. The idea of the whole idea of exile is that there it renews your plans,

Speaker 2:          00:58:15       right? If you don't die,

Speaker 3:          00:58:18       yeah. If you don't die, yeah. Even if you do die, it renews your planning. Okay, so now.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       Sure. Now the next thing that happens is that the strangers come to visit Abraham and he treats them hospitably and so now we might say that that's an indication of his increasing alignment with the good. Maybe that's one way of thinking about it because he does right by the stranger and one of the consequences of that is that the angels, I guess we find out that there are angels. Tell him that Sarah is going to give birth to someone and Abraham finds that very difficult to believe. It's Sarah finds it so difficult to believe that she actually laughs about it. She overhears it, she laughs about it, but, but he, he has the strangers, he feeds them. He has them wash their feet, if I remember correctly. And um, anyways, he treats them hospitably at well and there's a blessing as a consequence of that. And that's something we talked about a fair bit, Jonathan when we were talking about the things that doesn't fit in categories. Yeah. The Stranger. Yeah. Which is that invitation to chaos as well that you were talking about matthew, because the stranger is while the thing that you can be subjugated to, but also something that will bring something new and potentially disruptive but also potentially beneficial. And so then the idea there is whether or not the stranger is disruptive or beneficial depends to a large degree on how you treat the stranger.

Speaker 2:          00:59:58       And that strikes me as very, very possible. I mean, that's the one thing that that's one of the things that has really entered my imagination as a clinician. Now, if you're approached by someone who's very in chaos, the consequence of that is very dependent on how you interact with them because it can go any way and they're not really in control because there are so chaotic and so if you're careful and awake, you can keep things moving in the proper direction and maybe even benefit from it and that's Kinda like the idea of walking with God because one of the reasons that no one gets through the flood is because he is oriented properly. He's walking with God and so you could say that exile can. It's something like exile can expand you. If you stay properly oriented while you're in exile,

Speaker 3:          01:00:56       it could fit. It can fix your mistakes. That's part of it. It cleans you. It renews you because you make mistakes and they become part of you and if you're stuck with your mistakes, you're rigid about your own estates. You need something outer to something that you don't know, something that you don't understand to clean your mistakes away. Yeah. Well that's like

Speaker 2:          01:01:17       the Golden Dragon Horse with the Virgin, the Dragon Horts, right? It's, it's, it's the dragon represents that chaotic would say Exxon state that drag the gold and the and the virgin both represent that which can be assimilated as a consequence of being in that situation. The funny thing is, is in the hero myths going into exile on purpose works way better than going into exile accidentally. So that's an interesting thing. So. Okay. Okay, so

Speaker 3:          01:01:49       can I say something about the part you were describing that the whole story of Abraham, if you look at the big picture, it's really about progressive, a progressive Lee knowing something. So it started with just the voice of God. Go here. It doesn't mean much goes there. Then it becomes a little more precise. I will give you this land. So now it's more specific, and then as the further he goes, the more it becomes explicit what's going to. So I'll give you a sudden when I don't know, someday it doesn't say later on it becomes more and more explicit, gay, and he says like in the party we were talking about, he says, three men come. These are angels as, as it becomes clear later. So this is God, right? God sending his message in a clear manner and it's more specific. Then before he says, this time next year you will have it. Sound good.

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       So okay. So a couple of things about that. So one of the things that see, one of the ways that I've conceptualized the relationship between the Old Testament and the new testament and I, this is kind of a classic Christian conceptualization, I think. And it's also, it's also analogous to what happens to Moses because Moses doesn't get to the promised land. So there's this idea, Christian idea that the reason that Moses can't get to the promised land is because he only represents the law now. But then I thought about that. I thought, well, one of the, I've got to say about four stories at the same time here at him to get the parallelism right. So the first is, it's not so easy to speak the truth, but it's fairly easy to stop light and so as you stop lying, you get better. You get to approximate speaking the truth, but the way you start isn't by speaking the truth.

Speaker 2:          01:03:43       The way you start is by stopping light and then a lot of the rules in the Old Testament or prohibitions. Here's a bunch of things you shouldn't do that you might be inclined to do. And so the idea there would be if you stopped doing all the things you know you shouldn't do, then you can. Your head clears up, but now so you can start to see the things that you should do. And so then in the Abrahamic story, maybe it's something like this, you said you implied matthew, that Abraham originally follow something like a vague and ill defined whim, but he has enough faith to move forward despite the fact that it's vague and ill defined. And then as a consequence of moving forward, it becomes more and more concretized and and differentiated and clear. Okay, that's right man, because that's, you know, it's funny because the future authoring program we've developed sort of predicated on that idea. The first thing you do is wander around in a kind of confused days, trying to find a direction of orientation and then you clarify that. And partly you do that by continuing to think about it, but you also clarified by acting on it. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:04:49       Yep. And the idea that these three men that come visit him, um, there's a reason why there's three. Okay. It's because it, it's, it's trying to express the idea that it's more expressed, it's more explicit. It's not just the seed anymore, it's like, it's like a branch. Okay, you got it. Okay. You got something that looks like a branch. It's branching out into a more concrete thing and at first it's just a voice. Then it's a vision that it's actual people.

Speaker 2:          01:05:23       Okay. Okay. So here's another idea. So let's say if you're beginning to develop morality, you, you behave so that the people who share your morality can get along with you. That means you follow the rules, but if you're dealing with strangers, it's a different issue because they aren't part of your morality and so the question then is how do you act properly when you're not in the domain of your morality, and I always thought about that as a matter moral domain and it seems to me that it's the domain that Christ occupies because he's. He's like the mediator between morality's. He's in no man's land and is the mediator between moralities and if you're. If you're, if you've oriented yourself properly, then you even know how to act with. There aren't any rules and that's why Abraham can act properly in relationship to the strangers. He's awake enough so that when the strangers show up, shows up, he can pay attention to the way they're acting and could act spontaneously as a consequence of paying attention and things go well and so the strangers aren't hostile. They don't kill them, they don't take his wife. They don't do any of the terrible things that strangers could do and he gets a blessing as a consequence of it. Does that seem reasonable?

Speaker 3:          01:06:46       It is, but we have to understand that these strangers

Speaker 2:          01:06:51       are

Speaker 3:          01:06:53       come from heaven in the sense that they are bringing a message. They're not just random strangers right there sent, but maybe he would have acted the same way with a stranger that wasn't sent and that's the whole point. He doesn't know. He acts in a way that allows for that. For the one that sent it can be received.

Speaker 2:          01:07:13       Okay, so that's very interesting too because one of the things that I think you see happening as a consequence of the transition from the Old Testament, the new testament is that part of Christ's message is to act in exactly that way, is to act in a manner that allows for the possibility of the emergence of the good. That's something like that. Something like what would you describe it as a description of the necessity of faith and you know like let's say you stretch out your hand to someone in trust. You shouldn't be naive, but it's a precondition for good things happening. Like if you're distrustful and you have every reason to be because people are full of snakes. If you're distrustful, you've, you foreclose the opportunity for cooperative progress instantly, you might protect yourself against being bitten now in that so, so there is a dramatic relationship between the manner in which you open yourself up to the world and the way the world treats you, and one of the things that seems to be really emphasized, it's more implicit in the Old Testament, more explicit. The New Testament is that the more you open yourself up to the possibility that good things will happen and that's partly by accepting your vulnerability. As far as I can tell, the higher the probability is that good things will in fact happen.

Speaker 1:          01:08:30       Alright.

Speaker 4:          01:08:33       Yeah, I mean I would definitely say that in the story of Abraham, the like we were kind of flirting around that idea before, is that the reason why he was able to receive them as these angel, that they were able to manifest themselves as these angels was because he was willing to host them properly. He, he like, it's as if he had his family just like Sarah, like Sarah is his, is he was the right ground for that manifestation at that time. Right,

Speaker 2:          01:09:00       well you say that they wouldn't have been angels if he wouldn't have treated them properly.

Speaker 3:          01:09:05       Well, it might've been. It might've done. They might have done what they did in Sodom and Gomorrah. That's the whole point. That's the whole point. Okay, so now I want to switch. I want to flip ahead.

Speaker 2:          01:09:14       This is really what this is. I think of all the things I wanted to discuss with you guys, I think this is the one that's most crucial because.

Speaker 2:          01:09:25       Okay, so now we're in, let's say we're in of with the, with the angels and we're, we're in the part of the story where the townspeople of Sodom gather around the house and they tell lot and unless he throws out the strangers so that they can be raped. Well, the, this, the townspeople demand that and then um, lot offers them his daughters, which seems like a hell of a thing to do. It's like the sacrifice of Isaac to some degree. That's what it looks like to me because he's willing to sacrifice his daughters to protect the strangers now. Okay, so that's morally, let's call that a morally ambiguous element of the story, but then the townspeople reject that and they, they tell, they basically tell him that he has no right or power to bargain and that not only are they going to take his daughters, but they're also going to take the strangers so it doesn't work, but you know, to a, to modern sensibility, the offering of his daughters is a reprehensible thing, but it seems to be it in the context of the story. It's an indication of how hard lot is trying to treat the strangers properly in a place where that's essentially impossible.

Speaker 3:          01:10:37       Yeah. That's the whole point of that story. That place is impossible. That's the whole point. I think what he just said, okay. There's no way out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:10:49       Right. Leonard Cohen said something about that. He said there's. You had a line that I remember quite well. You said there's no decent place to stand in the massacre and what that seems to mean is that something. It's something like you can get into a place where it's made of such a compound of errors and deceit and catastrophe that no matter which way you turn, there is no good. No, I've seen people like that in my clinical practice. There's, there's no good, there's no good alternative. Everything is sin. That's. That's a good way of, no matter which way you shoot your, you're not going to hit the mark because you're not somewhere where the market can be hit. Okay. Now I've been trying to think about the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in relationship to modern sexual confusion,

Speaker 2:          01:11:37       so this is what I see happening on the social justice front, let's say on the one hand since the 19 sixties and probably as a consequence of the birth control pill, but other factors as well. There's been tremendous stress placed on sexual liberation and so there's this idea that I think is associated in large part right now with the radical left of total sexual freedom, but at the same time there's increasing emphasis from exactly the same sources on restricting sexual interactions. So you see this in the campuses, for example, where increasingly particularly heterosexual contact is regulated by a doctrine that says you have to get spoken permission for every move in the mating process and so you see, and I know I'm not expressing myself very well, but there seems to be in our current culture there seems to be massive sexual confusion. It's, it's some weird combination of extreme libertarianism and extreme authoritarian attitudes towards sexuality and and obviously in the story of Sodom, part of what's happening happening and is that sex impulsive? Sexual gratification trumps everything. It's something like that. I mean I know there's more to what's going on inside them than that, but there's certainly that and so. Well, I'm trying to figure out what to say about that tonight because there's a. there's a lesson in there. The lesson is something like,

Speaker 2:          01:13:11       don't let sexuality, don't let impulsive sexuality get the upper hand. It's something like that or all hell will break loose. Which I actually happen to agree with because one of the things that we haven't been able to talk about in our culture I think is. Let's take the idea of the phenomena of aids aids mutated to take advantage of promiscuous sexuality and that's just nothing you never hear that publicized. You know, people had associated aids with homosexuality and there was a reason for that because it's much more easily transmitted as a consequence of homosexual sex than heterosexual sex because the anus is a much more delicate physiological structure. It's not as robust and it can be much more easily damaged and and and with with disease resulting as a consequence, but it isn't only the manner of sexual action, that's the issue. It's also the fact that promiscuity provided the evolutionary platform for the AIDS virus to mutate into a very, into the form that it took and it was only through the school, by the skin of our teeth that we escaped a totalizing plague. No had that emerged a hundred years ago, God only knows how many people would have died. It AIDS was unbelievably fatal. So I know that's a mishmash of ideas and I'm not exactly sure how to see my way clear through it, but there is a clear warning in that story about about something about something to do with, with, with sexual inequity,

Speaker 3:          01:14:44       but in the Bible that sexuality has to two Poles that define it and it's pretty clear. One, one side is reproduction and the other side is with let's say recreation. Okay. So those are the two bowls of sexuality in a normal work. So it's not just for reproduction and it's not just for recreation. It's both. Right. That was the idea. I mean it's a natural idea. Now if you. If there's a balance there that should be had. If you lose this balance and it becomes just about reproduction, that's a problem. And if it becomes just about recreation, that's another problem. Yup. Okay. It's not that complicated really, but it's so politically incorrect to talk about these things even though they're obvious, nobody dares to talk about it.

Speaker 2:          01:15:38       The thing is is that the most difficult things to talk about are the things that are obvious because when they're obvious you don't have to talk about them and so then when people start to question the obvious, you don't know what to say. Yeah. It's like, so for example, we would. I'm thinking about the slut walks, you know, and so women go out and they dress very provocatively and they go out and manifest their right to be as provocative as they possibly can be without being interfered with. And I have some sympathy for that perspective because it seems to me appropriate for women to be. The final arbiter is in sexual contact, but on the other hand, it also, it's that whole exercise is blind to the fact that clothing, for example, has communicative intent

Speaker 1:          01:16:25       and that

Speaker 2:          01:16:28       people broadcast their invitation to sexual congress in a million ways. Subtle and not so subtle. And you can't just say, I have the right to broadcast myself in any manner possible and be completely, um, can, can, can be worked completely immune from the consequences. There's something wrong with that. And with regards to basic sexual morality, no, I've read things about like slut shaming is that the more radical feminist types, for example, claim that women shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual behavior in some sense it shouldn't be held against them, how many men they've slept with, etc. But then I think, well, you'd never recommend to someone that they laid down naked on the, on the side of the street with their legs spread and invite anybody who walks by to partake of the opportunity. Everyone would regard that as inappropriate, I think without question. And so what that indicates is that some degree of sexual propriety is Both normative and ethical. And then of course you can start asking yourself about what that degree of social sexual impropriety should be. And It does have something to do with getting the balance between reproduction and recreation. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:17:48       Okay. Well, the, the thing, even in the bible, there's the two aspects. Some stories are about just this aspect in, there are the most strange stories in the bible. For example, the story of I'm tamar is one of those. So, uh, I don't know if you're familiar with that story, but it's tough. It's in the, it's, it's intercut with the story of joseph in Egypt and it's essentially a, it says that judah had children with some woman and I think it's a stranger. It doesn't necessarily say so, but it seems like that's what it is. And then the sons die off. And then there's this woman called tamar and she disguises herself as a prostitute. Great. And she has a kid with judah himself. So all of the symbols are in that story.

Speaker 2:          01:18:48       Elements of his clothing.

Speaker 3:          01:18:50       Yeah. Demonstrate as a, as a bride. Yeah. Essentially

Speaker 2:          01:18:54       wants to indicate later that he's the one who slept with.

Speaker 3:          01:18:57       Yeah. Yeah. So that story is about the necessity, the need for the recreative part of sexuality. It's all about that symbolism. It's all about the seat. It's all about incest. It's all about death. And it's. The idea is it's to raise the dead. Okay. It's not clear in the story, but if you understand, if you understand the imagery, that's what it's about. It's about regressing back to an error that was made. Okay. And raising the dead so, and I don't want to get into it, but it's just the idea that in the bible there's both to the hearse reproduction and there's recreation and the recreation is renewal. There's the renewal sexuality's about renewal too. But that aspect of the symbolism is, is pretty. I don't want to say obscure because it's actually right there if you can see it, but it's strange. I'll say it like that. It's a strange. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:19:58       Okay. So now another element of this might be the fact that in modern identity politics, sexual choice is a canonical identifier. And that also seems to me to be something wrong about that. Like one of the things I've seen happening in toronto, I'm sure it's the same in montreal, is that, and I'm going to do this awkwardly. I'm going to put this awkwardly because I haven't been able to sort through it properly. Um, pride week. Pride day has turned into pride week and that's turned into pride month. And I think that seems to me to be pushing against some kind of limit. Because the first question that I have is like I was reading this book the other day by a friend of mine from ottawa who's a gay conservative and he said he had a lot harder time coming out as a conservative than he had as coming out as gay and he talked about the degree to which homosexuals were persecuted in Canada before say the 19 eighties and it's quite. It makes quite a harsh reading, let's say, and so and so fair enough to the, to the civil rights movement, let's say it, that that has brought homosexuality into the norm or that into the mainstream. Maybe that's one way of thinking about it, but that conversation still has a tremendous amount of development. It's necessary because I don't understand exactly.

Speaker 2:          01:21:32       It isn't obvious to me what integration into the mainstream precisely means because a lot. There's been a lot of talk so far about

Speaker 2:          01:21:41       respecting the rights of gay people, but very little talk about what the accompanying responsibilities might be. That actually it seems to me to be a problem and I mean I. I just had a letter from, from guy gay guy who has been wrestling with this because he's not sure how to be gay and to be ethical at the same time, you know, because he sees part of normative behavior is taking wife and having children and not and can see the value in that, but that's certainly not the direction of his proclivity. And so we wrote, wrote to me asking me what he should do and you know, I don't have an answer for that. I don't know what the answer to that is, but I know that it might be something that would be worth talking about and it's part of this current confusion about sexual identity and sexual pleasure and, and we'll even gender identity for that matter. So. All right, so your idea was, well the balance between recreation and reproduction had gone, was completely absent inside them. It was all recreation. It was all instant gratification and impulse.

Speaker 3:          01:22:49       Yeah. And that's why it's put in the contrast with the abraham bit because it's the same angels. But in that case he says, you'll have a son this time next year. So it's the reproduction part is there, but when he gets to the

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       bottom, it's not there anymore. It's only the recreation part. Okay. So they're, they're, they're meant to be contested. Those two stores actually in the story of abraham, it's pretty clear. He goes, um, I don't know if this will make sense because when the angels come it says, um, he washes their feet and then he feeds them. Okay. That's actually the recreation and reproduction part that not in terms of sexuality, but it's in terms of meaning the renewal, the washing of the feet is the recreation part, their renewal, they're restarting and the feeding is the reproduction part, not in a sexual way, but when you feed something food and he eats it, it integrates, it integrates it correctly. That's like our reproduction of your identity, your, you're staying yourself, you're reproducing yourself. So when you eat food, that's what you're doing. Not, like I said, not in a sexual way, but it has exactly the same. Meaning if you eat something that you can integrate correctly, you're like reproducing your pattern is the correct version of yourself. The other side, the washing is that like is that little flood

Speaker 3:          01:24:23       the fuck so many flood,

Speaker 2:          01:24:25       right? It's an acceptable. It's a controlled one. You're washing the dust off your. The roads dust off your feet. It means that you're. You're passing from one mode of being into another because you're. You're cleaning off the debris of the past. It's something like that and that it's about renewal next year, so you have to see that when, when, when matthew was talking about, yeah, you have recreation, you have to understand that recreation and rest are basically the same thing. ThEn you basically have the same meaning. It's sleeping, resting, recreation are all that bring you into renewal. okay, bye.

Speaker 3:          01:25:02       And dying. Dying. Dying is. It's passing into another state, letting something else have a chance that's quit tying his. I.
