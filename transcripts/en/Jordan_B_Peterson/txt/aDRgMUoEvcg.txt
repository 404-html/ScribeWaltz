Speaker 1:          00:00          I'd like to welcome you all to this important event. I would also like to apologize to those among your friends, relatives, and colleagues who could not be here today as the auditorium sold out in a matter of hours. My name is Joffrey Clarfield. It is my privilege to be the executive director of the speaker, this action group, and I would like to thank founding president, surely an haber and our new president irving. Why store and all the volunteers who've worked so hard to make this event happen. I would also like to thank our partner organization, the Masood Freedom Foundation and the council for Muslims facing tomorrow who are the a joint sponsors of this event. The speakers action group in particular and it's supporting groups is dedicated to the fight against antisemitism and racism. But without freedom of speech there could be no fight against antisemitism or racism for we need freedom of speech to defend our rights and as we will hear today, freedom of speech is most threatened where ironically it should be most tree in the media and the colleges and the universities of this country as well as an other democracies. I would like to introduce the emcee for this afternoon. Faith Goldie from the rebel media, an organization that is at the forefront of the fight for free speech in this country. I'd like her to introduce our two distinguished speakers, professor Jordan Peterson and Dr. Norman doidge faith. Thank you so much for being here today.

Speaker 3:          01:52          been a dishwasher, a gas shockey, a bartender, a short order cook, a beekeeper apply wood mill laborer and a railway line up worker. But today professor Jordan B. Peterson is best known for his work in the academic world. He has published more than 100 scientific papers transforming the modern understanding of personality and revolutionizing this psychology of religion. With his now classic book maps of meaning the architecture of belief as a Harvard professor, he was nominated for the prestigious Levinson teaching prize now at the University of Toronto. He is regarded by students as one of their truly life changing teachers and I think that I speak for a great deal of people in this room and frankly across the country when I say you need to be one of Professor Peterson students to have been enlightened and inspired by that eight pound universe between his ears as well as his bravery.

Speaker 2:          02:49          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:51          Most recently Dr. Peterson became the center of an ongoing national controversy for refusing to abide by the University of attempt to put very specific words into his mouth when they ordered professors comply with the gender pronouns policy, Dr Peterson's vivid descent over language politics and the political agenda behind it has seen him threatened and showed it down by snowflake students and the academic hierarchy alike as a result of his public views on how political correct nate's correctness rather violates freedom of speech and academic freedom. And the west Professor Peterson has become a cultural icon for liberty lovers and a long awaited obstruction to the wayfairs on the long march of the institution's. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Jordan bpt

Speaker 2:          03:36          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          03:52          So about three months ago I sat in my office at night. I wasn't really sleeping very well and because my mind was running and it was running because I had just read some policy documents on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website in relationship to build see 16 and at the same time I had heard that the University of Toronto hr and equity

Speaker 4:          04:24          vice president had decided to make anti unconscious bias training mandatory for her staff, which I find appalling and still find a polling. And I would recommend that if any of you are asked or required to have your unconscious biases adjusted, that you might see some, you might note to yourself that by agreeing to do so, you have agreed that you're guilty and I wouldn't recommend that. Anyways, I was mostly trying to straighten up my thoughts on these issues, you know? And, and that's usually what I do when I speak, you know, you know, because, and I have a good reputation as a speaker and I think there's two reasons for that. And one is I don't ever speak to a group. I always speak to individuals, you know, I'm not speaking to the group, I'm speaking to individual people and I'm not telling you what's right because I don't know what's right.

Speaker 4:          05:22          What I'm trying to do is to formulate my thoughts more clearly. And it's helpful to do that in speech, even in front of an audience because it's a dialogue with an audience. You know, if you watched the individuals, then they, you can tell if they're following you or whether mostly whether they're following you, if they can understand the line of the argumentation. And some of them will be shaking their heads and some of them will be nodding. And you know, some of it will be looking puzzled in which case you have to kind of reformulate. And so, and that's, that's how I, that's how to think, you know, and, and when you're speaking to people, it's okay to tell them what you know, but better to show them how you think. And that means you're going to stumble around like an idiot some of the time because you're trying to grapple with things.

Speaker 4:          06:06          And what I tried to do for my students is to, to model the process of grappling with things. Because that's what you do when you think, and you know, Norman pointed out that you can be right or you can try to get smarter and to be right. Then you convince people that you're right, but to try to get smarter, you find out why you're wrong. And so I decided a long time ago, one of the ways to deal with Maya authoritarian tendencies, let's say, was to make friends with what I don't know instead of what I do know. And that's a whole different way of looking at the world, you know, and it's, it's got its pain because you know, you're always trying to figure out more or less wire an abayas moron. And that's a very long list of, that's a very, you have a very long list of reasons for that.

Speaker 4:          06:55          And then you have to find out why you're wrong. And as a short term mechanism for attaining psychological stability, I wouldn't recommend it. But as a long term process where you're trying to make things work better in the medium to longterm, then it's the only way. But, but you know, it's easy to sacrifice the future for the present, although it's kind of the reverse of the way you should do things. So anyways, I made these videos, pretty amateur videos and you know, the lighting wasn't very good and there's a bunch of things wrong with them and a buck.

Speaker 4:          07:35          One of the things I've been wondering about for the last three months, it's just what, what happened? Like, what's going on here? This is crazy. And, you know, I've been accused of a lot of things, some of which are no doubt true. But you know, I've been accused of being a racist and being a trans fold. But what else? Profiteering and uh, I guess the other one was scaremongering. Yeah, that's the other one. Scaremongering and so of course I'd been wondering if that, if those things are true because it's not like, you know, my heart is as pure as the driven snow hardly and everyone has biases and all of that. So, and I also, well this unfolded had a group of friends who were definitely critics who were watching everything I was doing and you know, letting me know pretty forthrightly when I was being arrogant and when I was, you know, look kind of disheveled and when my arguments were just clear as they could be and you know, and so on.

Speaker 4:          08:35          These were smart people and their comments were very incisive. And then of course I had all the blow back and I was paying attention to it, you know, because well, you should pay attention to such things. And so, and I do pay attention to things. You know, that's the thing. I actually pay attention to things and if I'm embroiled in a controversy, even if it's a like problem in my home, I tried to get to the damn bottom of it. And you know, the bottom of things is not a pretty place to look. And so you know, when you're arguing with someone at home, even someone you love, you'll notice that your argument can get out of hand a pretty quick. So if you're arguing with your wife or your husband, you know, it depends on how volatile you are of course. But you know, you start

Speaker 4:          09:26          arguing about some little thing and then you come to understand pretty quick that it's actually not about that little thing at all. That little thing is associated with, you know, a little bigger thing underneath that. And maybe that's associated with even a bigger thing under that. And you know, soon you're taking each other apart for assuming you've been married for 20 years, for all the stupid things you've done to each other over the last 20 years. And it doesn't have to end there. And how it's not pleasant, it's really hard to bind a conversation so it doesn't go everywhere, you know? So one thing you can do if you're talking to someone about something you disagree with someone you love, you can tell them a bunch of good things about what they've been doing, which you actually believe. And then just say, well, but there's this little problem here. And I just like it adjusted in a minor way. And maybe that'll, you know, we'll sort things out a bit between us and then maybe you don't fall into that stupid pit, which is really easy to fall into. And you know, which certainly can lead to divorce among other things. And so a huge part of the issue always is just exactly what is this about?

Speaker 4:          10:29          Well, I'd been asking myself that question for a long, long time because I'd been interested in authoritarian conflict and atrocity and totalitarianism for way longer than anyone with any sanity should ever be interested in it. And you know, and then this, and then this all came up and I thought, okay, okay, okay. It's like, all right, well, you know, am I a bigot and a transformed? Well, I probably have my biases because people tend to have in group biases, you know, and that's associated by the way with compassion. Just so you know it because one of the things compassion does is make you much, strongly, much more strongly bound to your ingroup. You know, it's like a mother as compassionate cause she loves her baby and she loves the baby more than other things that aren't the baby obviously. And so actually compassion is one of the main sources of Ingroup bias, which is something for the compassion warriors to think about for like three fifths of a second.

Speaker 4:          11:25          There's, there's nothing less compassionate to you than a mother. Grizzly bear protecting her cubs. And so you should think about that when you think about empathy for a minute, because empathy is by no means an untrammeled moral virtue. In fact, it's responsible and can be responsible for absolutely atrocious actions. It depends on who you're empathizing with, you know, and if you are empathizing with someone that you regard as an infant dialyzed victim, then you snap into a frame of mind where everyone who might be oppressing that infant dialyzed victim is a predatory parasite and you're not very bloody empathetic to them. I can tell you. So now it's a big problem anyways with regards to this scaremongering issue. So yeah. Yeah. Biased. Yeah, probably and blind definitely. Um, like more than, more than you might expect. No, I don't think so. And one of the things that actually protected me through all of this was that, you know, I've actually tried to come to terms with the evil that lurks in human hearts, particularly my own.

Speaker 4:          12:32          And I have 500 hours of lectures on that online. If anybody has the bizarre desire to pound their way through them, they can more or less think, figure out what I think because I said 500 of hours of it publicly and so I didn't feel too bad about my level of bigotry or hatred, you know, I think you could probably infer that by watching the video. So it's kind of protected on that front. And then there was this scaremongering issue and that's a good one. That's a tough one man. Because you know, if you look at bill [inaudible] 16 it just kind of looks like, well we're extending protection to another oppressed group, which isn't actually true because gender identity, by the way, no gender expression, that's not a group I'd like just like to point that out because terminological accuracy actually matters. So we've extended legal protection to fashion essentially.

Speaker 4:          13:28          And you can say, well maybe I'm being a bit intransigent about that, but I read the Dat and policies and I don't think I am. And that's not a group. So that's an indication of the muddle headedness behind the legislation. And then the federal government, the Department of Justice did say on their own website that they were going to interpret that law in light of the policies of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. And so fine man, go to the Ontario Human Rights Commission if they haven't taken the policies off yet and read what they're up to. And if that, if you agree with that, well good green with it. But I would suspect that if you agree with it, you didn't, you didn't understand it or, or, or you're up to something and now it comes to the next part. What are, what are we really talking about here? Well, so we could be talking about my biases is my proclivity to scaremonger and you know, fair enough, but here's some reasons we're not.

Speaker 4:          14:22          And one is that I have all those lectures online and you know, believe me, if there would've been a phrase in any of them that indicated that there was something even vaguely morally corrupt about me, it would have been paraded around as evidence. You can be sure of that. So that's kind of a relief. You know, I did a lot of soul searching in the last couple of months and it's not like I'm without my problems. But anyways. So what is this about? Well we'll say, hopefully it's not about me because that'd be stupid. And so what, what's going on? Why are all these people watching these videos, these things I made just to figure out what it was that I was thinking. You know, cause I couldn't sleep one night and because I'm not very damn happy about that unconscious bias stuff, which I regard as absolutely reprehensible, that you could be held guilty for your implicit perceptions. Think about that. God, they use that test as a diagnostic test. You know, it doesn't meet the criteria for reliability and validity that you'd use for a diagnostic test. It doesn't produce the same results one time after another. And you can use it to target anybody. And so go along with it if you want and just see what happens. Anyways.

Speaker 5:          15:40          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          15:41          so I've been thinking about this like what's going on? Why the outcry, you know, you think, well Professor Peterson, God is 15 minutes of fame. It's like, well I had my 15 minutes of, you know, trivial fame several times in my life and there's some good things about it, but I am despite what you might think or rather private person. And so it's not like I'm particularly enjoying it, but I thought something, you know, when I made those videos I thought this is something I learned from reading mythology. If you have to fight a dragon, you should go to it slayer before it comes to your village. And so people think of what I did is courageous and I don't think that's right. I just think that I can see danger coming and you get to pick, you get to pick your anxiety. I could either be anxious about speaking or I could be anxious about not speaking. And so I chose to be anxious about speaking. And that's not exactly courage. It's more like common sense without assumes that you're looking into the future.

Speaker 4:          16:47          So are you might say, well, what gives me any special power to look into the future and hey, that's a good question and my God only knows what's going to happen in the next few years. You know, I did read today, this is cool. 250,000 people will be lifted out of absolute poverty today and 300,000 more will be connected to electricity and we're knocking poverty rates around the world down faster by a huge margin than we ever have in human history. There was an article in New York Times today called y 2016 was the best year ever. It's really worth reading. I concluded the same thing. I worked for a UN committee a couple of years ago when I was looking at, you know, what was going to happen down the road and everything. I kept reading less while, wow, we're getting rid of polio. We're getting rid of LFA elephantiasis, which you really don't want to have.

Speaker 4:          17:35          We're getting rid of Guinea worm. We're getting rid of polio, knock and malaria back into the swamps from where it comes. We're lifting people out of poverty. It's like, man, we're doing a lot of good things. You'd sure never guessed that by the way we treat ourselves. So anyways, so what's going on? Okay, so I thought, well I better think about this. I've been thinking about a long time. So you know, the, the right wing is really hard on the Frankfurt school, you know, and the Frankfurt school where these kinds of neo Marxist guys who combined Marxism with Friday and Islam in the 1940s and, and they were avowed neo Marxists, you know, so it's not like I'm making an accusation and they were kind of anti system type people and, and all of that. But I think to lay what's happening at the universities and in brought in the broader culture itself at the feet of the Frankfurt school is insufficient.

Speaker 4:          18:30          I really think that it's primarily a consequence of the French intellectuals who, and this is obviously an oversimplification who emerged out of Marxism in the early 1970s and produce postmodernism. Now, the thing about the postmodernist types is there nested inside mark's is they say that straight out, I'm not inventing this. You read Derrida, who's like the, the joker at the, at the head of the postmodernist movement. And I, I mean joker because he's, he's, he's an intellectual clown and not, doesn't mean he's stupid because he is not stupid. Not at all. These people are not stupid. They know exactly what they're doing. They know precisely what they're doing. They're a hell of a lot more educated about what they're doing. Then you are less, you happen to be one of them. And they mean exactly what they say. Just like people always do when they tell you what they're going to do or they write it down and they say straight out on their websites say that women's studies websites, we think the patriarchy is an oppressive structure that should be broken down to its core.

Speaker 4:          19:32          And they meet core conceptions. It's not just social, it's linguistic, philosophical and attitudinal. It should be broken down. What wiped out and restructured from the bottom up. And they mean that. So when it's not accidental. Any of this, and I know it sounds like a bloody paranoid conspiracy theory, but you know I've, I've always been of the idea, especially from reading young, that ideas people don't have ideas, ideas have people and these are powerful ideas. There's a good book called explaining postmodernism that I might recommend by a guy named named Steven RC Hicks and his first chapter, which isn't very long. It's a good introduction to political correctness, but so while, so why do I think this is about, about that? Well her, here's my reasons. I mean it doesn't seem to be about me. I think all idea to actually was actually, I made the general specific k, which is kind of what you have to do if you really want to make a point, a point, right? That's one place. If you want to make a point. And my point was, I'm not saying made up words generated by postmodern neo Marxists because I despise everything they stand for. And so I'm not using those damn words and that's okay.

Speaker 4:          20:57          No, I'd like, I have something against transgender people. I'm sure some of them are lovely people and some of them aren't, you know, and so they can do whatever they want as far as I'm concerned, as long as they don't, they can do whatever they want as far as I'm concerned, as long as I'm not forced to go along with the most radical representatives of them who don't even speak for them anyways. I've got like 20 letters from transsexual people supporting what I've done and like none opposing it. You know, one of the things that's kind of cool is I've only got three hate letters. I thought three, Jesus, you guys,

Speaker 2:          21:38          you guys are,

Speaker 4:          21:39          you guys aren't trying very hard. And I got like a thousand letters of support and if you go on youtube where I'm radically overrepresented, um, and you look at the comments and the likes and the dislikes, it's about the same ratio. It's like likes to dislikes is like about a hundred to one and almost all the comments are positive, which you know, could easily be a selection bias and probably is, but you know, it still means that there's quite a few people who think that what I'm doing is sort of okay as far as they're concerned. And so that's important. So anyways, we need to talk a little bit about postmodernism. Okay. So let's go back to France in the 19 end of the 1960. So, and this is of course an oversimplification and I'm sure I'm wrong about some of it because you know, it's not exactly my field of speciality, this sort of sociology.

Speaker 4:          22:32          Um, I'm more of the scientist tight, but, and I, and if I read philosophy, I tend not to read second rate philosophy. And so I've tried to avoid the postmodernists to some degree because there are, there any coherency is one of the least of their sins. But they don't care about that. No, no. You've got to understand, man, it's modernists 10 enlightenment people and even traditionalist who care about coherency, the postmodernists don't believe in coherency. They don't believe in, and I'm not making this up, this is part of their philosophy. They don't believe in logic. You know, debt does says straight out that Western society has fellow logo centric by which he means male centered and privileging the idea of logic. Well, he doesn't buy any of that. He doesn't think that there's a truth that is out there. He doesn't believe that individuals can reach any sort of truth by thinking.

Speaker 4:          23:21          He certainly doesn't believe that we can move towards truth in dialogue because that's dialogic, right? There's none of that. You wonder, well why don't, why did the postmodern types keep other thinkers off the campus? Well, it's not because they're afraid. Well also some of the market, but they use their fragility as a mask for their, you know, the underlying philosophical, their underlying philosophical and political interests. They do that Freidman terribly. It's not like every social justice warrior is, uh, you know, soared carrie and pork postmodernists but the idea are fragmented and distributed among them. Like they're distributed among a mob. And if you put the whole mob together, you get the whole post modernists thing happening at the same time. And that's how ideas have people instead of the other way around. Anyways, forget about logic. That's out the window. That's just a construct of Western society and, and the whole point of the construct was to oppress other people and to take their wealth and to privilege the people who live within that so called logic system so that they can justify to themselves and other people their prey Predator rapaciousness straight and simple.

Speaker 4:          24:32          And that's partly because postmodernism was influenced by Marxism. And of course that's what the Marxists, think about any situation where there's a, let's call it a power status differential. The people at the top are only there because they've stole everything from the people at the bottom. And so the knee, the Marxists in France realized by the end of 1960s there abouts when even John Paul Sartre finally figured out that to be a communist probably wasn't acceptable given that the bloody Soviet had killed like 30 million people between 1919 and 1959 and the Maoists done the same thing on a greater scale in China. And then we talk about North Korea and we can talk about, you know, by whatever, you know, we don't, students don't learn any of that in school anymore. And even if they did, they wouldn't want to listen to it. When I tell my students in my second year psychology class about the Gulag archipelago, hardly any of them know, well why is that?

Speaker 4:          25:29          Well, it's because they haven't been taught it. Why is that? Well, see if you can figure it out. All right, so, so anyways, back to the postmodern types. So you know, it got to the point where there's just no way you could be a Marxist, especially after social knits. And because Solzhenitsyn wrote this great book, which is actually out of print for crying out loud, which I've actually been able to popularize like mad over the last three months, which is, you know, really mind boggling and what soldier Nitsa did in his genius manner because he's up there with Dostoevsky and tolstoy like, man, that guy, he's a towering intellect and a person of tack can or moral force, you know, like he put himself on the line for that book. He memorized it when he was in the, in the prison camps. It's about, it's three volumes that fic, you know, it's like 2000 pages of someone's screaming. The smartest person you've ever met, the wisest person you've ever met, screaming and outrage for 2000 pages. It's no bloody wonder. It's out of print.

Speaker 4:          26:38          Anyways, what soldier in its did was take on this claim. You often hear the radical leftists make about communism, about Marxism. They say, well, that wasn't real Marxism. It's like, okay, well how many countries do you need to disprove your thesis? How many millions of people have to die before you might admit that you're wrong. Well, obviously more than a hundred million because that's the approximate total of, that's probably an underestimate, but we'll be conservative because I had to get another 10 million. Doesn't really make that much difference. So soldier Nansen took that argument apart partly in his book lending in Zurich, and then partly in the Gulag archipelago. Buck groundwork had already been laid for all of that by nature, who knew exactly what was coming in the 20th century and by Dostoyevsky who wrote a book called the possess back in like 1880 where he outlined in painful detail the precise mindset that would produce the Russian revolution like 30 years later. Amazing and Tolstoy as well. He's, he knew what was coming and made him suicidal. He wrote in his confession that win

Speaker 4:          27:47          the conflict between the ideas of Russia, the traditional ideas and the enlightenment ideas sweeping in from the west, they, they blew his worldview apart, which was traditional religious blew his worldview apart so badly that he was suicidal at the height of his fame. Tolstoy knew what was going to come to. And so it's not like soldier Mitson was the only person who could see this or are we all knew it. Uh, Malcolm Muggeridge knew it in the 1930s what he was noting that the Soviets, given their idea of class guilt, which sounds a lot like white privilege to me or any other form of racism,

Speaker 4:          28:23          they use that doctrine to just round up all the Kulaks they were the productive farmers and ship them off to Siberia and then 6 million Ukrainian starve to death. But you know, they had too many Ukrainians anyway, so it didn't really matter. So anyways, back to the postmodern types. Well, you know, this all came was revealed in such painful detail that even the kind of closed minded India log that Norman referred to just quite, couldn't, couldn't quite muster up the moral courage to keep beating the same damn drum. So what they did instead being highly intelligent individuals was play a game of sleight of hand and transformed these marks, his presuppositions into postmodernism in the 1970s. And the idea basically was, well, the working class isn't going to rise up and crush the burrs, waze, because first of all they're getting rich and that wasn't supposed to happen.

Speaker 4:          29:14          And second, well, it's sorted seemed to be a catastrophe when that occurred, let's say in Russia. And so maybe we won't do that anymore because the working class actually isn't buying into this either, which is also a problem, you know, having internalized their own oppression, they wouldn't buy into this, to the global myth of Utopia. So maybe it's because they had some sense. It's certainly possible. But anyways, the slight of hand was, oh, well fine, we'll just play a different, oh, oppressor versus gain and we'll introduce identity politics. It's like, okay, okay. You're not being oppressed because you're a member of the working class. You're being oppressed because you're a woman or you're being oppressed because you have an ethnicity that's outside the main paradigm, whatever that might be. Um, or it's because of your, your, your, your sexual preference or your sexual identity or whatever.

Speaker 4:          30:04          Whatever places you in some manner outside the normative culture. And you know, the thing is the postmodernist you don't, you might think, well your culture is good for something. It gives you a hierarchy of value. It rewards competent people. It gives you a direction so you can climb up, you know, cause otherwise everything's leveled to nothing. And then why do anything? Well, they don't care about any of that. They don't believe that there's any such thing as competence. They don't believe that there's any such thing as up. This is all postmodernism wipes, all of that out. And so when the postmodernist tantalize the text, all they care about is how it privileges the position of the author and who had impresses. And that's the only thing they regard as real. And they don't believe in grand unifying narratives. They don't believe that there's a Canadian identity.

Speaker 4:          30:46          They don't believe that there's an American identity. They don't believe that there's a western identity. They don't believe that value structures exist. Or if they are, there are replaceable. With some other value structure, they certainly don't believe that they have any biological grounding that there's any such thing as a human being. It's all socially constructed, which is really convenient if what you want to do is be the author of an entirely social constructed you utopia that you can run. And then when the marks is say, well that wasn't real Marxism, what it really means, and I've thought about this for a long time, it's the most arrogant possible statement anyone could ever make. It means if I would've been installing his position, I would have, I sure didn't the damn utopia instead that instead of the genocidal massacres, because I understand the doctrine of Marxism and everything about me is good.

Speaker 4:          31:36          It's like well think again sunshine, you don't understand it, you don't understand it and you're not that good. And if the power was in your hands, assuming you had the competence, which you don't, you wouldn't have done any better. And even if you had, there would have been someone else waiting right behind you to shoot you the first time you actually tried to do anything good. And that's what happened to all of the old guard who ran the damn revolution. Stalin rounded them all up and shot them along with their families and millions of other people. So even if you do happen to be that Avatar of moral purity that you claim implicitly, the probability that you'd give it to act out your goodness in relationship to those possessed by Your radiology is zero. So it's so, you know, you think, well, why are these postmodern is doing what they're doing? Why did they oppose the patriarchic? Here's a question, why don't the feminists complaining about Saudi Arabia? It's like,

Speaker 4:          32:44          you know, God sod, who's this guy up concordia who is in a business school so he can actually say what he thinks now. And then he tweeted yesterday, well, hey, see tweeted to the woman's march. You know, cause there's little twitter thing you could do that I suppose for the organizers. And he said, why don't you go to the Middle East and have a nice march again Saudi Arabia and see, see how that works out for Ya. It's like, so you think, well, why not? Like why not? Why? Why are the why or the radical left as to are so much for rights everywhere. That's what they say. Why aren't they complaining about Saudi Arabia, for example, which you know, breeds a particularly pathological form of video, logically rigid Islam that basically in slaves they're women. That's to put it properly. It's like why not complain about that? Well how about this? The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

Speaker 2:          33:37          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          33:37          And so when push comes to shove, you see how much concern there is among the radical feminists for the rights of women. It's like if the, if the pushing those rights forward doesn't also at the same time under a undermine the western patriarchy, then we'll take the undermining and leave the damn rights behind. And so there's an insight for you about exactly what's going on at the bottom of all of this. So,

Speaker 4:          34:04          okay, so then there's another weird thing, and I've already sort of hit on it tangentially. It's like, well the postmodernists don't believe in grand unifying narratives. They don't believe in narratives at all. They don't care about value because they never know. You have to value something in, in order to have some hope in life, right? Because when you value something, you're pursuing it. And in the pursuit, that's where the meaning in life is, you know, cause the rest of it's suffering. If you're trying to struggle upwards towards the light, it's like, well that's something to motivate you and to protect you against the suffering. But the postmodernists don't care about any of that. And I would say it's because they don't care about suffering.

Speaker 2:          34:43          Okay.

Speaker 4:          34:44          So all right, so here, but here's the, here's the final question. It's like, well, if the postmodernists don't care about grand unifying narratives and they don't believe in identity, why in the world are they willing to believe in gender identity and sexual identity and racial identity and ethnic identity? And the answer to that is, well, they can't, but they don't care because coherence isn't on their agenda. And besides that, when push comes to shove, they're postmodernism is nested inside a deeper Marxism. And so when the postmodern narrative doesn't suffice, say to push forward, the idea that Western civilization should be overturned, they just revert back to the over arching Marxism and say, well, those people are oppressed and that's a bad thing. It's like you might say, well, you're a postmodernist. It's like you'll believe in any of that. And they say, well, yeah, I'm only a postmodernist this deep.

Speaker 4:          35:35          But underneath that there's a, and I can always rely on that to fill in the gaps and that's exactly what's happening. So, so that's what's happening as far as I can tell. And you know, so why do I believe this will all, there's a little war going on in our culture. Maybe it's not so little. I put my finger on it and I wouldn't recommend that, by the way. You know, because okay, you explain it man. You explain why. Like 3 million people have watched the UFT free speech rally and I think 7 million people downloaded the Joe Rogan podcast. And it's like crazy. It's crazy. There was 180 newspaper articles about this. It was news for four months. Why? Who cares what I think, God, I don't even care that much about what I, what about trump? What's going on there? What's going on there? Exactly. You know, it was interesting listening to trump's inauguration speech because I detected elements of national socialists thought in it, you know, and not being dismissive.

Speaker 4:          36:43          I'm seriously not being dismissive, but when you radically activate on the side of the left, you call forth compensate Tory forces and they're not in your control. And like trump opened his speech, he just read it. It's, he sounds like a 1950 socialist, you know, he's going to use the power of the state to bring the industry home to produce a lot of infrastructure. It's a state business unity with the state in charge. And then at the end of his speech, which is where he stopped speeding, at least the international kind of socialist, he says, well borders are really important and so is national identity. And you know, he does embed that within belief in God, which is probably a good thing, assuming that he's serious about that. But you know, the fact that trump was elected in the end, that there was such a fight between him and the Clintonites and, and that the Clinton nights were playing identity politics instead of speaking for the working class, who then trump co-opted like he should have.

Speaker 4:          37:39          Um, there there's a war going on there. And then what, what about brexit? What's going on there? And what about France with Marine Le Pen and what about Holand with wielders, you know, watch it. We're in a chaotic time and you know, I've gotten letters from people all over the world who tell me how they can't say what they think. It's like, oh, well that's not very good. And they're kind of happy with me because maybe they think that I emboldened them in some way and so good. Good for that. Hypothetically. And most of the people who wrote me the overwhelming majority were reasonable. So pretty happy about that too. But, and maybe I'm wrong about my damn diagnosis because like what do I know? But I do have this proclivity to get to the bottom of things and what's out the bottom of this as an ideological war or philosophical war.

Speaker 4:          38:24          It's even deeper than that. It might even be deeper than a philosophical board, which is something that's more like a metaphysical or theological war. You know? It depends on how far down you look and the know exactly what they're doing. This isn't accidental. Of course, you shut down speakers you don't agree with because you can't have a dialogue with him then anyways, because human beings can't have dialogue. There's no such thing as a human individual. There's no such thing as truth. Here's the postmodern world. It's the hubs Z and nightmare. It's everyone against everyone else except it's not individuals. It's groups and you're stuck in your damn group and it's the only thing about you. Anyways, that's relevant, which is why we might base our hiring on it, for example, and you're oppressed and even if you don't know it just only because you've internalized it and it's the only thing that's real about you.

Speaker 4:          39:11          Anyways and I can't talk to you because I'm in my own little silo of privileged belief. And besides we can't use logic because that doesn't exist. And so you're in a group and I'm in a group and all we can do is have a war or we can talk, but we don't get to talk cause he can't talk if you're a postmodernist because speech is just chatter. So when it's just chatter that supports the people in power, that's how they think. And so the whole world is this little armed war of identity group against identity group against identity group. And you shut down people who don't agree with you because why should you let them talk? It's you don't believe in any of the reasons why you would let someone talk. So this isn't accidental. It's not because they're afraid. Although it's also because of that they hijack, you know, fear, they hijack compassion. They make anyone who who puts forward an alternative view into a terrorist of ideas and someone who's heartless at the core, which is really incredibly intelligent. It's such a good strategy. It's so devious and brilliant and it's so effective because who wants to, who the hell wants to be labeled a bigot? You probably are a damn big. It just like everyone else. So you know when it's easy to make people feel guilty about that, maybe they should.

Speaker 4:          40:33          So anyways, what's going on? Well that's what's going on. And so what do you do about it? Well, I don't know what you do about it, but I haven't theory. And that's when I'd been working on for like 40 years. So one of the problems with postmodernism, and I'm going to take five minutes and then we're done. One of the problems with postmodernism is that, and this is a big problem, like this is a fatal problem, apart from the fact that it's incoherent and there's no value structure in it and it's fundamentally divisive and destructive. There's a logical problem with a two that's even worse. And so you might be noticing that the lgbt set of acronyms keeps growing hay and it, it's, it's Kinda, it's kind of a form of it's own parody in some sense. It's like, well, I'm oppressed. It's like, yeah, yeah, you are.

Speaker 4:          41:16          And while I'm impressed too, yeah, you're also oppressed and maybe I'm even pressing you being part of this other marginalized group, but at least we share oppression. Well, I'm also oppressed. Well, so am I. I'm oppressed too. It's like, okay, so here's the problem. There's a big problem here. The problem is, it's true. You're oppressed, you're oppressed, you're oppressed, you're oppressed. God only knows why. Maybe you're too short, or you know what, as beautiful as you could be, or you know, your parent, your grandparent was a surf likely because almost everybody's granted great grandparent was, it's like, you know, and you're not as smart as he could be. And you have a sick relative and you have your own physical problems. And it's like, frankly, you're a mass and you're oppressed in every possible way, including your ancestry and your biology. And the entire sum of human history has conspired to produce, victimized you with all your individual pathological problems.

Speaker 4:          42:10          It's like, yes, true. Okay. But the problem is, is that it is true. And so if you take the oppressed, you have to fractionate them and fractured ate them. It's like you're a woman. Yeah. Okay, well, I'm a black woman. Well, I'm a black woman who has two children. Well, I'm a black woman who has two children and one of them isn't very healthy and then, well, I'm a, I'm a Hispanic woman and I have a genius son who doesn't have any money so that he cannot go to university and you know, I had a hell of a time getting across the border. It was really hard on me to get my citizenship and my husband is an alcoholic brute. It's like, well, yeah, that sucks too and so well, so let's, let's, let's fix all your oppressive oppression and we'll take every single thing into account and then we'll fix yours too.

Speaker 4:          42:54          We'll take every single thing into account. It's like, no, you won't because you can't. You can't. It is technically impossible. First of all, you can't even list all the ways that you're oppressed. Second, how are you going to weight them? Third, who's going to decide, and that's the bloody thing. Who's going to decide? That's the thing. Well, what's the answer in the West? It's like in free markets. Oh yeah. Christ will never be able to solve this problem. No one can solve it. What are we going to do about that? We're going to outsource it to the marketplace. You're going to take your, sorry, pathetic being and you're going to try to offer me something that may be I want and I'm going to take my story pathetic being, and I'm going to say, well, all things considered as well as I can understand that maybe I could give you this much money, which is actually a promise for that thing and you've packed all of your damn old pressured into the price and I've packed on my oppression into the willingness to pay it and that solution sucks.

Speaker 4:          43:54          It's a bad solution. But compared to every other solution, man, it's white. 10% of us have freedom. And so there, there's a tremendous illogic at the bottom of this. It's like you have to fraction eight theo pressed all the way down to the level of the individual. Well, that's what the West figured out. You know, there's a couple of figures who at the mythological roots of our culture, and you know, people get upset with me because I bring in religious themes, but I understand some things about mythology and religion. It's not an accident that the axiomatic western individual is someone who was unfairly nailed to a cross and torture. It's like, yes. Right. Exactly. So what do you do about that? Well, I thought about that for a long time too. It's like, well, you don't get together in a damn Bob, because all that does is allow you to be as horrible as you could possibly imagine and suffer from none of the consequences. That's a bad idea. So how about we don't do that? Well, there's a deep idea in the west too. It's like, pick up your damn suffering and Barrett.

Speaker 2:          45:08          Okay.

Speaker 4:          45:09          And try to be a good person so you don't make it worse.

Speaker 2:          45:13          Okay,

Speaker 4:          45:15          well that's a truth. You know, I read a lot about the terrible things that people have done to each other. You just cannot even imagine it so awful.

Speaker 4:          45:28          So you don't want to be someone like that? No. Do you have a reason to be? Yes. You have a lots of reasons to be God. There's reasons to be resentful about your existence. Everyone you know is going to die. You know you too, and there's going to be a fair bit of pain along the way and lots of it's going to be unfair. It's like, yeah, no wonder you're resentful. It's like act it out and see what happens. You make everything you're complaining about infinitely worse. There's this idea that hell is a bottomless pit and that's because no matter how bad is some stupid son of a bitch, like you could figure out a way to make it a lot worse. So you think, well, what do you do about that? Well, you accept it. That's what life is like. It's suffering. That's what the religious people have always said, life is suffering. Yes. Well, who wants to admit that? Well, just think about it. Well, so what do you do in the face of that suffering? Try to reduce it.

Speaker 2:          46:28          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          46:28          start with yourself. What good are you? Get yourself together for Christ sake so that when your father dies, you're not wining away in a corner and you can help plan the funeral and you can stand up solidly so that people can rely on you. That's better. Who'll be a damn victim course. You're a victim. Jesus obviously

Speaker 4:          46:48          put yourself together and then maybe if you put yourself together, you know how to do that. You know what's wrong with you, if you'll admit it, you know there's a few things you could like paulie sharp a little bit that you might even be able to manage. You're insufficient present condition and so you might shine yourself up a little bit and then your eyes will be a little more open. Then you can sign yourself up a little bit more and then maybe you could bring your family together instead of having them be the hateful, spiteful, neurotic in fighting batch that you're like doom to spend Christmas with.

Speaker 4:          47:23          So then you fix yourself up a little bit, kind of humbly because you know God, you're a fixer upper. If there ever was one and then you got to figure out, well what can you figure out how to make peace with your idiot brother and probably not because he's just as dumb as you, so the holiday hell are you going to manage that? And so then you've maybe you get somewhere that way and your family sort of functioning and you find out, well that kind of relieved a little bit of suffering, although it reduce the opportunities for spiteful revenge and that's kind of a pain in the neck and so then you get your family together a little bit and your little clued in then at least a bit because you've done something difficult that's actually difficult. You're a little wiser and so then maybe you could put an tend to do finger out beyond the family and try to change some little thing without racking it.

Speaker 4:          48:08          It's like our society is complex and we teach our students that they could just fix it. It's like go fix a military helicopter and see how far you get with that. It's like you're going to get a dude, you're like a chimp with a wrench. Whack. Oh look, it's better. It's like, no, it's not better. Things are complicated. And to fix things is really hard and you have to be like a golden tool to fix things and you're not. So, and that's the other message of the West. It's like how do you overcome the suffering of the of life? And I'm not saying it's only the message of the West. How do you overcome the suffering of life is be a better person. That's how you do it. Well, that's hard. It takes responsibility. And I think, you know, if you said to someone, you want to have a meaningful life, everything you do matters.

Speaker 4:          49:01          That's a definition of a meaningful life. But everything you do matters, you're going to have to carry that with you. Or do you want to just forget about the whole meaning thing and then you don't have any responsibility because who the hell cares? And you can wander through life doing whatever you want, gratifying, impulsive desires for how useful that's going to be. And you're stuck in meaninglessness. But you don't have any responsibility, which one do you want? Well, ask yourself which one are you pursuing and you'll find very rapidly that it isn't the majority of your soul that's pursuing the whole meaning thing because, well look what you have to do to do that. Yeah. Have to take on the fact that life is suffering. You have put yourself together in the face of that. Well that's hard. Christ, it's amazing. People can even do it.

Speaker 4:          49:50          I'm stunned every day when I go outside and it isn't a re a riot with everything burning. It could really, God you talk to people. It's like I knew this guy, he'd been in a motorcycle accident and it really ruined him and he was like a linesman, you know, working on the power and he was working with someone who had Parkinson's disease and they had complimentary inadequacies and so two of them could do the job of one person and so they're out there fixing power lines in the freezing cold despite the fact that one was three quarters wrecked with a motorcycle accident and the other one had Parkinson's. It's like that's how our works. It's like there's all these ruled people out there. They've got problems like you can't believe off. They go to work and do things they don't even like, and look, the lights are on. My God. It's unbelievable. It's, it's a miracle. It's a miracle. And we're so ungrateful. College students, the postmodern types, they're so ungrateful. You know, they don't know that they're surrounded by it. Just a bloody miracle. It's a miracle. It all this stuff works that all you crazy. Chimpanzees that don't know each other can sit in the same room for two hours, sweltering away without tearing each other apart because that's what chimps do.

Speaker 2:          51:04          So

Speaker 4:          51:09          anyways, so what happened? Well, I made some videos and I got to the bottom of some things, at least as far as I can tell. So I told you what the bottom is and then I got this idea about what you might do about it, which isn't my idea. It's like, it's not my idea. It's an old, old, old, old idea. It's far older than Christianity. It's all, it's the oldest story of mankind. Get yourself together, transcend your suffering, see if you can be some kind of hero, make the suffering in the world less. Well, that's the way forward as far as I can tell, if there isn't any way forward. Knots, what's under assault by the postmodernists? So look out, cause they know exactly what they're doing and they know exactly why they're doing it. And that's what it looks like to me.

Speaker 2:          51:58          So

Speaker 4:          52:00          that's it.

Speaker 2:          52:02          [inaudible].
