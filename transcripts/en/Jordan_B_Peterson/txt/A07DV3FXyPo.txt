Speaker 1:          00:00:00       How's you know, Freud believed that a substantial proportion of the symptoms he saw among his clients were of psychological origin, despite the fact that some of them are manifest physically. Uh, these things do happen by the way. Uh, I had a client who was from eastern Europe from eastern and Eastern European background, which is relevant in that I believe her upbringing to be more similar to the kind of upbringing that the victorians that Freud studied were then say more the people of people in the West. And she had the same thing that her grandmother had, which was, um, psychosomatic epilepsy. And so she expressed what we're often sexual conflicts through epileptic seizures. She had an epileptic seizure of this type in my lab, my office one day. And uh, you know, she was unsure whether they were real or not, but I've seen people have epileptic seizures.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       And as a general rule it's quite upsetting. But she had an epileptic seizure in my office. And one of the things I noted was that it didn't really bother me. And one of the things I've noticed about being a therapist is if someone is, is manifesting a lot of emotion and a, it's not bothering me, then it's a good hint that there's something wrong, that it's not real. There's something about it that isn't exactly right because it doesn't seem to hook in your MPA empathic systems the same way. So, um, I had another client. This has actually happened to two of my clients. The first one was attacked by her boyfriend and she was unbelievably naive. She was so naive. You like, you could write a whole book about how naive she was. I'm serious. It was unbelievable. Her parents actually taught her. This is the literal truth.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Her parents taught her that adults were angels. It's not a good way of preparing your child for the grown up world. Anyways, she'd had a fight with her boyfriend and he attacked her with sexual intent. And when we went through this and it was under hypnosis, she described his face. She said he had a look of sheer malevolence, right? He, she'd never seen that. She was like a 28 year old woman. She was a, she had a, she had an undergraduate degree, she was no idiot. Um, I asked her like, how can you reconcile your belief that adults were angels with all the things that you learned about history and your undergraduate degree? And she basically said, well, I just put those things in a compartment and didn't pay any attention to them. It's like, yeah, okay. So she saw this guy's face when he was intending harm and it was actually the look on his face that traumatized her and it traumatized her so badly that she had severe psychosomatic symptoms severe enough to get her diagnosed as schizophrenia for five years nonstop at night for four hours at a time.

Speaker 1:          00:02:56       And the symptoms were that her whole body would shake and she would be unable to sleep. So. And I had another client who had the same thing, not the same thing, but a similar thing happened to her in high school where a boy was picking on her continually with malevolent intent. And the thing that really made that memory stick in her face was the look of malevolence on his face. So. So you see some people are definitely capable of some behavior that is most properly explained as far as I can tell in terms that are similar to Freud's, what's repressed, unbearable memories, often sexual and impermissible desires. How do you defend against things that you don't want to be true? While there's repression, Freud really thought that was unconscious. People didn't know they were repressing. So I sent you guys a link you may have noticed about the Gottman studies on married couples.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       I think there are still. Studies are bloody brilliant, you know, and what Godman found in exactly typical is that the couples who are going to get divorced when you see them in their natural habitat, they're all nice to each other, but they're psychophysiological systems are just going preserved there like prey and Predator to each other. You know, and you know, I don't know if that's repression or if it's suppression. These things are very difficult to distinguish because they're not that well defined but. But there is a lot of activity beneath the surface, that's for sure. And the problem with being psychophysiology logically aroused like that is that the consequences of that overtime is physical, right? Because what's happens when you're aroused like that as you produce a lot of the stress hormone cortisol and that activates the general stress response. And the General Stress Response Basically Robs your future stores of energy and ability to overreact in the present.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       And if you do that long enough, well you'll damage your brain. That's one of the things that happens. But there's many other things that happened too. So denial people will just say, well, that's not so bad, or maybe that's normal. We'll see a lot of that when I show you this movie reaction formation, which is, it's like, it's, it's overcompensation in some sense. So maybe you really hate your sister and you buy her a great big Christmas present, you know, because you'd like to think that you like, or. But really you don't like her at all. Um, they're often sibling rivalry can be unbelievably intense. Um, displacement. This is a good one. My boss yells at me, I yell at my husband, my husband yells at the baby, the baby bites the cat, you know, so it's a cascading chain of, of emotion. Often I find with people though that if they come home and they're in a bad mood and they're touchy, you know, and, and you, you say something to them and you know, they, they fly off the handle.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       It isn't exactly so much that they've suppressed or repressed or denied what's happening at work. At least not in any obvious sense. Not that day. Often you have to like prior around in the person and talk to them and harass them a bit until they, you know, often tell emotion arises, which is partly why Freud thought about his transformation processes Cathartic. And then they figure out. They'll cry and say, well, I'm really upset at my boss. And the. It's not obvious that the person actually knew that when they came home and like the unconscious issue is quite a difficult one to, to tear apart. My conclusion has been that when people that repression isn't really much different than lying except that the lie is initially conscious when you first make, but if you keep habitually lying about something, you develop a little automated circuit that either does the lying or that has the replacement story at hand and after 200 repetitions at the same damn lie, you've built a little machine in your head that handles all that and at that point it can be unconscious because you don't need it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       You don't need to be conscious to make that decision anymore. So if you practice something deceptive long enough, I think it becomes habitual and unconscious. So I would recommend that you don't do that unless you want your head full of little pathological monsters that you can't control. I mean, maybe it's already like that. That would be a freudian idea. Identification is another defense mechanism. You're bullied. You want to become the bully rationalization. That's when you don't actually. This is. This is the thing that people who are highly intelligent, they're really good at, you know they've got a problem and they come up with some perfectly coherent and reasonable explanation for the problem or the misbehavior. That has absolutely nothing to do with what's actually going on. And if you. If you marry someone, for example, who's more introverted than you or less verbally fluent, this is something to really watch out for it because just because you could win an argument with someone doesn't mean you're right and if you're verbally fluent and extroverted, you can often tie people up in knots.

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       But I would say beware of that because just because the person you're arguing with can't formulate their ideas as fast as you and just because they may not be able to hold their own in an argument with you. That does not mean they don't know what they see. And if you have any intelligence and you're married to someone like that, you actually try to coax what they think out of them and help them articulate it and formulate it. Because there's always the possibility that you're doing something underhanded and sneaky and dangerous in the medium to longterm, and it might be better for both of you if you figured it out intellectually ization. Well, if you've ever watched a woody allen movie, you know what that is, um, what are, y'all should have had union psychotherapy, not Freud in psychotherapy because he's a creative person. And one of the things I've noticed is that I have clients who are very creative and other clients who aren't as creative and the ones who were creative spontaneously manifest processes in their dreams that are most easily interpreted in union form.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       It doesn't seem to be the case for people that weren't creative though. And if I talk to them about mythological or symbol like ideas, it doesn't click for them. So what we usually do things that are much more practical. What much more like behavior therapy projection is a good one. I'm not irritated. Your irritating, you know, and it's, it's, it's a toss up often because, you know, you might think, well, no one can irritate you without your permission. It's like, believe me, if you think that you've not been around some world class irritating people because there are certainly people, borderline personalities are like that, who I don't care if you're a safe man, sooner or later you're going to get irritated because that's actually the goal of the behavior in large part. So Freud's fundamental theory was that unconscious ideas were at the core of many psychological conflicts like incomprehensible distress.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       Psychosomatic symptoms are psychosomatic. Cyst is when your body attempts to represent something that you're repressing. Now. I think there's two ways of looking at that because I don't actually think. I don't always think that's what happens. I think sometimes the reaction to the situation in question is actually sematic to begin with, and then if it's articulated and worked out, the body can can. It's like the memory locale shifts or the representation area shifts. So for example, I had a client, she had a wonderful time. She, she got fired from her job and they bundled her into her car and it was sudden she didn't see it coming and then on the way home her car was hit by another car. So like that was a perfect way to be traumatized because she was already really upset and on edge obviously, and then this car hit her at about 50 miles an hour and it hurt her quite badly and she had minimal brain injury, which is a really rough one because it has non specific symptoms and like she, she, she'd come to therapy and I, I talked to her for her ideas were quite fragmented so it took us quite a long time to kind of weave a coherent story together.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       But she'd sit there like this, you know, and one of the things that I found after a while when I was working with her was that I was really uncomfortable watching her and it was a discomfort that seemed to center about here. It was a physiological response, probably a mirroring response. And one day I said to her, it was like a spontaneous impulse. I said, come over. We'd worked together for a long time. By the time said, look, come over here. I'm leaning on the desk. So I had her lean on the desk and then I sort of pounded on her shoulders down down her spine and she started to cry and she cried like for 45 minutes and then that loosened up a shoulder and then we. Another thing we did was to. I had her, she said she couldn't lift her arm a.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       So we were doing basically exposure. I said, okay, lift your arm and then let it go and then lift your arm another inch and let it go and then lift your arm another inch and let it go. And soon we had her arm up like this. She had moved her arm above her head in like five years because she was in this like protective crouch. It's like a startle response and I think that if you're traumatized, often what happens is your body throws itself into a state of hyper preparation and then unless you can, unless you can bring the meaning of the traumatic event up and articulate it and throw away what it isn't, you know, like. Because when she got hit by the car and lost her job, part of her idea was, well, my life is over now, you know, because you can understand why someone would think that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       So I would say, well, yes, that's understandable, but it's too global and vague formulation to be helpful, but if your life is over and there's nothing you can do, this is probably the right thing to do. You know? And so sometimes it's not so much that the simplest sematic symptoms are a consequence of repression and then symbolic, symbolic representation, it's that the actual response to the event starts out physiological and it never gets any farther than that. And so partly what you're doing is, and I think it's, it's like a permanent manifestation of the stress response. So he thought of behavior anomalies in this way and hallucinations and delusions. Like a lot of this stuff is dead on as far as I'm concerned. Like you see this, you see this a lot with people that you have an intimate relationship with. You know, like there's something off about what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       Well, for example, in the gottman study, that's a good example. You know how Gottman said I'm the successful couples have responded to each other's bids, right? So if, if you're in the house and your, your wife says, um, oh look, there's a, there's a cardinal in the backyard and it's really pretty, you know what that means is maybe you could come over here and look at this bird with me and you know, that would help me understand that you liked me and they're interested in what I'm doing, you know. And so you can say in Gottman's terms, you can just say, I don't want to look at your stupid bird. That's not a great response. Or you can say really, okay, you put down your newspaper, whatever it is and look like you're really perturbed and then you walk over there and no, that's a good response to because then you can also destroy her pleasure and looking at the bird.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       So without really looking like a son of a bitch. So that's a good one. Or you can just sort of see. I love that one. Which means, oh, you're annoying. I'm so put upon, I really, you're always asking me to do stupid things and I'm so generous and giving and here you are exploiting me again and then you go over and you look at the burden, you know, maybe a smile with your mouth but not your eyes and that's real nice. And then the other one is, well you go over there like civilized human being, like interacting with someone that you'd actually like to get along with for the next 30 years. But the things in all those other three categories, those are, there is like just in that Psi, there's a whole bloody massive snakes underneath it. You know. And if you, if you watch someone who does that and you go after them, you know, if you decide you're going to solve this, you have to dig down into that side.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       Like God only knows how deep it might be a decade old, you know, they're harboring some bloody resentment that occurred like 15 years ago is those things are just stacked up like, like little bombs underneath the surface of this little tiny behavioral auction. You know? And usually people will just ignore it, which is not a good idea, but because they're conflict avoidant, people are very, very conflict avoidant and they like to think that, well, if everything's just all right right now, it'll stay all right into the future. It's like, no, it won't, it absolutely will not. And if you don't deal with little things, then all the monsters that are packed up inside the will eventually eat you. So, but that's a while in the future. So you don't really have to worry about it. It's not a very good, a good way of thinking about things.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       Freud also noticed, noticed that people make jokes about things that are often repressed. And that's definitely the case if you watch a good comedian, especially the ones that are a little bit more on the outrageous side, what they're doing constantly is saying things that people don't want to believe but know are true. And so they'll reveal something that everybody knows and everybody will laugh because yeah, we know that. But you're not supposed to say it. And um, what's his name? The Indian comic from. Yeah. Yeah, that's the guy. I mean, he's always making racial jokes, right? So funny because it's, this whole audience is full of, it's really, really racially and ethnically mixed mixed audience and all he does is pick out people in like assault them for their race or ethnic identity and they're all laughing way like, oh, it's so cute that we're all in here like insulting each other and, but you know, he's, he's, he's giving voice to, um, what to commonly held stereotypes that no one will admit to holding or knowing.

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       And so it's kind of a relief to everyone to have that broad out in the open, in some safe place. So slips of the tongue are also an interesting phenomena. You can watch people very carefully for this because now and then they'll say something that means something other than what they thought it would say, or it means something contrary or it's a hint into one of these like stacks of monsters that normally they didn't want to admit to and you have to be sharp to, to catch these things. You have to pay real attention. You can also see the same thing with micro-expressions, often with people that's given rise to this whole new politically correct movement about suppressing microaggression, which is like one of the most pathological things I've ever heard of, you know, like getting rid of your micro aggression expressions that does not make you a good person just makes you a trickier sort of psychopath.

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       So Freud also was extremely interested in dreams and his theory was that a dream was a wish fulfillment and like I really don't think that's a good theory. I think that sometimes some dreams have a wish like element, although I should say, even though I'm not very fond of the wish fulfillment theory, I don't think it's comprehensive enough. His, the other things he had to say about dreams were absolutely brilliant. So the, his book, if you want to read one book by Freud, I would say the book on dreams is the best and unfortunately at the moment I can't remember what it's called, the interpretation of dreams, right? It's a very thick book and you know, it can't boil down Freud's theory of dreams. It's a whole book into one phrase, wish, fulfillment, you know he's way smarter than that and so you, you don't, for each writing is sort of like fiction.

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       You can't condense it. You have to read it. So you know, sometimes it seems obvious like if the dream is of a sexual nature, you can easily see whether that might be a, you know, a wish fulfillment or something like that. In hungry people will dream about food. So it's not the case that and lonely people will dream about social comfort and so forth. So it's not the case precisely that the dream can't have anything to do with wishes. Jung's idea, which I think is a better idea and I think it's more grounded in how we understand dreams in the modern world, was that the dream was compensate Tory so that if you're, if you had a particularly rigid viewpoint and in of the world and that rigid viewpoint was actually impeding your progress forward, that the dream would spin up counter propositional fantasies in an attempt to update the, the, the stiffening in the and the rigidity of the more explicit belief system.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       And I think there's some good evidence for that in modern studies of dreaming it seems. It's certainly the case that dreams do seem to update your memory and our eyes. I think partly what the dreams are doing too, and this is maybe where some of the symbolic content comes from, is there's this, you know, it's not obvious how you should structure a category, right? Because categories, they're very fluid, you know, you might think, well all men is a good category, you know, and then you might think, well all white men and old non white men is a good category depending on what you're discussing and so on, you know, the contents of your categories often depend on what you want to do with the category. So it's not obvious what should be in the box and what should it be. And partly what the dream is doing too, is by loosening up the categorical structure, you know, because things can fluidly change and transform and dreams.

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       And it allows you to experiment with re categorization while you're asleep, without having to suffer the consequences of that in the waking world because you're paralyzed right? So I think it's more accurate to think of the dream as an, as part of the process by which new knowledge becomes eventually articulated and that's more of a union perspective. So you start out not knowing anything about it and then maybe you can code it onto your behavior. That would be something piaget would suggest. And then after it's coated onto behavior, maybe you can start expressing it in image, especially in dynamic images. And so that would be something like fiction and so you can think of dreams as a kind of fiction and then once you've got the thing laid out in fiction, especially if it's kind of coherent, then it's not a huge leap from that to having an articulated model.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       And I think a lot of what you're doing when you do dream interpretation in psychotherapy is you're doing the same thing that you would do if you were interpreting literature. Um, and you know, you think, well, is it worthwhile thinking about literature? It's like, well, you know, it's worthwhile reading it. Fine. Is it worthwhile thinking about what you're reading? It's different process. It's like arguably, well, so the dream has a function and it does whatever dreams do and then perhaps there's also some utility in attending to the dream consciously and trying to elaborate upon its contents. And Freud would do that with Free Association and works. It really works. It's quite fun. If you have someone who's a good dreamer, you know, you say, okay, they, the way I do it as they are, they tell me the dream, they read it and I listened to it and I let my imagination work on it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       So it kind of builds up an association net and then I have them start from the beginning again and whenever they come to a theme or an object or something like that that's identifiable, then I asked them what that reminds them up and so to me what we're doing is flushing out the association network and that's a freudian idea. And then if you walk through the whole dream like and then people will associate and then that will remind them of something and then maybe they'll remember why a specific date is in the dream or something like that. And so it's like the dream is putting together ideas that have a vague cloud around them and it's trying to sequence and organize them and you seem to be able to facilitate that process with conscious reflection. So, and for some people it's extremely useful. I mean, one of the things young said, which I really liked was that if you're stuck in a problem and you can't solve it, you have no idea how to solve a terrible conflict of some sort.

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       You have to look where you don't know. And he thought, well, one of the places that you don't know is in your dreams and you think, well, dreams are doing something and there's good evidence that part of what dreams are doing is dealing with novel information. You know, they're trying to conceptualize novel information. And so that's a good place to look for new potential solutions because you can also think of the dream as part of a hypothesis generating mechanism that would also be the creative imagination. So I think often the reason, I think maybe the reason that sometimes people remember dreams that are extremely emotional and they feel compelled to tell them is perhaps is because the people who did that, I think about it from an evolutionary perspective. The people who did that and expose the fantasy to the group, we're more likely to gather information about what it meant and possibly more likely to survive.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       And so there seems to be a trigger level, you know, above which the dream is specifically particularly sufficiently emotionally impactful. So the actually remember when you wake up and you would also often consider those big dreams, you know, especially if they had archetipal content and those would also sometimes be dreams that had relevance beyond the relevance to the specific individual. So they might be dreams that are working really hard on a problem that's collective. So, and you know, you think, well, where do new ideas come from? You know, well they just appeared in my head. It's like that's not a very good theory. You know, the idea has a birthplace, the birthplace is in the unknown. And then there's a tremendous amount of elaboration of that information before it ever gets up to where it pops into your head is an articulated statement, you know, that's not a, that's not an instantaneous magical transformation or maybe you can think it is, but it's, you know, it's not a very useful theory.

Speaker 1:          00:23:29       And the idea that there are multiple stages of processing of information each with their own natures much more in keeping with the way that modern people look at the brain, which is as a Oregon that's evolved, that has very, very archaic elements like massively archaic, like the ones I told you about that were you share it with lobsters and then there's all sorts of weird systems built on top of that that are basically there for biological purposes. And then there's a cortical cap that sort of elaborates and all those things are working together to extract out information that you can use for living. It's certainly not mechanical. It's not exactly computational. It's, it's a multistage process. And dreams and imagination are involved at least at the hypothesis stage. So. So you can think of dream as a hypothesis in some sense, and although I don't think, I don't think it's reasonable to say that dreams do one thing anymore than it is reasonable to say that thinking does one thing, but the competence Satori idea is a good one and you can kind of think of the wish fulfillment ideas, that subset of that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       So the dream is also, Freud says that process of regression that manifests itself simultaneously in three fashions as topical regression from the conscious to the unconscious as temporal regression from the present time to childhood. Sometimes you see this with people who've had repetitive nightmares. One thing I can tell you, you can try this. If you have a repetitive nightmare, usually it presents the same thematic problem over and over. Like maybe you're being chased by a monster when you turn around. Um, maybe your hands are tied or something like that. You know, which, if you told me about that, I think, well, who or what is tying your hands? Right? That would be the first question, but one of the things you can do to make that nightmare go away is to sit down, reimagine the nightmare, and fix the ending. Now you have to come up with a reasonable ending.

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       So for example, I had a client who was afraid. She had a cabin, was very interesting case. She had a mouse phobia and she was afraid mice would run up her leg. That was the specific content of the phobia and she had a cabin and she didn't like to go to the cabin for two reasons. One was a mouse might run up her leg and the second was she was up there alone and she was afraid that she would get attacked and sexually assaulted. So it doesn't take much of a frailty and genius to figure out the connection between those two things. But one of the things we did was first of all talk it through as if it was a reasonable fear. It's like, well, you are up there alone. Maybe you could have an alarm system and some good locks. It's like, you know, so your fear might be predicated on some realistic, some realistic appraisal which you're repressing, you're not dealing with it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:01       It is potentially dangerous fix that. Get a dog, you know, so we did all that and simultaneously treated or most phobia through behavioral exposure and then she was having these dreams of these guys breaking in and raping her and so we had her walk through, I think she bought a bat and put it by her bed, which was something I suggested. And then we walked her through. I walked her through the dream and we changed the ending. So what she did was the guy climbed in the window and she picked up the bat and she smacked him one and then she sprayed him with oven cleaner, which is like a really nasty thing to do. Then she tied him up in a chair and she was like, she was dancing around in the office thinking that's, you know, that's a hero myth essentially. Right? We changed, we transformed the dream from victim to hero essentially. And that was the end of her nightmares. And that happens more often than you than you might think because the dream is presenting you with the problem, right? It's like a threat detection mechanism. It says, well here's the threat. Maybe it's expressing it in symbolic terms or maybe it's using a general category like monster. It's like our monsters chasing you. Well, it depends on what you mean by monsters. But functionally, yes they are, you know, while you might think, well, conceptualizing them as monsters isn't exactly accurate. It's like, well,

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       it's not exactly clear that it's not accurate. So

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       I think a monster is a monster is like a representation of the class of all things that could chase you and devour you. And there's lots of those that are symbolic and articulate. Like if you're arguing with someone who can defeat you or you know, there are, there are certainly predators on the, on the Internet that are waiting for you at pretty much any moment to slip up. And like the idea that the world is full of monstrous embodied forces that have you as target for pray. It's like, yes, that's right. Obviously that's right. So,

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       so Freud, Freud's theory of dreams was essentially that there was a little late and content in the dream, which is what the dream really meant, and then the layers of weird transformation of the idea. He thought about displacement where one thing would stand for another or condensation where a lot of the events would be rammed together in a very short sequence or symbolization. So like the mouse in my client's phobia would be a good example of symbolization, of fear, of sexual penetration and dramatization. He thought of those is all ways that the dream was hiding the latent content from the dreamer in order to protect sleep. Whereas you young and Freud really argued about this and it's part of what broke them apart. Young said, no, no, no, that's, that might be right in some cases, but generally what the dream is doing, it's just a fact of nature.

Speaker 1:          00:28:47       The dream is trying to think something up and so it might be concentrating on something that you refuse to admit to and repressed, but sometimes it's just like out there with free play at fantasy, trying to generally orient you in the world. So he thought about it and you'll also thought it's like young was an archeologist of the Ed in some sense, you know, he thought of the Ed as a much as a more creative place in some sense than than Freud did and as the place where new ideas and new adaptive patterns were born. So he believed that the dream was generally fairly logical and one of the things you did when you recounted the dream, no matter how accurately you tried to recount it, was to transform it into more of a narrative form than it actually took as a dream. And so no doubt that's true because when you describe an experience, even if it's an experience you have every day, you basically extract out the gist and then describe the. And you have to do the same thing with dreams because you can't present the images. So it might that just the act of telling the dream might even be useful in that sense. Because what you're doing is making whatever that thought is more coherent than it would otherwise be. So.

Speaker 1:          00:29:59       So I want to run through this, this psychosexual theory very rapidly, and then I want to show you some examples of it so you don't believe that in some sense, you know you had a primary energy and that psychic energy, that's what we call energy. You know, when you say I'm feeling energetic today, it's not obvious what that means, but Freud regarded that as libidinal and he thought that there were multiple sources of libido, but the most fundamental source with sexuality, and I think he thought that in part because of the influence of Darwin's ideas, because Darwin basically said that the goal of organisms was essentially to procreate. The sexual urge is extraordinarily strong and so he thought it was primary and you can make a reasonable case that it's primary, but I think it's too reductionistic because there's lots of drives that people have and it isn't obvious that they all coagulate into a single source of energy.

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       Somewhere in the psyche. If you look at the way the brain is structured, actually the part of the brain that wakes you up, it's called the reticular activating system and it's. It's, it's some strands way down in the brain stem that, that, that branch out in a Mo in many, many ways out into the brain like a tree in some sense, if you twist your head the wrong way when you have a car accident, sometimes you can shear off those tracks and then you're in a coma and there's nothing that can be done about it, but the reticular activating system is really, really old. I could seems older than all the motivation and emotional systems, and so if there is a libido, which would be whatever it is that the reticular activating system does in order to awaken you from your slumber, say, or to put you on alert when something happens, it looks like it's older than all the. The isolated, motivational and emotional systems. So the libido per se, isn't sexual by, by all appearances. It's something that's below sexuality. No. So, but you know, it's still reasonable to note that sexuality is a powerful driving force. So

Speaker 1:          00:32:01       Freud said it begins its development in infancy. The infant is a sexual being by which he meant the infant is capable of experiencing sexual pleasure. So why not, I should let you know that one of the practices of Victoria nurses with male babies was to masturbate them till they till satiation so they would sleep. So it's not, it's there, it's not like there's no evidence for sexual pleasure in, in, in children, in infants in particular, Freud thought about that as polymorphously, perverse by which he meant that the infant was willing to take pleasure in any, in any activity whatsoever, and babies can have some pretty messy habits without any structuring of that and then that that channeled in various ways as the, as the, as the baby developed. So here, here are his stages, the aural period. Well, it's quite interesting that when a baby is born, the part of its body that is in fact most mature, most like a mature part in terms of its eventual function is in fact the mouth and the tongue and obvious.

Speaker 1:          00:32:59       There's obvious reasons for that because the baby has to be able to latch onto the nipple, you know right away. And that's actually quite a complicated activity. It's a complicated social activity and it requires a fair bit of coordination between the baby and the mother. It's not something automatic. So if the baby didn't come out, um, you know, wired up for certain basic in certain basic ways it wouldn't be able to get going to begin with. So it's definitely wired up in an oral manner. So he thought if the oral character as passive optimistic independent, and there's the anal period where the Freud thought that's where the ego, the Super Ego for the first time in some sense where the child has had to renounce primary pleasure and so that would be the pleasure of dedication fundamentally in favor of a more complex form of behavior and that that was actually an inhibitory process and certainly the case that parents can get into like year long wars with, with kids over toilet training, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:33:54       So I've seen some pretty weird examples of that. So I, I saw one parent who, who was in such a war with, with their three year old, that that three year old would only dedicate if the mother put a diaper on them. So it had perfect control, but it was like there was a war going on, so, and he thought of anal people as orderly, parsimonious, and obstinate. It's kind of interesting too, because one of the things that we found recently is that conscientiousness is one of the big five traits, right? You can break it into orderliness and into industriousness and orderliness, predicts conservatism and predicts authoritarianism and it's associated with disgust sensitivity. So I thought, Huh, that's pretty interesting. You know, and it's also the other thing that's really cool about orderliness and disgust sensitivity is that it is associated with disgust associated with anything that would contaminate.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       And so the idea that that's associated in some sense with, with, with anal thinking is it's, there's something about it that's right. You know, and it's also pretty important to note that the reason that all you people are going to live to be 90 or thereabouts, roughly speaking, isn't doctors and it's plumbers. So. Right. Really? So, you know, uh, the, the, the life is in itself contaminating and we have a built in system that's the disgust system to take care of that problem. And it's clear that that does vary in strength between individuals and it's also clear that the degree to which that if you have a stronger disgust system, you're much more likely to be conservative in your political beliefs. So that's pretty cool. It's like it's not something obvious. You know, the Phallic period, three to five, that's when Freud believed that children often discovered masturbation and that's when girls develop penis envy and boys develop castration anxiety, which I said is a small price to pay for the possession of a penis. Yeah. So all right, here's a way of thinking about the depaul phase. It's basically hostility and erotic attraction towards the parents now for and thought about this as a normative part of development.

Speaker 2:          00:36:10       And that's a tough one.

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       It certainly does seem to be the case and there is some experimental evidence that boys

Speaker 1:          00:36:22       fight more with their fathers and girls fight more with their mothers. So that's kind of interesting. But I think I not so sure that the idea that this is normative development is exactly right. And maybe maybe Freud got skewed over a bit because he was always dealing with people who had one form of pathology or another. Now here's, here's how to develop an equitable situation if you want to with your children. Some of you will take this road so maybe this will help you do it better if that's really what you're into. So the thing to do is make sure that your marriage is quite hostile so that you have a lot of underlying resentment to your partner and that will, that will encourage you to suddenly turn one of your children or more of them against that parent without them really knowing it. And you can do that by covertly reinforcing them when they do that or ignoring them, that's even better when they do the opposite.

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       So you know maybe your daughter is being nice to your husband, you're already mad at him so that you know you make it known to her using one strategy or another that you don't really approve of that sort of behavior. So that's pretty effective way of doing it. Then the next thing to do is this works really well. If you have a young boy and you're a woman. It's like you know, you wanna, you wanna develop a lot of hostility towards your husband so you really don't want to have anything to do with them and you don't really want him to even touch you and because of that you're not even really all that happy about men. And so then you do two things is that you turn to your son because he's kind of harmless and you make your relationship way closer than it should be with him and you encourage all sorts of things that are really kind of on the edge of acceptable behavior and at the same time you repress and crush any part of him that would develop in the kind of masculinity that would enable him to turn into the monster that you think your husband is.

Speaker 1:          00:38:03       So that's a really effective. And people can do that for like 20 years and outcome. Is that. I have a lot of business as a therapist because I do see this sort of thing and a lot of. A lot of what happens in therapy is that it's an interesting thing is people come to see me to solve all sorts of problems, like have a very large number of sorts, but one of the common problems is they cannot get away from their families. They can't, they can't break. Those initial isn't even break them. The family can't negotiate a to allow

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       the person to manifest the independence that would be necessary for them to have their own life and their own family and their own career. And so they're struggling and they're caught in these often ugly nets, like often unbelievably ugly nets and they can't get out of them. And that's what we're going to see right now. So now this character Robert Crumb, he's quite the character and we should turn those lights down. Yeah, that's good. Maybe we can do a voiceover and this later so it doesn't really matter if we have. Let's do that.

Speaker 3:          00:39:21       Okay. So Robert Crumb was an underground cartoonist is an underground cartoonist and he lived in Berkeley in the late sixties and this documentary was made about him and his family and so I'm going to get you to watch as much of it as we can watch and maybe I'll show you a bit more in the next class so I'm not supposed to because we're supposed to do something else, but I might anyways. Now this film, I love this film for a variety of reasons. First of all, I think it's a work of genius. Second, I've never ever seen any film of any sort that does as good a job of illustrating not only what Freudian psychopathology is and how it manifests itself symbolically, but also how the family plays into it. So away we go

Speaker 4:          00:41:57       me off.

Speaker 3:          00:42:35       Okay. So here's what happened. The film crew wants to go to his house where his brothers still lives and film his brother Charles, who's lived there since he was 55 and he's lived there since he was a teenager. And you notice how Robert uses a very soft voice. He's talking to his mother and you know, he's got a whole. He's a famous guy. He's got a whole film crew there and he's basically asking his mother if it's okay if he brings his friends over and she basically says, well, I don't think that would be such a good idea, and he backs off right away. And then when he gets off the phone he says, well, she said, no, you know, that's it. So you know, that's. That's if you're. If you have a good snake detector working and you're listening and watching closely, you know that there are a tremendous number of snakes under the surface already.

Speaker 4:          00:43:37       The soul of people expressing their connection to eternity, whatever you want to call it, modern doesn't have lost that. People can express themselves that way anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:43:53       So that's a very paradoxical set of statements because on the one hand he's expressing, he says he really loves old music and he loves it because he can hear the soul of the common man being expressed. But then he takes like a pot shot at the entire world of music since 1920, which indicates a tremendous amount of, of implicit arrogance. And he also says that's the only time that he feels any love for humanity. It's like, well, first of all, I'm not sure that his attitude towards humanity as a whole is actually all that relevant. And second, if, if you're, if you've put yourself in the position where you regard yourself as a credible judge of humanity, it's like you might want to take a few steps

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       back from your narcissism, right? Right then and there. So, and I'm not kidding about this, I'll tell you, those kids who showed up at Columbine high school, they had their motivations and they wrote them down and they knew exactly what they were doing. And the leader who was the more literary of the two said quite explicitly that he was the judge of the human race. And as far as he was concerned, it didn't pass his judgment and that you know, that he was perfectly reasonable for him to go on a cleansing binge. You know? And, and he didn't just want to shoot up a whole, you know, a few students in the school, he had bombs planted all over the school. He wanted a whole apocalyptic scene and they had dreamed about blowing up Detroit. And so you could imagine what would happen if someone like him got their finger on the button of the, of the, of a hydrogen bomb. So, you know, young said, if you go deep enough into the shadow, you find hell. It's like, that's exactly right. And it's no joke.

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       This is mom's house.

Speaker 4:          00:48:09       Do you read any good books lately? Just kind of like recycling a lot of these books, recycling.

Speaker 3:          00:48:22       They've got a very interesting voice tone, which, which you might pick up on as well. It's very ironic, like everything they say is ironic. Scott, this kind of bitter and arrogant twist in it and they're talking about absolutely catastrophic things like nightmarishly catastrophic things. Yet there's this sort of adolescent like banter and, and laughter about it

Speaker 4:          00:48:43       when you were reading all year, 20 years ago, do that because there's nothing else you ever read anything new. Really recent writers I'm interested in, most of them are not nearly as interesting as the old lady,

Speaker 3:          00:49:20       so you know, Freud would say here that there's an awful lot of intellectual ization going on and there definitely is. So these, these guys are very divorced from their bodies and they have every reason to be

Speaker 4:          00:49:41       books. Charles is the one that started this whole comic thing. He was completely obsessed with comics. We are kids had absolutely no other normal kid. Interesting. Wasn't interested in toys or games in place. Scores, didn't do anything but read comics for all comics thing. Come and talk and the drawing, the other drawing interest besides the control realistic scenes and you know, just pictures of buildings and cars and stuff was interested in that at all. It's only the earliest one that is still existed. I had as Charles through this one that's supposed to be. And

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       Yeah, so you hear that laugh. It's like that's the situation they're in is adults and Charles could see that coming and he had all sorts of homicidal fantasies about.

Speaker 4:          00:50:41       How about Robert? It was unconsciously imitating when I forced you draw comic books. There's still a kind of sibling rivalry going on between the me and the kids and he was still living in basically the wrong. You're still competing with each other. Drug products. I still think of Charles approval like Charles drawing come.

Speaker 3:          00:51:32       Yeah, so what basically happened was Robert got the world and Charles God, his mother, so they both won, but I have Charles I don't think is very happy with what he want

Speaker 4:          00:51:47       tunes where we sat around and talked about. I was usually the president, vice president, secretary and saying that he was the trailer to still. He still resents the fact that we impose on the role of supply. Boy Them. Excellent was the scapegoat and five kids. He was definitely the bottom of the ocean to explain is that we have these meetings for this, this Columbus Club, comics and Austin and bring out their 10th or different jobs or different like a secretary and prison or vice president on our director Robert did or something that seals. The whole thing is just like incredible, crazy, similar thing in me and Charles and Robert have been slight little room upstairs in the whole rest of the world to know what the fuck is going on, so he's working at it on the trees, you know, it was just together in a closed situation fired by the Disney movie where Robert Newton plays alone.

Speaker 4:          00:53:51       John Silver in episode in 1955 when we started like playing pirates here, like normal kids go out, pretend you've made this shift, that little refrigerator cart and then everything that Charles would walk around town dressed up like long John Silver, crystal coded my mother's as Long Green Code and he made himself a three pointer and has that. He had a crutch and you tied with leg like go around town that way. I hadn't realized that years later fixated Charles really wasn't as treasurer and then this thing done on the native art played aren't as bad as the first six or seven years after that. We do these context about treasure. I became Israel Baroque elaborate thing way beyond the original Disney film. This was one of, Charles is one of our two med, yes, in which he would draw some of the characters, knives are also interact with each other.

Speaker 4:          00:54:47       That was also a great school of cartooning for me is having to come up with clever retorts to him. He was. He's actually much cleaner and funnier than I was. It actually got kind of tiresome. Buddy, you know he had to do it, but he was in charge. Has very like definitely band from about Charles was not. Sometimes I think a lot of them do with like overly morbid sensitivity to the guy or something too as well. Assistant you have a natural affinity to get into your profit. Off of robbery course was someone in the middle man had this wind like restricting and complex, like terrible selfconsciousness restriction and me as a kid, I was like morbidly monster. My body like sex plate completely came time for me to become sexually like a puberty or something like sex with nowhere near my life. You know what?

Speaker 4:          00:55:36       Just put them to sleep. It was like six so heavily repressed, which meant naturally editing. Sneezers started to have a seizure, so this was like a point where your behavior becomes, wow, I have to get into the whole sector versus normal up topic, you know? That's all I thought about when I was in my late teens and early twenties in a sentence and I masturbated about four or five times a week. How frequently did you ask anyone out? My sexual desires. You did. Like I told him the other night. I can't even get any reception know whether it's the one thing or maybe it's a combination of things. Maybe it's a combination of the medication and the lack of external stimulation. Maybe approaching old age to have something meaning any, some external stimulation to keep up your interest? I don't know. Now that my sexual desires in that earliest sexual abuse. Have you ever actually, it will be like 40 years old and getting directions. Here's my aunt or my older sister and her legs and her shoes. Like I need a table instead of going like mother's closet and she had these cowboy boots that she wore when it rained and humping goes in the closet.

Speaker 4:          00:57:02       I already have five or six. I was sexually attracted to bugs bunny bunny, have to cover the chronic bucket to carry the rail with my pocket to get looked at, periodically wrinkled up and handling it so much that they asked me whether the fire engine on the ironing board and flatten it out, and she did not as deeply as appointed because it got old brown. When she died. It crumbled apart. This sexual attraction to keep cartoon characters. You tell me I don't change. When I turned 12, 55, 56, totally obsessed with she lives. Went to bid. Are they of best things I wanted to do with sheep.

Speaker 3:          00:58:23       Now you see how how he conceptualizes himself in relationship to her too, so he's like this while he's a lot smaller than she is and he's clearly depended on her physical strength and ability and so he definitely conceptualized as himself as a subordinate entities

Speaker 4:          00:58:43       very hung up on even more so. I think you were more shy actually. I think you were more afraid of women was as a young person in high school. I had a few dates with girls when you were in high school, you at all with anybody sort of good looking at everything. Almost a handsome, good looking chaplains and teenager. There was just this. Something was wrong with my personality. High school was an absolute nightmare. It was the most unpopular kid in high school. People were always taken on the the male and the girls didn't have anything to do with me. They treated me like I was just there trip by my by predominantly women starting with high school where I learned a lot about women because there was this guy case Gutsche escape here with like the mean bully, but he's also very charming and all the girls liked him. The dream boat that was also bullied in my brother Charles was one of the guys singled out for particular attention. If you get this gang of flowing piece that had around with disguise Ganache, so scene where they were special punches up my brother in the hallway at school sense I to see Charles gave up trying to be popular or had girlfriends or anything. If everybody saw that he could fight back, beat up by Scotch,

Speaker 3:          01:00:34       so that was probably enough to get his depression going because it's a major dominance, hierarchy, defeat, and he was also an outcast, so he's not even in the dominance hierarchy. He was one of the class of boys by his own account that was so contemptible that he wasn't even in the realm of possible date partners for any of the girls. And so when you're thinking about why Robert is dry drawing women with like vicious bird heads, one of the things that you might think about is that for men at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy or outside the dominance hierarchy completely like these guys were all they ever got from girls, including their own mother was rejection like harsh rejection. And it was enough basically. Well it was really in the final analysis. It was enough to kill Charles. Now I'm not blaming the girls, but I'm trying to explain why Robert is expressing himself the way that he's expressing himself. Why these images come up?

Speaker 4:          01:01:31       You gotta take tranquilizers. That makes it a lot easier.

Speaker 3:          01:01:43       You know, and so Charles still has this kind of dream in the back of his head too, which is really the image, the idea that the Charles is living out, which is that Charles has it much easier and much better than he does because he doesn't really have to deal with the world and he can just stay at home and comfort with his mother. It's like he's not in comfort. The guy he commits suicide six months after this film

Speaker 4:          01:02:12       now

Speaker 3:          01:02:13       that's extremely interesting. So young had this idea about synchronicity, you know, he said now and then would happen in the world that we're connected weirdly because of a, like an emotional contagion and it's a very strange idea, but I wanted to show you an example of it because it's actually caught on film here. So when Charles and Robert are talking about their mother, you notice Charles Hunches right over it, right? He's like even more inside than he normally is and they turn into 2:13 year old teenage boys talking upstairs so their mother won't hear them as soon as they mentioned her. She pipes in.

Speaker 4:          01:03:08       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:03:20       Now you see when, when he did hear her, she's complaining about the curtains being closed with something in this camera crew cluttering up your house, which you know, probably hasn't been cleaned since 1957. It's not really that she matters that she cares, that they're there. What she's doing is expressing her dominance and it's. And she does it in a very, uh, very subterranean way and Charles is absolutely terrified of her.

Speaker 4:          01:04:03       No, don't worry about it. It's all going to be out here and I'll be back to normal. Cool. These girls talking about one difference could a date. It's good. She's envious. They all are. This is how I still bitter about it. Most teenage boys are very cool and aggressive and everything like that. If girls would see that I was more kind of insensitive things press, but I expect that I could draw but couldn't understand why they liked these cool, aggressive guys. Not me because I was more kind and sensitive and everything for them. I was more like him, but he realized he didn't want him to be like them. Basically filtered, hurt and cruelly misunderstood because I consider myself talented, intelligent. It's not very attractive physically. I think those things really mattered. It was what's inside. When I was 13 and 14 and trying to be normal teenager, it was like a really ensured.

Speaker 4:          01:05:09       We just, I tried to go. Applicant thought they were acting. It's raw and weird, so then I just stopped completely and just became a shadow and I wasn't even there. People weren't even aware that it was, you know, in, in the same world they are in. That kind of freed me completely because it wasn't under those pressures to be normal. So I got interested in old time music and went to the black section of town, knocking on doors, looking for old records and things like that. It would be unthinkable if you are going to be a normal teenager.

Speaker 3:          01:05:41       So Robert can, despite the fact that he grew up in a family that was very difficult to escape from, did follow his creative interests, you know, and he, he picked a path that was characteristic of individuality and it did get 'em out. You know, he gave up on conformity. But he found an alternative so you know, it's pretty impressive and he did become very, very successful. I want to show you, I can't show you all of what I wanted to show you today, but I do

Speaker 4:          01:06:11       forced me to answer that door and take her outside you to put this girl's armored personality line. Chileans, Rogan, and then you got a good grade on a test. Then you've got the fascinating. There is six weeks here. His other guy got to light jobs, hit you real art, Nice. Five years old at Christmas and this whole thing happened during stack, pleasantly collarbone. Charles a pinching for getting in trouble, very diabolical as a Cuban. And I finally would like beat him unmercifully for these things that he was always these crimes. He was always convincing and it just, it just made him worse. I think the subconscious desire. No, just this. Oh yeah. Here we go.

Speaker 3:          01:07:42       Yeah. I think we've got 10 minutes here. So

Speaker 4:          01:07:53       they started being driven by that session that I'll go down in history as a great artist. That will be my revenge because my image celebrating Valentine's Day 13th, 1962 when I decided to reject conforming, when society rejected me, I heard all that be yourselves to myself. Think I'm does not have to be satisfied with cans and old records. Girls are just utterly out reach. They won't even let me draw them all that change after you get a famous I was used to doing, which was really quite sweet. And then he did this one that was just incredibly hostile to women, very sexual hostile. And I was, I wasn't expecting it and it was really. I was really shocked and taken aback and really just kind of like, it's hard for me to believe that he can just channel in sales doing or work.

Speaker 5:          01:09:02       I like a lot of his work and certainly this is the lyrical aspect of it. But then I find me something completely different reaction, you know, perhaps when I've been really turned off and disgusted. And um, you know, this, this cartoon show blow is when I thought about a lot of light. On the one hand it's a satire of the 19 fifties. The healthy facade of the American family and it kind of exposes the sickness under the surface, but at the same time you sense the crumbs getting off on it himself and some other way and on another level it's an orange sheets, self indulgent orgy in a fantasy. And the fantasy, you know, specifically this story is a story about a father who commands his daughter to give a blow job and she does. Then they wind up having sex and the little sort of leave it to beaver type brother character comes running in and he's the father and his sister and he's shocked and upset.

Speaker 5:          01:10:04       He goes running to the mother and tell her and mom comes out of the closet wearing sort of snm kind of get up and go, oh cool. You know, and the next thing my mom is sending the whole panel ends. The whole cartoon is the parents saying, gee, we should spend more time with the kids. You know, so you don't, you read something like this. And I think that it has gone over the line from satire of a 19 fifties, hygienic, you know, family and denial into something which is just chrome producing pornography. And I think this theme in his word is omnipresent. It's murder. Been arrested, juvenile position.

Speaker 4:          01:11:09       So the mother has these cute things scattered everywhere. We pulled it loose from each other for the most part. You spend all your time down here watching television going across or I spend most of my tops

Speaker 3:          01:11:34       so you can see how well they communicate

Speaker 4:          01:11:40       resources living in this. Well you do, you do most of the talking and the relationship, he said told me that you take those medications. Would you still feel nervous and depressed sometimes? You know, not as. Not as much as I would have been. It wasn't taking. What do you think would have just stopped taking this stuff? And I tried it a couple of times. I didn't like what was starting to see if I were becoming gradually on hinge back on them again. I tried a couple of times. Do you still think they're picking my brain?

Speaker 3:          01:12:29       No. She doesn't have to clean up for the cameras, that's for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:12:35       Charles, some people, I mean some,

Speaker 3:          01:12:43       so you realize that this is a man who spent like 30 years in his room upstairs that has no friends and has never had any friends and now it's his mother's response,

Speaker 4:          01:12:56       five from one extreme to the streets and one of the last time you slept old lady in the street and started drilling or a better spiritual your life and she just like got really frightened and threaten to call the police and everything. Go to these strangers on the streets or 30, but that kind of stuff, but always got in trouble and everyone else can be one good reason for leaving illegal drug is miserable is true. I saw all this $200 ticket upstairs. Ever. See anybody take a basketball once in six weeks. I believe in a certain pride in yourself for your answer. Why not a ratio gets out of hand or you're an EGOMANIAC? Something in relation to them. Yeah. Your hygiene habits are pretty good. Constipated,

Speaker 1:          01:14:52       15 more seconds.

Speaker 4:          01:15:11       Your kids are always giving a success story were real little. I had to take care of your and giving us all innovations that didn't work out. We didn't meet interested in legs and feet. It's very difficult.

Speaker 1:          01:15:46       Well, that gives you some indication of a Freudian family. It's not pretty good luck on the exam on Thursday. As you know already the. There are lots of sample questions posted on the net, so it's all. It's here right.
