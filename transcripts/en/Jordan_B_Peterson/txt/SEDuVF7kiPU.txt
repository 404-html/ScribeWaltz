Speaker 1:          00:01          Yellow, so some of you may have heard about the Google memo that has been circulating virally around the Internet for the last couple of days that was written by James Demore who was fired for it last night and a colleague of his reached out to me and put us together and so I'm going to talk to James today about exactly what happened and why and perhaps what should be done about it. So I'll. So that's what we're going to do. The interview I had with him, which finished at about 3:00 on Tuesday, August eighth. Follows immediately after this introduction. Hi everybody. I'm speaking today with James Demore and an unidentified google employee who wishes to remain anonymous. Reasons that I think are obvious. And James last week put his hand in a blender by circulating an internal memo that I would say has become somewhat infamous. So James, let's start with, let's start with a bit of discussion about you tell us who you are, about your background and about what you were doing at Google.

Speaker 2:          01:21          Alright. Yeah. So I was actually just, you know, I really interested in science and psychology and stuff and then I really liked puzzles and that's how I got into Google. Actually I did one of their coding competitions, they just recruited me out of that. And so I Google, I was mostly working on search and image and video searches.

Speaker 1:          01:47          So what's. Tell us about your educational background a bit.

Speaker 2:          01:51          Alright. Yeah. So I just did a random science and math and undergrad and I ended up with a degree. I didn't really know what I was gonna do. So I started doing research at Mit and then uh, I went to a systems biology at Harvard. I initially wanted to work with Martin Nowak. He's really great in evolution and Game Theory. But uh, then I started working on other things.

Speaker 1:          02:21          So tell us a bit of road systems biology. What, what is that exactly? What kind of research were you doing?

Speaker 2:          02:27          Alright. Yeah. So systems biology has many different meanings but it's generally just mathematical biology and uh, I guess seeing biological systems as a whole rather than just individual molecules. And so I, I liked looking at populations and so my interest in evolution.

Speaker 1:          02:52          So why did that make you a viable candidate at Google? It's eight.

Speaker 2:          02:58          Uh, I think they just saw a smart guy that could code.

Speaker 1:          03:05          Now you've been there three years, is that correct? But also as an intern before that?

Speaker 2:          03:09          Yeah. So about four years total.

Speaker 1:          03:11          And so how would you say you've performed as an employee and Google and people being happy with you or have you been here?

Speaker 2:          03:18          No, I, I got promoted twice. My last review was a, the highest possible to per which is the top two percentile. So it definitely wasn't based on performance if they fire me.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Have you enjoyed working at Google as it being a good experience?

Speaker 2:          03:37          Yeah, I love Google. That's horrible part. Like I've always been the biggest Google fanboy, all like I've never had an iphone. I've always tried to convince my friends to use android and all of these different things. And yeah, I mean this is just puts a sour taste in my mouth.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Okay. So, so you've got a good educational background. You were interested in things that Google would be interested in. Your good coder, you've worked with him for a number of years, have done an excellent job and you're pretty pro google. That's basically the background. Okay. Now last week you wrote a memo which has attracted a tremendous amount of attention and in that memo you, you made a number of claims and the claims were, and please correct me if I've got this, if I'm not summarizing this property, you were attempting to describe reasons why there might be a lack of gender parody might exist within Google, for example, and with an NGO, engineering or broadly, but also in occupations more broadly. And you, um, you laid out a very elaborated document and I reviewed it and as far as I can tell, your opinions are well supported by the relevant psychological science. And I think what I'll do in the description of this video when I link it is putting the references so then people can decide for themselves. I want to put up a webpage about gender differences in general, but I'll try to hit the highlights for this particular document. So why did you do this?

Speaker 2:          05:14          Yeah, so about a month and a half ago I went to one of our diversity summits, all of it on recorded and super secret and they told me a lot of things that I thought just were not right.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Okay. What do you mean unrecorded and super secret?

Speaker 2:          05:34          Well, I mean they were telling us about a lot of these potentially illegal practices that they've been doing to try to increase diversity and

Speaker 1:          05:45          what kinds of practices?

Speaker 2:          05:48          Uh, well basically treating people differently based on what their race or gender are. Yeah. Basically. I see.

Speaker 1:          05:58          I'm so, and it was ultra secret and unrecorded and in what manner?

Speaker 2:          06:03          Uh, yeah. So I, most meetings I Google, I recorded anyone at Google watch it. We're trying to be really open about everything except for this now. They don't want any paper trail for any of these things.

Speaker 1:          06:16          Well, okay. Why?

Speaker 2:          06:19          Because I think it's illegal and I mean as some of the internal polls showed, there were a large percent of people that agreed with me on the document and so if everyone got to see this stuff then they would really bring up some criticism,

Speaker 1:          06:38          a large number of people in Google and a very large number of well-informed biological scientists we might also add. So I was quite struck by your document given that. No, it would have been at a decent document for a well informed psychologists research psychologist to. Right. But it was somewhat of an outsider, but you've got the, you got the highlights. Accurate as far as I'm concerned. So. Okay. So you went to this diversity meeting and you weren't happy with the sorts of things that you were being told and with the practices are, is that both correct? Yeah. And what we're being told.

Speaker 2:          07:16          Well, so that, I mean there's a lot of ways in which they pressure people to increase the diversity of their team. And now there's no way to do that besides actually choosing someone based on their race or gender. Right?

Speaker 1:          07:33          Mean, precisely.

Speaker 2:          07:37          Uh, I am more women or underrepresented racial minorities.

Speaker 3:          07:45          Can I jump in? Yeah, yeah. I, I would hesitate to say that that's 100 percent true. One hundred percent right. So the organization that I'm in, I have not personally seen anything that I would deem crossed the line, you know, I personally believe that there are a good amount of synergies to be found if you can combine, you know, slightly different ideologies into a room and that is the, the thesis that some groups are working towards. Um, obviously there's going to be a distribution of how people follow the rules. Um, and you know, it's unfortunate to hear that it's, you know, it could be that some people fall to the wrong side of that distribution, but that certainly wouldn't, it would not apply to everybody.

Speaker 1:          08:35          Certainly. It certainly also distressing to hear that there is acceptance of the idea that diversity can be mapped onto race and gender, especially with regards to performance because there's no evidence for that whatsoever. So. Okay, so you went to this meeting and then you decided to write this document and um, how long had you been working on it before he released it?

Speaker 2:          08:59          Yeah, so I was doing it throughout my free time. I, and I just wanted to clarify my thoughts on this and I really just want it to be proven wrong because, you know, if what I was saying was right then something bad is happening and so about a month ago I submitted it to feed back to that program and you know, I saw that people looked at it but no one actually said anything.

Speaker 1:          09:24          And what did you submit?

Speaker 2:          09:27          Uh, I mean I basically said what I said in the, in the document and then I linked to the document itself and so I actually published this about a month ago

Speaker 4:          09:38          and

Speaker 2:          09:39          it was only after it got viral and then we to the news that Google started carrying,

Speaker 1:          09:46          how did it go viral and how was it leaked?

Speaker 2:          09:51          Yeah. So I, there is a group at Google called skeptics and so I was like, okay, maybe they'll be able to prove me wrong in some way. Like they're skeptical about things, right. I wasn't naive I guess, and so I sent them a message like, okay, what do you think about this? Is Google in some sort of echo chamber or I'm crying and echo chamber

Speaker 4:          10:15          and,

Speaker 2:          10:17          and then it just exploded after that. And you know, our internal. Yeah. It was just spread throughout all google.

Speaker 1:          10:27          Do you and do you know, was it the, was it the skeptic's group that started to spread it around?

Speaker 4:          10:33          Yeah. And then

Speaker 2:          10:35          there were a lot of upper management that uh, you know, specifically called it out and started saying how harmful it is and how is unacceptable. This sort of viewpoint is not allowed at Google.

Speaker 1:          10:49          Yeah. What sort of viewpoint? Exactly the idea that there are differences between men and women that actually might play a role in, in, in, in, in the, in the, in the corporate world. That's an opinion that's not acceptable.

Speaker 2:          11:02          Yeah, it seems a,

Speaker 1:          11:05          well, understandably it is just these issues are tricky morally and politically, but thing that was disturbing to me about watching the response to you is that as far as I can tell, there isn't anything that you said in that paper. First of all that is in fact biased in the manner that should open you up to the sorts of charges that have been opened up against you or that violates the scientific literature as it currently stands. So both of those are rather distressing.

Speaker 2:          11:35          Yeah, and there's a lot of misrepresentation by upper management just to silence me I think.

Speaker 1:          11:42          Yes. And why is that? You think like why? Why is it the Google couldn't have actually you think that Google couldn't have come out and have an intelligent discussion about this instead of. Well first of all, releasing like Danny, I read Danielle Brown's response to you, which I thought was absolutely appalling. It was formed and the following and then they fired you, which seems to be like really bad pr move, but more importantly doesn't actually deal with the issues at hand. You know, they're basically saying something like, well, what was the rationale for firing you? Exactly what was the excuse that was given?

Speaker 2:          12:15          So the official case was that I was perpetuating gender stereotypes

Speaker 1:          12:19          that you were perpetuating gender stereotypes? Yeah. And did they say anything else about your performance or about anything else that you'd done?

Speaker 2:          12:28          No, it was, that was the only reason.

Speaker 1:          12:31          And who, who, who fired you? Technically?

Speaker 2:          12:35          Uh, it was my hr representative and my director.

Speaker 1:          12:41          Okay. And do you end, do you have any idea on who's ordered they were acting or if this was something that they conjured up themselves or.

Speaker 2:          12:50          I, I'm sure I probably went from higher up than that because I missed a huge pr move. So they would need approval from higher ups.

Speaker 1:          13:02          Right. And I think the CEO, the CEO actually made some comments about the issue today, which I'll probably cut into this video as we, as I edited. So yeah. Okay. Alright. So the first question is how are you doing?

Speaker 2:          13:20          I'm doing okay. I there's a lot of messages that I'm trying to sort through and just trying to figure out what I should do now, but

Speaker 1:          13:30          yeah, you've been given some interesting job offers as far as I know.

Speaker 2:          13:35          Yeah, I've gotten a surprising amount as part. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:38          Yeah. Well, I suspect, I'm sorry, I'm virtually certain that you have a majority viewpoint. It's just the people who hold the alternative perspective, which are the radical social constructionist types, who insists that everything is a consequence of socialization. There are a little bit more organized politically, but they're clearly wrong. Scientifically they're wrong factually the wrong ethically for that. So. So you, you probably have more support than you think and it'll be very interesting to see how that turns out. So, so what do you think about having written this mean now? Your life is going to be turned upside down and for quite a while I suspect. I mean, so you put yourself out on the line doing this, so what do you think about that?

Speaker 2:          14:27          It definitely sucks, but at least I was proven right know

Speaker 1:          14:33          when. What do you mean by proven right?

Speaker 2:          14:35          Oh, just the whole culture just tries to silence. I needed a dissenting view and then we really need some more objective way of looking at these.

Speaker 1:          14:52          Yeah, well I felt the same way with the University of Toronto decided to, you know, an attempt to shut me down after I need my videos. I thought, well that just proves my point because I mean I made the videos saying, well I don't like the climate that's developing it. It's making it very difficult to have conversations about certain things. And your example is even more egregious I think because at least objected to a piece of legislation that in principle would have been a benefit to an identifiable group, but say the transgender group, I don't believe it is of any benefit to them, but you could make a case that it was, but you. All you did as far as I can tell is review the modern personality literature and the literature on individual differences relating to men and women and other groups. And there's actually not very much your opinion in your piece at all. So what that means is that it is not possible to actually have a discussion about the scientific literature on these issues without putting yourself at risk and that's a hell of a thing for an engineer because being engineers and rely on the facts as far as I can tell. And one of the things I like about engineers is that they tend to stick fairly closely to the facts that they're not a very political group. You know, generally speaking, they're much more practical.

Speaker 1:          16:15          I don't know how they can expect a silence. So many engineers then intelligent people and just

Speaker 4:          16:23          deny science. Like it's like

Speaker 1:          16:24          this. Yeah. Well the question too is what are your supporters within Google going to do? Because you know, I would say you're a great warning man, because you, you showed what happened, you showed exactly what happens if you have enough, I don't know what you'd call it, curiosity and courage I suppose, but, but mostly curiosity to lay out what you think for discussion. You opened this conversation. You said that you weren't jumping up and down and insisting you were right. You were trying to lay out what you understood from doing a fair bit of reading and, and make the case that the, these facts, the facts about the differences between men and women and employment choice and payment and all that aren't being discussed and they're not being discussed. I mean we know for example, and I'll put this citation down in the description, has been very difficult for the Swedes, for example, to flatten out the gender distribution for engineers in Sweden and in and in and in the Scandinavian countries in general, despite their advanced social engineering, let's call it.

Speaker 1:          17:38          And they also can get male nurses, you know, I think it's four out of five nurses in Scandinavia, if I remember correctly, are female and the reverse number are our engineers are male and you know, that seems to be associated with this quite well founded. Um, scientific observation that women tilt towards interest in people and men tilt towards interest in things and that that's associated with testosterone exposure in utero. This is science. Anybody beating an ideological trump because most of the people I would say that most of the people who are publishing this would have been even happier. How did turned out the other way, you know, the findings actually run contrary to their biases because academia is generally full of people whose biases are less and now and then you know, scientific findings emerged to dispute on India. Logical proposition not certainly the case with role of biology versus society in establishing gender differences. So the science is very credible. It doesn't mean it's completely beyond dispute, but that's not the point either because your survey was actually pretty decent survey of the current state of affairs with regards to individual differences. That doesn't mean it's right. So, okay, so what, what are your, what are your, what does your family think about all this?

Speaker 2:          19:06          Yeah, they definitely support me, but they don't really know what I should do from here. They don't want me to just go to a ton of news corporations and do all these interviews and stuff and because they just want to twist whatever I say towards their agenda to. It's not really clear what I should be doing.

Speaker 1:          19:26          Yeah, well, there's certainly no shortage of people that want to talk to you. I mean, I'd been contacted by four or five journalists who would like to speak with you. We can talk about that afterwards. I can let you know who they are, but um, yeah. Well you've got a, you've got a conundrum on your hands. No, I mean you're, you're a, you're a very straightforward person and you're obviously not grinding any acts, at least not in any order is waiting. So my suspicions are that talking to the right people could be substantial use to you, but I guess it also depends on what it is that you want me. And that's something we can talk about now you've, you've,

Speaker 1:          20:09          you've rattled up the cages have a fair number of people and a fairly large organization, interestingly enough just on the heels of Google and youtube. So the announcement about the new free speech restrictions on, on Youtube, you know, and their incorporation of Ngo who's into that sensor set process. So it's been quite a week for Google I would say. So you've opened up this can of worms, what is it that, so imagine if you're looking six months down the road and say, and things happened that were good because of what you did, what is it that you would like to have happen

Speaker 2:          20:46          at the very least I want, because I do still care about google. I want some conversation to be had and for the ideologues to not just have their way, but yeah, I still don't have a clear vision on how exactly this will happen. How, how this can spread farther than just google

Speaker 1:          21:11          well farther than just google.

Speaker 2:          21:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:15          You know, um, I mean I would say my experiences with the premise is that the first thing that happens that will happen is that you'll get jumped on by people who call you the sorts of epithets that would be appropriate if you were a bad guy and you should just shut up and go away. Okay. That's already happened. But I think you're going to get through that real quick because I went through your, um, your writings which are not as screened by the way on are certainly not anti diversity street. I went to the writing center and I can't see anything there that identifies you as the sort of person that can be easily and permanently tarred with a hateful epithets. But you know, it's logical for the public, let's say, including the media to jump on someone like you when they blow a whistle.

Speaker 1:          22:05          Because the first thing that you might presume if someone's causing trouble is that there's something wrong with them. So then you have to sort of beat them awhile with the idea that there's something wrong with them to see what happens. And so the first thing is you have to withstand that, but there don't seem to be any smoking pistols into your background. So for example, you were in an ideal Google employee, well that protects you a lot and you don't have a history of this, of any sort of trouble making and you have a solid educational background and you're clearly a reasonable person. And so the first thing is just to steel yourself to get through that. And then what happened, I think if you do talk to media organizations and especially if you talk to them the way that you're talking to me, which is extraordinarily calm and composed, then you're going to reveal yourself even more as a reasonable person and the press overall will start to shift behind you. And I think the reason for that is one thing you got to remember about the press is that when push comes to shove, they're actually rather in favor of free speech giving. Without it they would be dead.

Speaker 1:          23:17          So I don't think like, I don't think that you have to worry about being exploited and twisted by media sources. I actually think that it might be to your advantage to talk to people, you know, you can figure out who those people are, but you're just not the kind of person that can be easily transformed into a villain. And the more that you can demonstrate that, the better might be, you know, for the cause that you're engaged in, but also for yourself. So what? So like how are you feeling about this emotionally? You must be in a bit of a state of shock.

Speaker 2:          24:01          Thanks. It's been a stressful week for sure. I'm not feeling too negative about it. Yeah, I. It hasn't fully hit me, I don't think.

Speaker 1:          24:17          Yeah. Well it will because God only knows what's gonna happen to you over the next few weeks. Right? It's going to be a real rollercoaster. And the other thing that you might consider is that it's possible that this will turn out extraordinarily positive for you. You know, there's gonna be it's gonna be a rough ride, but to the degree that you are accurate in your observations, then you know it's not that easy to. It's not that easy for the opponents of truth to have a battle with truth. It's not easy to have a battle that you tended to lose. So can I just go over some of the things that you sent so that we can discuss it. So I'm going to take a look here. So you started with a pretty good solid statement. I would say Google's political bias has equated the freedom from offense with psychological safety, but shaming into silence is the antithesis of psychological safety.

Speaker 1:          25:14          Well, that seems even more relevant now in your situation. The science is created ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too sacred to be honestly discuss. Well, we can check that one off too, right? It certainly seems to indicate that was the case. The lack of discussion discussion fosters the most extreme and authoritarians elements of this ideology. Some of the extreme, the extreme is all disparities in representation or do new oppression. That's a good one, right? That's a univariate hypothesis. It's very, very simple minded. And then the authoritarian element, you defined as the idea we should discriminate correct for this oppression. Great. And then you make a claim just difference in distributions of traits between men and women May in part explain why we don't have 50 percent representation of women in tech and leadership discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair. Divisive and bad for business.

Speaker 1:          26:09          Okay, so that's your thesis and then you go along and try to justify it. So the first thing you do is talk about left wing versus right wing biases, and I should point out that you don't concentrate on the left biases or on the right biases. You're completely even handed with regards to laying out the pros and cons. So the lack of compassion for the week. Disparities are due to injustices. Humans are inherently cooperative changes, good slash unstable, open an idealistic, fair enough man, you're dead on with regards to the relevant psychological literature. Where are we seeing that political correctness is motivated by agreeableness and that liberalism is fundamentally predicted by openness and the right biases. Respect for authority, disparities are natural. Adjust humans are inherently competitive. Changes, dangerous, stable. That would be high conscientiousness, low openness and they're closed rather than open and pragmatic rather than idealist. Yeah. Well, I don't think any reasonable person could read that column and say that you were coming down hard on the side of either part of the political spectrum.

Speaker 3:          27:18          Dr Peterson. Can I jump in with a question? It appears from my interactions with many people that they are projecting words that were not written onto the paper and would you be able to elaborate on the schemas that people develop and how they classify information in their minds because this is very much how stereotypes form I would think, um, is by kind of just grouping a bunch of disparate but semi related people or things together and then projecting an idea that may or may not pertain to that.

Speaker 1:          27:55          Yeah. Well, it's a, it's a low resolution thought issue. I mean, what, what's happened to James is that he, you know, he, he, he put up his hand and said, wait a second, I don't agree with the diversity ideology. And he was immediately declassified essentially as a misogynist and bigot. And that's the simplest thing to do, right? Because misogynists and bigots, we'll hold viewpoints that are anti female and racist. And so it's a lot easier just to paint someone with a broad brush, especially if they're violating the tenants of your implicit temperament, let's say. Then it is to dive into the details were real thought occurs. And I think one of the sins that James committed was that he actually dared to make this about details rather than about vague hand waving ideology that's very annoying to people who don't want to think because in order to analyze his claims, you'd have to go through, well let's say 20 or 30 scientific papers and actually understand what they mean.

Speaker 1:          29:00          And that's very annoying, especially if you're pursuing a given agenda. So. Okay. So then you say neither side is 100 percent correct. And both viewpoints are necessary for a functioning society or in this case company. Yeah, well I think the data is solid there too. I mean our research has indicated that open people who are primarily liberal start companies and the more closed people, the conservatives, the traditionalist are good at running them. They're better at being managers and administrators that's associated with high conscientious. So you've got it right there. A company too far to the right, maybe too slow to react over a higher hierarchical and uninteresting and accompany too far to the left will overdressed, diversify its interests already trusts it's employees and competitors and change perhaps to rapidly. Yeah, great, fine, perfect. Nicely balanced as far as I can tell, only facts and reasons can shed light on these biases, but when it comes to diversity and inclusion, Google's left bias is created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming descenders into silence.

Speaker 1:          30:04          Well, that certainly seems to be the case this time as removes any checks against encroaching extremist and authoritarian policies, right? Like Google, we're regularly told that implicit unconscious and explicit biases are holding women back in tech and leadership. Of course, men and women experienced bias in the workplace differently. We should be cognizant of that, but it's far from the whole story on average men and women biologically different. In many ways. These aren't just socially constructed because they're universal across cultures. Clear biological causes links to prenatal testosterone. Biological males castrate them at birth and raised. His females often still identify and act like males. The underlying traits are highly heritable and they're exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective. No, I'm not saying that all men differ from women in the following ways or that these differences are just, and then you put it into nice chart indicating that the amount of overlap between men and women per trade is greater than the amount of difference.

Speaker 1:          31:04          Right, and so you state that directly. That's. That's perfect. That's a very good way of defending your thesis and also of not overstating the case. Then you do a nice job of of also graphically indicating what happens if the distribution is ignored and people are just treated as if they're a unit polar representatives of a given group, which is kind of what the what the people who are predicating the push for diversity on gender and race are assuming. Right. Which is. Which is really so funny because it's really a biologically essentialist argument. Much, much greater than than than the argument that you're making, which is that men and women and the members of different races are so different that in order for a full diversity of viewpoint to be achieved, you have to pull in people by race and gender which which, which implicitly states that the differences are so great that the distributions don't overlap.

Speaker 1:          32:03          You couldn't make them more racist and misogynist statement than that and it's, and it's also technically wrong because men and women are more alike than they are different. Maybe if you summed up all the differences, you could absolutely differentiate between, you know, in all likelihood you could, but some of those differences are clinically irrelevant to the workplace. Okay. Then you go through the personality difference literature and you're. You're exactly right on that. I see that the CEO took you to task for using the word neuroticism. However, that is the technical term in the personality literature and there are historical reasons for that. I'm a better word, might be negative emotion, but it's clearly the case that women are higher in negative emotion than men, and that means that they are on average, less tolerant of uncertainty and stress. They suffer more psychologically for for the equivalent levels of uncertainty and stress, and that is also why cross culturally women have more depressive disorders and anxiety disorders and the research on that is rock solid rock solid men have their own problems, right?

Speaker 1:          33:07          They're more likely to be antisocial, they're much more likely to be in prison, they're more likely to have learning disabilities. So it's stating that there are differences in the rates of certain kinds of psychopathology. It doesn't put any either gender into a position of relative inferiority. So, and then you quote research that suggests that greater nation level, gender equality leads to psychological dissimilarity, dissimilarity and men and women's personality traits. Absolutely. That's what the Scandinavian studies indicate. There's been a number of them and they're very large studies, so you've got that right. What? What does what the researchers demonstrated was that as Ka Ka, Ka, as countries move to flatten out the socio economic playing field and remove discrimination, the differences between men and women are many of the differences between men and women maximize instead of minimize it and in Scandinavia you really see maximization of the difference in men and women with regards to interest in people versus interest in.

Speaker 1:          34:11          Thanks. A major, major issue. Men's higher drive for status. Yeah. Well we know that women are hyper agamous and that they choose men on the basis of their socioeconomic status, right? Well documented cross culturally and also just rational because women have to make themselves dependent when they are pregnant and when they have infants, so that makes perfect sense for them to seek out the most competent person they can manage, the most common and generous person they can manage in order to help them bear the burden. So, so not no, no dispute there at least know you're not diverting from the central tenants of evolutionary psychology and biology. People will disseminate those findings, but you're not conjuring this out of thin air. There's a nice in scientific literature behind you, so, and you know, it's also very interesting to look at the US labor stats on gender differences in occupations, you know, because it's so funny to watch the radical feminists only go after the high status occupations.

Speaker 1:          35:21          It's like 100 percent of brick layers are net. We don't hear that being being a complaint about. And of course men occupied most of the outside jobs, they move more and they will do more of the dangerous jobs as well. Um, so, so these are all factors that are, are relevant but completely undiscussed as far as I can tell by this sort of ideological types that have been going after you. So women are on average, more cooperative. Yeah. Especially with members of their ingroup. Whether they're more cooperative with members of their outgroup is a different story, right? Because agreeable people are in group oriented and very hard on outgroup members, which I think is partly why the pc types are so hard on their enemies because you guard the nest predators, predators on infants essentially. Something like that. Women on average are more prone to anxiety. Yes. That's true. A women on average look for more work life balance. That seems to be the case. I don't know if the literature on that is tight, you know, but it's certainly the case that law firms, for example, have a hell of a time keeping their women in, in partnership positions because most of them don't want to work the 60 hour work week, 60 to 80 hour work weeks that are necessary to performance at that extremely high level.

Speaker 3:          36:44          So Dr Peterson for, for anybody who might be new listening in, you mentioned that a lot of women might not be interested in working 60 to 80 hour work week. Do you think it would make sense to expand upon that just a little bit? Um, I know you talked through hyper to me, but you've also mentioned the thing about why would anybody want to do that no matter what your gender is.

Speaker 1:          37:07          We got to get the mystery right here. The mystery isn't why there are a bunch of people who are low status because almost everyone's low status comparatively speaking, right? Men and women alike. It's a small minority of people who were high status on any dimension and they tend to be hyper successful and they tend to be men. So you see this in scientific publishing, for example. So the median professor male publishes as much as the median professor, female, but the vast majority of the, of the high publishing people are males. And that seems to be because there are a small percentage of males who are very static, very focused, very energetic, and very much prone to put their career first. And part of the theory for why that is, is that some men are that, that the, the, the, um, evolutionary and sexual tradeoff for men with regards to high status is much higher than it is for women. So there's good documentation and I can find these references to that. The number of sexual partners or opportunities that a man has in previous year as tightly associated with the socioeconomic status. Whereas the number of partners or opportunities for partnering that a woman has is negatively correlated with your status. And that might be partly because high status women who are looking for either even higher status men priced themselves out of the mating market and there's actually pretty good of that as well. So. So you're fine, you're fine with all of that.

Speaker 1:          38:43          The harm of Google was biases to achieve a more equal gender and race representation. Google has created several discriminatory practices programs, mentoring in classes only for people with a certain gender or race, a high priority queue and special treatment for diversity candidates hiring practice, which can effectively lower the bar for diversity candidates by decreasing the false negative rate. Yeah, that's a big problem. Either have standards early, don't. The problem is is that if the standards producing inequitable outcome, then what happens is people criticize the standards and that would be fine if, if the standards board no relationship to the job. But the problem is, is that if you have your hiring practices set up halfway intelligently and, and, and it's never perfect, you're actually hiring for attributes that would make a job defectiveness much more likely. Yeah. So how did you come across all this information? A part of it was through that diversity summit and just looking through all the stuff that we have online or in through our internal sites. Yeah, so you can do in a certain bit of literature review. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:58          These practices are based on false assumptions generated by our biases and can actually increase race and gender tensions. Yeah. Well, the whole unconscious bias thing is a great example of that is like first of all those tasks, the implicit association tests are nowhere near reliable or valid enough, so nowhere near the quality necessary to diagnose anyone as having a unconscious bias. Second, second, the data relating those so called unconscious biases to actual behavior is weak. Third, there was no evidence whatsoever that anti unconscious bias training programs have any positive effect whatsoever and some that they have negative effect, partly because people don't like to be called racists and marched off to forest reeducation training, so suggestions. Demoralized diversity. Yeah, that would be good. And start to define it more appropriately, right? Just start having a real conversation about what proper hiring practices should be, which should be objective standards universally applied without bias because that's the best we can do that. That's still going to introduce some non equal outcomes, but of course hiring practices are designed to do that. For example, clearly designed to reward more intelligent people who is highly heritable. That's actually a real problem. Yeah, definitely. And we definitely set up hiring practices to reward conscientious people.

Speaker 1:          41:28          So, um, what are, what, what about banks need to negative emotion? It seems to me that screening for stress, which is a reasonable thing to do in high stress jobs unless you want to put the person in the position where they're likely to collapse, to be miserable. I don't see any utility and not

Speaker 3:          41:47          Dr Peterson. I had a question relating to that from an employment standpoint. Is there an Optima, um, sensitivity to stress that you've seen from the most economically productive employees? By that I mean, I feel like there's a middle ground between people who are laid back versus people who are, um, probably overstimulated by external factors that make them self conscious. And these people, I think at least at the lower mid levels of many companies actually have a little bit more anxiety that powers their ascension through the dominance hierarchy.

Speaker 1:          42:26          Yeah. Well it's a tricky issue because you're probably the sort of negative emotion that might be useful in motivating you is probably more associated with conscientiousness. Then with neuroticism, neuroticism seems to be pretty tightly to anxiety and emotional pain, frustration, disappointment, grief. Those all sort of fit into those categories. Whereas the negative emotion perhaps that's associated with conscientiousness and industriousness in particular seems to be more something like self contempt and disgust and so conscientious people are made uncomfortable by their lack of productive effort, but that doesn't seem to be associated with trait neuroticism. It's a different thing. So that's partly why it's so necessary to get the psychometrics. Right, right. And to get the. To get the measurement right. So the best hiring, the best hiring screeners are the big five personality tests, roughly speaking especially weighted towards conscientiousness and for complex jobs in general. Cognitive ability test. Although there is some question about the legality of those in the current political situation. So all alienating conservatives disposed noninclusive and generally bad business because conservatives tend to be higher in conscientiousness, which is required for much of the judge and maintenance work characteristic of a mature company. Yes, absolutely. So

Speaker 1:          43:54          now here's what you suggest. Confront those biases. While you've done that. We've seen how that went. I would start by breaking down. Google is scores by political orientation and personality to give a fuller picture and do our how our biases are affecting our culture. That's a fine idea. Stop restricting programs and classes to certain genders or races. Yes. Well obviously having open and honest discussion about the costs and benefits of our diversity programs. Well, I guess that's what we're trying to do right now. Discriminating just to increase the representation of women in tech is misguided and biased. Is mandating increases for women's representation in homeless work related that violent as prisons and school dropouts. Yes. It's the same thing and it's the same issue as the bricklayer issue as well. And what are you going to do? You're going to chase the nurses out of the women out of nursing and medicine and psychology and social work. And and university undergraduate programs where they're radically overrepresented. So what about Jews? You're going to get rid of them too. They're overrepresented in most complex occupations and Asians as well. So are you only, you're only going to do this in very limited circumstances. You're gonna. Figure out some way to put a limit on that or you seems very unlikely.

Speaker 3:          45:11          I almost wonder what the Adl is, you know, we'll be thinking six, six months from now or 12 months from now, given the high number of, you know, at least in the United States, I'm Ashkenazi Jews in leadership positions at companies that are advocate advocating for less of themselves are less people who are in the bucket that they're in.

Speaker 1:          45:31          Yeah. Well as long as the discussion centers on the overrepresentation of white men, people seem to have no problem, but you start to break that down a little bit. And because a Jewish white men are particularly overrepresented as well, I'm going to make an issue out of that. Really. We're going to do that. So now the Asians are already having a harder time getting into universities. So that's well documented. So. And that that's a terrible thing, partly because of the cost to the individuals involved, but also the cost to society because it means that we're not taking the people who are most competent and allowing them to expand their education to the greatest degree possible. And because there aren't that smart competent people are actually rather rare and it's just society's advantage to exploit the hell out of them and pay them well for that.

Speaker 1:          46:19          But it's not like they're of no benefit and everyone knows that when they try to hire someone. Competent de emphasize empathy. Yes. Empathy is a good ethic for small family units and a terrible ethic to run a company by. It looks like conscientiousness is the right ethic to run a company, but I think conscientiousness, we don't have good animal models for conscientious will say. But I think conscientiousness probably evolved so that human beings could, could operate in groups that were larger than just kingsize, you know, because equity makes sense that a kitten level. Every mother wants her children to have a good outcome in life and once resources distributed equally between them. So it's not like it's something that doesn't have a niche micro prioritize intention, our focus on microaggressions, etc. And other unintentional transgressions increases our sensitivity. You do A nice job of criticizing.

Speaker 1:          47:17          Now I read derald wing sue's book on microaggression. It's an appalling. It's appalling load of tripe to put it bluntly and I believe scott lilienfeld, who's a very good psychologist, has recently published a shredding the the construct validity of the concept of microaggression. So it's a nonviolent construct right from the bottom up. It's purely ideological in nature and it's also one of those constructs that allows anyone who's offended to to weaponize. They're weaponized discourse around it. So reconsider making unconscious training bias training. Mandatory for promotion committees. Yeah. That should be considered. It should be stopped. There's no scientific basis whatsoever for proceeding with that operation. so. Great. Well, you know, it's a pretty straightforward document as far as I'm concerned and I've gone through it with a fairly fine tooth comb as a behavioral scientist and I would like to state for the record that I believe that what you said in there, if not accurate, was at least representative of the current state of art, a mall, well trained psychometrically. I'm informed psYchologists who are experts in the field of individual difference, so congratulations to pay such a price for it.

Speaker 1:          48:41          All right, well thank you very much for the conversation. Oh, one other question. Why did you agree to talk to me? I am a huge fan, so I know that you went through similar things being any influence on, on this you're going to pay on. Actually, I'm not sorry. I'd like to say I was sorry, but I'm not actually really clean. I, I do think that you're going to be pay a big price for this, but that the net consequences will be very positive and I'm. I, I think you did an excellent job on this document. I think you were very careful. I think the fact that you're being labeled with episodes and that you were fired is absolutely reprehensible. It's clear to me that you're just trying to figure out what the hell is going on and that you know you're not, you're not any of the things that people would like to think you are so that they don't have to bloody well.

Speaker 1:          49:40          Think about what it is that you said it did, so congratulations to you that courageous people are rare and you put yourself on the line and I really learned that in the last year. So I would say keep your head up. Assume that this is gonna work out. I wouldn't hide from the press because the press is actually, you're the right person for the press to be something for you to use. Know you're well spoken, you're quiet, you're, you're, you're convincing your rational. Um, you're obviously at least you come across as a decent guy very, very rapidly.

Speaker 1:          50:20          There's no reason I would say there's no reason not to let people see who you are because I think that would improve your credibility and make your message even more powerful. So you think, no doubt, I mean you're, you are, have every right to defend your privacy, you know, but, and that's fine, but I don't think that you have any reason to be afraid of depressed. I would say a couple of things when you're talking to the press, don't apologize. Don't tell people what you're not, don't tell them that you're not going to get a massage that's a technical error and stick to your damn guns. You kNow, as, as, as quIetly and forthright as you can. And now you're going to come out on top of this because you're, you're on the side of the right as far as I'm concerneD.
