Speaker 1:          00:02          Hi everyone. It's January 15th a few weeks ago in a discussion with Dave Ruben, I announced that I would be closing my patrion account as of today, so I am doing so as Dave has or will shortly. I'm not pleased about this in any way and patrons, innovative service helped me a lot when I was first in trouble because of the videos I made criticizing the Canadian compelled speech bills, see 16 and the University of Toronto's forest anti-biased training policy, but I don't think what patron has decided to do in the case of Sar gone have a cad. Carl Benjamin was right and I think it sets a bad precedent so that's that

Speaker 1:          00:49          I'm actively working on an alternative platform has a competitor to patron. In the meantime, I've set up a simple rather featureless alternative, which is now where the support bar on the lower left hand side of my videos points. This is for those who would like to continue their patronage or begin his new supporters. My financial situation has stabilized substantially since I originally set up a patron account and I did it then in March of 2016 to see if I could fund further development of my youtube channel, which is not and has never been ad supported. However, it seems that a substantial number of people want to indicate and provide their support on a continued basis, feeling inclined by all appearances to provide something reciprocal in return for the content they have been provided with. Although I would likely continue to generate video content in any case, seeing all that support definitely incentivizes me on an ongoing basis to make generating youtube content, uh, top priority as well as allowing me to continue to fund the small team I have working on an online education project.

Speaker 1:          02:01          I've discussed a bit in various interviews in the past, about 5,000 of my patrons have already left the platform in protest, so I'm already down to about half the number of subscribers I once had. Approximately 2,500 of these have transferred their support to the alternative I spoke of earlier. Although an unknowable proportion of this 2,500 have new lease signed on. Thank you very much to all my patrons and all my viewers and listeners and readers for their past support and to all of those who have transferred their contributions to the alternative system. So let's see how this goes. I think I have it set up here to delete. We'll see right here. Disabled my account. Well, you're goes, all right. 12 I have to withdraw $11 and 21 cents it looks like that happened. So let's see now if I can do this one more step by the looks of things. That's it, ladies and gentlemen. All right there. It's nighttime in Switzerland where I am now. Anyway, so I tried to sign in and it's definitely gone. So I just thought I'd let you know that. Thanks again. We'll talk to you soon. I've got a couple of new youtube videos that'll be up in the next week and I'll see those of you who are coming to my shows in California and New Zealand and Australia over the next month. Bye Bye. All.
