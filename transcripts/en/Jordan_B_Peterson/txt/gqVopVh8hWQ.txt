Speaker 1:          00:00:08       I guess it starts right away. I can check here. Yeah, it's life. And that's that.

Speaker 2:          00:00:23       All right. It looks like we're ready to go.

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       So welcome everybody. Um, let's see how the q and a and goes. I've got a number of, of uh, the questions that people have already submitted, so I'll probably start with those. And for those of you who are on the live chat, you can submit questions too and I'll, I'll probably just move back and forth between the ones that are pre submitted in the ones that you guys are asking. So, and yes, it will be uploaded later. And uh, I think youtube does that automatically. Really good to see all of you, um, are people from all over the world here? London and Vancouver. And let's see, where else are you guys from?

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:01:12       well Toronto, that's not quite as exciting since I live here. Quebec, Calgary, Edmonton, Vienna.

Speaker 1:          00:01:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       Boston, Auckland, New Zealand, Montreal, Texas. Here we go. Morocco, Netherlands. Yeah, it's amazing that this can, this can happen like that as far as I'm concerned. So it's going to take me just a bit to get adapted to what I'm doing. Okay. First question, what is your advice for finding a sane sound therapist and do you think a fruitful psychotherapeutic relationship requires a therapist to have specific temperamental compatibility or even literacy and interests that align with the patient? Well, I would say with regards to finding a sane and sound therapists there some practical things you can do. Um, I guess this is more relevant if you live in North America and I'm not sure exactly what the training requirements are and other places in the world, but your best bet I would say is to find someone who's appropriately trained. And I would regard someone who's appropriately trained as a psychotherapist to be someone who's, I think you're safer if you go with someone who's trained at one of the big research schools and you have a therapist who's well versed in psychotherapeutic practice but who's also sufficiently educated scientifically to be able to understand the scientific literature.

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       And you can be pretty certain of that if you find a therapist who's got their phd, um, rather than a psy d now, not that there's anything necessarily wrong with Saudis. If they go, Hey, go received their phd from an American Psychological Association approved, um, um, school of clinical and those schools operate under what's called the bolder model. And the boulder model is promotes, um, what now what, what's it called, science, science practitioner as, as the optimal ideal combination for a psychotherapist. So someone who's trained psychotherapeutic, but also has research experience and can understand the relevant scientific literature as it pertains to, to mental health. So that would be the first thing. The second thing I would say is, um, well I go to see yours, a psychotherapist once and maybe go to see a couple of them and find someone that listens to you because the psychotherapist shouldn't be someone who solves your problems for you or offers even really offers you advice.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       Although sometimes that can be helpful. Really what the psychotherapists should do is be someone who can help you understand what problem it is that you're facing so that that can be delineated properly to help you articulate what it is that you want. So what your vision of mental health might be and what you'd like to attain in psychotherapy, and then who helps you strategize towards that end. And so you want someone who will really listen to you that you feel comfortable telling the truth too, because that's also incredibly important. You have to, you have to, uh, if you can't tell your psychotherapist the truth, then you're not going to get anywhere in therapy because you won't be able to actually outline the nature of your fundamental problems. So that's vital and go see someone and see if you're happy with the way that you're interacting with them. That's the most relevant issue. So that's the first question. Now the next one was, do I think s fruitful psychotherapeutic relationship requires the therapist to have specific temperamental compatibility or even literacy and interests that align with the patient? I think that it's, I think it's difficult to work with a therapist who is less intelligent than you are. That's kind of a rough way of conceptualizing it. But a lot of what a therapist does is help you strategize and the person has to be able to think analytically and probably at least to some degree to the same with the same degree of complexity that you're capable of. Um, it's not necessarily a good idea to be able to out think your, your therapist. So

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       Dr. Peterson, I heard you recently say that if a woman doesn't want a baby by age 30 that something is unhealthy. I take no offense to that assertion. Rather I am taking it very seriously. I'm 34 years old in a longterm relationship, but don't feel desire to have children. I always thought that I would one day, but I'm getting older and that I'm getting older and that day still hasn't come. I'm terrified of reasoning, realizing too late that I should have had a family. But I'm also terrified of having them and regretting it because it never truly want it to be a mother. I don't think I have any ideology at play. I'm not a feminist or anything like that. When you say something might be wrong or unhealthy, where might I look? Any advice on how to make this change but won't make this choice? P S my boyfriend and I both had he depaul mothers perhaps that is relevant. Well it might be relevant given that you saw fit to um, included as a potential detail. And one of the rules that I would operate by as a psychotherapist is that if a client is inclined to add a detail to the

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       okay

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       to the formulation of a problem, that the details are likely to be relevant. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:06:49       but I can't tell, right? Because of course I can't use it a rule of thumb. And so you might object, well, I shouldn't have used a rule of thumb to say something like if a woman doesn't want a baby by the age of 30, that something is unhealthy. Well, are going to be exceptions to every general rule. But my attitude to this essentially is that we have all come from an unbroken string of 3.5 million years of successful mothers. And so the probability that that's going to be part and parcel of the healthy woman's desire and not only a woman, no, obviously men desire to have a family too, and often very intensely. It's just that men have a much longer time span over which to consider such things. So perhaps the chips aren't down so rapidly and to the same degree for men. Um, I wouldn't be so bold as to say that there's anything wrong with you, the questionnaire specifically.

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       Um, maybe you have the sort of temperament that isn't particularly inclined towards maternal behavior. Uh, that might be someone who's low in agreeableness and well, that would be the primary issue. Um, and so I wouldn't take my word for it, that if you don't want to have a child in your 30 that there is necessarily something specifically wrong with you. But I would say as a rule of thumb, it's, it's part of the normal panoply of human desires and values. And so if, if, if there's violent objection to having a family or something like that, then generally that seems to me to be indicative of something that might be at least worth looking into. I'll try a live one here, a live question.

Speaker 1:          00:08:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:42       What do I think of Paul Joseph Watson position that populism is the new punk slash counterculture? Oh, that's a good question. I actually happened to watch that video a couple of days ago. That's a good question. I mean, you see that, you see, I would say some indication of that on Youtube, although it's not easy to get an unbiased sample of what's going on on Youtube because of course youtube tends to present you with things that are akin to the things that you're already watching. It does appear to me that the conservative commentators on youtube are playing somewhat of the same role that the counter culture played, let's call it more traditionally. Even though that's a funny thing to say about the counterculture. What I'm wondering more is whether or not, not so much whether it's a counterculture, but if it's something that's more specifically associated with a place that men, young men are finding their new political voice online.

Speaker 2:          00:09:42       Uh, part of the reason that I'm wondering about that, although there are a number of female conservative commentators who also become popular online is because many of the commentators appear to be man and many of the people who are following them also appear to be men. And so, and it's not obvious to me that men, it's easy now for men, especially young men to have a political voice on campus for example, or perhaps even in public. Um, and so maybe they're turning to youtube to, to find these viewpoints that aren't being district disseminated is widely in the, in the popular media.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       So

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       was there ever a time when you saw a therapist of some kind? Well, no, actually I haven't ever seen a therapist and, and uh, that might seem strange. I suppose given that I am a psychologist, um, I don't really like talking about my problems with other people. As it turns out, I'd rather keep them to myself and, um, but, but I would say having said that is that I've read an awful lot of the writings of the great clinical psychologists and psychiatrists and I would say that I've used them as psychotherapeutic aids. And I think that that plays, uh, uh, a very similar role that can play a very similar role. So, okay. We just had to update the link. Um, so, okay. So let's try another question here from, from the prepared questions. I tried to rank order these by the number of people that

Speaker 1:          00:11:45       mmm.

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       Indicated an interest in them.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       So

Speaker 2:          00:12:11       you emphasize the spoken truth and negotiation as the alternative to war and site Solzhenitsyn as a brilliant documenter of the potential or inevitable fallout of deceit. But in soldiers nip since diagnosis of the factors leading to the Gulag archipelago, he also included the failure of people to take a violent stand to disrupt tyranny. And here's a quote

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       and how will we burned in the camps later thinking, what would things would be like if every security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest? Had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family or if during periods of mass arrests, as for example, in Leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their layers paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and every step on the staircase, but at understood they had nothing left to lose and then boldly set up in the downstairs hall and ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand. The organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding all of Stalins thirst, the cursive machine would have ground to a halt if if we didn't love freedom enough and even the more we had no real awareness of the situation, we purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterwards.

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       End of quote, there appears to be a point where the price of our sovereignty and liberty must be paid with blood in addition to the vulnerability required by the spoken truth. Here are my questions. Do you agree that there is such a point or to the weapons in power we possess today make violence in, in viable course of action? Okay, well I would say first of all, part of what soldier nicheness talking about actually is the right to self defense and you have the right to self defense and you have the right to use whatever force is necessary and reasonable when you're defending yourself and you know, in under the American constitution for example, it's predicated on the idea, at least in part, that you have not only the right, but perhaps the moral obligation to resist tyranny. And so obviously, so that that's a difference.

Speaker 2:          00:14:27       That's very different from using violence for specifically political ends. It's art. Do you have the right to defend yourself against incursions into your own home or into your own family? And I think the answer to that is you do part of the reason that it has manifested itself, so that being dangerous is the appropriate response. Now then you might say, well how do you know how to calibrate your, your defensive response? And I would say, well, we have some legal guidelines for that. Uh, that would be the guidelines governing, governing self defense in general. I guess maybe it's time for a more aggressive response when you're prepared to pay the price for that or aggressive response. Do you have to think it through? But you certainly have the right to protect yourself and your family and, and your property from inappropriate incursion by other individuals or by the state. Uh, and without knowing the specifics of any given circumstance that might call for such a response. It's difficult to be any more straight forward about that. But I don't, I'm certainly wouldn't regard myself precisely as a pacifist. I don't, I, because I believe that there are, there are, it's reasonable to meet

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       well, how would I say you have the right to self defense. That's as clearly as I can formulate it. Can I ask your thoughts on Brexit? Uh, that's a, that's a question coming from the live chat. Yes. You can have my thoughts on brexit. Tom. The other day I was doing a lecture on the, on the stories in genesis and one of the stories that I analyze briefly, and this will be posted very soon, is the story of the Tower of Babel. And I've been very curious about that story. It comes after Noah's flood myth in genesis and

Speaker 2:          00:16:19       it's very interesting story in what happens is that human beings get together and they decide to build a massive building and the human beings that are building that building all speak in one voice and they have this grand vision, which you might regard as a utopian vision, which is what I think it is, that they can build a building so high that within it everyone will speak the same language and it will reach all the way to have it. And so you could see it in some sense as an attempt to usurp the transcendent. Um, I kind of read it as an EA, an early precursor of the story that Milton told him, paradise lost, where Satan, who's God's highest avidly angel and perhaps, and who's Lucifer? That the brightest light in the psychic hierarchy you might say. And, and the spirit of untrammeled rationality decides that he can wage war in heaven and overcome God, overcome the ultimate in the transcendent value.

Speaker 2:          00:17:17       When I read that as a cautionary tale about the pride that goes along with intellectual presupposition in the same pride that produced the totalitarian states of the 20th century, what happens with the Tower of Babel is that human beings start to build this a unitary homogenous structure who's pentacle will reach into God's heaven. He domain perhaps thereby taking the place of the transcendent God gets wind of that and goes to earth and takes the people or, or transforms the people who are, who are building the building and who in principle it would house into a polyglot of people speaking different languages and then scatters them all over the world. Well, what I think that means is that if you try to build a homogenous totalitarian structure that you searched the transcendent, it will begin to badly fragment from within. And I think it's a warning against gigantism. And I think one of the things that's happening in Europe is that we're seeing the folly of the idea of too big to fail.

Speaker 2:          00:18:22       What we're seeing instead is the manifestation of so big it will certainly fail and I think the reason for that is that there has to be a certain degree of homogeneity within anything that can be categorized as an organization. If the degree of heterogeneity within the organization becomes too extreme and if the organization becomes too large, then it's very difficult for people to feel any affinity with it. They're going to fragment back into their subsidiary identity groups and those might be national groups for example, which seems to be what happened, what's happening in Europe and then the whole thing is going to fall apart. And I have some sympathy for that because I think that it's necessary for human beings at an individual level to feel some sort of affinity for the power structures that they find themselves in. And maybe being one 300 Mil, one 300000000th of an entity is to be too much of a non entity to feel any real affinity for that structure. So that's part of what I think's happening with regards to brexit. So, okay, so let's see what happens here. A little another. Let's take another live question here

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       is remove the toxic people in your life. Wholly. Good advice. Well, no, I wouldn't say it's wholly good advice because no single piece of advice could be considered as holy good, except perhaps for tell the truth. I think that one might be outside that that rule of thumb, it depends very much on what you mean by toxic and also who's doing the judgment with regards to toxicity. My sense is that you should surround yourself with people who genuinely want the best for you or perhaps more specifically, genuinely want the best for the best part of you. And if you're, if the people around you are not supporting you in your endeavors and they put you down and they punish you for your virtues or even punish you too intensely for your faults and failed to reward you when you're doing what you should be doing and fail to engage in reciprocal interactions, that there comes a point where you would be better off finding someone who is actually on your side.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       And that can even be the case with family members. Although of course that's a very difficult decision to make. But sometimes people do have the misfortune of being up with family members who are so who are operating in a manner that's so counterproductive to their health that it's better for them despite the pain to cease communication with them. And, and sometimes paradoxically enough that can also facilitate communication because sometimes you have to draw a line in the sand before people are willing to undergo the serious self consideration that print would proceed any real transformation. So, but I would say even if even if you don't like the idea of removing the toxic people in your life, you should certainly endeavor to surround yourself with the sorts of people that you would want to surround someone that you regarded as your friend or loved one. So you need to, you need to extend the same courtesy to yourself, especially to the part of yourself that striving upward that you would to someone that you cared for. So,

Speaker 2:          00:21:47       okay, what do I think of the phrase diversity is our strength? Well, I think it's a slogan and the word slogan is derived from the Welsh two words slew ag, s, l, U, H, g, H and Gerome, g, H, a, I, r, m, and slew a Garam is the battle cry of the dead. So the problem with that sort of slogan is that it replaces independent thought and it's certainly possible that quote diversity is a strength, an end quote. But the question is, what the hell do you mean by diversity? And if the idea is that diverse modes of approaching situations, nestle necessarily emerge because you've gathered people together who were of some, who are different in their whatever group identity marker happens to be the privileged one at the moment, to use the postmodernists language. There's no indication whatsoever that that's going to produce diversity of, of strategic plan for example. So it's, it's an empty phrase and it's a dangerous phrase because diversity can be a weakness. It's just as much as it can be, uh, can be a strength. So, you know, I think it's all right. It's a slogan and I don't like slogans very much. So

Speaker 2:          00:23:08       do you have any practical advice?

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:15       It's still on. It's just the cameras. The camera turned off for some reason. Do you have any practical advice? It's still an audio. Yeah. Well we, I have all this new technology here guys. And sorry about that. It's still, we're still working out the bugs. I bought new cameras and new lighting and all of that and um, it does strange things that we don't understand yet. And so it looks like I'm back on.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       So do you have any practical advice on how I can improve my ability to concentrate and pay attention to the world around me? Um, well, I have some practical advice without the first piece of practical advice. Often the devil's in the details, you know, but often some practical advice as well. Regulate your, regulate your habits. Um, try to get up at approximately the same time each morning. I would recommend that you get up approximately when other people get up. So that would be something in the neighborhood of seven 30 or eight in the morning or perhaps earlier, perhaps a little bit later. But you want to stabilize that because your, your circadian rhythms operate more, uh, what would you call it to fluidly and your mood is likely to be regulated better if there's islands of stability in your daily routines. Human beings like daily routines, just like dogs, like daily routines and so regulate your sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:24:48       Um, I would say when you get up in the morning, eat breakfast, that's a really important thing to do. I can't tell you how many people I've treated in my clinical practice who's proclivity for emotional instability and depression, anxiety, general hopelessness, um, emotional pain and gloom and doom as well as capacity to concentrate. We're property regulated or inhibited or produced by merely ensuring that they ate a, I would say a protein and fat rich breakfast relatively soon after they wake up. And that's especially too if they're stressed. And as it turns out that if you stress yourself after a fast, which is of course what you've undertaken, if you haven't eaten since the night before, that your body produces enough insulin to deplete your, your, your to deplete the sugar in your blood. And then it's very difficult for you to become regulated properly with regards to your metabolism, metabolism until you sleep again.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       And so it can be regulating your sleep and your breakfast. Eating habits in particular can be a very effective way of regulating your mood and increasing your capacity to concentrate. The other thing I would say is that spending some time scheduling your time is also extraordinarily useful. And so I can tell you a little bit about about how to use schedule as effectively. So the first thing I would do is, the first thing I would say is that you should, um, you should, you should develop a longterm plan. You can use something like the future authoring program, which most of you are familiar with because of course you would have got a key to it. Almost everyone as a consequence of being a patron is you have to, you have to set up your vision like Japan, no, when he's looking at the Star before Pinocchio's transformation takes place, you have to set up your longterm vision to have some vision of the good towards which you're working and some vision perhaps of the hell that you're avoiding.

Speaker 2:          00:26:46       And then I would say once you set up that vision so that you know how to Orient Yourself, then you should start designing your days. And you can do that very effectively with a calendar like Google calendar. And instead of many people say, well I hate using a schedule and, or I hate using a calendar. And what I would say about that is, is that if you hate using a schedule or a calendar, then you're probably using it wrong. What you're doing is using the calendar as an external tyrant that's telling you what you should do if you were going to be a conventionally good person each day. So you load yourself up with, with arbitrary, we'll say arbitrary responsibilities, but that's not really how you should use a schedule. What you should use a schedule to do is to design the day that you would most like to have. And obviously that's going to include accepting some responsibility and undertaking to make progress on those things that you have to make progress on, to keep your life from collapsing into chaos. But it should also mean that you schedule in activities that make you actually want to have that day. And so if you're using a schedule properly that it can be your friend and that can also be something that can increase your capacity to concentrate. And then I would say, well, if you're, if you're very scattered,

Speaker 2:          00:28:08       then you can start to train yourself. You might say, well, um, I need to learn to read without distraction. So maybe what you do, you say, okay, well for the next week I'm going to read 10 minutes a day and I'm going to try to limit the distractions. And if you're successful at that, then you could try 12 minutes a day. And if you're successful at that, you could try 15 minutes a day. And the trick is to set a goal for yourself that is slightly beyond your current level of performance, enough to be challenging enough to be worthwhile if you accomplished but not so difficult that you're likely to fail. And then practice incrementally day by day trying to inculcate the habits that you want to inculcate and assume that it'll take you a number of months or even a number of years in order to become very fluent at the habit.

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       The important thing is to start improving incrementally because incremental improvement pays off like a compound interest. And so I would also say that the trajectory that you're on is more important than your starting point. And that's also an extraordinarily optimistic observation because it means that direction is more important than current position and enemy current position matters obviously, but it, I don't think it does matter as much as direction. So if you want to learn to concentrate more, define what constitutes concentration, break it into micro habits and then start practicing instantiation of those micro habits. So

Speaker 2:          00:29:36       very good advice here. Robbie Kelly says, how do you eat an elephant? You bite one chunk at a time. Well that's exactly right. And that's also the hallmark of behavior therapy, the issue. So what a behavior therapist does and, and I'm an admirer of behavior therapy, although there's other psychotherapeutic approaches that I also appreciate too to a great degree for, for more that are in some sense more conceptually sophisticated. But one of the things you do if you're a behavior therapist is take the problem at hand and decompose it into its micro elements and then practice implementation of the micro elements. And that can be the integration of new habits is already mentioned, but that's also a great way of learning to face the things that you're avoiding. Learning to confront the things you're avoiding that frightened you were, it stopped you in your trucks. So you know, if you, if you're scared of going to parties or maybe scared of going out in public, you can also always go to the nearest bar for 10 minutes and sit there and, and have a drink and then leave, you know, and then maybe expand that up to 12 minutes and then maybe dare at one of the dare at one point when you grow up to say hi to someone.

Speaker 2:          00:30:43       But again, don't ever underestimate the utility of incremental improvement. You can get a tremendous distance by, by engaging in incremental improvement. So, okay, so let's see here.

Speaker 2:          00:31:05       Why did I know how to upload my talk at Western? University of that will be being uploaded. There's a couple of talks I did that just aren't the people that were preparing them just haven't got back to me yet. I have a podcast that went quite nicely with a German interviewer that I'm going to upload this weekend. I thought it was, I thought it was good. So, but the, the western university talk will be uploaded. I also did a talk in Calgary recently, which I talked about something new. I talked about equity, which, which I believe is absolutely catastrophic, uh, goal. Let's say that's equality of outcome. I think the reason that it's catastrophic is because you can't have equality of outcome because you can fractionate the group differences between people and an infinite number of ways. So even if you did manage to produce equality of outcome by you know, the two top contenders for, for prime group identity right now, which are race and gender being pushed very hard by the left, which I would say is something that's very racist and very sexist.

Speaker 2:          00:32:03       Um, you might be able to reach equality of outcome across race and gender, although you couldn't practically speaking, but let's say hypothetically you could, well then you'd still have to start to fragment race. So what do you mean by race exactly? Are you going to stick with the three? Well you might describe them as canonical racial differences negroid caucasoid in Asian or are you going to start to fragment Asians into their various subtypes and exactly how are you going to do that or no, are you going to do the same thing with black people or are you going to just assume that they're all the same? And how do you know when someone's black and not just dark brown, so to speak, or medium or light brown. And I'd also like to point out just in case anyone hasn't noticed that people aren't black and white, they're actually Tan and Brown.

Speaker 2:          00:32:48       And so, and I'm saying that because there aren't clear distinctions between the racial divides. And so you have to fragment race and then obviously you have to fragment gender at least according to the gender theorists. And then you have other problems of group identity. Um, do you ensure that people are equally represented across levels of attractiveness or height or extroversion or introversion or emotional stability or mental health or physical health or age or? Well, as you get the picture, I don't have to continue to repeat myself. There is a, there is, there are as many, there are an infinite number of canonical group identities and there's no way of making a, an objective hierarchy out of them in terms of value. And so you can't equate for equality of outcome up across all potential category schemes. And so equality of outcome is a futile endeavor.

Speaker 2:          00:33:44       All that it does is transfer the power that the free market should. Um, essentially the free market as an externalized computational machine should be calculating for us, even though it's an imperfect calculation, all it does is transfer the power of that collective and impersonal decision making into the hands of a coterie of people who will abs. Even if the initial people who have that power don't misuse it, the people who take their place will certainly misuse it. So anyways, have Calgary, I did a talk on equity and tried to outline some of these things. Trying to understand exactly what is wrong with the idea of equality of outcome. Mean the historical data obviously indicates that it's a catastrophic doctrine, but I think there are technical, psychological, computational and complexity related reasons why the doctrine of equality of outcome is, is uh, is, is it's an impossible goal. It cannot be achieved even in principle. So. All right,

Speaker 2:          00:35:00       let's see. The thinking skeptic says, I love you, Dr [inaudible]. Well, thank you very much. Uh, thinking skeptic. Um, it's conceivable that I love youtube, but I don't know because I don't know, but we'll assume that we can start from that perspective anyways. Thoughts on the use of amphetamine to improve conscientiousness? Um, the longterm data on use of amphetamine as a treatment for attention deficit disorders suggest that there are no positive medium to longterm benefits. So I would say that if you're going to take a data driven approach to that issue, that you would draw the conclusion that it's not a, a useful long term, uh, solution. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:35:43       I experienced tremendous abuse as a child and it's led to me being a doormat for abuse. I seek out people who reject me and reject people who seek me out. How do I break this cycle? Wow. Well that's a really, really hard question and the reason that it's hard apart from the fact that your situation is very complex is that the devil's always in the details. What I would recommend though is that if you want to break that cycle, the first thing you need to do is to figure out what it is that you want. You need to understand where it is that you want to go in your life and you need to understand what people would look like if they were the kind of people that you could surround yourself with to facilitate that goal. And so I would again recommend that you do the future authoring program so that you can get your goals in order and then you need to start thinking through how it is that you would like to be treated and what your strategies would be.

Speaker 2:          00:36:36       Even in principle if you find yourself not being treated that way and then you have to start practicing that at the level of micro routine. So, and I think one of the ways that you can do that, and this is something I often recommend to agreeable people, is that he will see that there are people who treat you in a manner that leads to the development of your resentment, feelings of resentment. And now there's roughly two reasons why you might feel resentful and one is that your just windy and someone is calling you on your misbehavior or you're failing because you should be failing and you're not. Your character isn't well developed enough to merely adjust to the error and to fix yourself up. And the other is that you're being genuinely taken advantage of and that you need to put a stop to it. And the only way that you can really figure that out is by thinking it through or writing it down or perhaps by talking to someone that, that you, that that cares for you in a positive way.

Speaker 2:          00:37:39       Once you've done that and once you realize that you're resentful because you are being interfered with, then it's incumbent on you to say something so that it, it comes to a stop and you'll have to practice that it and you'll be bad at it to begin with. Now, it might be that your interact with someone and you don't realize until hours later that you don't like the interaction that you had something to say. You might have to sit at home and then figure out what it is that you should say should have said and then go back and tell the person you're going to be awkward and bad at it. But it's a good start. And maybe you need to write out why it is that you shouldn't be allowing people to mistreat you so that you replace your habitual proclivity that was may be instilled in you when you were a child with a thought through and mature philosophy of interpersonal relationship.

Speaker 2:          00:38:25       That's it. That's a reasonable start. So is it safe to go into psychology in university? Definitely not. It's not safe to study psychology. Uh, but that's not really the issue. I think what you mean has is has psychology been so corrupted by let's say, political correctness so that it's no longer a reasonable pathway. It's no, no longer a reasonable discipline. And I would say I don't think it's corrupted to that degree. And I would also say that one of the things you need to understand if you are going to university, that is that fundamentally university is a place where you educate yourself. Now you can seek out people who have knowledge and confer with them about your own education, but the primary responsibility has to fall to you, the libraries and [inaudible] full of great books. And you can find out what the great books are in a relative, in a relatively short order manner by just by even just looking online.

Speaker 2:          00:39:23       And you can do a tremendous amount of reading and a tremendous amount of writing on your own. And you can do that very effectively if you also treat your university experience with the same degree of, uh, well, what would you call diligence that you might, that you might put towards a full time job. So you want to find the professors that have something to say and select them and you want to do the readings of the great books and you want to learn to write. And if you do that, then you'll receive an education. And you can do that pretty much at any university I would say. So what music do I like? I like a lot of different music. I like a lot of different genres. I listen to rock. I'm a dinosaur. So I listened to classic rock all often from the 70s I'm, you know, I was wired up and imprinted on that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:40:12       But I listened to rock music from the fifties through today. I really liked the band arcade fire for example, a beach houses, a new band. I kind of liked them. There's a band called Devotchka that I think, I think they're out of Seattle. I think they're really good. I love Tom Waits. I like old country music, the Western stuff from the forties thirties forties and 50s. I listened to jazz. I like blues. I listen to classical music. Um, so, uh, I think I mentioned Tom White's already, who I think is an absolute genius, so I don't remember who said it once, but someone said there was only two kinds of music, good music and bad music. And I really believe that's true. And so I, I've found what I regard as great music in all sorts of genres. Um, I wouldn't say I'm a hip hop officio, but there's some of it that I've learned to like, uh, I really like m and m's rap. God, I think that's an absolutely remarkable song. He's unbelievably skilled in this ability to annunciate and I think there's high quality music being produced across a wide range of genres. I don't like pop, generally speaking. Um, it all sounds like bad. 1970s disco to me and I didn't like bad, 1970s disco, so, so that's what I liked for music. Um, let's see, what else have we got here?

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       What

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       do I think of the comments? The role favorable to me on that recent Hamilton article. Hamilton's a city, the city where mcmaster university is being disappeared. Um, I don't know what to think of that. You know, my, my, my gut instinct, and I would use this as a good rule of thumb, is to assume ignorance or error or stupidity before you assume malevolence. And so you have to go through those alternative explanations first. I mean, I don't know why the comments were shutdown. Um, I, it would be easy to assume the worst, but there's no reason to do that. You don't want to jump to the assumption of the worst to begin with. So I thought it was curious and so I tweeted it and I do think it's curious and I do think that the, the, the threat of invisible Internet censorship is a real one because w we are conversing increasingly in this public artificial intelligence, giant invisible corporation mediated way.

Speaker 2:          00:42:32       And we don't know what the rules are and we don't know who can make them. And I think that that's something we're really going to have to watch out for you. I think you can see that happening with facebook and twitter and perhaps with youtube, although I think youtube still pretty clean, although you know, I've seen people complaining that they're losing subscribers and that and that their content is being restricted. You know, the thing is the company is going gonna make some mistakes there. They're trying to do multiple things at the same time. And so like I said, I would assume, um, error and ignorance and stupidity and then malevolence in that order and you know, give, give people who are trying to mediate these new technologies a bit of a break, but that's still, you should be awake because there is always the potential for new and unforeseen threats to emerge to freedom of speech when it's electronically mediated. So how will rescuing my father from the belly of the whale helped me with regards to leftist ideology? Well I hope it would help you with regards to ideologies in general. I mean, it's a serious, that's a very, very serious question

Speaker 2:          00:43:53       to believe that rescuing your father from the belly of the whale would inoculate you against ideology is to accept it particular interpretation of what that story means. Now, my interpretation of that story is that the whale, the whale dragon is a symbol of the predatory unknown. So it's a symbol of the dangers that lurk in the unknown. And the idea that the father, the dying father or the or the ghost father or the deceased father is lying. Somehow inert in that landscape means that encountering chaos can help you understand more clearly what the value was in traditional order. But it's not only traditional order that, that, that, that that is the domain say of the, of the resurrecting farther. It's partly the farther represents partly the spirit of the social order and partly the, the, the implicit logos that's characteristic of the individual that acts to create society across time.

Speaker 2:          00:44:59       Um, if you identify with tradition as, as, as the foundation of being and you understand what identifying with the spirit that creates tradition means, then that gives you a means of orienting yourself. That's far preferable to any pure ideology, whether it's hiding in the nationals structures that the right promotes, um, which tend towards rigidity, rigidity, and hyper order or drowning in the chaos that the left producers in their attempts both to demolish order sort of on the negative end and, uh, transmuted say on the positive end. It's better to, I think it's better to act your life out as an individual, to incorporate the traditions that your society has have brought forward to you, into your life. So to, to do what other people do and to do it well, to, to grow up, to move out of your house, to adopt the responsibilities of a family, to learn how to be honest, to take on the heavy load of helping to reduce unnecessary suffering in the world and to try to make something productive and useful of yourself. And that's a lot more interesting and meaningful than trying to, um, manifest yourself as the incarnation of a pathological ideology.

Speaker 2:          00:46:45       Oh, okay. What the hell is it doing? Dying? No, I turned it back on. You don't game,

Speaker 1:          00:47:06       you stopped recording too,

Speaker 2:          00:47:27       so, so I'm, I'm, I looks like I'm back. There's a lag on the q and a, so it's, it's somewhat difficult to d Sherman. So the Shaman to what did the Sherman and D Sherman? Yeah. Hi. I'm okay. Somebody says that this is the fault of postmodernist. It's probably is, it probably is. I, that would be my guest. They're probably putting like some kind of electronic bug in my camera. I don't know why it's shutting off. I'll sort that out later. So Julian, we need you, I guess you heard that a, yeah. Yeah. Well, okay. So, oh, I agree. How, don't yell at Julian. I get you now. I can't, I have to yell at him. He's my son. I can yell at him. He's my technical support actually. He's really good at it then. I hardly ever yell at them to rough life for me though. Okay. Let's say here,

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       take another question from, from, so someone says, what's up with the socks? Yeah, well I have, I guess I need to dim. I guess I need to indicate to the rest of you just exactly what that means. You see these are the socks that we're talking about here. Um, my wife bought me some fancy socks. My, my wife bought me some fancy socks for Christmas and so I guess she thought my style needed upgrading. I guess it was partly because I got completely reward robe to here. I guess that might be a word in the last few months I lost, I've lost a tremendous amount of weight in the last year about 40 pounds. And you know, some of that might be due to social justice warriors. So although it's really not, it's because I've transformed my diet. I seem to have a variety of dietary sensitivities that seem to be contributing to, uh, to, I've had a history of depression and that looks like it might be associated with diet.

Speaker 2:          00:49:42       And my daughter who's been very ill with a variety of health problems, including extraordinarily serious arthritis. She lost her ankle and her hip to arthritis when she was 17. She's figured out that a lot of her autoimmune problems were associated with severe dietary, uh, sensitivity. And we share some symptom overlap. So I've had some autoimmune illness problems. And so she went on a very restrictive diet, which was basically only chicken and vegetables and it, it stopped the vast majority of her symptoms, including extreme fatigue and depression and the arthritis itself. And it had quite a market impact on her to the point where she could stop taking antidepressants. And so about a year and half ago, she convinced me to, um, try the diet for a month. And that meant well, it meant eating nothing but meat and vegetables and that would beef chicken and vegetables. That's it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:39       No carbohydrates, no nuts, no nightshades, no beans, no dairy, no chocolate, no fruit, no sugar. Like unbelievably restrictive. It's been a real pain because it's really compromised my social life because they're like, who's going to invite you out? Because so many people, you know, are, um, so much of what people do socially, it revolves around eating. And if you're really a royal pain in the neck with when it comes to your dietary proclivities, then people are just not going to be very happy about you. Anyways. I tried the Diet for a month and I lost about seven pounds, which I've, and I quit snoring, which, which had been plaguing me to some degree. And so I thought that was pretty interesting. And, um, so I just stayed on it. Then I lost, I kept losing them about that much weight per month. So I went down from about 212 pounds to my current weight, which is about one 70, which is about where it was when I was in graduate school. And so anyways, this is a long answer to this question.

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:51:42       Because of that, all my clothing became tent like, and I had to throw all of it away. And so I got some new clothes in more recently and including some very colorful socks. So I guess that's my, uh, what would you say? I don't know what else to say about it, that, that I have these colorful socks and they're, they're kind of interesting and stylish. And so that's what's with the socks. So it's a complicated answer. Hey. So,

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       mmm.

Speaker 2:          00:52:19       Can you please take some questions submitted via patron advance? I did do that. I did take questions. I guess you might mean. Do I answer that? Will I answer some more of the questions and I, yeah, I can do that. I think what I would recommend everyone, I mean we'll get better at this and I'm going to keep doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:36       Um, where'd it go here?

Speaker 2:          00:52:43       There are a lot. Many of the questions that were submitted on Patrion were very long and I don't think that's going to work because, um, it takes a long time to read the long questions and

Speaker 2:          00:52:56       that means I can't answer very many of them. So one of the things I would say, if you're going to submit a question on Patrion, at least for the time being, you might, might want to make them not more than about maybe for la, four or five lines long. Cause I also have to scan through a lot of questions to find out which ones not only are worth answering because I think many of them are worth answering. But which ones I've got an answer at hand for because I can't sit here and think and produce dead air for periods of time for this to work properly. So we'll figure this out as we go along.

Speaker 1:          00:53:31       So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       Dr. Peterson, in your lectures, you speak a lot about toughening people up as someone who went through college, got a humanities degree, bought completely into postmodern ideology. And until hearing your lectures couldn't pawn pinpoint that feeling of aimlessness, hopelessness and the aversion to responsibility, where do you recommend they start? I've particularly seen this inability to be tough, to negotiate and to bring up my inner tyrant who is really just afraid. Or You said it does bring out your inner tyrant who is really just afraid it's not going to get what it wants. How do you begin to work with that? Well, that, that's a good question. And the next question is how can men become more dangerous? Well, I can answer both of those at the same time. I would say for people who are too agreeable, the first thing that you need to know what the first thing you need to figure out is what is it that you want?

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       And

Speaker 2:          00:54:28       because if you don't want anything and if you don't know what you want and you don't know what your strategy is, how are you ever going to be able to conjure up the courage to stand for what you believe in? You don't believe in anything and you don't have any arguments at hand. And I mean, that's part of the reason that we developed the future authoring program was so that people could not only figure out what they wanted. So to identify the goals in life, which is identifying those goals as an integrating force, but also to articulate the arguments that make them capable of defending yourself. You know, like if I'm going to challenge you, let's say you come to me and you say, uh, um, I wanted to raise, maybe it's taken you a lot of courage to conjure to, to, to be able to step into the office of your boss and say, well I want to raise.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       And he says, well no, we don't have any extra money at the time. And you say, well okay. And then you leave. Well that's not a good negotiation. If you want something, the first thing you have to do is set up options for yourself. So if you really want to negotiate for a raise, let's say, cause it, we'll use this as an example. The first thing you have to do is decide whether or not you deserve to have a race. Because you can't just ask for one. You have to make a case for it. And so how do you know if you're in a position to ask for a raise? Well, part of it is that you have options. So I would say put your cv or your resume in order and make it tight and then look around to see what other other employment options you have that you would in fact take and see what your market value is.

Speaker 2:          00:55:59       And because you have to have options, you have to be able to say no one in negotiation and then decide how much of a raise you want and why it would be in the person's best interest to offer you the race, make a case for it. And one, one of the reasons is, look, I've got this other job opportunity that I'm pursuing and I like working here, but I'm going to take this other opportunity because it pays me more. And you can't just say that if it's not the case, if it's not true, because that's an absolutely foolish negotiating strategy. You have to have options, you have to negotiate from a position of strength. And so you have to know what you want and you have to have options. And then you have to develop strategies for communicating what it is that you're, that you're asking for and you, you have to be forthright about that and, but you have to think through the reasons because otherwise you won't have enough courage to tolerate the conflict that it might entail to, to withstand the negotiation.

Speaker 2:          00:56:53       And I think if you're an agreeable type, one way of, of, of, of fortifying yourself is to understand how much misery and conflict you may be storing up for yourself in the future if you refuse or if you refuse to engage in reasonable negotiation on your own behalf in the present. It's like, so one of the ways I get myself to do, to engage in conflict that I might not have wanted to engage in. And despite what you might think because of what's happened to me over the next six months, I'm not a person who particularly enjoys conflict. I'm a person who knows that unless you engage in a certain amount of conflict to stand up for what you want, that your life turns into hell. And maybe the lives of people around you turns into hell too. And I'd rather have the damn conflict, which I find quite stressful.

Speaker 2:          00:57:40       I'd rather have the conflict and allow everything to degenerate around me. And so, okay, so, and then you say you bring out your inner tyrant who is really just afraid. It's not going to get what it wants. Well, you get what you negotiate for and if you put yourself in a position of power and you give yourself options, then you will get what you most more frequently than not, you'll get what it is that you want, but, but not because you want it, but because you have a variety of options available to you that would enable you to move forward more effectively in life. So, okay, let's see. Note for Juliet. Will this live stream be archived? Yes, it will be archived. Our Youtube seems to do that automatically. So

Speaker 2:          00:58:35       is this chat really just patrons? Yes. It's just patrons. I mean, uh, it's reasonable for the people who are supporting the channel to have, uh, to, to what it's reasonable for me to thank the people that are supporting the channel in a specific way. I know that you guys, because I, I talked to a number of, you are happy that your efforts are also contributing to the fact that very many people, and it's about 8 million now by the way, I'm very many people are able to watch these lectures online and many people are translating them and doing all of that too. So, so the information that's available in the lectures is spreading very rapidly and the support that you've uh, provided me with has not only facilitated that and improve the quality, these offerings substantially, but has also enabled me to start thinking about what I might do in the future that's more extensive. And uh, and so one of the things I thought I would do is to thank the Patriot people specifically for, for devoting their resources to this project. And I doing the q and a's, I'm going to do them once a month. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59:47       Yes, it's just Patriot on people who are going to be able to submit the cue the questions. Although everybody will be able to watch them on Youtube because why not? It's no, no harm done there. And it's nothing but benefit as far as I can tell. So I'm Benjamin. Rude says Jordan, why don't you use a dedicated microphone and headphones? There is a painful reverb slash echo when you interview host people. Yes, I think I've taken care of that. I've got a very good set of earbuds. I've got new lighting. Um, I've got to though I have a very good microphone even though I wasn't using it very well. And so I think I probably got that solved and certainly the camera is much better than the one before. So, um, so let's see, what else have we got to say here?

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:00:48       One of the things also that I might comment on it that's quite interesting is that I've read a lot of the youtube comments that accompany my video isn't, you know, I'm, most of the time my experience is on youtube that if you read the youtube comments gives you a seeking feeling about the potential future of humanity. You know, um, people seem to use the opportunity provided by anonymity to be some strange, frequently some strange combination of arrogant and obnoxious, but you know, on, on balance. And I would say it's more than on balance. It's in the vast majority of cases the comments that have been appended to my youtube videos apart from the odd troll and, and the odd person making the sorts of comments that no one should make, the quality of the comments has been very, very high. And so I'm very happy about that. And maybe that's an accurate reflection of the people that are, are watching the information that is provided by the videos. It's rather difficult information and I don't think it's particularly welcome to those who only want to cause trouble. So. Okay. Dr. Peterson, I'm a psychology student. What do you think is the role of psychology in the selective reconstruction of ethics? Well,

Speaker 2:          01:02:03       I think that that's part of the reason that I'm a great admirer of both Freud and young and Rogers to that degree to to some degree, I know you don't and not, I shouldn't only limit it to them because I've learned a lot from reading the great clinicians, the great clinicians are attempting to determine what the appropriate ethic is that promotes both healthy lives and healthy societies and they've made a fair bit of progress. You know, and maybe this gives some credence to Sam Harris's claim that you can derive an ought from. An is a, certainly an is can inform an art, although it certainly doesn't, there's too many is, is to, to, to derive arts with in, in various, I think that's the fundamental problem, but it's certainly the case that one of the things, the pieces of wisdom that you can see emerge across psychotherapists is that um, people are strengthened by voluntary exposure to the things that they're avoiding.

Speaker 2:          01:02:59       And that's a big deal because I think that that's not much different than a practical application of the lessons that are embodied in Orthodox represented rep that are represented in an image and drama in hero mythology. Because the hero is the person who goes forth to voluntarily confront the unknown and gained something as a consequence and benefits the community as a consequences. Well, and that is very little different than the idea of exposure therapy and psychotherapy. And so that seems to me to be the base, the core basis of a certain kind of ethic is that human development is facilitated by voluntary exploration, confrontation and exploration of the unknown. And that looks something like it's all right. I don't know if she can precisely say that that's an ought from an is, but it's certainly 10 it's certainly trending in that direction. So psychologists can help us understand the nature of human beings and by understanding the nature of human beings, we may be able to better understand how it is that human beings might optimally behave. So, and that may also not merely be a consequence of laying out the, the vast array of empirical facts that's associated with psychological investigation. It might also be a consequence of the sorts of things that piaget talked about, which is the observation of how societies right from the small societies of childhood all the way up organize themselves into coherent and functional large scale units. So,

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       okay, how do you walk the line between being too agreeable or disagreeable when in a relationship, not making it, not making it boring or impossible to work with the other person? Well, you, you walk the line between being too agreeable or disagreeable by self reflection at by self reflection, listening and negotiation. So the self reflection is um,

Speaker 2:          01:05:10       continual self analysis about whether or not you, the relationship is fulfilling those things that you need to be fulfilled in to commit to it. Um, self reflection is continuing analysis of whether you're acting in the other person's best interest in a way that facilitates your own interest in a manner that makes the relationship likely to last and maybe to extend out beneficial beneficial consequences into the broader community. And then less by listening, you get a chance to see how the other person views the situation. And by negotiating you enjoy, you engage in joint problem solving and the person will tell you often if you're being a pushover, you know, you never tell me what you want to do it and, and then you get angry about it. That that's often an indication that you're being a pushover or, or maybe you don't take enough during sex or maybe you give, you give too much or you don't take enough during sex, which is actually quite frustrating for the other person. And so it's self reflection, listening and negotiation that that'll help. So that, that's basically the, uh, uh, short and straight forward answer to that.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:06:30       Um, let's see here. Somebody said that Julian is cute. Well, I'll tell him that. I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that. I think he's cute too. Although he's 25 year old man and he's not necessarily all that thrilled when I refer to him as cute. He's actually quite tough and that I think is actually tough plus cute. That's a killer combination. So

Speaker 2:          01:06:53       Elvin artists says, I love your serious tone when answering dumb questions. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate the positive feedback. It's how tall and my Dr. Peterson. It depends on whether I'm sitting down or standing up. So at the moment I'm about three foot six, but generally speaking, if I'm standing up, I'm about six foot one. So you could ask me some more questions like that because it's getting late at night. And so those questions are really easy to, um, to answer. Someone says, my father is dead. Who Do I save from the whale? Well, that's easy. You save your spiritual father from the whale. Um, saunder behind her sis. My feet lost weight. Well, possibly I haven't weighed them independently of my body, so, but it is certainly possible. Um, Chinese culture mansplain says plus one for Paleo. You know, I know a number of people who have benefited substantially from a Paleo Diet, including, uh, a relative of mine who's a great genius and whose life, whose probably in better shape, better shape.

Speaker 2:          01:07:53       Now that he's 60, then he was, when he was 45, he made very radical dietary transformations of approximately the same sort that I've made in my keys in extremely good physical shape and, and doing very well mentally. And so there is a lot more to the Diet picture then we know and at least for some people a heavy carbohydrate diet seems to be absolutely catastrophic and it's something I wouldn't have expected because I'm one of those people who regarded people who was, who were hyper concerned with their diet as, as, as tending towards the unbearably neurotic. And I certainly learned my lesson about that. I no doubt in any group of people who are hyper concerned about something, there are people who are unnecessarily concerned, but there's definitely something going on with our diets, especially in North America because everyone is overweight and far too many people are depressed.

Speaker 2:          01:08:45       Um, and I do think that it has something to do. I hesitate to say this, but I do think that it has something to do with eating too much green derived carbohydrate, specifically perhaps wheat and dairy. Um, there's there, the situation may be more complicated than that and it's not an area of specific expertise for me, so I'm hesitant to say anything more about that. So Robby Kelly says storing is from being overweight, sleep paralysis stops muscles in the throat from keeping the fat away from crushing windpipe. Yeah. Well, I thought that too when I stopped snoring. But the thing is after I changed my diet to basically a paleo diet, I stopped snoring within a week. It happened long before I lost enough weight to make that, that canonical reason. So,

Speaker 1:          01:09:32       um, let's see.

Speaker 2:          01:09:38       A commenter says, Paleo meat plus vegetables did great things for my depression, weight and health in general. Yes. Well, that, that is, that is, uh, um, that is something that's characteristic of many people's experience. Loser lesser 55 says his snoring a bad thing. Uh, well, not if you enjoy it and not if you're partner enjoys it. But yes, generally it's a bad thing because it interferes with your sleep and anything that interferes with your sleep is generally a bad thing I get. And it can devolve into sleep apnea where you spend substantial periods of time each night, not breathing and uh, that can cause very serious health problems. So, um, so yes, it can be, it generally snoring is a bad thing. So what would you recommend to someone who wants to try to be productive in their free time but always gets sucked in by video games and other distractions? While I would say, define more carefully, precisely what you mean by productive. So get, get a plan in order, delineate the plan down to the level of a daily routine. Set up a daily routine, using a calendar, put in times that you're going to get sucked in by video games and other distractions because obviously you enjoy that and then set yourself up so that it's difficult to get access to those things.

Speaker 1:          01:10:57       So

Speaker 2:          01:10:59       that's the answer to that question.

Speaker 1:          01:11:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       More technical trouble here.

Speaker 1:          01:11:16       Hey, because of that,

Speaker 2:          01:11:23       why in the world do you think it's doing that? I don't know. So technological mysteries. So, um, let's see here. Congratulations on the socks, the weight loss and better sleep. Stay healthy. We need you. Well, I'm doing my best. I've had a lot of health problems over the last, well I guess to some degree over the course of my entire life though I had a very terrible time in December, but I think I'm doing okay and um, I don't think the health problems were a consequence of all the political controversy that I'd be in. I just think they happened to Cole, although one probably didn't really help the other, so, all right.

Speaker 2:          01:12:09       Hey Julian. Julian, someone thinks that your cute. Yeah, someone thinks you're cute. Hey, you want to come and look at these people and they can judge for themselves. Yeah, sure. Why not? All right. So this is Julian. He's, he's my son. He's been helping me with all of the technical issues that, that I've been coming up against or the last few months. And so he wouldn't think I was cute if you knew me. Yeah, well that's exactly right. So I think actually if you know anyone, you pretty much stopped thinking they're cute. So anyways, so, all right, so let's see, what else have we got here? What type of therapy should I seek for my social anxiety with so many different options available? Um, I would say the most straight forward form of therapy for something like social anxiety is behavioral therapy and the behavioral therapists are very practical.

Speaker 2:          01:13:00       And so if it's relatively straight forward, social anxiety, uh, exposure therapy is very useful for that sort of thing. And sometimes social skills training, if you don't feel that you have the, the like the skill and wherewithal to conduct yourself appropriately in a social environment. And some people aren't, weren't socialized very well and so they don't have those skills or they didn't, they didn't get the opportunity to practice. I would say what's probably more important is that you find a therapist that you're comfortable with and who is pushing you and helping you and listening to you in a proper manner. But behavioral therapy is very, very effective for relatively straight forward ils issues of anxiety and um, and skill deficit, let's say. So. Okay. What else have we got here?

Speaker 1:          01:13:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:13:54       Do you think science is a different domain then spirituality or religion and therefore can't answer questions each other's domain? Yeah, I do. I do essentially believe that. I think that science is pretty good at laying out the landscape of empirical facts and that the religious is the domain that attempts to answer the question, how is it that we should act in the world and there's overlap between the two. They can't be entirely separate domains, but roughly speaking. That's the distinction and I think the reason is is that value free empirical facts cannot. You cannot derive values from a set of value free empirical facts and empirical facts by their nature are value free, partly because the value is eradicated from the empirical fact by the scientific method. That's actually what the scientific method does. Now. It cannot do it completely because scientists tend to concentrate on facts that they assume are relevant to the solution of a given problem.

Speaker 2:          01:14:52       They don't just randomly search for facts and that's a good thing because there's an infinite number of the irrelevant facts to get separate them completely. I believe that the, some domains are separate, but that the scientific domain is necessarily nested inside the metaphysically religious domain. And I believe that that domain is isomorphic in some sense with the Darwinian domain. And that's the point I was trying to make in the discussions I had with Sam Harris. I have a lecture about that, Tom, the name of which I don't precisely remember unfortunately at the moment, but it's a lecture on Darwinian versus Newtonian approaches to the truth. And I tried to delineate my, my thoughts about that more particularly in that video. So how old was I when everything you understood started to come together? Um, I think that really started happening to me,

Speaker 2:          01:15:47       started probably happening to me when I was in my early twenties. Um, I think the most important realization I had, and I outlined this realization in my book, in the preface of my book maps, maps of meaning that I realized at about that age that almost everything I said was a false set of one form or another. It was either I was using language instrumentally in order to win arguments or to attain dominance or to indicate that I was intelligent or to use it for victory, for, for, for narrow local personal victory. And I realized that when I was in my early twenties and I started to cause a voice in some sense of voice started inside my head, which I now regard as something equivalent to the cricket in Pinocchio. And it basically continued, continually informed me that the things I was saying weren't in some fundamental sense weren't true.

Speaker 2:          01:16:42       And it was very disquieting because the voice that was commenting on what I was saying was making comments of that sort. I wouldn't call him disparaging act, our voices of voice. It was more just a, a matter of fact commentary. But it was saying it about about 95% of what I was saying. And I thought, well, that's a strange conundrum because now I don't know if I'm the voice that's criticizing what I'm saying or if I'm the thing that's saying what's being criticized, how do you figure that out? But I decided that I would take a chance and assumed that the part that was suggesting that I wasn't saying things truthfully was accurate. And I started to practice only saying things that that voice wouldn't object to. And I think that's also equivalent to some degree to trying to say only those things that make you strong instead of weak or that make you, that, that do not fill you with a post speech sense of shame and regret.

Speaker 2:          01:17:40       And I really think that was the beginning of, of all of this, um, about this. It was at the same time though that I was starting to work out to, are starting to work on the problem that I think is obsessed my, my entire life, which is what's the pathway between nihilism and totalitarianism? Is there, is there a genuine pathway between those two pathological extremes? So, and I think those things wove together. I had a serious problem to solve and I also tried to, tried to begin to sort out my language and really to learn how to work as well. So, and that was in my early twenties. Um, I mean I had lots of things to straighten out in my life. Many, many things. And I still have many things to straighten out in my life, but I think that's it. So, oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          01:18:39       Okay. But isn't the future authoring program just praying? Ah, well, you know, whenever you ask a question and the question is of the form, is x equal to y? The answer is always, it depends on how you define x. And it depends on how you define why and it's not a copout. I mean, your question really means something like, are there important similarities between what people conventionally described as prayer and the meditative exercise that you might undertake while doing the future authoring? And I would say yes, there are important similarities. I don't think it's reasonable to say that they're the same because people wouldn't automatically assume that they were the same. They're not obviously in the same category. But I would say that completing the future authoring exercise is to a large degree, um, putting into practice in a very pragmatic way, the ethical guidelines that were outlined in the sermon on the mount. Because what the sermon on the mount basically says is something like aim at the highest good that you can conceive of and then concentrate on the day. It's something like that. And there's also a tremendous call to truth in that sermon. So yes. Um, Sam Dogan asks, what is my favorite biblical story?

Speaker 2:          01:19:55       I don't know if I have a favorite. I mean, some of them I've analyzed more than others. I guess maybe that's wrong. Maybe the story that, that, that, that packs the most punch for unitive of, of, of, of conceptual effort per unit of conceptual effort is the story of Cain and Abel. That is really quite a story. I mean it's, it's very, very short and it's unbelievably punchy. So, so far that's the one that's been most remarkably illuminating to me. Now that's not it. It's a tough, tough question because I could say the same thing about the story of Adam and eve. I mean when I understood like, I mean, gaining some of the insights that I've had into these stories has really been a mind altering experience. So, for example, when I understood why it is in our, at least I believe I understood why it is that in the story of Adam and Eve, that human beings accrued the knowledge of good and evil, that they were transformed into moral agents when the scales fell from their eyes and they realized they were naked.

Speaker 2:          01:21:01       That was unbelievably powerful revelation for me. And the revelation was, for those of you who haven't heard me talk about it, that there's no difference between recognizing that you're naked and vulnerable and mortal and that you're going to die so that you're a vulnerable creature. And, and being able to take advantage of that vulnerability as it's manifested in yourself and other people. So you cannot be evil without knowledge of your own vulnerability and the vulnerability of others. And you can be evil as soon as you know that, because as soon as you understand that vulnerability, you understand how to exploit it. So animals, for example, predatory animals don't exploit the vulnerability of their, of their prey. I mean they killed them. And so in that sense, I suppose it's an exploitation, but they don't take conscious advantage of the prey. Knowing what would hurt them as individuals, the milks, they can't torture and they certainly can't torture intensely and for long periods of times, like human beings scout now it requires self consciousness. And so it's the emergence of self consciousness that gives people moral agency because they, they develop the capacity for evil at that point and developing the capacity for evil. They offer also develop the capacity for the opposite. Which minimum is the, the decision not to be as Google would put it, not to be any more evil than necessary. Let's say. So

Speaker 2:          01:22:41       Dr. Peterson, am I in the Illuminati? Huh? Well, if I wasn't in the Illuminati and I said no, that would just be proof that I was in the Illuminati. So I don't see any way I can answer that question without obviously offering proof that I am in the Illuminati. So, um, I don't, I'm in the Illuminati. How's that? That, that might work out? So

Speaker 2:          01:23:21       let's see. Jordan, Dr. Peterson, will you visit Fredericton, New Brunswick? I have visited Fredericton. I actually had quite a nice time there. Um, I, I'm try, I'm going to try to limit my travel to about once every six weeks because I have a bunch of other obligations that I have to keep up with. And so, and at the moment, Fredericton isn't on my travel schedule. I am releasing a book in the early part of 2018 it's called 12 rules for life, an antidote to chaos and it's 12 essays that I derived from a set of answers that I gave on the website. Cora, to the question, what are the most valuable things that everyone should know? What are the most valuable things that everyone should know? I think I wrote 42 little rules there and you can find them@jordanbpeterson.com some, um, uh, they're accompanied by photographic images that one of my viewers has kindly donated to the project.

Speaker 2:          01:24:18       People have been doing all sorts of Nice and creative things for me, helping me facilitate what I'm doing on Youtube. And they did that. Um, the reason I mentioned that is because I presume that when that book is released that I'll be going on a speaking tour and it's possible that Fredericton would be on that agenda, but I don't know because none of that has been formulated yet. So, um, the book, I'm happy with the book, I've been writing it for about three years and it's been quite thoroughly edited and commented on by my editor at Penguin Random House is publishing it in Canada and fed a number of friends of mine who are good authors and sometimes excellent authors, um, review it. And so, um, uh, that should give me the opportunity to do some more traveling and to talk about the book. So, okay, so let's say a Dr. Peterson, how did the postmodernist so successfully take over the education system?

Speaker 2:          01:25:14       Man, I should certainly knew, wish I knew the answer to that dedicated effort over three decades would do it. But I would also say, you know, if people are continually funded by the public purse for the political activity, they can spend a tremendous amount of time concentrating on it. And so, and when you also add to that the fact that 80% of humanities papers, uh, Garner zero citations, which means essentially that no one reads them or if they do, they don't do anything with them, then you don't have to spend a lot of time concentrating on what you're writing because it tends to be a very low quality, at least judged by the standards of attracting readership. And so I would say we've devoted a substantial proportion of the public funding of higher education to the production of precisely the kind of ideological ideologically minded activists who are aiming precisely at, at, at occupying positions of power everywhere they possibly can and transforming the social institutions into, into puppets of their particular form of possession. So, okay.

Speaker 2:          01:26:26       Iq and wisdom. What's the relationship between Iq and wisdom? I would say virtually no relationship whatsoever. There no evidence of any relationship. So for example, I, wisdom seems to be something more like the balance between, uh, uh, a large set of, of abilities and virtues. And there is no evidence that I know of that, that people with higher iqs are, are wiser than people without high iqs. I don't, I don't see any evidence for that. So, and I think it's partly because you can be, your, your capacity to think can lead you into very bad places just as well in some sense as it can lead you into very good places. So it's a tool. It's a very, very powerful tool and it's a tool that can be wielded for, for better or for worse. And even in relationship to your own wellbeing, have you seen many people who, whose intelligence and rationality has become nothing but the kind of critical force that completely undermines their capacity to live? It makes them nihilistic and bitter and resentful and, and it's, uh, it's uh, and proud as well because it's very intelligent. People tend to be very proud of their intelligence, which is also a mistake because they're not the creators of that intelligence and have no reason to take personal credit for it. So, but wisdom, whatever wisdom is, doesn't seem to be related to in any straight forward manner to street intelligence. So, um,

Speaker 2:          01:27:51       someone says, I made the mistake of using, um, psychedelic and recreational drugs to access when I was young and I'm sorry I missed, I can't see the question right now. So I'm going to have to regenerate it for memory. And the consequence of that I believe is that my ability to think has become very cloudy and uncertain. And I don't know what to do about that. I would say that you should probably go talk to a psychologist or a psychiatrist because there, there may be things that could be done to sharpen your thinking up again, and maybe some of them perversely enough might be pharmacological. Perhaps, you know, what you're describing could be a consequence of something like depression or even post traumatic stress disorder. Um, so because the evidence on the longterm use of, of, of psychedelic drugs for example, isn't, it doesn't indicate that in that overall they produce negative health consequences of the sort that you're describing.

Speaker 2:          01:28:48       Now you might've had adulterated drugs, you might've been one of those people. And there do seem to be people like that who are prone to negative consequences for using various recreational drugs. But I would say if you really think that your cognitive ability has been impaired, you should probably go talk to a psychologist or a psychiatrist and see if you can do something about that. Because sometimes, for example, antidepressants or drugs like Wellbutrin, which is also an antidepressant, but a different kind can be very useful in restoring mental clarity. It's worth a shot. You know, you don't want to go through life like that. So, okay. Do I believe in the power of Lord Keck? What do you think of the rise of belief and need magic? Well, I don't think it's any different. It's the use of archetypal imagery. And I don't know if if, I mean obviously archetypal imagery, it has tremendous power. And so when, when right now people are obsessed with archetypes of chaos and Kik is a manifestation of an archetype of chaos and, and transformation because the frog is a, as a, as a spirit of transformation. I talked about that did an interview with a great Russian Orthodox carver named Jonathan Powell, who's very knowledgeable about such things. And we did a, uh, uh, a youtube video on the metaphysics of pepe. And so if you're interested in that, you might want to take a look at that. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:30:19       is there a universal female story opposite to the hero myth? Yeah, I think there is. I think it's beauty and the beast. Um, although I think that the taming of the partner, the taming of the wild partner as an as a, as a myth is applicable to men and women. There's an element of taming that goes on in a relationship regardless of the sex of the people who were involved in the relationship. So men, team women and women take men. Um, I think the idea of taming and civilizing men is more directly a part of the fundamental archetype of the feminine. And I think that for a variety of reasons, but I think beauty and the beast might be the canonical female heroes story. So, uh, I would like to elaborate on that. But what, I'm starting to get tired and I don't have the mental energy to do that. I may do a video on beauty and the beast though I'd like, I would like to do that. So, um,

Speaker 2:          01:31:27       what do I think is the archetype whole significance of the popularity of the anti hero in American television? Oh, well that's, that's easy. I mean the, the anti hero nature, nature made the proposition that he said that morality is cowardice. No, that's not exactly what he said. What he, what he said in a more elaborated for him is that very frequently people are afraid to do things and they're often things that other people regard bad. And because they don't want to admit to themselves that the reason they won't do those things that are regarded as bad is because they're cowardly. They pretended to that it's because they're moral. And so often conventional morality is a consequence of conventional cowardice. And the problem with conventional cowardice is that it's not sufficient to solve serious problems. And so for example, it's necessary for a man and perhaps for a woman as well to become a bit of a monster or even a lot of a monster in order to move through life successfully.

Speaker 2:          01:32:31       And that doesn't mean precisely that you have to act out being a monster, but it means that you need to be able to be a monster when the circumstances demanded. And so the reason that anti heroes like Walter White, for example, are so popular in American culture is because the criminal Walter White was by no obvious, was in no obvious way, less moral than the conventional and cowardly Walter White. Now you might say he went from one extreme to another, which he did, but it's also the case that in order to expand past the domains of conventional morality slash cowardice from the Nietzschean perspective, it's necessary to incorporate elements of the shadow. And that's in some sense what needs you meant when he said that we need to go beyond good and evil. And it's certainly what you meant when he said that it's necessary for someone who wants to burst forth from the potentially pathological combined confines of their conventional persona into the, the journey towards individuation and, and the development of the self was that the shadow had to be incorporated.

Speaker 2:          01:33:43       And that means often in part, the capacity for aggression, uh, the capacity for sexual expression, the capacity to defy defy convention, that capacity to take your own road. And that's all predicated on the development of an inner relationship with the monster. And it's the same idea that's expressed in Harry Potter. Harry Potter is actually able to combat voldemort who's essentially Satan for all intents and purposes because he has a pace of evil, lodged firmly within him. And it's also what makes him a, uh, redeeming rule breaker. Right? So, so the anti hero is the shadow, roughly speaking. And the shadow is the thing that the persona needs to incorporate to become the hero. So South Fresno says, I preached a sermon and use some of your cane enables stuff. Well, that's good. I wouldn't say that it's, my cane enables stuff though much as I'd like to take credit for it.

Speaker 2:          01:34:41       Um, but I'm happy to hear that. And uh, um, I hope it worked well and, and that there were people at your sermon because otherwise that would be a problem. So, um, Jordan, what's your favorite mean? Made a view? Well, I don't know. Um, I don't know if I've developed a favorite. Um, let me think about that for a minute. I find the fact that they're being made of great amusement, I think it's absurd. It's absolutely absurd and ridiculous and I can't believe that it's happening. So, um, I know that that's not much of an answer to your question, but, um, I find the whole category, I don't know what to say about it. It's surreal. It's a surreal phenomenon. And, uh, the association that has emerged between me and, and kermit the frog and pepe, I also find that that's, that's, that was actually the most market form of synchronicity that I, I've ever seen manifest itself. So that was really something quite remarkable and amazing. And I talk about that also with Jonathan Patio on the, in the metaphysics of pepe. So

Speaker 2:          01:36:19       turned off again. Yeah, I turned it back on. It seems to turn off on a relatively regular basis. So there must be something. There must be some setting that we just don't understand that any of you have a Canon camera and you use it for video broadcasting and it shuts off now and then, and you know why you could, uh, put that in the comment section. I'm sure we'll figure it out, but it does seem to be a regular occurrence. So, all right, so I'm going to sign out here pretty quick because I'm starting to wear out and I don't want to say anything pathologically idiotic for public consumption and that could happen and that would be a bad thing. So, okay, so let's see. I'll ask answer one more question.

Speaker 1:          01:36:59       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       The Canon cameras in the tea range, go to sleep at Canon. Cameras in the tea range. Go to sleep. Okay. Thank you very much. Hey, that's from Louis Guillermo Martinez Pinzon. And if I remember correctly, please correct me if I'm wrong. I believe that that is the delightful gentleman from Mexico who's produced the, uh, excellent graphic intro that I use on my videos and he's produced another one for me, which I'm going to be using on my youtube interviews. So thank you very much, Luis, and, and I will, or Louie and I will check that out. That's, that's a good, that's good hint. Thank you very much. What are my personal spiritual practices and rituals? Um,

Speaker 2:          01:37:53       the simpsons. Yeah, I'm absolutely addicted to the simpsons. I think I've watched every single episode of the simpsons at least five times. Generally what I do is I start with episode one and I go through all of them. And that takes about a year or maybe a year and a half. And then I started at the beginning and again, and I go through them again. And I also watched the trailer park boys. I'm very embarrassed to state to say that, but I, I've also quite addicted to the trailer park boys and that's outside on. I don't know what to say about that, but, um, I, I think that bubbles is one of the most remarkable comedic characters that Canadian comics have ever developed. And I think the same thing about ricky, I really think that show is a profane and, and distasteful work of genius and it's a guilty pleasure. So I guess those are my spiritual practice watching the simpsons in the trailer park boys.

Speaker 2:          01:38:44       I should also tell you, because this is a funny story and because my son happens to be sitting here with me and he can tell you that this is the truth. When my kids were little, we didn't have a television and the only television show I ever let them watch was the simpsons. Yes, exactly. And so when they were really little, I used to cover up their eyes when itchy and scratchy came on because I thought that was a bit too much. But, um, I thought that the simpsons was a very honest satirical show and that it was teaching them the proper, the proper rules of life and they didn't seem to turn out too badly. And they have really good senses of humor. So, um, so it seems to have worked on all Simpson Diet. That's not the ritual I recommend for children. I didn't take them to church, but I, I had them watch the simpsons on regular basis and probably I should be hauled off in front of the child, you know, child welfare people for that and admitting it.

Speaker 2:          01:39:34       And that's why I need to stop because I'll tell you other things that I've done and I'll get myself in trouble. So. All right. So, oh, and Louie Guillermo Martinez has been zone says also when no one presses any buttons. I see. Okay. I see. So it is set to automatically shut off because it assumes that no one is doing anything. Do you know Louis, what I can do to stop it from shutting off because I don't want to get up in the middle of a broadcast and like push a button. So, so much, much appreciated. So, okay. I think I'm going to stop guys. Um, I appreciate that. I appreciate the support very much and I'm doing my best to put it to the best of all possible uses. One thing I couldn't tell you is that you know that I'm doing this series on the Bible.

Speaker 2:          01:40:22       You may know that or may not. It's going to start I believe May 16th but possibly May 23rd and I'm going to go through the Bible from beginning to end describing the psychological significance of the stories. But another thing that I've got involved in recently, and this is in, it's in its early stages of development, but I met a group of of moderate Muslim intellectuals in Toronto a couple of times now and they're planning a reformist movement, a reformist Islam movement that will be grounded in Canada. And I hope to be involved in out in some integral manner, partly as a consequence of doing youtube videos and podcast interviews on the topic of Islam and on how it, how it's more extremist elements might be properly Moto Mod, your ma moderate it. And so you know, that's a big deal and who knows if that'll go anywhere. But that's definitely something that I want to devote my attention towards because it seems like an extraordinarily important topic.

Speaker 2:          01:41:17       And so with any luck, I'll be able to concentrate my attention on elucidating the psychological significance of the biblical stories from beginning to end. And also engage in a dialogue with intelligent and careful and thoughtful moderate Muslims about how we might bridge the gap between our two civilizations in a manner that would be productive. And so that's part of what I'm, that's what I'm aiming out utilizing the resources that you, people are partly providing me with as well as continuing to develop the youtube channel and, and the, the biblical lectures will be taped by the same people who'd be doing my lectures. And so, um, that's part of, that's part of the upcoming plan over the next couple of years. So I would say, and that might be enough if I could do those two things extraordinarily well or even well, hopefully I could do them extraordinarily well, but if I could devote my efforts to doing that credibly, that would be, that would be really worth, that would be something really worth doing.

Speaker 2:          01:42:12       So thank you all and thank you for putting up with the technical glitches and all of that. And I'll, I'll get better at this as I go. Uh, you know how it is when you first do something. It's okay if you're a fool, as long as you're not any more of a fool than you have to be, and you get better at things by doing them somewhat badly to begin with. So anyways, thanks very much. I'll see some of you again in a month and, uh, um, over now and thanks to Julian very much for helping me sort this out and set it up good night.

Speaker 1:          01:42:50       Hm.
