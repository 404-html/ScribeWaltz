Speaker 1:          00:00:30       All the books here. They're all, they're all at the coop. Does anybody else missing syllabus then this will be the set up was missing a syllabus. Anybody else? All the, all the readings at the top are in the coursebook. That's abnormal in the coffee and the books that are listed below, they're all separate books. Okay. Well let's just go over there. Are you ready? Okay, let's go there. Oh, alright. I should welcome my extension school students too. We'll be looking at this morning. Okay. If you turn to the back of the syllabus where it says two calendar of events, the titles that are listed on the right hand side are all chapters from the coursebook that sap? No moon coffee. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       And then if you look at reading list and due dates, so is it agile readings? Those are all books that are responsive to this one, which is for weeks one to three or books that are available at the coop. Okay. And the address for noman coffee is 13 olds for Massachusetts Avenue. All right. And as I said, there's a mixture of analytical psychology texts that's basically young in psychology. Some philosophy, some literature and some more neuropsychology and not basically covers the domain of the course. So I'll start the introduction here. Okay. This is a course about the causes of social conflict. Um, I'm not interested in social conflict from the perspective of a political scientist or a sociologist. I'm interested in intergroup conflict, but not at the level of group analysis. I'm interested in what role social identity or group identity plays in individual psychology and why it is that individuals are motivated to participate in acts of conflict.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       Um, are you using for an example here, the Holocaust, I was thinking last week reading part of the preface to the book that you're going to read about the Holocaust museum in Washington. There was a lot of heads up, obviously this is a museum to hope to the Jews primarily who were killed by the Nazis in World War Two. And there's a number of museums like this throughout the world and their central model is never forget, and this has always been confusing to me. It's notion of never forgetting because I don't think you can remember something that you don't understand. And I don't think we understand why the Holocaust happened in World War II. I think. I think you might regard the Holocaust as none learned lesson and I don't think that you can process information you don't comprehend, so we'll just say never forget things. The question is what is it that you're supposed to remember and use it?

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       The fact that 6 million people were killed, does it? Is it the fact of that particular event or are you supposed to be giving some consideration to holocaust like events that have occurred through history. There are people who think that what happened in World War II was a relatively unique event of something unparalleled in history. This is not a position that I adopt. I think actually it's a very common sort of event. It was perhaps it was the event of that sort that has proved most shocking to the European conscience, so to speak, but it's hardly strikes me as unique and people often talk about the Holocaust in terms of the relationship between the Jews and the Germans are between the Jews and the Nazis. The Jews obviously playing the part of victims and the Nazis often for always playing the part of the perpetrators. And of course this has absolutely comprehensible from the historical point of view, but it also strikes me that if what we remember is that the Nazis killed the Jews that were already on the road to making a mistake that similar to the mistake that was made that led to the Holocaust to begin with, which is to identify characteristics that lead to patterns of action of that sort as characteristics of groups identifiable groups.

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       And it seems to me, I mean I'm not trying to equate the role of the Jews and the Nazis and producing the Holocaust that would obviously be observed, but what I'm trying to say is that the last one, it seems to me to be, especially when you consider that the propensity for home costs like events is deeply rooted in human nature. The lesson to draw from the events of World War II with the, that's what human beings are like, not what the Nazis were like because these sorts of events happen all the time. I mean, it's obviously the case that there are well in the 20th century alone, English and bent at the concentration camp in South Africa, Germans, her fact that Chinese used it to great advantage, Solzhenitsyn estimated, I'll show this on the next slide. 66 million people in the Soviet Union were killed as a consequence of internal repression, many of whom went through camp like procedures on their road to their demise.

Speaker 2:          00:06:09       See ethnic cleansing occurring in places like Rwanda and even once again in Europe and the Balkans, whatever it was that we were supposed to learn from the events of the Second World War hasn't been learned nor being remembered because you can't remember what you don't understand. That's what this course is about. I'm, I've been working for since 1985 I guess on trying to figure out what it is about. People remember how to read that. Maybe you know this, maybe don't. She's a famous political scientists. She was a student of Martin heidegger. She wrote a book called the banality of evil and one of her points was that these people, she was talking about the Nazis in particular, people who perpetrate events like this. If you meet them, if you talk to them, if you have encounter with them, the thing that's often striking about them is not their striking abnormality or their evidence to eval, but the fact that they're very much like other people that you might've met, which was suppose putting be surprises.

Speaker 2:          00:07:07       So surprising when you think about how thoroughly, for example, the Nazi movement dominated the German punches and sort of likewise with communism in the Soviet Union. I mean those ideological movements characterize people. They didn't characterize some strange sort of misfits whose consciousness was characterized by something in comprehensible that led them to perform the kind of actions that we are theoretically supposed to remember. My perspective on all of the assistants, the fact that people are capable of perpetrating atrocities like those that characterized the Holocaust. It says something about what people are like, what everybody's like, because it's strikes me that that kind of tendency is something that's deeply rooted in human nature and then to say that, but what was it about the Nazis or what was it about the Soviet communists that led them to participate in this sort of behavior is completely decided to point in a sense.

Speaker 2:          00:08:04       All that does is you're looking for some sort of group characteristic. It's devoid and you don't have any personal relationship with that group. The problem is instantly made abstract and as far as I'm concerned, if it's abstract, well then once again, nothing is remembered and what I want to do is to try to, I want to outline the reasons why. Something like the whole, the costs incurred, what it is about us that make us so concerned with protecting our group identities, what those identities mean, what role they play in the regulation of emotion. That's the critical thing right there for me, idiot ologies are, are, are the expression in a sense, the verbal expression of the internal structures that regulate our emotions. When you mess around with someone's ideologies. Therefore as a consequence, you're messing around with the inhibitory structure that regulates the interplay between their emotions.

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       So we're going to study in part in this course of what emotions are and how they're rooted in neuropsychology and neurophysiology and how they manifest themselves and behavior and how they might be controlled and how that might tie into something as abstract as social identity. Usually there's no question that a link made between the concept of sociological processes, so to speak, and inter psychic processes or neuropsychological structures, but it's obviously, if you think about it for a moment that whatever your identity is plays some role in regulating your emotional nature and your of your physiology because your thoughts are embodied. They're part of your mind, you're part of your brain. Do you want to get right down to it? People have belief systems and they'll do anything to protect and I find that peculiar is what is it that's so important about belief system that would lead people to do things.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       Normal people as far as I'm concerned, to commit acts that under normal circumstances would would be conceived of as incomprehensible even by those people. So I also hope to make, as I said, I want to make the lessons here personal. I'm not interested in discussing the issue from the abstract perspective because I don't think that an issue, an issue of this magnitude deserves to be discussed. Data at an abstract level. It's not an abstract problem. It's something, there's something peculiar about us that we have to learn to control because as far as I'm concerned, we're to the technologically powerful to remain at the whims of the uncomprehending aspects of our nature piece, predictability and the delusion of self representation. What does that mean? Well, if you can predict something as a general rule, it's hard to determine why it is that you think you understand something when you think you do.

Speaker 2:          00:10:59       If you think about it for a moment, it gets complicated because you're surrounded by things that at some level of analysis, you cease to understand. It doesn't matter what what phenomenon it is, and even even the most mundane objects become mysterious. If you look into them foreign, take something as simple as a chairs made out of wood. That's all. There's nothing remarkable about that. But if you start to look into the structure that wouldn't count. Organism Mitre produced it. All of the chemical reactions that go about bringing that about and the developmental history that led to the, to the emergence of plants and trees. But it can see that even in something mundane or and banded all sorts of mysteries. But for the large part we traded show something. We understand well that's in part because we're only concerned with it with regards to its function. And if it serves the function of being able to be sat upon, then we don't pay any more attention to it. So we think that if we can predict the behavior or something that we understand it. So in peace when we observe ourselves acting peacefully, we presume that we'd got ourselves under control, that we actually do understand about each other because we can predict the behavior of others. Then we can predict their own behavior. Now deludes us into thinking best therefore our models of ourselves or actual actually accurate representations of what we're like,

Speaker 3:          00:12:17       wow,

Speaker 2:          00:12:17       the problem is in wartime we don't act like we do in times of peace, but then of course during war time when people are committing violent or socially aggressive acts, they don't really have all that much time to sit around and self reflect. So it's not a time to be to be building models about who it is that you are and why it is that you're that way you're too busy doing whatever it is that you happen to be involved in to protect your territory or to take someone else's territory or two to expand your ecological dominion or whatever it is. Peaceful Times. We look at ourselves, can we see ourselves being peacefully they bleed and nice name, who make the precept position that as a consequence, that's what we're like and that we also understand herself. This is a big mistake because if you put someone under extreme circumstances then there will be things about them that will be revealed to them that can only be revealed under extreme circumstances and it's extreme circumstances that were concerned about in the course of this course.

Speaker 2:          00:13:12       I want to find out, I think that one of the things that ideology does a group identity for that matters, regulating our emotions and if you're a member of a community that has a successful ideology and so the social structure is basically stable and successful, then your emotions are regulated so well that you don't even know that they're there. Just to say that you're protected by something that you don't understand from something that you don't comprehend. And when I want to do is open the gates a little bit and let you see what's underneath your comfortable social identities and what it is that you're protected from by the weight of your history.

Speaker 2:          00:13:53       Well, this is the central question I guess. Then like first of all, I think social aggression is a primary Cuban characteristics. If you even have a cursory knowledge of history, it's obviously the case work or plays in the man's role. And it seems to be the case that this is also true down the find a genetic lottery. I mean for a long time it was thought, for example, the chimpanzees live peaceably and this appears to be the case as long as you studied chimpanzee's within their own family or kin unit or I suppose roughly speaking tribe, he had a piece of lead to each other even in their dominance, dominance dispute. So usually settled more or less peacefully good. All discovered not so long ago that chimpanzees conduct wars and clan wars by, by all occurrences when a chimp group is faced with an interloper from another group or with another group that they're capable of engaging in the same sort of behavior, have much, much more fundamental level in the sense that we are and also seems to be the case as we'll see a little bit later in this discussion that similar things are true.

Speaker 2:          00:14:54       Even animals is as simple, so to speak is wrapped, uh, looks like the capacity for. So it's strange. It's strange because it's obvious that people have a tremendous capacity for social affiliation. I mean, we made groups in the West. People are usually considered as rugged individual, less so to speak, but it's all, it's the case. Even in the most individualistic of societies that were constantly in contact with other people. Almost all our environment, there's other people, we're all members of literally often dozens of groups, families and in groups devoted towards certain tasks and and so on and so forth. We're very, very, very social thrive in a social community. But it looks like the flip side of that is the fact that we're so capable of making social groups also makes us very capable of organized aggression against other social groups. So it's, it's the strange phenomena that it's our very capacity for social organization that also gives us this terrible capacity for social aggression.

Speaker 2:          00:15:49       So that's another thing that I want to take a look at it of course, like I really want to get at the core of this too. I, like I said ago, I'm not interested in messing around with a question on an abstract level. I want to end the course with concrete answers about why it is that people are capable of doing the sorts of things that characterize not to behavior say during the Holocaust. I want to make that so crystal clear that you can map out the argument from precept position a tick to conclusion d so that it's socially and personally approved, clickable and so that you also get a glimpse perhaps of what might be necessary from the perspective of personal and interpersonal conduct to alleviate the likelihood that you'll get trapped into doing something like that. It's one of the things you pointed out cause he was very concerned with events.

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       The second reward and social aggression in general, he said you have to understand is that these great evils tend to take place one small step at a time. Do people get tracked into them over a long period of time? You make a small bad error but it doesn't look so big at the time at least to another type of error. That snot so baby as well. And that leads to a third era and he spoke so big. But if you've put together 40 of those areas or 50 of those errors and all of a sudden you see that someone's traveling down a road to a place where they might not want it to have gone in the beginning, have they been conscious of it? So one of the things about never forgetting is to understand is to engage in primary prevention, so to speak, which is to understand how the sweetness in the second half of, of course has to do with that issue, particularly personal relationship to group identity and group fostered action. So the first part of the course basically deals with why it is that we're susceptible to social aggression as a consequence of our biological makeup. What it is about us that makes us like that. And the second part of the course is about how certain patterns of personal calm down heighten the possibility is socially aggressive acts will take place and about how it is that you might avoid engaging in all sorts of that.

Speaker 3:          00:18:06       That's an overhead

Speaker 2:          00:18:17       detail. Some of the things I've already discovered. So good home here. I'm going to tell you a story from the Soviet Union. It's soldier knit some total. He introduces it with the home from the Russian poet Mayakovsky with cohesion, construction, grit and repression. Bring the neck of this gang run riot. That's nice. Pole social knits and wondering who was the game. That's the question. As I said, he has to make 66 million people died. The Soviet Union between 1917 to 1959 Solzhenitsyn also estimated that is substantially larger number of parish in Communist China. No one really knows the staffs on that. Now this is a debatable statistic as Social Nixon points out in this book, this is from the Gulag archipelago. As he said, as soon as the official statistics are released to revise his estimates. This includes, for example, several millions million hasn't pushed into the Tundra and forced relocation in your early twenties 6 million Ukrainians, we six months. You have even the famines in the 1930s

Speaker 3:          00:19:27       pretty good a story.

Speaker 2:          00:19:40       So this is the situation.

Speaker 2:          00:19:44       So what did, did she tell you a little bit about his life story? You go like archipelago is a three volume. The second volume of which you will read is his story about the blue light. Good light. It was a system of forced labor camps set up in the Soviet Union soon after late and die. In fact, yes, some of them were set up before he died and upon which the Soviet economy duty ran for much of, it's for much of what constituted its life. Soldier Solzhenitsyn's started, he has traveled through the ghoulag originally as a Russian is frontline soldier. So neat story and Sam's got thrown into a German prisoner of war camp and when he was repatriated to the Soviet Union stabling through Beta in a concentration camp. And the reason was as he did with all the return Russian prisoners of war who are treated by the way terribly and the German prisoners of war camps because stellman refused to sign the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners.

Speaker 2:          00:20:46       So not only were they in prisoners of war camps, which was miserable enough that they were starved to the degree that the other allied prisoners used to give them food. They didn't have much food themselves, so he was a front line soldier. Then he got thrown in a German prisoner of war camp and then when he finally returned to Russia, Stellan through and the concentration camp, and the reason for that was that the Russians who were in German prisoners of war camp had been contaminated by their exposure to western ideas and that was his rationale. So anyways, then he spent a decade and a half or thereabouts and concentration camps, but when he got out he developed stomach cancer. So that's a brief summary of some of the highlights of his life. Okay. In this scene, he's being transported from one camp to another. You know, a railway car that's being roughly outfitted for transporting human beings.

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       He's sitting with the friend that he calls panic. I'm just going to read you this story. My friend pattern and I are lying on the Middle Shelf of a stall up in compartment. That's what it was. Cattle cars basically to refit it for human transport and have set ourselves up comfortably, talk to our salt carrying in our pocket so we don't need water and can go to sleep. But at some station or other, they shoved into our compartment. A Marxist scholar. We can tell this from his goatee and spectacles. He doesn't hide the fact. So He's been arrested. He's a devout communist, being arrested by the communists. He doesn't hide the fact. He's a former professor of the guardianist academy. We hang head down in the square, cut out from his very first words. We see that he is impenetrable, but we have been serving time for a very long time and have a long time left to serve and we value of Mary joke.

Speaker 2:          00:22:35       We'd was pointing down, have fun. There's ample space left in the compartment. So we exchanged places with someone and crowd in. Hello? Hello? You don't too crowded? No, it's all right. Have you been in the jug a long time? Long enough or you past the halfway mark? Just look over there. How poverty stricken her villages are. Straw thatch, crooked hugs. That's an inheritance heritance from the czarist regime. What we've already had 30 Soviet years. That's an insignificant period. Historic. It's terrible that the collective farmers are starving, but have you look in all the wrappings just ask any collective farber in apartment. Well, everyone in jail is embittered and prejudice, but I've seen collective farms myself. That means they were uncharacteristic. The goatee had never been in any of them that way. Simpler.

Speaker 2:          00:23:43       Just ask the old folks and bizarre. They were well fed, well clothed, and they used to have many holidays. I'm not even going to ask. It's a subjective trait of human memory to praise everything in the past. The cow or the died is the one that gave twice the milk. Sometimes even certain problems and there are people don't like holidays. They like to work. Why is there a shortage of brandon? Many cities when right before the war, for example, not true before the war, everything in fact and be more. Listen at that time in all the cities on the pool guy, they were accused of thousands of people, a local failure and supply. More likely your memory's failing you, but there this shortage. Now old wives tales we have from seven to 8 billion bushels of grain. The grain is rotten, not so we've been very successful in developing new species, great and so forth.

Speaker 2:          00:24:48       He's going to perturb level. He speaks in the language between quarters, no effort of the mind and arguing with him is like walking through a desert. It's about people like that, but they say he made the rounds of all the blocks smiths and came home on Shawn and when they write in their obituaries perished tragically during the period of the stone in this cult, it should be corrected to read perished comically benefits. Faith had worked out differently. We would have never learned what a dry, insignificant little man he really was. We would have respectfully read his name in the newspaper. We would have, he would have become a people's commissar or even ventured to represent the whole Russia abroad. To argue with him. It was useless. It was much more interesting to play with. It don't a chess, but at the game of comrades already is such a game.

Speaker 2:          00:25:39       It's very simple game play up to him. A couple of times or so, you used some of his own pet words and phrases. He'll like that phrase, grown accustomed to find it all around him are enemies. He's become weary of snarling and doesn't like to tell his stories because all of them will be twisted and thrown right back into space. But if he takes you for one of his own, he will quite. Keven only disclosed to you. What have you seen at the station? People are passing by talking, laughing. Life goes on. The party is providing leadership. People are being moved from job to job. If you and I are languishing here in prison, there are only a handful of us and we must write and write petitions, begging a review of our cases for a pardon or he will tell you something interesting. In the Communist Academy, they decided to devour one program and he decided he wasn't quite genuine, one of our own and somehow they couldn't manage it. There were no errors in his assets and his biography was clean and all of a sudden going through the archives,

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       what a fine. They ran across an old brochure written by his comrade in which Vladimir Ilyich Lenin himself had held in his hands. And in the margin of which he had written in his own handwriting. The notation has it in the economist is shit, well now you understand or smile essentially, but after that it's no trouble at all to make short work of that model. Hadn't paused. He was expelled from the academy and deprived of the scholar. This story. That's a perfect example of the kind of phenomena that I'm interested in trying to understand. The communist professor, this exchange, he doesn't think, it doesn't have to think because he has an ideological system that time it worked out.

Speaker 1:          00:27:45       He won't admit any evidence whatsoever exists to suggest that some of his presuppositions are wrong. For every bit of evidence that exists, there is a counter argument that justifies it or excuse it or makes it disappear in some way. That's the first part of this story. The second part of the story is that being like this, he's also extraordinarily clannish in a sense. Can you tell us a brief story about being in the Communist Academy where everyone shares in urology and finding outside yourself essentially destroyed there specific reasons why the two halves of that narrative, we're stuck together because the first attitude leads in absorb link to the second attitude, which is to say the adoption and authoritarian etiology, which is basically the presumption of omniscience in a sense. If you're an idiot, you think that what you think is the right thing thing. There isn't anything else that needs to be thought.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       It's you that has the answer. Now you might know, thank it's you. You might even think that it's your leader or the ideology in and of itself, but the point is you're the one that's in possession of the absolute truth in every fact that might exist to dispute that is eliminated. And a problem with the limited facts is that sometimes they come in and body form, which is to say we tend to think of ideas as disembodied abstract and entities, but the truth of the matter is that ideas are representations of human patterns of action and sometimes the enemy idea is actually the enemy. And there's very little difference from the practical perspective between repressing facts that are uncomfortable and repressing people whose viewpoints or even styles of existence are equal in long term. So this is another example, this sort of thinking that I want to explain, I want to spend the motivation for that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       Why is it that someone would adopt a rigid ideological position and then defend it sometimes to their own debt but more frequently to the death of others and to feel that not only is that is that acceptable, we'd often even morally justifiable. It's is the thing that should be done. You're a good Patriot so just so this is the quick thesis. This is what I want to address and of course I don't want to use this. I said I don't want to take a stab at the question so to speak. I don't want to beat around the Bush on an answer these so that when you're finished of course you will. What purpose group identification serves, why it's so important to people, how it developed, what it means to have a belief. People have beliefs. We never really, a question we get is what it means when you say that. I have, I think the world is in a particular way as opposed to some other particular way. Why do we feel threatened? We were in groups. We identify with our challenged. Why does challenge me as aggressive and righteously and sort of the core. I guess those are the core questions of course centers around.

Speaker 1:          00:31:16       There's more I can describe the whole, of course. Obviously it's the first lecture. This is about half the half the story. I'm also interested in how our own personal behaviors make our group identification more or less dangerous and what can be done about that as well. Okay, so do you understand why we are capable of atrocious behavior? You have to understand how we think and I want to approach that from a variety of different perspectives giving you initially he grounding and mortar neuro psychology or psychology and emotion and emotional regulation because that puts the discussion on what I think is a firm foundation. He said I bring in 10 political ideas and ideas from literature and philosophy as well, but it's nice to also have reference to some facts that are acceptable as facts. That's when you start, you know, psychology well, how do we think this is half the store? We'll discuss the other half as we go through the course.

Speaker 2:          00:32:44       The course is predicated on a theory of knowledge. Let's suggest that we classify objects in situations according to two separate types of schemes. And the first type of scheme is one that everyone was essentially familiar with apps. The scientific scheme that makes the presupposition that there's an objective world that's apprehensible to the census make, can be collectively describe, which is only to say that the thing is real, if you can sense it, choose me means if you can touch it or see it or in some other way detected. If you can describe the price procedures by which now detection. Oh Curd. And if someone else duplicating those procedures comes up with this same observations and that's a real thing and that's a fact. It's a scientific fact and we've been able to codify a methodology for determining what is from the objective perspective and I don't think there's, there's no real reason to dispute that seems more or less self evident.

Speaker 2:          00:33:55       It's a relatively new procedure. We've only been really good at it for 500 years at the most. It's going to be in that long since the scientific enterprise is being transformed into something that was actually codify. It's obviously an extraordinary efficient way to proceed and there's no point in a sense, been debating is utility. That's one type of knowledge scheme, but there's another type that people have spent much less time formalize it partly because it's more difficult before we want to say with regards to the scientific method, we more or less have a set of agreed upon rules by which the endeavor should proceed and also by which to judge the validity of the outcomes of the procedures. You can write them down. They're very much formalized. That's why almost anybody can do scientific research, especially the type of scientific research that Tom is tuned described as normal, which basically means that you have a set theory what's you're not trying to challenge and working with him to theory to more or less flesh it out, so a technician putting into work potent technical tools that you can virtually do by rote.

Speaker 2:          00:35:09       Anyways, we figured out how to formalize that. That's an answer to the question. What is, how to control things. The second type of inflammation. That's the type of that I am concerned in this course and that is not what a thing is from the objective perspective but about what it is from the perspective of determining its implications for behavior and to say, well there are things and there is also knowledge about how to behave in your presence. First kind of information you might consider. The second kind of inflammation is more akin to what has been traditionally described as wisdom because wisdom is the knowledge of how to conduct yourself. Things exist and the fact that their existence has implications for behavior and what's the implications of the existence of things for behavior that I want to focus on. Because in our social command it's we come to agreements over vast stretches of time about what sorts of behaviors are to be considered appropriate in which situations and under which conditions, and it's this agreement Atlantans predictability to our interpersonal relationships.

Speaker 2:          00:36:20       It can take an example just of this course we all share map, so to speak of what behaviors are appropriate in a situation like this. And essentially what that means is that we can come in here and conduct our business and we all know what that business is going to be. There's no dispute about that and we all know more or less what our respective roles are going to be in conducting that business. There's no real, there's no space for disputed at all, which basically means that our shared map of the significance of the events that are occurring in this room eliminates the need for conflict. We don't even have, we don't have fight about what's going to happen here. We don't have to fight about who owns that sunkist orange juice or who's going to take control of the pens or who owns that particular computer or who's going to, or how the, how the discussion is going to proceed.

Speaker 2:          00:37:08       That's all mapped out for us in some ways and that means that we've rendered ourselves in this particular situation predictable, which means that there's no reason for any of us to regard any of the other people in the room with any sort of apprehension whatsoever. So in a sense you could say that for me, you're a fixed object in terms of your significance in this environment. And the reason for that is because we're engaging in a culturally determined process, none of which were questioning or at least that we've, we've accepted implicitly or explicitly and implicitly you're out of university. This is what happens at a university, you know, that I know of that we don't have to set any of the ground. Well, it's our shared apprehensions about the implications of situations for behaviors that constitute our cultures. And it's those shared maps that bring predictability to our interpersonal relationships.

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       And what that essentially you can only understand that if you understand what the world is like when it's not predictable. And it's difficult to understand that for water and people who live in peaceful times because our culture is so successful at regulating our interpersonal behavior and even the environment for that matter. But we hardly ever encounter a situation where anything remotely unpredictable happens. So you can't tell what it's like to be faced with something that's unpredictable. So you don't know what it's like when you're in an environment where culture doesn't rain because you're part of a successful community in your extraordinarily well protected it. You're like, you're like a boy that lives inside the castle. You can't see over the walls. It doesn't even know that they're there and just all sorts of terrible things outside the castle. But everything inside is peaceful and that's the world and the boy has no idea what he would be like if he went outside into the real world where things were actually not predictable because he's only had a chance to observe his behavior under stable conditions where everything's predictable and acceptable.

Speaker 2:          00:39:00       It's even worse now in a sense it's better than waiting too. I mean he is peaceful now in many ways. I mean even compared to 15 years ago, there's much less ideological dispute in the world about how to conduct affairs. Then there was staying in the mid seventies and people are more or less, I mean I know there's exceptions to this, but people in the world over have more or less accepted in this basket. For example, for a market and economy, there aren't very many ideologies that appear attractive even in the imagination in contrast to two western style democracies and I mean not so pretty recent occurrence and it's unlikely to last for any great length of time, I think, but it is peaceful now that the fact that that piece makes it even more difficult for us to either to understand ourselves or to be sufficiently motivated to understand yourself because when things are going really well and everything's predictable, then you presume that you know what you're doing. In fact, that's the basis on which you, you base your judgments about whether you know what you're doing, if you perform a procedure and what you predicted, oh, occurs. You're right. Now that doesn't mean you know everything, but as far as you're concerned, that's sufficient.

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       So anyways, the fundamental point is this.

Speaker 2:          00:40:12       We share a map of the significance of things and situations including other people, including ourselves and not maps or culture. And one of the lines of arguments that I want to develop throughout the course of this course is that that shared culture takes the form of a story. In fact, that's what his story is. A story is a description of the significance of situations or events for behavior and the stories. The kind of inflammation story is a form of information that transmits abstract knowledge about how to add. So you have on the one hand, scientific descriptions are the descriptions of facts, things that are sensory apprehensible to a collected and you had another form of information that's narrative and a narrative contains information, but how you should conduct yourself literally how you should propel your body through space under which circumstances and the shared narrative post due to culture.

Speaker 1:          00:41:11       Yeah. Let me show you,

Speaker 2:          00:41:19       but I think the basic structure of a story,

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:41:25       Scientific description is concerned with what is, can we do? We have rules for determining a story is concerned with what is known from the

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       perspective of the census. But from the perspective of the implications for behave. So that's the main essential things have an existence. They have a meaning and the story is concerned with the meaning and meaning is a description of the current state description of the ideal future state and the description of means of transformation.

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       You run a fantasy of the sort of three so you have a plan, a plan, it's relevant to something you termination of action. You just want to go down to the corner store, get a loaf of bread. You can see above yourself here as lacking something necessary, apprehended in the abstract and an ideal goal, which is your trip down to the store and you also formulating plans of how to get there and you, you, you valuate oh occurrences on the way to this store in relationship to two year idealized future. Just to say that anything that gets in your way basically on the way to this store, if you're in a hurry for example, that's regarded as an inconvenience. Anything that hurries you along? Yes, regarded it as something positive. Just basically to say that you use your apprehension of the ideal future, which is always construed in relationship to your present conditions as the Schema by which you determine the significance of things. Because you're always construing the meaning of things in relationship to what you want to do in relationship to this function. And this basically constitutes the whole, the whole story in a sense, at least the simple version of it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       Okay. Let me just stop there for a second. Ask people questions. And then next thing I want to do is give you a really brief overview of how your brain determines how things should be evaluated in terms of their emotional relevance. Okay? Does anybody have any questions so far on the other, the quality, you put up a, what is the, the ring then the Naccho though. The, the gang run, right? Is that, that the bring the neck of the right or wring the neck of the people that are under the, uh, under the federation. It was the cup like that, that poem was it. It's by a poet, I think his name was [inaudible] sst of eliminating descent. So like there's this, you could think the Soviet Union, for example, ran on a number of five year plans,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       five year plans where we're going to, we are here, we're going to get to here. Here are the means by which that's going to be done. Then anybody who was viewed as deviated from that plan, of course, was instantly regarded as a threat and my costs in the same luck, those are the gang run, right? And fundamentally anybody who doesn't agree with the forward portion of the current society instantly regarded well. They're instantly regardless, fundamentally hasn't it normally, but more pragmatically as a threat. And my costco was making the point that those people, they should be eliminated. They deserve to be eliminated, which is even, you know, even a further step in a sense, they constitute the class of things that deserves to be annihilated because it's construed in relationship to some ideal. At the same. You might be wondering, why the hell was this a story? What does this have to do with the story? While I can give you the most, the most fundamental example of the census. I want to tell you what stories are and then I want to take a look at their substructure.

Speaker 3:          00:45:32       Well,

Speaker 2:          00:45:33       the fact that there's a substructure to stories as evidence in the number of subtle ways, it's part of the epidemic because myths that have been collected throughout the world have a remarkably similar nature. That's one, one bit of information that's relatively curious. It's also very strange, but the people like stories. Children will listen to stories and come to any external reinforcement. They're intrinsically rewarding. People Watch tv all the time because TV is full of stories. We pay to go see movies more by normals, but something about stories that are intrinsically attractive to the point that will actually work to be allowed to becoming, to be in contact with them, which should beg the question. Since we're willing to go to all that trouble, to, to look at stories and to receive them, perhaps they're actually serving some function. It seemed at least at least reasonable in the function. There's certainly story. Good story is what regulates your emotions. And if you share a story with someone else, then you can predict them and both your emotions are making a group of you share the store, then you have the culture and you're all more or less predictable to one another. It's a very useful because then you can be organized and you could move forward in one direction and so on. But most of your predictable tomorrow say

Speaker 2:          00:46:52       shoe to make the story aspect of this more comprehensible. You might think of this as political utopia. That's one way of doing it or as a vision of paradise. And then that's the archetypical aspect of underlies the notion that the future could in fact be better than the present. Even in trivial waste. We're doing this all the time. We're always moving from a state that we can see them as not entirely ideal towards a state, that we can see them even in the smallest ways as somehow better than where we work. And that's the sort of thing in fact, gives us the impetus to move forward in the, in a literal sense. But underlying that is the notion way under so to speak is the notion that the world as it is presently constructed is somehow we needed redemption and there is a state hypothetical state that exists somewhere in the future, so to speak, or somewhere at least towards which the world could move in all religious stories, all religious systems share that sort of notion of clinical that you told use as well.

Speaker 2:          00:47:49       I mean it's really evident in the case of something like, Connie, this is call me. This was always trying to establish the Kingdom of God on earth, so to speak. Although of course without theoretically without the religious overtones, it of course we've just made implicit instead of instead of being allowed to be, to be explicit because Stellan was as close to a god and a pretty miserable one is any religion hasn't managed to construct. This isn't a simple story. Basically stories have a slightly more complicated structure than this, which we'll discuss later. How would you distinguish or how do you distinguish between the strategy and the story? This would be a strategy in here. A strategy is just, that's a good question. This is actually, this is somewhat simpler then the real structure because in a sense each of these strategies is this whole structure in a smaller sense. So you could say this structure is composed of smaller units like this all the way down and I don't know how far down I'm being able to figure that out, but like because every goal can be conceptualized as viewed of sub goals that have the same notion for for the purposes of the present discussion.

Speaker 2:          00:49:01       This is a sufficient sufficient representation, but that's something will that specific issue we'll talk about more in the latter part of the latter part of the course because the fact that a story is made up of sub stories right down to the lowest level of resolution has implications for all for certain forms of mythological representations, representations of trees actually knowing and want to get into that at the moment. So anyways, that's the story you said. I put up there the domain and constituent elements of the known what you pay for, kind of, I don't want a title for our diagram like this, but I would say that from the perspective of the regulation of emotion, a story about where you are and where you'd like to get to and how are you going to do that? That is what you know, just remember, we're not in the domain of facts here construed from the scientific perspective. We're in the domain of wisdom, behavioral knowledge and what you know is where you are, where you want to be, and theoretically how to get there.

Speaker 1:          00:50:01       So I'll explain this in some more detail later. Yeah. Oh sure. I'm, yeah. Okay. So I said the first thing we're going to do,

Speaker 2:          00:50:24       it's described in some detail how the brain works and I want to do that because I want to give you some insight into how it is that we processed the multiple information and you need to know, and we think in stories before you can actually understand how it is that we processing emotional information. So I'm going to put up a somewhat complicated diagram. Your number basically that it will take three weeks to discuss this case briefing, but here's, here's the ideal. It's not as complicated as it looks. Okay? At the top, well this is a circle but and you can start anywhere in a circle, but we'll start at the top is how you process information. Obviously the bottom line is if you have a certain road, Spencer, again,

Speaker 3:          00:51:11       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:51:16       That seems where you input is interpreted with regards to a significance as a consequence of its interaction with what you already know, which is basically to say that your presence, which is which constitutes the sensory information you ready for you to Tim pinching on you at this moment is not a vertical picture of the external world, but your interpretation of reality as it's unfolding. And I'm not saying I'm not trying to make a point that there no such thing as an external reality or that you living in a delusion or any of those things, just that you're always interpreting what's going on in relationship to its significance to you and you have models, some models. Then you're doing that. You have theories about what someone's like, what you're like and what the situation consists of, what you should be doing next. If all of the input did you have with prostitutes, your online experience is a function of your interpretation. It's based on actual information, but it's still a function of interpretations. Okay, let's, we'll use your declarative memory. That's one form of memory storage to construct your version of the present. That's the significance of things as they're unfolding at the present time, and you can only really, you can only really make judgments about the significance of things by contrast with what you would like to happen. That's your image of them. Have the desired future. Okay? If you're, if you're doing something this evening, it's a very simple,

Speaker 2:          00:52:45       well, let me give you an example. There are experiments where people's task is to pick up an object and you could see the object in front of them. Okay, so you're giving the tasks. That's the basic story. The story is what you're required to do is to transform yourself from the person you are now into the person who has possession of the watch. It's just the standard laboratory experiment, but the watch is actually there. It's an image that's generated by mirrors and when you move towards the watch, you find that it's not where it appears to be. Well, the fact of object not being where it appears to be is an anomaly with regards to your current plan and you'll react to that emotional. The first thing that'll happen is that obviously you're going to be surprised, right? You think this is pretty easy. I'm going to pick that up and you find out that the thing that you see is no, it actually there. That's an anomaly you contrast and your desired future, which was your aim when you moved your arm with the actual outcome of your actions.

Speaker 2:          00:53:55       That's a mismatch. So part of your brain called the hippocampus that seems to be responsible for comparing what's actually going on in so far as you can interpret that with what you want to happen and if, if a mismatch occurs, that sets up a whole sequence of related events and those events manifest themselves in emotion and in thought and in behavior most evidently and emotion. If you're going to do something, you've done it before and it doesn't work out the way you expected it to. The events that constitute the anomaly, the unexpected occurrence there are surprising. And the question then is what does surprising me? Well, it basically means that something threatening as occurred and something, something that moon is taking place. And what does the unknown mean? Well, the thing about the unknown is that you don't know what it means. It's pretty, it's a pretty straightforward statement, but you see that immediately.

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       That immediately introduces this strange sort of paradox because you lacked infinite information. Obviously people don't know what they're doing all the time, which means that you come into contact with things that you'd want to understand the law. And that means in the sense that you have to know what to do when you don't know what to do because you don't know what to do a lot and that just doesn't just bring into a hall. What is the case that your nervous system is hardwired to move to a sort of default position when the plans that the explicit plan is that you have, that you're carrying out fail. So as long as you could say in a sense, as long as you know what you're doing, which means that you have a representation of where you are and where you'd like to be, you're carrying out your plans to make the move and things are going according to plan.

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       As long as you're doing that, then the higher centers in your, of your brain and the cortex basically it's under control. You know what you're doing. If you feel comfortable and secure as soon as something unexpected happens, the control shifts and this is something that basically beyond your capacity to control, well you can interfere with the process control shifts from the cortical centers to the more fundamental areas of the brain. To the limbic system. When something unexpected happens, two things, Bowker, you stop, you'll feel a little bit of anxiety and it's not unexpected you occurrences, it's really unexpected. You will be very, very frightened because just minor something, minor league, unexpected. He'll just stop. Your sensory processing will heighten, you'll gather more information and you'll explore and as you explore the generate information and the information is supposed to bring me back on course basically.

Speaker 2:          00:56:32       So you'll say what you'll do if you're trying to reach for the watch and you can find out that it isn't where you taking this call, you'll start making different sorts of approach sequences until you end up producing. Now tell me that you intended when something unexpected occurs, two sets of circuitry, you're activated. One looks like it's dominated by the right hand to secure the other. It looks like it's dominated by the left hemisphere. Unexpected things make you anxious and curious and you've been localize those emotions in the body, so to speak. Anxiety is the emotion that a company is the cessation of your body's plan directed activities. Okay? That's you could say that anxiety is what you feel when you slipped into the motive. Pause, pause for further analysis. What do you expect it to do? Give you a copy so you have to stop.

Speaker 2:          00:57:24       Curiosity is what you feel when it's necessary for you to explore further, to gather new information, to update your plans and exploration is basically governed by the interplay of the circuitry brain circuitry that mediates anxiety and curiosity. Curiosity, by the way, now it's associated with positive emotions and anxiety. As you all know. Those associated with to negative people shooting people would rather do I experience it. Curiosity of course. Surprise is basically a juxtaposition of those two sets of emotions which work antagonistically. The unknown produces coin flipped all by itself. That's thick. It's in a sense, it's kind of early to introduce this, but that's the central theme in a way of the whole course is that you have a hard wired response to the emergence of the unexpected. You have to because they have to know what to do with something unexpected trip. It's instinct.

Speaker 2:          00:58:16       Your instinct of response to the unknown. Anxiety plus curiosity, which is to say cessation of ongoing motor activity plus a drive to move forward and explore and your exploratory activities. Actually the sum total of the activation of the two sets of circuitry that mediate that response and when you explore, if you explore, if something unexpected happens, you don't have to explore, you can note it and get the hell out of there. It's safe, but you don't get them any new information. It's a good short term strategy. It's not a good long term strategy, but anyways, the point is, is that surprise, it's curiosity and it tells you 40 generate new information, you update your plan, and as soon you can get to her, you want to go. The point is the mismatch between what you expect to happen and what actually happens. That disc inhibits thing side.

Speaker 3:          00:59:06       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:59:12       If mismatch occurs, there's a little sub organ in your brain called the Amygdala and you made, it looks like it's responsible for the addition of emotion to sensory experience. Yeah. Behavioral psychologists have presumed in the past, most psychologists presume particularly behaviors that you learned to be afraid. Newer models of the neuropsychology of volition reversed that precept position and say, no. You know how to be afraid. Anything that you don't expect makes you afraid. That's your default position. What you have to learn is how to be secure. Now, by the time you're an adult, you've learned how to be secure so well under most circumstances, under secure circumstances, you've learned how to be secure so well. Then you don't realize that you're a priority or default position is fear. You're coming, you're so well inculturated, assuming you're successful. That's the true nature of your emotional responses in is in a sense hidden from you, which is precisely as it's supposed to be because the whole purpose of socialization, the whole purpose of learning is in fact to shut off the circuitry that says something of indeterminant significance is occurring now. People do not like it, will not. Certain three is accurate, don't not, not it. That's a fit in the air because people like to explore. You're like novelty in small doses, small controllable doses. It's like food. It's when something truly unexpected occurs that up roots or upsets your plans, that anxiety really becomes disinhibited. People like that less than anything else.

Speaker 2:          01:00:56       Anyways, the Amygdala labels things that are unexpected as simultaneous, that threatening and promised, that basically puts you into an approach. Avoidance conflict. So what does that mean? It means that anything unpredictable is not neutral. Anything unpredictable was frightened that that in and of itself immediately she has a certain amount of life of why is that we're somewhat low to accept people whose behaviors we can't predict it as one of us people who are from a culture that's different from ours for example, who have a story about how things should go that runs differently from ours. Their behavior cannot be predicted with certainty and you, you're, you are instinctively wired so to speak, to label unpredictable behavior as threatened. And I think you can think about this in really concrete terms and you can experience this sort of thing regularly. For example, on a stroll through Harvard Yard in north.

Speaker 2:          01:02:01       Like if you look around you, you're all decked out in symbols. So does that indicate here a particular status? And Gold direct nature in a community such as this, you're all relatively well dressed, you're all relatively, no, no, it's all it's intended. Um, you're all weld grew, you're a tentative and your behavior is very much indistinguishable from one another. They're all participating in the same sort of ritual. And then there's, there's no reason for you to view your neighbor's sitting beside you with any degree of suspicion because you're convinced that you can predict them. But if you take a walk through somewhere like Harvard Square, where there are people who in a sense fallen out of the culture. So there are people there who were mentally ill, some of them are schizophrenia, many other miracle holic or homeless for one reason or another. They're hard on your guilt if nothing else, but they're also unpredictable.

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       And you find that people do standard things in the face of unpredictable. Others, they tend to avoid them, walk around them, or at least to feel very uncomfortable in your presence. And that's because you do not know what to do in the face of someone who's story you cannot easily determine. You don't know what they're like. You don't know if they're going to hurt you. You don't know if they're, um, if they're, if they're dangerous. In some regards, you don't know what your obligations are with regards to them. They're already labeled as part of the unknown, so to speak, and you'll give them a relatively wide berth.

Speaker 3:          01:03:24       Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:03:27       The only message that that's really necessary from this particular slide, you're always contrast what you want to happen with what you think is that they're both more and wherever there's a deviation, wherever what you want to happen isn't going on, then you feel anxiety, curiosity as well here impelled to explore. But anxiety is the thing that comes up first. And the larger, the magnitude of the unexpected occurrence, the greater the amount of anxiety. One of the things we're going to try to determine in the courses, how you can understand how large a disruption a given unexpected event is. Because, you know, minor thing, let's go back to the southern diner for a second. Here's a, here's a way of looking at it. So let's say you're, you know, you're going somewhere, you have three plans to get there and this one doesn't work. So that means it produces an outcome that isn't what you envisioned and this plan doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          01:04:27       It produces a anomalous outcomes as well, but that plan doesn't work well, that's no problem. And he knows are pretty minor league disruptions. All you do is you keep the same vision of yourself and the same vision of the future. You just switched between plants and you're really in trouble if none of your plans work or if someone messes around with your representation of this or this. So you can say for example, you want to get into medical school and you need 30 courses to get into medical school and you should have a's on all of them and you get a b plus on one course. Okay, well you still have all these other courses. That's not such a big deal. It's a minor league disruption that causes you a certain amount of anxiety and produces a certain amount of exploratory behavior. Perhaps might go to the professor and say, why is it that I got this last one?

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       I was expecting a name. Don't you know what that's going to do that by positioning of the ideal future and so on and so forth. That's, that's one sort of disruption. You're a bit anxious, but hey, you have 29 other courses, it's not such a big deal. Now instead write damn cap and You score in the 50th percentile. Well now you're in trouble because you have a vision of yourself. You think this is your version of the unbearable present. You know, a doctor that's a pain in the neck, but you're a potential doctor. You have the intellectual resources at your disposal and the educational background and, and, and the familial, uh, push perhaps to make you into a doctor. And so that's what you've conceived yourself as. That's your story about yourself cause you're the, this person with this set number of potentials. And you also have the visual of where it is that you're going, oh, am cat score comes back and you're in the 15th percentile.

Speaker 2:          01:06:10       Well your, your ideal future is gone. That's a big problem because that means that all of the events that have surrounded you and surround you now and as far back as you can remember that were given determinant significance by this particular plan have all been cast into chaos. Everything that you've done up to that point has been predicated on the notion that this is where you were going and that means that the significance that you attributed to everything was attributed to everything in relationship to that goal. You blow out the goal and all those significance or backup in the air. We have to modify your version of yourself. Why the hell are you going to do now they going to be a doctor, but a lot of work into this. Plus it's your whole self conception. Well, this is gone. This is gone. I mean this is irrelevant, right? I mean the other 29 courses, why the hell are you even here now?

Speaker 2:          01:07:06       That's one example of the levels at which anomalies can incur minor league anomalies. No problem. You just scoot around them and you go to the same place, major league anomalies. It's a new ideal future. That's part of the reason that people are so prone to ideological conflicts. It's like this is an ideology. You could say it has a particular version of the way things are. Knowing a little bit communist ideology is pretty, it's pretty explicit. What's the unbearable present, so to speak? Well, I know this is a bit dated, but we're running out of the hardline etiologies to co fund, so I have to use an old one. But um, the unbearable present is the class struggle and we have reasons for that. It's basically the fault of the rich who are exploiting the poor. The ideal future is the point at which those unfair divisions of capital are eliminated them.

Speaker 2:          01:07:56       There's a whole bunch of means to that end. That's, that's an ideology. Well, someone else has a different ideology, different version of the significance of current events, a different version of the significance and the nature of the ideal future and they completely different apprehension of how to transform one or the other. When those two cultures come into contact, we'll how, first of all, they made each other anxious because they're not convinced. They don't have to answer and goals. And if this is the structure that regulates emotion, well what's going to happen? Why don't you can't just give up your damn plans because then your emotions are dysregulated. You fall into chaos, so to speak. You don't know where you are and you don't know who you are. You don't know what to do and you don't know where you're going. That makes you anxious. Neither side is going to give up.

Speaker 2:          01:08:39       Give up their certainty. Well, the only thing left and under what circumstances is conflict and you see this, I mean look how do, how do arguments escalate and argue? Argument with someone that you love. Even if they want one thing, you want another, you discuss it. You're not getting anywhere you're tempers raise because the abstract discussion isn't helping find that you'd give up. Maybe you move to to violence to solve your problem, to hammer out the story, so to speak. You can do that, but still oppressing the person who has the different, a different import.

Speaker 2:          01:09:15       So your brain is set up to contrast a vision of what you would like with a vision of what's occurring and when something unexpected occurs and there's a whole sequence that emotional processes that are disinhibited, the May deal with the governors governs. Then by all appearances. It's an extraordinarily ancient Oregon works in concert with the hippocampus. They hit the campus by the way evolved in the course of five. The genesis basically what amphibians left the ocean. So we had this circuitry has been around a long time, a lot longer than your higher cortical centers. It's very sophisticated and it's very powerful and I think you could say that we spend our whole lives trying to make sure that the Amygdala is shut off so we don't like it when it's on. I mean, maybe you can, that's again, that's not exactly true because I think a tiny bit of activation under controlled circumstances, that's optimal, but there's a threshold and if, and if differs to some degree from person to person, if you exceed that threshold, there's nothing that you dislike more cause the [inaudible] to the thing that says everything that you are is in danger.

Speaker 2:          01:10:22       We'd like to keep it shut off. Most of the time it shut off as long as we associate with people who are predictable to us, as long as we know where we're going and things that we predict our own current, it shuts up and the cortical centers are in control and you know, we go down the path that we've chosen.

Speaker 3:          01:10:39       Okay. Now the other thing I'm interested in is

Speaker 2:          01:11:15       good. Say It as far as your brain's concerned.

Speaker 3:          01:11:19       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:20       Let me step one step back. What's the emotion? Emotion is the subjective sensation that you feel when you encounter a situation that has implications for action. So emotion occupies the space between sensory input and motor. So if you encounter something that has significance, you feel an emotion and an emotion is the subjective sense that it companies the activation or the preoccupation of motor output systems. That's basically how it occurred. How it appears. Say Well,

Speaker 3:          01:11:55       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:11:57       you can think of the world the way that we normally think of it as something that exists objectively have something that's amenable to scientific description or you can also think of it as a place that's full of things that have implications for rashes. Now as far as stories are concerned, the university is a place that's full of things that have implications for action. That's the environment from the narrative perspective. The most fundamental substructure of narratives can be phoning myths and the next thing I want to show you is how miss fundamentally represent the world in so far as it's conceived of it as something that has implication for behavior, something with emotional significance. So you decided the world of the scientific object, so to speak, is devoid of emotional significance really by design. Part of what you do in the scientific procedure is eradicate anything that's purely subjective, like emotion.

Speaker 2:          01:12:55       If you think a theory is true because you liked the theory that snoring sufficient grounds for considering a true from the scientific perspective, you're supposed to make yourself on objective, which basically means to eradicate your emotional assessment of the, of, of a given situation. But the thing is we're always assessing situations for their athletic. That significance. We have to do that because emotion around affect needs how to act, and you always have to figure out how to act in every situation, so it's reasonable to construe the world. That's something that has meaning as a place where that meaning exists. This is how the world is conceived of from the mythological perspective.

Speaker 3:          01:13:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:13:42       It's quite straight forward. I'm not going to talk much about this.

Speaker 2:          01:13:49       Mythological representation of chaos is just the attempt to represent the place that everything comes from before there's any divisions between any, I didn't want to get into that right now from the mythological perspective. This is, this is how the world, this is a creation myth. Basically you're Rachel things into two components, one of which is the unknown and the other, which is the known. Now the no one has this structure. It's a story is if you know something, you know the story that goes along with which means that if you know, if you know a territory, if you explore the territory, I mean as you know how to act, then that's all. That's all that I'm trying to emphasize here and myth. From the mythological perspective, the world is constructed of three things. One is all those things that you don't know as the domain of that unpredictable and it has a primary motivational significance.

Speaker 2:          01:14:49       It's basically, it means that Oh, first dawn attack, it scares the hell out of you and then it makes you curious. If you stick around long enough. First face it reveals is the one that makes you anxious. That's unexplored territory. That's the the dark forest, barbarian lands, dark water, the land of the dead tie math as well. [inaudible] the dragon from Mesopotamian creation myth from which everything comes. Basically anything frankly, anything threatening, anything that makes you run away, anything that's in the dark, anything that's unfamiliar, I don't know what constitutes the unknown from the mythological perspective, that's half the world. It's a division between chaos and order. Basically from the mythological perspective, that's what the universe is composed of. Chaos is divided for mortar and that's the world you live in order. Hopefully chaos surrounds you like a, like in the ocean surrounds an island. Fundamentally. That's what this diagram is basically trying to represent the known a great father. That's culture, the village, the nation explored territory, the city, the family, the king, the predictable. That's where you live. That's where everything is being transformed from chaos into order where everything can be predicted and it sits on top of the unknown.

Speaker 2:          01:16:16       Psychoanalytic interpretations of the rationale for social conflict, often positive that what you see in people who you are willing to persecute his, your own dark side. Those things above you that you're most unwilling to admit. I think there's a certain amount of truth in that, but what's more accurate and more fundamental and much less difficult to understand in a sense is that if someone is not familiar to you, you don't have to presume anything about the mere fact of their existence as something unfamiliar. It's already sufficient to give them a certain emotional valence and that emotional valence, at least on initial contact is the promotion of anxiety.

Speaker 3:          01:17:08       Don't. You don't

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       have to think in some ways about the necessity of projection or your unreal are you're, you're, you're only incomprehensibility to yourself or your propensity did until we see the evil and others is the mere fact of unpredictabilities enough to render someone associated with this domain that makes the thing I said we classify things in two different plays in a sense what caused to buy things from the scientific perspective, but we also classify them from the perspective of their significance for action and you could say that a natural category is the class of all things that you should run away from and from the perspective of that sort of classification, everything that is the sort of thing that you should run away from is the same thing. So that means anytime you, you encounter something that's unpredictable, it's that thing is instantly thrown into the category of all the things that I've ever frightened you, all the things in your life that you haven't been able to control because the idea of the thing that you should run away from is one of the most fundamental types of classification.

Speaker 2:          01:18:15       The ribs just, we're always classifying things in terms of fundamental significance for behavior. I found out for example, I'd thought about that, I guess about six or seven years ago, I was reading missy Elliot. There are many creative, many creation. There's the world comes out of the body of a drag. For example, in the Mesopotamian creation myth, marvel versus timeout. Timeout is a dragon who lives at the bottom of the ocean and she's the mother of all the gods, but they make a lot of noise and irritate your and it also killed her husband. This makes it quite mad, so she decided she's going to eat them all and one of the medicine it can go up to the Martech is elected by. The other goal is to go and fight with time. Map him down. He encloses her in a Gnat and cuts or into pieces.

Speaker 2:          01:19:02       None of the pieces he makes the world. He creates order from chaos. He's the third feature of the mythological world. There's the unknown and there's the no, and there's process that mediates between turns. One backs the hero, the hero. He turns up the dragon and makes the world so he's assimilated to a creator. God. Basically. The reason I'm telling you the story now of always because I found out from Iliad, but many archaic cultures, the Iranians and the Egyptians were three others whose names I don't remember a moment. The symbol that they used for the stranger, the barbarian was the same symbol used to represent the chaos that predated the construction of the world. So you can, this is so interesting. If you'd grab the Chris Grasp the significance of that because it meant that Egyptian, the ancient Egyptians, for example, who never let a foreigner into one of their temples because the foreigner would bring chaos into order.

Speaker 2:          01:19:59       The forerunner was chaos. That's the thing for the Egyptian foreigner was chaos. They use the same symbol. That's how people think that is. We think it's like if you're not from the same tribe, however, that's defined most, most fundamentally, it would be the family, but obviously we've abstracted that up into the nation. We're into an ideological unit or whatever. If you're not us, then you are chaos and all by yourself. Under those circumstances. If you're an agent of chaos, you have emotional significance. Here's something I know I can't predict. I'm afraid of things I can't predict. You're a threat to me. Along the path from that to to oppressing you is not very, very, it's a very short one.

Speaker 2:          01:20:40       Well, one of the things we're going to study to a fair degree is mythological representations of the world hits. I find this extremely interesting and the reason for this is because as soon as you know, as soon as you know that we use stories to regulate our emotions, and as soon as you know that there are two types of information that we need to gather, one be factual information and the other information about how we should behave, then you have the possibility of reading mythological accounts or stories in general from a completely different perspective because you don't have to think anymore. Well, this mythological account, for example, with the creation of the world has no relationship whatsoever to evolutionary theory. We know evolutionary theories more accurate, therefore this whole sequence, but accounts has to be cast into the realm like pseudoscience of superstition. Well then you lose all the information that's in those stories.

Speaker 2:          01:21:32       As soon as you know that those stories aren't concerned in the least with the construction of the objective world, but our concern with the world as it as it has significance women, you have a whole new way of approaching the whole new mode of interpreting them and you can start to understand the nature of the stories that actually underlie our culture and believe me, that's so, that's so useful. Well, it's so useful. You can hardly believe it. Fine. All of a sudden there's all these stories that you've heard since the earliest days. Stories that are basically rationally and comprehensible. As soon as you twist your presuppositions about their origins, just 45 degrees, then you can see the order in the mini exactly what it is that they're trying to turn to put forth and they all of a sudden made sense. Well, I think knowing, just regardless of its implications for Social Poncelet, knowing that getting a key to the meaning of the stories that's worth having to plow your way through all the information that you have to read in this course because you all Italian, you'll go see if they can see movies and read novels and look at myths and we'll think, oh, I know what that means now, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:22:39       Isn't it so interesting? If that's what it means, you can immediately see that relationship between the story and your own and the position that you occupy in the midst of things. It's very fascinating. So we're interested in representation, but right here, I want to read you a bit of a story here.

Speaker 2:          01:23:03       So the unknown is the great, terrible mother. Wow. You know, you're going to have to accept that, my word for that at the moment. But the basic notion is a feminine imagery. 10 is tends to be used to represent the unknown. And the reason for that is because the unknown is the mother of all things. So that's obviously their mystical way of thinking about it. But all I've seen is this, every bit of as far as math is concerned, information is the world. That's the note. All the information that you generate, you generate in contact as a consequence of your contact with something you didn't understand, which is only to say that you generate information by exploring. It's not hurting. That's obvious then it's not much of a step from there to the construing the thing that you're investigating, which is the unknown as the source of everything.

Speaker 2:          01:23:53       Perfectly reasonable presupposition and it's not such a difficult leap to make, to construe the source of everything as something feminine thing, something that gives birth to things anyways. It doesn't matter if you follow that train of logic or north or if you accept that that isn't the case and that is how miss tend to represent them. No. So uh, one of the books that you're going to read is called the great mother and that's how work by your new one and it is. It's 300 pages of description of mythological representations of the feminine. Anyways, that's the mythological aspect. I want to read you a good story about rats because I want to show you how deeply grown with these sorts of notions are. I want to tell you a little story first before I read this, I was watching a bugs bunny cartoon the other day with my kids.

Speaker 2:          01:24:39       And um, you're probably more or less familiar with the bugs bunny cartoon characters. There's a sheep dog and a wolf and they go to work in the morning and sheepdogs job is to guard the sheep and the wolves job is to eat them and they punch the time, clock in and then they go into their respective roles. Anyways, the sheep dog is always beating, whoa, flop baggy and he gets the real rough end of the stick. Now there's one scene there, cause she'd be August, sitting on a cliff watching the sheep and it's raining and the wolf gets a bright idea, is going to put hair tonic on the sheet goes, hey, okay. And it's raining so that the sheep dog, well not as sweet, sneaks up and the sheep Harriton and hair grows down over his eyes right now. So the sheep dog sitting here and they're wolf climbs up the cliff and the first thing he does is he has a hand, the glove on the stick.

Speaker 2:          01:25:28       So he's hiding behind the cliff and it puts the hand on his dick and he raised it in front of the sheep dog space. No one response. Now that wolf is exploring unexplored territory and it does. It cautiously sticks a stick on it. Nothing happens. And so then the next thing it has is just pokes his head up and goes right down and it looks nothing terrible happens. And then it climbs up on top of the cliff and it weighs this hand in hand. The sheep, you are you starting to smile now? I thinks it's pretty smart now it's jumping up and down. Okay, so it's explored the territory. It's mapped it originally the unexplored territory was anxiety provoking the wolf on your way to a whole sequence of exploratory activities. Map The territory. It's safe. So then it's off to steal a sheep. Okay, that's funny.

Speaker 2:          01:26:11       That was funny because animators are great at picking out what we do and exaggerating them. So they're comical. That's exploring unknown territory. Okay. Most of the time when behavioral psychologist teach a rat to be afraid and that's what they think they're doing, they take a route that's secure. So they presumed that the natural state of the rat is secure. But the only bloody reason the rats secure is because it's already explored his cage. So you put a rat in a cage and they will freeze because it's scared. And then if nothing terrible happens soon it unfreezes and then it slowly starts to explore it. It might just move his eyes first and sniff and then if not in terrible happens and starts to move and as soon and checks out the whole cage. And if nothing is in there that it's going to kill it, it has a nap or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:26:52       Maybe it looks for some food, but it asked to explore before it's secure. Now more modern animal psychologist need fallen, just sort of starting to study the reactions of things like rats in their natural habitat. And that's what this story is about. So take a rabbit, wraps their social, set them up in a Burl, and they let them set up. There were only map out their territory by exploring. So they have this whole burl system set up and the rats, no, it, nothing's dangerous there, that's home, but a caffeine, one section of it. That's the story. When a cat is presented to an established mixed sex group of laboratory rats living in visible girl, the behaviors of the subjects changed dramatically in many cases for 24 hours or more. The initial act of defensive behavior flight to the tunnel chamber system. So the rats are cruising alone where they think it's safe and there's a cat.

Speaker 2:          01:27:42       Well, it's like home into the borough is followed by a period of immobility during which the rats make 22 kilohertz, ultrasonic vocalization, which apparently served as lawyer cries that I rate. So there to put it, uh, they're freaked out and they brought it home and screen the frozen and they screen like they must be screaming something like, oh no, there's a cat and all the other grads here this, and they're all in their girls. They're terrifying. They're frozen into your mobility by the appearance of this unexpected thing as freezing breaks up. It's interesting. Think of a good myth. This persons in the Gorgon show, the face of the Gorgon was this female head. This covered the snakes. That's a new image of the unknown. That thing turns you to stone anyways, as freezing breaks up. Proxemic avoidance of the open area, gravity diddly gives way to a pattern of risk assessment of the area where the cat was encountered.

Speaker 2:          01:28:35       Okay, so the rats are frozen and they think you know, oh no, death is around the corner. They don't precisely think that, but that's how they act and if nothing happens, it's also terrible. Well, they start to relax a little bit and as soon as they start to relax the circuit, you're like, they're very curious about this unexpected occurrence, but they're overwhelmed by anxiety. They don't do any exploring. They run back and make sure that nothing terrible happens. Just like that movie she could dog may run back and how's their anxiety? Receipts. Okay. Curiosity starts to predominate. So they go back to the open area subject to poke their heads out of the tunnel, openings to scan the open area where the cat was presented for minutes or hours before emerging. So they're like watching this is new territory now. There was not supposed to be a cap there. So let's just see what happens. So they're watching in Washington remapping the territory when they do emerge there locomotory patents or characterize while they couldn't have run flat so they can't be seen. But the thing that's really neat is they do short corner runs. I think this is so interesting. So you think here's the area the calf was seen. Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:29:37       so it's like cat

Speaker 2:          01:29:43       right now, the rats on the cat there. So this is, this is all of a sudden being reading novelized. This area was once map and made secure. But the appearance of the cap there is throwing their plans for a loop. So one of the routes do, well the catch disappeared, but they don't trust this area anymore because it was associated with the cat. So they do corner rugs. The bravest of rats leaps out of his title. And Bratton was right across a small area and if if he doesn't get killed,

Speaker 3:          01:30:12       that's safe,

Speaker 2:          01:30:13       so then it grows back. It takes not choke up safe. Other rats are in the same place soon if there's no cat. Hilarious mapped. Again,

Speaker 2:          01:30:27       these risk assessment areas appear to involve active gathering information about possible dangerous sources providing a basis for a gradual return to non defensive bt active risk assessment has not seen during early post cat exposure but rises to a peak about 10 hours later. These rats are scared. Non Defensive behaviors such as eating, drinking sexually aggressive activity tend to be reduced over the same period. That's because of the anxiety system just predominance. You don't think about anything else when there's a cab around, so it's such a great, it's such a great story because you get an idea of how their Massey University is set up like there was known territory and then there's on unknown territory and well known and known territory can turn into unknown territory as soon as something unpredictable happens and when something unpredictable happens. That hilarious is made novel again and the rats have to undergo is very complex pattern of exploratory activity to make their territory secure again. So that's, that's quite interesting. It was also the case. Yeah. Like I gave you here a representation of novelty. That's what normal people, it's half threat to me produces anxiety, taft promise and impels exploratory activity. Anxiety comes up first. This has be known among behavioral psychologists for about five decades. It's like the exploratory and anxiety circuitry are mutually inhibitory, but the anxiety circuitry has the upper edge in terms of potency and rapidity of rise and fundamental

Speaker 3:          01:31:56       so long. Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       so let me show you something. Well, it's also the case. So racks, they identify each other by smell, and if you smell like you should smell, then you're familiar. You're not contaminated with the unknown. So your behavior is predictable, which basically means that I know your place in the dominance hierarchy. I know what role you play with all the other animals, and I know how to behave in your presence. You're familiar. You're Ken. And I can tell that if I'm a rat bite of the way that you spell, okay, so you take a rat that everyone loves and you pull it out of its cage and you wash it off and you throw it back in with the rats would kill it because that rat is now contaminated with the unknown and we don't like to have the unknown around because it upsets our predictability and whatever. Predictability gets upset that our anxiety levels rise and all hell breaks loose and literally all hell breaks loose. That's actually pam is a mythological representations of the unknown. These fats in part,

Speaker 3:          01:33:04       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:33:06       from the mythological perspective of the world has three constituent elements, the unknown, which is everywhere, the known and the process by which one has turned into the other, which is basically exploration. So the knower is the archetypical archetipal pattern of expiration. The thing that mediates between the unknown and the known and from the mythological perspective part of the process creates the world. See that's the, that's absolutely fascinating too if you think about it from him because he can think about something like the fact of say, a our democratic system now, our democratic system is deeply rooted in religious presuppositions bidding, which we forget now, but it doesn't really matter. They're still there. They're implicit. They're there. Now, one of the implicit presumptions is that every individual in our society is worthy of respect. That's the core aspect of your natural, right? Fundamentally, even if you're a criminal, like even if you've broken rules that you admit you broken in this society and others that have the same preset positions, you, you still have a whole sequence of rights that cannot be violated because in principle there's something about you that's worthy of respect regardless of your behavior.

Speaker 2:          01:34:16       The question is what is, what is that? Well, I think even see this in simpler social animals like wolves.

Speaker 3:          01:34:23       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:34:25       Oops. Well, they live in social groups. They have dominance. Hierarchies and wolves are always trying to climb up the dominance hierarchy, which is good for the wolf pack, cause the strongest animal, more or less, the most competent animal. It shouldn't be at the top, but anyways, if one will fight with another wolf and they very seldom injure each other if they're in the same group, which is good because you don't want the group diminished by constant intergroup intergroup conflict. Well, the talk wolf, the wolf who wins the conflict, which is usually more of threat posturing than actual physical engagement, although sometimes a real fight breaks out if wolf that loses the dominance dispute benefits submissive behaviors, which basically means it rolls over and shows its throat, which means you can kill me now if you want to talk, we'll stops and you can say, well, the stronger wolf packs as if it's constrained by knowledge that even the weaker members of the group still can conceivably contribute something of value to the group.

Speaker 2:          01:35:20       Well, that's what we're like to in our organizations except we've got, we've got that principal up almost to the point where we understand that it's the individual who in contact with the unknown generates inflammation and that inflammation constitutes the group and the individual is valuable because they are in fact assimilated to the mythological perspective, to the force that creates the world, which is basically the forest that renders the unknown, predictable or that creates order out of chaos and say the aspect of people that's divine theoretically is the part that stands on the border between the unknown and the known and the most information from unexplored territory in two explored territory. Expanding the dog to the dominion of the group. That's okay. Who's this? I says Kelly, the devour. She's a negative mother, so to speak, from a mythological perspective and I find very, very interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:36:15       She's the best representation of this sort of thing that I've ever seen. If the myth that you think maths, they last a long time, sometimes tens of thousands of years and they, they often even last across cultures and you think, who are they? How is it? What could the story actually be telling you that could be useful given that much change? Well, the mythological world that stories are concerned with is composed of three things. The unknown, but it's always there. It doesn't matter when you live or where you live or who you are, that's part of your experience. It's always going to be part of your experience. It doesn't matter how much you know, there's always things that you can predict. The more you know what the more potential problems there are, because knowledge in itself even breeds new problems. That's always there. The fact of culture is always there.

Speaker 2:          01:37:03       I mean the cultures may change, but the fact that there's culture and that you're a product of culture and that you have to add to it or at least establish some relationship to it, that it protects you and creates you and that you contribute to it and that never changes. And the fact that you're the intermediary between those two forces, that never changes. And that's what describes those three things. This is a representation of the unknown. The unknown is also as well as being the thing that gives rise to everything. It's also the thing that destroys. Everything gets on the things that we cannot control it in the final analysis lead to our demise. It's our ignorance that causes our death in a sense. We just can't stop something. He can't stop aging disease. We can't stop starvation. There's are all things that we haven't got a grip on there. All things that are still unknown, unpredictable, and sooner or later they get us.

Speaker 2:          01:37:55       Let's look at Kelly. Well, the first thing I'd like to say, like I said, the unknown automatically frightened to us or other things that automatically frightened us more or less. There's some dispute about this and the behavioral insurance. There are things that you can learn to become afraid of very easily. Spiders, snakes, fire alarm skeletons, disembodied bodies. Those are all elements of horror movies. It's pretty obvious that people are more and less afraid of them. It's not that difficult to figure out why. The only debate in them in the, in the psychological literature is whether those fears are actually nate or whether you have to acquire them through very brief exposure. It doesn't matter as far as I'm concerned. The point is is that those things might be regarded as extraordinarily appropriate. Representatives of the unknown. What's myth trying to do? It's trying to encapsulate behavioral wisdom under what circumstances and what world?

Speaker 2:          01:38:48       Well, the answer to that is in the world that's composed of the unknown, the known and the mediating force say if you have to adapt to the unknown, which you have to do. The thing to do logically say you'd have an infinite amount of time at your disposal is to come up with a representation of what the unknown is a strange thing to do because you don't know what it is. So the question is how the hell can you represent it? But the one thing you do know about it, it's always the case is that it makes you afraid and it makes you curious. So if you want to make a representation of it, then you use those things that you do know. Something about that either make you afraid or curious and let's look at this figure figure to who, whom at some point in history and not so long ago, human sacrifices pro actually offered it.

Speaker 2:          01:39:30       We're on, we're going to look a little bit at the reasons for that. This is Kelly. She is the thing that everything goes back to she's a representative of the unknown. Well, let's look at her now. She's something that produces religious devotion in those who apprehend her presence. Seizure of meaning fundamentally, which you could assimilate to and religious experience. She has eight legs like a spider. She spins the web of faith. That's the reason the web has made a fire. Her hair's on fire too by the way. She sits in the middle of that way. She has a head dress of skulls and usually has a snake around her waist. A snake's a symbol of transformation because it sheds its skin, so theoretically did something that's reborn anyways. Um, she often has staring eyes protruding teeth to something else that people are pretty much in a predisposed to respond to and she is so in her hands are tools of creation and destruction and she's simultaneously giving birth to this gentleman and eating here. That symbol that, and I would say, well, okay, now you understand two things. You understand that you have an innate response for the unknown and the next APP, permanent constituent elements of experience from the perspective of emotion.

Speaker 2:          01:40:58       And if you look at figure like that, then you can get some comprehension of what it is that people are trying to avoid contacting the attempt to maintain things predictable.

Speaker 2:          01:41:23       Well, I'm just going to close this, I guess. Um, this is a hint about the second part of the course. So the first part of the car, while it's going to, there's one, there's a lot more detail to the story than I brand across today and there's some complicating factors that make the whole story much more interesting. I mean, this is interesting already. I think this is the most, this is, has something to do with hope. When let's say you're a natively predisposed to respond to the unpredictable with anxiety and perhaps to eliminate it. If you care, you can understand why that is, but you need to be able to predict your circumstances. You have to be able, you kind of just give up your story or your culture because that throws you completely emptied chaos and that's unpleasant because unpleasant does anything you could imagine

Speaker 2:          01:42:11       what other people believe different things and obviously when you come into contact with him, while there's a high likelihood of depression and aggression of such magnitude that there's a good probability that you'll be destroyed and some of the person that you're aggressing against that just really striking as you know, all that greatest solution. On the one hand you give up your ideas for, then you are subject to half active dysregulation of the most intolerable. Sorry. On the other hand, if you pursue your particular ideas in the face of opposition, then you might run into a circumstance where aggression is inevitable and that'd be the end of the year. This is a bad sort of paradox. Oh, so what can be done about that? Well that has, I guess you could say, to give you the answer in the tiniest sort of the shelves and has something to do with your attitude towards anomalous information, have the highest likelihood of not falling into this sort of trap. If when something unexpected happens to you register and you explore it to see why it was that you were wrong, to accept the fact of the anomalous information and to explore it.

Speaker 2:          01:43:13       This is a nice figure and I'll close with a discussion with just a brief discussion of this. That's a bonus. Sound Fun. It's an eastern image. Then I suppose you could assimilate to some degree to Christ in the West. It's an image of the hero and the hero is the intermediary between the known and the unknown. Tierra. Listen, first one goes out where it's frightening. See this little dragon stories should have mentioned that dragon dragons, they live in the bottom of the mountain and they sit on a treasure and if he want to treasure you, go out of your community is threatened by the Dragon. If you weren't the church you go to and slayer overcome with drag. Bringing back the treasure. When you come back, then your communities transform. The last of the story about explorations is the dragon isn't the thing to simultaneously threatened in the promising as well as archaic and ancient and our full, the hero is the person leaves in the community to encounter that arc in temple phenomena to overcome it, to get the tragedy to bring it back to the community, which is therefore you rich.

Speaker 2:          01:44:17       That's the path of the hero. This, this is a very interesting image. That finger see the attempt by the author to make it recurring ready and this is, this is the sky by the way, and this might be conceived of as a tunnel, but it's a tunnel into time and into space. This is the most, this is the present and this is the past. Does it extends back as far as can possibly be imagined. This finger sits on me or I know, I know it's kind of blurry and that's unfortunate, but let me see here. See these fingers at the bottom. These are figures that are very much like Kelly, same sort of thing. This representation is this figure of triumphing in a sense over this speaker, this swelling by fire as well, and it's a symbol of transformation. This is an attempt to portray the fact that the pattern of behavior that is characteristic of the hero is something that constantly recurs through time.

Speaker 2:          01:45:25       That's an architect from the union perspective, just the fact of exploration and the tendency for us, that's an ending bill, part of the human psyche biologically predicate it. It's part of the, it's part of the apparatus that you inherit, so to speak. It. It's nothing to do with inherited memories or anything, anything, man, I'll just try. It just has to do with the fact that that's the sort of creature you are. You're always, you always serve as the intermediary between unexplored territory, unexplored territory. That's true. No matter where you live. This is a finger then, well that isn't drawing that attempts to represent that idea pictorially. It's very cold. Most religious traditions, perhaps with the exception of course, there's always exceptions are predicated on the notion that identity identity with this figure right in it with this finger is necessarily up the core, proper human adaptation. And without that identification and chaos will necessarily ring.

Speaker 3:          01:46:31       Okay, sure. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46:52       So does everybody have a syllabus? Okay. Does everybody have the directions to the coffee shop for a long time? For a long time, he was the only neuro psychologist that I knew of in North America who's actually interested in some of the ideas that are in your name and your student Id. You're welcome, dawn there. Mark, they're downstairs in my office. I'm going to put the mode. What's the course number? Two four three five no, cause I have a sabbatical next year, so it's, it's not a good idea. You should find someone who was around as long as long as you're convinced that you can. Oh, good. Okay. Do you have any oh, 12 bucks or something? Some very expensive. Okay, thanks. Yup. Mechanisms you might try. Rich might be relevant.
