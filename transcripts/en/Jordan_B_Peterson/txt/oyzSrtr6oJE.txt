Speaker 1:          00:00:20       Well, I'm speaking today with Dr Steven Hicks, who's a professor of philosophy at in the Department of Philosophy at Rockford University in Illinois, and Professor Hicks has written a book that I found several books, but he's written one in particular that I want to talk to him about today called explaining postmodernism skepticism and socialism for Moose, so to food code, which was published fair, why it fair while ago now in 2004, but I think has become even more pertinent and relevant today. And I have talked a lot to my viewers about your book and so let's talk about postmodernism and its relationship with new Marxism. That's an so maybe you could tell our viewers here a little bit more about yourself and how you got interested in this. And

Speaker 2:          00:01:16       finished graduate school in philosophy in the early nineties. I'm originally from Canada, born in Toronto. Uh, at that point a Pittsburgh and Indiana had the two strongest philosophy of science and logic programs. And that's what I was interested in at the time. So on a professor recommendation, I ended up at Indiana and it worked out very nicely for me. So most of my graduate work was actually in epistemology philosophy of science, logic, some cognitive science issues as well. So a lot of the ecosystem, a lot of people and philosophical linguistic issues that come up being postmodernism. Uh, the groundwork was laid for that when I finished Grad school teaching full time, uh, came to rutgers university is teaching an honors program and the way that program worked, it was essentially a great books program. So it was like getting a second education wonderfully. But, uh, the way it was done was a, each course was taught by two professors to our honor students and so the professors would be from different departments, so paired with literature, professors, history professors and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:02:26       And this was now the middle of nineties. I started to hear about to thinkers. I had not read, I kind of heard about them, but now I was reading them more closely and finding that in history, in literature and sociology and pro a names like dairy dog who the others were not omnipresent, were huge names. So I realized I had a, have a gap in my education to fill. So start reading a deeply in them, uh, my education in some ways was a broad in the history of philosophy but narrow at the graduate school level than I focused mostly on annual American philosophy. So my understanding of the continental traditions was quite limited, but by the time I got to the end of the nineties, uh, I realized there was something significant going on coming out of continental philosophy and that's where the book came out.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       When you say significant, do you mean what do you mean by that? You mean intellectually do you mean socially? Politically, there's lots of different variants of significant

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       at that point, intellectually this is still the 1990, so postmodernism was not yet outside of say are a, a cultural wars. But it was strongly an intellectual force in that at that point, a young phds coming out of sociology, a literary criticism, some subdisciplines in the law, you're getting paid, he's in the law, historiography and so on. And certainly in a departments in philosophy still dominated by continental, traditional, provocative, uh, that almost all of them are primarily being schooled in what we now call postmodern thinkers. So the leading gurus are people like a leotard from whom we get the label, postmodern condition, Fuko and, and the others.

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       Maybe you could walk us through what you learn because people are unfamiliar. I mean, you had, you had, you were advanced in your education, including in philosophy and still recognized your ignorance say with regards to postmodern thinking. And so that's obviously a condition that's shared by a very large number of people and postmodernism is one of those words like existentialism that covers an awful lot of territory and sober. Maybe we could zero in on exactly what that means and who these thinkers were, Derrida, Gluco, and who you are and what you learned about them. Okay. Yeah. Fair enough.

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       Well, all of the things you just named, they think broadly, they think strategically and they do have a very strong historical perspective on their disciplines and at the same time they are trying to assess where they think we are culturally, politically, socially, and all of them are making a very, uh, dramatic claim that to some extent or in some way modernism has either ended or it has reached its major right or all of the kind of the pack, apologies and negative traits, uh, within the modern world are reaching a culmination in their generation. And so it's time for us to both recognize that modernism has come to an end, that we need some sort of new intellectual framework. A post modern framework isn't

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       that they're criticizing what, how would you carry that?

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       That's it. That's the enlightenment values. That's scientific rationalism. How would you characterize it? Exactly right. Elements of it. So of course there are some discipline specific differences. So literature, people in philosophy, people and the historians will use modernism slightly differently. But the idea of core is that if you look at the mortem world, essentially the world of the Middle Ages saying that that was a itself broken up by a series of revolutions, the renaissance reformation and counter reformation, early scientific revolutions and all of this is going on in a historic or short chunks of time. 15 hundreds and 16 hundreds. And so if you look at the both the intellectual world and the social world, uh, comparing, say the 14 hundreds with the 17 hundreds culturally and intellectually you're in a different universe actually at that point. So the features then of the, of the modern world.

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       And now I'm going to use my philosophical labels here are that we're now natural listing, right in our thinking that we were no longer primarily supernatural mistake in our thinking. So we might still be open to the idea that there's a god or some sort of supernatural dimension like the way deists are. But first and foremost, we're taking the natural world as a more or less self contained self governing world that operate supporting the cause and effect. And we're going to study it and its terms, but we're not seeing the natural world as a derivative, right? Have a higher world or that everything that happens in the natural world is a part of God's plan. And we read omens and so forth into everything. So metaphysically then where there's been a revolution will naturalistic epistemologically in terms of knowledge. There also has been a revolution, a how do we know the important truths that require the beliefs that were fundamentally going to commit our lives to four by the time we become modern, we, uh, we take experience seriously personal experience.

Speaker 2:          00:08:08       We do that more rigorously and we're developing and scientific method, the way of organizing the data. We're taking logic and all of the sophisticated tools of rationality and developing those increasingly. And so our, our, our opposition then is either you know, something because you can experience it and verify it for yourself or we've done the hard work of scientific method a and as a result of what comes out of that, that's what we can call knowledge or best approximation to that. So revolutionary. Let me just say one more thing because the prior intellectual framework, right, was much more intellectually authoritarian in the framework, right? So you would accept in the Catholic tradition the authority of the church, right, and who are you to question the authority of the church and who are you to mount empirical rational arguments are against the authority of the church, or you take the authority of scripture, right? Or you accept on faith that you've had a mystical revelation of some sort. So in all of those cases you have non rational epistemologies that are dominating intellectual discourse that is all buying logs swept away by the, in the, in the modern world.

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       Okay. So, so prior to the emergence of the modern world, in the same people are dominated essentially by their willingness to adhere to a shared tradition. And now shared tradition is somewhat tyrannical enforced, but there's no real alternative in terms of epistemology, let's say. And then as the modern world emerges, people discovered the technologies of science and the value of rigorously applied method and the comparison of shared experiences. And that makes us technologically, technologically powerful and in a new way and philosophically different from what we were before.

Speaker 2:          00:09:59       Yes, the assured tradition praise that, uh, that you added there, that's an important one. So I would say in the early modern world, there's not necessarily a skepticism about assured traditions of students. So it would be an acceptance of shared conditions. The idea is that you would not uncritically accept your tradition, that you will accept the tradition, but only have two. You've thought it through the major own Independent. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       So you're elevated to the status of someone who's capable of taking a stance with regards to the, to the tradition and assessing. It's pretty sad. So there's an elevation of the individual and the critical intellect alone along with the, with the elaboration of the scientific method. Okay. So then then we might know perhaps that that's a tremendously effective transformation, although maybe it leads in a somewhat nihilistic direction. Metaphysically we can leave that to the side, but it's a very, very successful revolution because by the time, at least the beginning of the 20th century comes along. There's this staggering. And of course, before that, the industrial revolution, there's this staggering transformation of technology and technological and conceptual power and then a stunning increase in the standard of living and that starts at about 1890 to really to move exponentially in the eighties, nineties, or, or at least to get to the really, really steep part of the exit ex exponential curve. Okay. So that seems to be going well. So what is it that the postmodernists are objecting to? Precisely?

Speaker 2:          00:11:29       Well, by the time, just on those two issues, um, the metaphysical naturalism and then the, uh, the elevation of critical empiricists and a belief that we can through science and, uh, even not necessarily a science, the social scientists and so on, come to understand powerful general principles about humanity and social systems. Those two revolutions both are then subjected to counter attacks. Uh, and again, uh, what happens in this case is there was a revolution, uh, probably by the time we get to 1800, the height of the enlightenment or the beginnings of more powerful skeptical traditions that they come to be developed. So the thinkers are starting to say things like, well, you know, if a scientific method is based on the evidence of the senses that we, uh, we observed the natural world, that's our first point of contact, and then on the basis of that reform, have distractions and we put those apps integrated into a propositions and then we take a propositions and put them in networks that we call theories and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:12:40       So we start to critically examine each of the elements of scientific method and over time, uh, weaknesses in the existing accounts of how all of those rational operations work come to be teased out. And philosophy then starts to go down a more skeptical path. So if, for example, you take perception, uh, as fundamental as our, you know, the individual subjects, first point of contact with the natural world, then you have to immediately deal with issues of a perceptual illusions for the possibility that people will have hallucinations or that the way you report your perceptual experience is at odds with how I report my perceptual experiences. So we have all

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       tell me if I've got this right. So with the dawning of the empirical age, let's say there's this idea that you can derive valid information from sensor data, especially if you contrast that sense data rigorously without others. Okay. So that's sort of the foundation for the scientific method in some sense. But then I think this is with manual con, there's an objection to that, which is that while you can't make the presupposition that that sense data enters your cognitive apparatus, your apparatus of understanding without a prior restructuring, it seems to me that that's where the postmodernists really go after the modernists. It's that given that you have to have a, a very complex perceptual structure that modern people might say was instantiated as a consequence of biological evolution. You can't make the case that what you're receiving from the external world is something like peer information. It's always subject to some very difficult to delimit degree to interpretation. And then you also have to take into account the fact that about a restructure and what it might mean for your concept of objective reality. And that's con. I think if I've got that right.

Speaker 2:          00:14:42       Well, the postmoderns, we'll use both of those strategies, the, uh, the strategy and the rationalist strategy. And what's important about con right is that cloud is integrating, right? Both of those and by strategy. So in the generations before Khan, the, uh, the skeptical arguments about perception by directed against the empiricists, you just want to say everything is based on observational data, but then if you don't have good answers about hallucinations and relativity and illusions, right, and so forth, and it seems like your structure, intellectual structure, whatever it comes to be, it, it's all based on probabilistic or possibly faulty perceptual data than the whole thing is a, is a tottering mess. And by the time we get to con, the appearance is tradition is a largely unable to respond to those kinds of objections. And so contract recognizing and saying, all right, we've been trying now for a couple of centuries, we haven't been able to do so successfully, uh, we're not going to be able to do so.

Speaker 2:          00:15:43       Now. You also nicely right, emphasize that one of the other, the other response. So it had been on the rationalist solid, which is to say, well, no, you don't start with pure empirical data instead that we do have perhaps some innate, a priori structures built into the human mind, how they got there. Maybe they're put there by God, maybe they're put there naturalistically regular or whatever. Uh, but what enables us to have legitimate knowledge, right, is that our empirical data comes in and it is filtered and structured by these preexisting right cognitive structures as well. The problem with that side of the line, and this is also well worked out by the time we get to the content, is the same world. If you're starting with inbuilt cognitive structures and everything that comes in so to speak, goes through the structural machine and you're aware of the outputs.

Speaker 2:          00:16:38       It goes. That's what's presented to your mind. Well, how do you know that those inbuilt structures I have anything to do with the way reality actually is out there. It seems. I've been. What you are stuck with is the end result of a subjective processing and there is no way for you, so to speak, to jump outside of your head or to compare it to end result with the way the world actually is our independently of how your mind has structured the awareness. So once again, you're struck stuck rather in a rather subjective place and again, the importance of contours and he's also looking at this more rationalist tradition and he's saying, well look again, we've been trying now for a couple of centuries to work these things out here from descartes who spinosa lightness in the others and rationalism also has reached a dead end. So we're not going to be able to do so. So conference in effect standing at the end of these two traditions and saying, you know, uh, the skeptics have it right on both sides. The empiricists and the rationalist tradition fail. There is no way for us to objectively come to know and external reality restructuring some sort of subjectivism.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Okay. So I don't know now whether to talk a little bit of Rote American pragmatic approach to that or whether to maybe we should go ahead and continue our discussion of the postmodernist because they're developing these claims.

Speaker 2:          00:18:03       Absolutely. And some of the postmodernists who describe themselves as neo pragmatist, Richard Horton for example. So yes, that's exactly the direction it's worth going.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       Okay. Okay. So my, my understanding of that, if I was going to defend the modernist tradition, let's say, I would say that we, we have instantiated within us an a priority perceptual structure that's a consequence of millions, billions of years for that matter of biological evolution. And yet it is, it has emerged in tandem with continual correction of its presuppositions by, by the selection process, but it's still subject to error because we have a very limited viewpoint as specific individuals. And we can, we can, not only are we limited, but we also make, you might say moral errors and I'll get back to that cloud our judgment. And so in an attempt to, um, expand our purview and rectify those errors, we do two things. We test our hypothesis practically against the world, which is to say we say, here's a theory of reality. We acted out if the theory of reality is sufficiently correct when we acted out, we get what we want and then that's sufficient proof for the validity of the theory.

Speaker 1:          00:19:19       It's not absolute proof, but it's sufficient proof. And then the other thing we do, and I think this has been paid attention to much less except by thinkers such as piaget, is that we further constrain our presumptions, presuppositions about reality with the necessity of constructing theories that are also acceptable to people around us, so they have to be integratable within the, the currently existing social contract, and they have to be functionally appropriate in the external world. And that's a nice set of constraints. And it seems to me that that at least in some part goes along ways to answering the objections to the, to the limits of the scientific method that had been discussed, that were discussed and that you just discussed that had been discussed historically that you just summarized.

Speaker 2:          00:20:10       Uh, I'm sympathetic too much of what you went through. The five point like a response to the kinds of arguments that have been played out, but you're actually putting me in a position then of the defending the postmodern condition, right, about how it would undercut each of those components. So if you take for example, a evolutionary epistemology and you give a nice sketch of one standard evolutionary epistemological framing, which we said, okay, maybe we have these Infield, a priority structures, but we can rely upon them because here we are standing at the long end of, uh, you know, uh, hundreds of thousands or millions of years of evolution and they would not have survived or enabled us to survive had they not serve some sort of reliable cognitive role in accurately representing the way that it works with the, uh, the postmodern. Uh, this is actually too early for the postmodern.

Speaker 2:          00:21:09       Postmodern will agree with this is to say all of that kind of begs the question right in a very deep way against the kind of skeptical objections that we're raising. Because in order to make that paragraph long description of what evolutionary epistemology is, what I have to do is take for granted as basic assumptions, certain truth right about the world that for example, there is an external world, right, that we are biological creatures that we have in built structures, that those structures are evolutionarily responsive and conditioning by changing forces like and so forth, and if you take those assumptions right to be true, then as a consequence or inclusion, you can infer that therefore the intellectual products that come out of our cognitive processing or reliable right in some way, but where did you get those for premises from? How do you know? Right? That there was an extra in a world.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       How do you know that we are biological creatures? How do you know for that evolution is true with all of the historical knowledge is necessary to reach the conclusion that evolution is true. All of that presupposes that we have legitimate cognitive methods become to understand the world, but our having legitimate cognitive processes understand the world. That's exactly what we are arguing about in the first place and you can't just assume that right for the sake of coming up with some premises that are then in turn going to validate those cognitive processes. So something like that or say is there's a, there's a big circle, a circular reasoning problem that the evolutionary epistemology find some crap. Then now I think there are some responses to that and this is just the first back and forth, right on that particular debate, but that is the kind of response that will be there.

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       So the third and fourth are keeping track accurately is to say that we also have a constraints, right, with respect to, to ourselves, uh, that if we have a certain set of hypotheses are certainly fatal theories and we're testing them out, uh, we will accept those that give us what we want. That's sort of what I want. So the street and I'm also necessarily in a social situation. So what you to do is check my results against the, uh, the results of others. Purely review, experiment, replication, like and so forth. Or we live in the same household. Yes, absolutely right. More prosaically, right? A sharing our frameworks right with each other, right. And so on. And so if so to speak, uh, and this is the more pragmatist orientation. If we then say we have a theory or a set of principles or guidelines or whatever, and they do enable me successful, you navigate the world or to get what I want, or they do enable me to navigate my social world. We get us what we want. Then they're reliable crew or some sort of a success label epistomological that we're going.

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       Okay. So let me ask you a question about this is a place where I got honored and very badly with a Sam Harris. We were discussing metaphysical presumption. So you know, and, and I'm confused about this. I would say to some degree conceptually because I'm, I'm an, I'm a scientist and certainly operate most of the time under the presupposition of an independent objective world. But then I also have some difficulty with the idea that objective truth. It's that it's objective truth within which all other truths are nested. And that's something that Sam and and the people that he represents in some sense are very dead set on insisting. Now, it seems to me though that the crux of the matter is something like the method of proof and districts me is very important because my theory is correct enough if when I implemented, I get what I want is not the same as the claim.

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       My theory is true because it's in accordance with some independently existing objective world. I mean both of those things can exist at the same time, but I think the more appropriate claim to make with regards to human knowledge is something like it's biological functionality, which is that your knowledge is of sufficient accuracy, which is about the best you can hope for because of your fundamental ignorance. If when you implemented it reliably produces the results that are commensurate say with your continued existence. Now it seems to me that that's a reasonable claim from a Darwinian perspective. And it also seems to me that it's very much in keeping with the claims of the American pragmatists. And I mean, it's not like they were radical postmodernists because they weren't, but they were trying to solve this problem to some degree of our fundamental ignorance and our, our inability to be certain about the nature of the reality that surrounds us.

Speaker 2:          00:26:20       Okay. Let's set aside a Sam Harris's a version of this and focus on the pragmatist Reggie tradition here. So No, you're absolutely right. A William James, John Dewey, right? And the others, late 19th century, early 20th century. They are coming a century after the content revolution after ideally ism, uh, and so forth. And so they are very much trying to solve this problem one way. And this is a very American right sort of things to say. Look, maybe the problem with philosophy is that we have been to like intellectual ising like cognition that we're not just embodies. Brains are disembodied minds that are trying to kind of contemplate abstract in some other realm. Maybe what we need to do is understand right? The mind and cognition as a naturalistic process and that the purpose of knowledge is not to come up with these pure and beautiful truths that are going to be kind of museum pieces that we will admire her, but rather the purpose of knowledge is functional.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       The purpose of knowledge is to guide action. Uh, and so they will then harking back to the earlier they konijn traditional the knowledge knowledge is not an end in itself, but as they can afford it. A Francis Bacon, a knowledge is power and by its fruits, right? So to speak, you know it's worth. And so what we then should do is to see that the chest of crew is not like whether it meets purely intellectual standards of logic and mathematics, but rather when we put it to practice and then we act upon it, we actually get good results or we get the results we want or I get the results I will become and more individualistic form or more socialized,

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       right? Because then we can get on. That's ignorance in some sense.

Speaker 2:          00:28:29       So there's two things that are being packaged here, right? One is to say that knowledge right is functional and that part I think is important. I think it's a very nice correction or the pragmatists are, it's not original with them, but they are re emphasizing that in the 19th century, knowledge needs to be pushed to the test. Uh, and uh, it's ability to do, enable us to, uh, to be pragmatic, but so to speak in the real world is a test.

Speaker 1:          00:28:58       Then there's a code to data as well. And I think this is relevant to Thomas Kuhn's discussion of scientific revolutions because code is often read as positing a sequence of, in some sense discontinuous revolutions. But if you, if you and, and, and, and that the conceptual structure that characterized one epoch, let's say like the Medieval Lee Park was so totally different and it's presuppositions from the conceptions that characterize the next. He parked that, that you can't even mediate between them in some sense. And now the reason I'm bringing this up is because coon is at least read as hypothesizing that there's not any necessary progress when you make leaps from one conceptual system to another. But if you take this pragmatic approach, the one that we've been outlining, it seems to me that you can say, well, something like this, your conceptions of the world are more tool like than objective truth, light and tools can have a greater or lesser range of convenience.

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       And so if you come up with a really good tool which would also be something that would look objectively true, generally speaking, then that's something that you can use in almost every situation and it will never fail. You and I would think of something like Newtonian physics and in that regard, or even more particularly quantum mechanics because it's never failed us and so it seems to me the pragmatic approach in some sense allows you to have your cake and eat it too. You can pause it, a hierarchy of truths, moving towards an absolute truth even, but also retain your belief in your own ignorance and not have to beat the drum too hard about the like what eternal accuracy of your objective presuppositions. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:30:42       Again, I'm sympathetic. I think with about 80 percent of that, but let me put my skeptical hat back on and say, well, how the postmoderns or the critics of pragmatism for first generation pragmatism will respond to that. So if we then say, right, all of these, uh, cognitive results and to rephrase, so we're going to assess all of our cognitive, uh, results or cognitive hypotheses in terms of their work with unity or they're getting what I want or what we want. Well, then the big question we have to turn to is to say, well, how do we judge whether something works or say that it's good because I get what I want. We get what we want, what is a want, right? And where do these wants come from and why should we accept wants and desires and, uh, achieving certain goals as our bottom line,

Speaker 1:          00:31:49       so to speak. Great. Okay. So that's right. So you can start to question the framework, the framework within which you're constructing the answer.

Speaker 2:          00:31:58       That's where I end at this point, we're leading epistemology right neutrally, so to speak, and moving into normative issues. And so the whole status of normative, uh, goals and, and then the means that are going to enable us to reach, reach rather those ends comes into play. So if I want to say the it's important thing is that I put it very baldly here, right? I get, I want, right? And I'm going to assess intellectual structures and beliefs and hypotheses in terms of do they give me what I want? Well, that already sounds like a fairly, uh, normatively subjectivist standpoint. Why should you take your wants as having some sort of high status it, everything has to be evaluated in terms of a. and then philosophically, then we say, well, where'd wants come from? And forces along anthropological, psychological, that set of literature a here, what, what's the relationship of our ones?

Speaker 2:          00:33:01       Are they based in biological drives or the instinctual or they acquired or the intellectual. Do they have any relationship to our rational capacities when I'm acting? Should I act on my desires and my wants, my console? So poor. So there's that whole tradition and we have to have a sophisticated theory about how all of that is going to work. If we're going to say we'll solve all these cognitive because the mechanical issues in terms of once or the satisfaction of desires or the achievement of goals the way private does want us to do, and again, uh, it's fairly easy to, uh, to imagine what the skeptical you're going to be, right? If it's a matter of what I want, well, isn't science supposed to be about coming up with general truths, uh, or, or maybe even universal cruise. And if we're immediately going to devolve it to whatever individuals want, well then we're going to be in there

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       fairly scattered because that also opens up a good point for a segue into the potential link between new Marxism, let's say, and postmodernism, because maybe you could say once you've opened the door to an admission that you can criticize the, the idea of want as a social construct, let's say. Which is one of the things that you intimated, nor the only thing obviously. Then you open the door to also making the claim that, that, that social construct that governs the wants that governs the truth can be governed by power, relationships. Something like that. And then by unfair power relationship so you can spin off down that aisle, which, and, and that's the other thing I really want to talk to you about is because on the one hand, the postmodernists are following this intellectual tradition of the critique of, of western thinking, which is exactly in some sense what philosophy should be doing, but in another way they seemed simultaneously to be introducing almost by sleight of hand, I kind of social critique that has its origin more in political revolution and class based theory. And they do that. They do that under the guise of pure philosophy in some sense. But with the intent and motivation of something like justifying the social revolution or continuing the Marxist, the Marxist analysis of power differential.

Speaker 2:          00:35:17       It can go both ways. Yes, it is possible that follow the road that we've just been going down to say, well, you know, if it's a matter about, uh, you know, what works for you, then that immediately starts to sound to relativistic and subjectivist. We don't have

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       an explanation or an answer rather to all the Weirdos want to do strange things because that's what they wanted to. So we might introduce as a corrective a socializing right of the process. So we might then say, no, it's not so much what you want as an individual, but rather what we want and we need to achieve some sort of a consensus here. So this is a slightly cartoon version here, but the difference between William James who was more individualistic and John Dewey in the next generation will collect advisors things, right a little bit more. So then we have a corrective on all of the individual Weirdos who knows what their desires and goals, right are going to be. Right. But anyway, just to confront the same problem there as soon as we start doing anthropology because then if we say, well, if we relativize it to the social group and when we start looking at different social groups, obviously different social groups have dramatically different wants and needs and desires and evolve very different traditions. And if it's a matter of saying what's true is what works for the group, uh, there is then no sorta speak Uber Group, right, or, or highest group of all groups that has status overall of the others. And if you do, and this is the second point that you said, right? Exactly right. Uh, then you say, well, no, no, this group's norms and goals are better than that group's goals, or hey, then you're into a, what the critics are going to call imperialism, right? Of, uh, of the, of the Lgu, inappropriate form,

Speaker 1:          00:37:01       right? So that leaves us, that leaves us with our current political situation in some sense, which is because that's been, it's been, that idea has been taken to what, to a logical conclusion. And that logical conclusion has now been instantiated to a large degree as a, as an intellectual and political activist movement. I would say that.

Speaker 2:          00:37:23       Sure, absolutely. So it can start as an intellectual movement that we're trying to do some hardcore epistemology, right? And we go through the empiricism, the rationalist and the content revolution. And the pragmatists are right now, we're in the second generation pragmatism where we'd relativize relative to various kinds of groups and then we're just stuck in a kind of group relativism and then the operational principles socially then is going to be that each group, so to speak, should stick to itself and not think that it can impose its ideas and its norms on any. Any other group. Right. All groups so to speak, are equal.

Speaker 1:          00:37:59       Yeah. There was an equal claim to have an equal claim to their formulation of the truth. The problem with the postmodern conjunction with neo Marxism to me, seems to be the idea, the acceptance of idea, that there's an intrinsic moral claim by the dispossessed to the, to the obtaining of status, and that actually constitutes a higher moral calling in and of itself. So they're swallowing a moral claim that it making it universal in some sense. At the same time, they criticize the idea of say general narratives are universal moral claims. Okay. Now that's

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       also A. Right. So that's, that's the other way rather than starting with epistemology. Right. In ending up getting into a kind of cultural relativism, right? You can start a course committed to a certain normative framework, regular certain ideological framework, uh, as Marxism is where you're very critical part of one of those traditions. And then the cultural relativism can be right a part of that that you used to criticize the tradition, right? Internal. Now then we're explicitly into a not to met an ethics and asking where do we get our ethical principles off the ground or where do they come from in the first place, but kind of a robust normative ethics where people have committed commitments rather to fairly strong ethical principles and ethical ideals. And this is where there was a debate between say Nisha and mark's becomes relevant and this is a late 19th century right?

Speaker 2:          00:39:35       Debate. So I suppose we say as both the Marxists who will do is say there is no proof in any objective sense. And we said, oh, we have the subjectivity in relativity regular very sorts and we have different individuals in different groups and they are in antagonistic conflict, relationship with each other. And that means there's not really going to be any, uh, know rational and civil resolution of these discussions with each other. Instead, it all comes down to power a sleight of hand claim there too, because why? It has to come down to powers that seems to introduce the necessary need. Okay? Yeah, that's another thing. We set that aside just for a moment, uh, but then we say, okay, so we have power, right? And one thing that we can say is, while we don't think any one individual, any one group has a better objective claim to truth or better ideals, it is nonetheless the case that some individuals and groups have more power than others.

Speaker 2:          00:40:47       And so then we have to make our allegiance clear in this unequal power struggle. Are we on the side of those who have more power or are we on the side of those who have less power? And that's where we get then a Nietzschean and Marxian that fork in the road, right? So the nutrients following nature will say, look, uh, it's all about power. Uh, then we can try on some crude evolutionary thinking here. It's only the exercise of power, right by the stronger, the fitter, healthier, and so forth that are willing to impose their power on the weaker and use them for their own ends that we as individuals and groups are going to make any sort of progress toward the next best thing. But whatever that is. So in the power struggle, there is no objective morality and objective truth, uh, we just throw our lot in with the stronger, with the richer, with the more powerful, and they say whatever it is that they do in order to advance themselves, that's normative best that we can do better.

Speaker 2:          00:41:50       Of course, there's a long, kind of aristocratic tradition, right? Uh, innovative thinking that one can draw on to support that. And in a Marxist mattress rather, of course it was on the other side of that equation, right? Where their sympathies, right initially are going to be say, you know, in any power struggle, our kind of a prior or I commitments that should always be to the weaker to those on the losing end or the pistol, those who suffer and so forth. And it's always the rich and powerful people who are oppressing and harming them and so we throw our lot in with the weaker and we're willing to use power whatever amount of power we have on behalf of the weaker. And then when we're just into what I think of as the major false alternative that really has driven much of 20th century with intellectual life. Are you a nutrient or are you a Marxist?

Speaker 1:          00:42:45       Well, okay, so now we can get to the crux of the matter here to some degree because to even engage in that argument means to accept the a priority position. Which would you made quite rationally compelling? Let's say that its power, its power because there's no other way of differentiating between the claims of different groups. It's power. That's the determining issue. But yeah, that that's something I really have a problem with and, and I think it's crucial importance because first of all, I think there's a big difference between power. There's a difference between power and authority and competence. Those are all not the same thing because you might be willing to see greater status to me in some domains, if there are things I can do that you value that you can't do, and that's not power. Exactly. Power seems to be more than I'm willing to use force to impose my interpretation of the world to get my wants fulfilled on you, and it seems to me that were the Marxists make a huge mistake.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       Not that the Nietzsche ends aren't making mistakes as well, but for the Marxists make a huge mistake is that they failed to properly differentiate between hierarchies of interpretation that are predicated on tyrannical power and hierarchies of interpretation that are predicated on authority, confidence and mutual consent. Because those and the other issue that they failed to contend with, and I believe this is a form of willful blindness, is that it isn't obviously the case that every society is set up equally to only fulfill the desires of the people who are in principle situated at the pinnacles of the hierarchies. I actually don't think that that's fundamentally characteristic of the western tradition because it has a very strong emphasis, weirdly enough, and this is how I think it extracts itself out of the social socialized, the conundrum that accepting a a socialized version of truth presents to you.

Speaker 1:          00:44:39       The West does two things. It says we have a social contract that constraints are views of the world and our actions in it, but that social contract is also simultaneously subordinate to the idea of the sovereignty of each individual and so the social contract is bound to serve the needs of each individual. Not any privileged set of individuals. Although sometimes it works out that way and I don't believe that the postmodern NSF contended with that properly with their. With their criticism of logo centers and for example, which was something that characterized data. Because I think that that because it doesn't. It never has seemed to me that what you had with Stalinist Russia and and the Marxist view of the world and what you had on the side of the West was merely a matter of a difference of opinion between two equally valid socialized modes of interpreting the world.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       You know there's something wrong. There's something more to the view of the West. Then what's in battle, what's embodied in the conflict between capitalism and socialism. Because it could've just been a matter of argumentation and opinion. But I think that that's. That's fault. And I thought this way in part because of piaget, because piaget was interested in what the intrinsic constraints. We're on a social contract and he said, and he was trying to address this issue of the insufficiency of want as a, as a, as a, as a tool to justify your claims to truth. And that's when he introduced the idea of the equilibrated state. So if you're sophisticated, you have to put forward your want and then need it in a way that will meet it today and tomorrow and next month and next year and in a decade. So you have to iterate yourself across time and you have to take all of the iterations of yourself across time with some degree of seriousness and then you also have to do the same thing as you extend yourself out into the social community. So it has to be what's good for me now and repetitively into the future in a manner that simultaneously good for you now and simultaneously into the future. And that starts to become an. And he thought about that as the playable game, something like that. The voluntarily playable game. And there's something deep about that because it includes the idea of iteration, you know, iterated interpretations into the equation, which strikes me as like, of crucial importance. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:12       Again, I think by my count about six very interesting subtopics built into that and the latter part of a very nice statement I think of kind of lightened meant humanism where we're going to take power seriously, but we're going a constraint power in a way that respects the individual and simultaneously enables individuals to form mutually beneficial social network across time. And so, uh, and uh, I'm very sympathetic to a, that overall right construction, uh, that comes out of them. The first part, which is a taxonomy, right? That you're offering about the nature of power and that taxonomy does differ significantly from both the Marxist and, and the Nietzschean one I would say is, you know, I think it's better to take power right more neutrally. Um, so there's a continuity with what the physicists do. My understanding there is a power or just the, the ability to get work done. So it's a, it's a tool and functionality, right? Language, right power is what gets you from a to B. Great.

Speaker 1:          00:48:31       I love that description because it fits very nicely in with the narrative conceptualization of b, because narratives seem to be descriptions of something like how to get from point a to point B,

Speaker 2:          00:48:41       right? But it also doesn't say anything about being in the status of be how we choose where we should be going, but what our ends are or what are our goals are going. So in that sense, power is normatively neutral. It's a means to an end. Uh, and that means that when we start to try to evaluate the uses of power, we're going to be evaluating power in terms of the ends towards which is put a, if I can end with that pip position. Yeah. So now then we say, okay, well power comes in all kinds of hormones, right? We're quite happy to say those intellectual power or the ability to use our minds to, to address and solve certain problems that there's muscular power will the ability to move physical objects. There's a social power people respect you and are, are willing to spend time with you and divert resources to voluntarily and so forth. Uh, there's military power, political power, and so we're going to have a whole set of subspecies of power. And what they all have in common is a, in each of those domains, there are goals and having the power enables you to achieve your goals in those domains.

Speaker 1:          00:49:57       Great. And we shouldn't fall prey to the illusion that there's necessarily any, like, what would you call it, unifying matrix that makes all those different forms of power. Importantly, similar except for the terminology you know, we, and this is another thing that bothers me about the both, the Nietzschean in the Marxist Marxist view, is that there's this proclivity to collapse these multiple modes of power into power itself and that's not reasonable because if it's reasonable to note many of the forms of power that you just described contend against one another rather than mutually fortifying one another. It's like a. it's like the balance of power in a. In a polity like the American polity,

Speaker 2:          00:50:39       that's a deep point that you're making a, I think both the Marxists and the Nietzschean to do ended up collapsing power into a unitary type. Alright, that's when the steak, but it's a mistake only if you deny right? As both the marshals and the Nietzschean do that. There is a deep individuality right about a world. So if you think by contrast, right about the kind of individual human rights respecting and lightening and vision, you're articulating that I agree with as well. For normatively, that wants to devolve social power to the individual or individuals with a great deal of self responsibility and control over their own domain. Right? So the speed and the idea then is that if we're going to form social relationships or any sort of social interaction, it has to be mutually respecting that I have to respect your control over your domain and you respect my control over my domain, but we agreed to share domains, so to speak, that voluntary. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:51:51       And this is a place where I think the post modernists are really open to you might say conceptual assault is that you know, in order to have that freedom devolve upon the individual in that manner, it also means that the individual has to take responsibility for acting as a locus of power in world actual responsibility and cannot conceive of themselves or act in a manner that only makes them an Avatar of a social movement. And I think that art of the preferred anthony individualism of the radical left is precisely predicated on that refusal to take responsibility. And I think that's also reflected in the fact that by temperament, they're low in trait conscientiousness, so it's deep, it's not merely an opinion, it's an expression of something that's even deeper than opinion

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       prayed. Locus of responsibility, locus of power, locus of control. You're right that the far left in Marxist in Neo Marxists form does deny that. But you also find that in far right in general, right? So this is a bit of cartoon, right? To intellectual history, right? But then if you try to trace it to the Marxist on the left and the nutrients on the right, both of them do denied that individuals are locus Loci, rather have responsibility by both of them in their views of human nature have strongly deterministic views for what we call an individual. Right? According to both of them, right? It's just a vehicle through which right outside forces are flowing, so to speak.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       Right? Well, you can also see that in some sense, as a perverse consequence of the scientific revolution because you're still see this among modern scientists. It's like, okay, what are the causal forces that regulate human behavior? Okay, there's two primary sources, mature slash biology and culture.

Speaker 2:          00:53:43       So it's the crude nature versus nurture, debate being played out through them. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:53:48       Right. So, and that's in my opinion, and I've derived this conclusion from studying mythology mostly, is that there's a missing third element there, which is whatever the active force, whatever it is that constitutes the active force of individual consciousness,

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       right? We don't have a good grounds right in being an independent private initiator of power instead of merely a responder to other power forces, right? Or a vehicle through which those other power forces operate. So yeah, the individualism, right? Uh, that is built into enlightenment humanism. We start to see it developing in renaissance humanism is to take seriously, right? The notion that individuals have some measure, some significant measure of control over their Fox, over the actions, the shape, the shape, their own destiny, and that is fundamental right to one moral dignity as a human being. And so that is going to be a live view of human nature built into the ethics fundamentally. And then all of social relationships have to be respectful of that individuality. And then consequently, when we start to turn to political theory, or we thought knockabout very heavy duty use of power such as the police and the military, uh, we want to have a serious constraints on government power to make sure that we are respecting the individual sovereignty.

Speaker 1:          00:55:20       Okay. So here's something perverse to that, that, that emerges as a consequence of something you pointed out earlier in the conversation. You know, you mentioned that when modernism emerge out of medieval Islam, the two things happened and one was the elaboration of the conceptual frames that enabled us to deal with the external world, but the other was the elevation of the individual to the status of valid critic predicated on the idea that there was something actually valid about individual experience as such. Now the problem there as far as I can tell, and maybe this is part of the reason we're in this conundrum, is that the, the elaboration of the objective scientific viewpoint let us left us with the idea that it was either nature or nurture that was the source of human motive power. But the missing element there is. Well, if that's the case, then why grant to the individual to begin with the role of independent social critic? Like on what grounds do you, and it's like the, it's like the resentment. It's like a residual belief in something like the autonomy of the soul. You can't just sneak in and not justify without, without, without problems like the ones that we have now.

Speaker 2:          00:56:30       That's well put and I think it's fair to say that we still are in the infancy of the psychological sciences. You can speak to this better than I can, but as someone in philosophy, I think we're still at the beginnings and we are still in the grip of early and crude versions, crude scientific understandings of how cause and effect operators. And so what we are starting with is very mechanical, uh, understandings. And we can understand how people that are pushed around by biological forces. We can understand to some extent now the push around by the external, physical and mechanical forces, but we do not yet have a sophisticated enough understanding of the human brain, the human mind, human psychology. To understand how a volitional consciousness can be a causal force causal power in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       Right? So that's perfectly put. So in this, I do a detailed analysis that some of the people who watch, we're familiar with this movie Pinocchio and Un Occhio is got a very classic mythological structure and it basically introduces three elements of va, so there's the element of being that's associated with Japan and also the evil tyrannical forces that are kind of patriarchal in nature and that's sort of the conceptualization of society. I've been evolent element and a level at the elements. And then there's the introduction of this other causal factor in it. It's personified in the form of the blue fairy in the blue fairy is a manifestation of mother nature and she animates the Nokia, so Japan creates them and then sets up a wish for his independence. And then nature appears in the guise of the blue fairy and and grants that wish. So you have culture and nature conspiring to produce.

Speaker 1:          00:58:14       I'm a puppet that could in fact disentangle itself from its strength, but the movie insists and it does this on profound mythological grounds that the puppet itself has a causal role to play in it's own, um, what would you call its own capacity to transcend the deterministic change that it's being, that, that have the deterministic processes that have given rise to it, but that also enslaved it and you know, in, in, in all of our profound narratives, I would say, and this is part of the way that they differ from the standard scientific account. There's always that third element. There's always the autonomous individual who is in some sense, you know, lifting himself up by his own bootstraps and, and I don't think it's a problem that science is unable to account for that, but it's a very big problem with scientists who are unable to account for that deny that it exists because they can't explain it then becomes extraordinarily dangerous, right?

Speaker 2:          00:59:11       Once you stop looking, uh, you stopped crying, right? Then you're left with a, an impoverished account. So in a way, there's a kind of Hubris right? Built into the skepticism, right? It says, you know, I know that this is a problem that we just can't solve that, and so I'm not going to try. I'll try anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:59:30       There's A. There's a performative contradiction as well, which is much worth pointing out because on the one hand, the scientists might well claim as far as I'm concerned from an epistomological person perspective, the only two causal forces are nature and culture, but then I'll go about my actions in the normal world as an existential being, acting in the world, and I will swallow whole heartedly the proposition that each individual is responsible for his own actions because that's how I constantly interact with everyone in the world and I get very irritated if they violate that principle.

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       Right? So how you live, so to speak with your skepticism or with your relativism in a way that doesn't mean snarl you in the countries and contradictions. That's a. that's a hard contract itself.

Speaker 1:          01:00:17       It does. It does seem to be that I think it's reasonable to point out that it's not possible to find a person who acts as if he or anyone else is biologically are culturally determined. We just don't behave that way in the real world. We act as if we're responsible for our own actions and the consequences of those actions.

Speaker 2:          01:00:38       So then we have a tension between what our intellectual theories, right are telling us and what are kind of empirical data, right was telling them. So we don't yet have a way to put those two together. And then what you as an individual do in response to that tension between theory and practice. Uh, that's a whole other can of things to explore. Great. To get the backup to our discussion about power. Um, it's interesting that the way our discussion right up to that point then integrates, right free thing. So we started talking about proof, uh, and then we started talking about goals and normative ends, right in ideals. And then we talk about power. So there was already the big three truth, a ideals, right and power. I discussion about truth right? Took us into a logical issues, right in philosophy, our discussion about ideals that takes us into ethics and ethics issues.

Speaker 2:          01:01:39       Again, also in philosophy or discussion of power, right? Takes us in to issues about human nature, which traditionally, but a branch of philosophy now, smarter sub disciplines were doing so we already have to have a theory of epistemology, theory of human nature, a theory of efforts, and we sometimes try to integrate those and postmodernism is going to be an integration, right, of certain views that develop in divisions in all three of those areas. So maybe one way to put it is this, if you, if you contrast it to again taking white moment as our touchstone a since we're both fans of the enlightenment because they were fine with, with power, like knowledge is power and we want to empower the individual, right? We want to eliminate slavery and empower. People want to eliminate or fashion sexism and empower women. So power.

Speaker 1:          01:02:43       Yeah. We actually want to remove arbitrary and unnecessary impediments to the expression.

Speaker 2:          01:02:48       Yeah. Proper power. That's so there are legitimate uses of power that are stopping and disempower and right people. So it's the double edge sword, uh, and as long as power is properly directed or properly located, right then we are confident that by and large people individually and socially we'll use their power to put together useful lives, build a successful economies and societies and so forth. So it was actually a very optimistic right overall assessment about, uh, about, about power, but power right is then structured as a means to an end. And we want to empower people cognitively teach them how to read, teach them how to think, right, so that they themselves can understand the truth and discover new truth. But so power leads to true, but we also then want people to be free to, uh, to, uh, to, uh, to act on the basis of their, their power. Because then we think that if people are respected as individual agents are going to be happier, uh, and so they will achieve good goals and they will mute workout, share together, fair will, uh, agreements and deals, a kind of justice will, the society will get better and better and so forth. So power is in the service of just social relations. And powers in the service of truth.

Speaker 1:          01:04:22       Great. That's a great, that's a great justification for the enlightenment viewpoint. And it seems, I don't want to stop you from pursuing that, but it also seems to me that to the degree that that's true, a valid description of the enlightenment aims and to the degree that that's actually manifested itself in reality in the state, in the current state of human affairs, that it's perhaps unwise of us to allow our Marxist or are Nietzschean presuppositions to take, uh, take two careless to swing at that foundation. Given that it's actually okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05:01       Absolutely right. And that's why the enlightenment articulation power is good. If it's in the service of proof, right? Or power is good. If it's in the service of justice and you were fine and we're optimistic enough about human beings cognitively and morally, that we think empowering them, giving them lots of freedoms is going to increase the net stocker approved and it's going to increase the net stocker justice. So that entire enlightenment package is precisely what the counter enlightenment attacks and attack very fundamentally. So that by the time we get to two, three generations later to the generations of marks and eat you, it has been hollowed out. So on the epistomological side, right? We don't believe, right, that there is such a thing as true anymore. So it's not the case that power is in the search for truth because we don't believe that human beings are capable of getting any sort of objective proof anymore. So we're just left with power. And also on the normative side, we don't believe in dressed us right anymore. We don't believe that any sort of normative principles or ethical ideals can be objective. We ground up. And so then once again, maybe we're left with subjective designers, right? And so forth. But we're just left again with power. So Howard, service approved power in the service of justice that goes away. All we are left with is power. Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       Well we could mount a psychoanalytic critique of that set of objections because I could say, okay, here's some reasons. Let's, let's assume that you're doing something simple

Speaker 3:          01:06:44       and and

Speaker 1:          01:06:47       let's assume you're doing something simple and easy instead of complicated and difficult with your objections, and so here's the simple and easy explanation you want to dispense with the idea of justice and truth because that lightens your existential lobe because now there's nothing difficult and noble that you have to strive for and you want to reduce everything to power because that justifies your use of power in the pursuit of your immediate, in pursuit of those immediate goals that you no longer even have to justify it because you don't have to make reference to any higher standards of justice or true, and so I would say that's a deep impulsive and resentful nihilism that's manifesting itself as a glorious intellectual critique. Now I'm understanding as well that there is the history of genuine intellectual critique that you'd be laying out, which is not trivial, but those things have to be differentiated. You know, it's certainly not reasonable either. For those who claim that all there is is power, that they're not themselves motivated equally by that power.

Speaker 2:          01:07:54       So in one way, right? What you could always say in the tech philosophy is autobiographical, in many cases were philosophers will put their pronouncements in bird person form. I don't generalize form, but if you always put it down to the power or sort of person formulations that can be profoundly self regulatory, right? So if you say for example, human beings are Scamo, where then you have some sort of pessimistic already assessment of the human condition, a well built into that. Then as the idea that I think if I personally I am scum, we're really doing is a, is a, is a first person confession and it's always done in a legitimate move to exempt yourself from the, from the general principle, right? Everything just is to come back. You are more likely topic, your power relations and people imposing their agendas on other people than what you're saying is, well, my fundamental commitment is power and I just want to impose my agenda on other people.

Speaker 2:          01:08:55       So I think you're right that it can go both ways. It can of course be that you have people who, for whatever reason, have a predisposition to nihilistic, uh, a more power seating and they, when they become adults and intellectual, they latch onto theories, uh, that in indulgent that enabled them to rationalize their predispositions. Uh, and so in many cases you are a lot of postmodernism in some of the manifestations is disingenuous, right in that form that people don't necessarily buy into the postmodern philosophical framework, but rather in kind of pragmatic form, postmodernism as a set of tools is useful for them to advance their own personal and social agenda. But whatever those happen to be because they find it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       Okay. So let's switch a little bit. Let's switch over into that a little bit. And I found our discussion for what it's worth, I found her discussion extremely useful on the philosophical and, but now I would like to make it a bit more personal. So now you, if you don't mind, you've written this book and it's a fairly punchy but say critique of postmodernism and its alliance with neo Marxism and, and you've done a careful job of laying out the historical development of that, have both of those movements and their alliance. Um, what, what was your motivation for doing that and what do you, what have you experienced one as a consequence of writing the book and to, as a consequence of a professor who's in the midst of a, of an academic society that's basically running on postmodern principles?

Speaker 2:          01:10:43       Yeah, that's a good trio of questions there. But my, my motivation for writing the book was a motivations plural. A one is an intellectual exercise. A year was a movement that was complex. Many philosophical and cultural screens were coming together and uh, I enjoy the intellectual history very much so. It was a pleasure for me to, to read back into the histories and the cheese out over the lines of and how things were packaged, be packaged. Uh, so that the postmodern synthesis right as it came together in the front of the second, third and 20th century, right, came, came into being as a, as a purely intellectual historical enterprise, found that fulfilling a partly also this was a 19, 90, late 19 nineties. It's end of the Cold War. Uh, one of the things I had done, not professionally but just out of personal interest was read a lot of political philosophy, read a lot about the Cold War and the, uh, the intellectual developments and political developments that have gone on there.

Speaker 2:          01:11:56       So I had a very good say amateur working knowledge before I started researching the book about the history of Marxism and history of the Cold War geopolitics and sort of one of the big questions that are on everyone's mind person in the 19 nineties with the fall of the Soviet Union. The end of the Cold War is what's going to happen next, whether it's the new geo political alignment going to be. But then from my academic position, uh, the big question inside the intellectual world is since far left politics had been so prominent and that for generations, right? Intellectuals inside the academic world at large will given the benefit of the doubt too far, leftists experiments, even going out of the way to be fellow travelers and so forth that, uh, by the time you get to the end of the cold war, basically everybody except for a few true believers is rethinking. Right? So what does this mean for not necessarily left politics more broadly, but certainly for our lab by politics.

Speaker 2:          01:13:07       Uh, and so even the far right of the leftists are recognizing that they're going to have to come up with some sort of a new strategy in order to remain intellectually respectable and some sort of a new strategy in order to become a culturally and politically feasible. So I didn't have a kind of a cultural, political interest in what the thinking was on the far left about what they're going to do now that the Soviet Union has collapsed and the whole world is shifting more toward market liberalism or to some sort of third way central is loaded up on the beach. So yes. So you have a huge amount of empirical data that you have to confront and uh, uh, yeah, I think this is certainly going to be part of the postmodern package, but there was a lot of denial of the relevance of Empiricism, a lot of denial of the, uh, the relevance of logic and social scientific statistical methods of aggregating that data and which normally the conclusions on the basis of that. So we can understand the temptation on the part of a lot of people to find psychological devices that will enable them to deny the gulag and various other things

Speaker 1:          01:14:30       either are stacked viciously and get the facts as even you would constrain them. Are Stacking officiously in contradiction to your theory. It's time to mount an all out assault on what constitutes a fact. One strategy,

Speaker 2:          01:14:47       and that's again, one of the sub strategies, I think that postmodern postmodern worldview, so if you then have a loss suffers and social scientists and the people who are up to speed in their epistemology who are telling you well know there are just know different narratives that are out there and there are no such things as objective facts and logic was not necessarily pointing in one direction. There are poly logics or, or, or multiple frameworks. Then, uh, if you have one framework that says no, there are objective facts, uh, and, and the logic is all going against your, your version of political idealism. It's to be very tempting for you to say, well, I can just dismiss that as just one narrative way of constructing the historical facts. I can come up with a different narrative that softens organized like all together and certainly some of the bad faith postmodernist who go down that road like very much so.

Speaker 2:          01:15:43       In part that was my motivation for writing the book part. I did feel that I was in a good position intellectually to do so because my, my phd work had been in, in logic, philosophy of science systemology, so it was up to speed on the entire history of a log from the modern world on blue things are the way things were in the eighties and early nineties. So I was reading the same people that were already had, I have to say I've learned an enormous amount from reading Richard Rorty. He's first rate even though I ended up disagreeing fundamentally everything, uh, who goes phd also was in philosophy. He also a phd in psychology. There's another philosophy, Phd Realtor, another philosophy phd, so not necessarily put myself on the same stature right intellectually, but, uh, all of the so to speak or first grade educated, any piss demolished, so I know where they're coming from and where all of that is going at the same time.

Speaker 2:          01:16:52       Uh, my, uh, my undergraduate and master's degree at Grove, just down the road from you, uh, in a, in history of philosophy. So a long standing passion for how arguments and movements develop over time. Uh, so, uh, I thought I had, it was in a good position to see how postmodernism have evolved out of various other earlier movements that had developed over time and I am enough of a political animal to be interested in political philosophy and I believe that abstract philosophical theory when it puts it, gets put into practice, make life and death practical differences. So the stakes are high. Uh, so it was motivated then to put it all together. How does the history and the philosophy and the politics all come together in. And so, so I wrote the book now a yeah. How it has affected me personally in an academic life.

Speaker 2:          01:17:50       Well, let me see. I think in one way I think I was fortunate that I had tenure by the time the book was published and my university is a vital, larger tolerant case. We have some, some issues here, but by and large my colleagues on a reasonable decent people, uh, and uh, I was able to get tenure on the strength of my teaching abilities and my, my publication. Um, so it wasn't that I was going to lose my job right over this fracture. First areas, there's blow back. I did have difficulty getting the book published right in the first place. Actually I finished writing the book by the year 2000. I had taken a sabbatical from 1999 to 2010. I was not able to get the book published until 2004. And a reason for that was a number of desk rejections. You know, the editor sends a form letter back for very few of those, but more seriously what happened three times, possibly four times, I don't remember exactly now was that would get past the, uh, the, the editor at the press and then it really sent out to two or three reviewers.

Speaker 2:          01:19:05       And in each case what happened was I would get split and poor I slipped a review for at one would come back and say, yeah, this is a really good book. You've done his homework. It's a good argument, is a fresh argument. Don't necessarily agree with all of it, but this really ought to be out there right as a book. And then the other review or the other two reviews on the other side would be a equally savaging at this terrible book, or he doesn't know his history of philosophy. He butchered the sat or act or the other thing and I strongly recommend that you don't like publishes books. And then almost always in that situation, the, uh, the editor just said no. So it wasn't until 2000 and I guess late 2003 a or few thousand for a scholar, ged, which was at a small press working out of Arizona, uh, took the book on.

Speaker 2:          01:19:56       And I'm happy to say that to accurate published. It's an imprint consistently since then. So remarkable. Just remarkable how many book, let alone an academic book and then multiple translations and those continue. So, so, so I'm happy about that now to say the scholar and the responses have been from the moderate liberal, also kind of traditional the one who used the word necessarily traditional, but the rational, naturalistic liberal right thinkers, uh, conservatives and libertarians that reviews have all been strong, strongly positive or not received any formal reviews from any of the postmodern for or far left journals. So I'm not sure what that means, but there is a, at least some level of unwillingness to engage with might be a sign of respect. Well, there is one sign of respect that comes out and that is that every, let's say once a year, so probably a dozen times since the book has been published, I've been asked by the editor of a postmodern foreclose fellow traveler, a critical theory type of journal to be a second reviewer right on one of your articles. So I'm in their Rolodex, so to speak. We use the old fashioned label has that when they are actually looking for someone who's likely to give an objective but critical respect perspective on some articles to be submitted to the journal once in a while my name floats up and they'll send it out to me. So I'll just do the standard thing of reading it and getting my mindset, my professional opinion on that. So I think when they are aware of me, but there hasn't really been any direct intellectual engagement. Kind of sad.

Speaker 1:          01:21:47       When you set yourself up to write the book, were you thinking of writing a critique of postmodernism or, or were you thinking of conducting an exploration of postmodernism?

Speaker 2:          01:22:01       Right now I'm working on the critique or the, the book ends, uh, I don't want to say abruptly because it did set out the purpose of. It does, but it doesn't end with the door open, right. To say how then do we respond to a, this is this dead end of counter enlightenment thought or in postmodernism are. So we're at a point culture. We were that the meaning of postmodernism has now it's infected the academy. And we see problems there, but it's also left the academy and so for people outside the academy are seeing results. And so the big question is what do we do next? So, so I am actively working on the sequel to, uh, to explaining postmodernism now. And I did go back and forth in the writing. My first purpose was to write a straight diagnosis and intellectual history of postmodernism.

Speaker 2:          01:22:50       And uh, that's where I ended up leaving it because in one sense this is a bit artificial, but I really liked 200 page books. It's a kind of long enough for you to get into a subject deeply enough and to make a good point in integrated argument and then stop. And so I realized if I wrote the sequel then it would be a 400 page book. And I thought it was more important to get this self contained intellectual history of postmodernism out there. So I brought things to a logical conclusion right where I ended the book and, and now I'm working on

Speaker 1:          01:23:31       which the next one called just as a,

Speaker 2:          01:23:34       the working title of something. And it changes every year, every few months, right? Or, or, so sometimes I think about it, the fate of the enlightenment or something to do with the neo enlightenment, uh, or it won't be this, but post postmodernism or after postmodernism something.

Speaker 1:          01:23:55       Yeah, we've been struggling with terminology as well. Absolutely. Talking about with such things.

Speaker 2:          01:24:01       And it's a very hard thing to do because it's a, as we've seen Phyllis philosophically, right? Postmodernism is multidimensional. It's a metaphysical critique, it's informative critique, it's a political critique, it's an epistemological right set of views. And so the alternative then also has to be integrated philosophical. There has to be an entire prosoft package. And so what, uh, what label is going to capture all of that, uh, and at the same time make a connection to postmodernism. And also, uh, I'm, I'm basically an optimistic positive guy. So I want something that,

Speaker 1:          01:24:39       that has a as a way forward. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Make it a better place. Right? Right. Exactly. Exactly. So, look, I think an hour and a half interview is approximately the equivalent of a 200 page book. So why don't we, why don't we end with that and what I would like to propose is that we have another discussion in a couple of months about what you're thinking about with regards to what you're writing. Now. We've covered the intellectual territory. We've covered the historical territory and done a reasonable reasonably good job, I think of both justifying posts, postmodernism in this discussion and also pointing out its pitfalls and dangers. We haven't outlined a much for an alternative vision except making tangential reference to the potency of individual capacity. That seems to be. That would seem to be reasonable grounds for the next discussion. So

Speaker 2:          01:25:45       the next time we chat, right talking about the current culture war issues, you know, one of the things I'm very interested in is younger people in particular who are in the front lines in universities, so to speak, and they're surrounded in a bewildered and angry and in some cases intimidated by all of

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       the microaggressions and so forth and the indoctrination of getting. But I'm actually kind of glad that we didn't talk about the political end of it today because it enabled us to have a conversation that was almost entirely philosophical in nature and I really think that's the right, that's the right level of analysis because the battle that's occurring in our culture is actually occurring at a philosophical level and there's other levels as well. But that's, that's, that's even more important than the political level as far as I'm concerned. Well said. I agree 100 percent nicely. Right. Well it was a pleasure speaking with you. Is very much worthwhile or do you have a remarkable capacity for tracking the content of conversations and on point. So that's quite amazing to see because we did branch out and a lot of different directions more or less similar caneously it was quite helpful in keeping the chorus on track that you could so rapidly organized the, you know, it was almost like you're putting a paragraph structure in the conversation, ask occurred. So that was something that was really interesting to see. So anyways, it was a pleasure meeting you and thanks very much for talking with me and I'll obviously input recommend book like. Sorry, go ahead. I want to say much respect for the work you're doing. Thanks for having me on your show. Be Happy to talk again. Great, good. We'll set that up right. Thanks Jordan. Bye. Bye.
