Speaker 1:          00:00:29       Because we're in Vancouver is daunting.

Speaker 2:          00:00:40       Who here for a second, Jordan and given me the honor of moderating this debate or discussion depending on how you view it and I think that actually creates a certain kind of responsibility and I want to talk to you about my responsibility and who I see it in my. My sense of how you all have responsibility in this as well. I suspect that what's going to happen tonight is actually historical, which doesn't necessarily make it good as lots of

Speaker 3:          00:01:11       bad history.

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       It could be good though and that's what I'm hoping will happen. So the reason I say I think it's historical is that we are existing in a moment where all of the systems that have helped us make sense are breaking down the university.

Speaker 3:          00:01:26       The students are breaking down, journalism is breaking down

Speaker 2:          00:01:33       and at that same moment we have a network of people who are trying to make sense in an alternative way. And I have to say I think beating the odds for the moment. So here's the problem. That network is not entirely in agreement with itself about some significant issues in Sam and have some differences. Very difficult. So what could happen tonight is we could have some sort of a failure where things get even more muddled. We could tread water, we're nothing gets clearer. Maybe it would be entertaining, maybe it wouldn't, but best case scenario is that we figure out how to make sense of things that have gotten in our way before. And if that happens then you all will leave here and as you talk in your various networks, you will have something to say about in what way we upgraded our software so that we could talk more deeply about difficult issues. So and to that end we would ask that you not film tonight's discussion and broadcast and online. It's not that we want to hide this. In fact we encourage you to discuss it, but we would like to have all of us feel maximally free to speak here to try out positions that we haven't tried out before in the hopes that we can get somewhere new. All right, so

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       see if we can head towards some of the discussions that have difficult in the past.

Speaker 4:          00:03:13       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:03:20       I think I'll just start by saying that when we first had the idea to do this now some months ago, and I'm getting a little reverb, so if you can dial down then there's a white one, Jordan I first designed to do is you do an event together was after we did those somewhat ill fated podcasts and I joke that we would probably need a safe word for this event.

Speaker 4:          00:03:47       So

Speaker 5:          00:03:49       that safe word as will come as no surprise is lobster.

Speaker 4:          00:03:58       So

Speaker 5:          00:03:59       No, you'll know, things are dire when one of us says says that, but I, you know, I just want to express my motive for a helping to stage these events into it because I, you know, I, I reached out to Jordan,

Speaker 6:          00:04:14       um,

Speaker 5:          00:04:16       it really was born of him in conversation with people other than myself. I saw him do a podcast with Joe Rogan. I saw him speak to Dave Rubin as I'm speaking with Brett on Rogan's podcast and I had so much admiration for him in those conversations is 90 percent of what he said in those conversations struck me as really wise and useful and well intentioned and 10 percent didn't. And but I, and I noticed that it was clear to me that I am seeing these successful conversations with other people who I respect. I began to wonder that, you know, I might be the problem and I, I think I, I think I am the problem. Before you applied, maybe I didn't mean that quite the way

Speaker 4:          00:05:08       took it.

Speaker 5:          00:05:10       I think it's, I think it's a good sort of problem for Jordan to have because it's what happens on those 10 percent moments and what doesn't happen that I think made our conversations so hard and, and I think there is stuff to clarify between us. So I look forward to doing that. And thank you Jordan, for agreeing to do this. It's an honor to share the stage with you and needless to say, having Brett as a moderator is a, almost an obscene underestimation of the role he should be playing at any stage because he, as you know, he's been on my podcast and that was one of the best conversations I've ever had. So thank you for doing this.

Speaker 4:          00:05:49       Thanks.

Speaker 7:          00:06:00       Alright, so I'm going to jump right into it. I think you're. So look, this is. I put up a poll a couple of days ago to find out what people broadly speaking might want us to discuss and I'd been taking a look at that and I took a lot of notes, which is why I have my computer here by the way on my phone. It's not to check my email. Well, the debates going on the discussion. I thought what I might do is just lay out some places that I think Sam and I agree and because there's lots of places we agree and so and then I want to figure out where we disagree, which I've been trying to sort out and then I want to see if we can hash it out a little bit and move forward on that a bit. So I'm going to lay out.

Speaker 7:          00:06:44       See, one of the things that Carl Rogers said, this psych psych psychologist was that one good way to have a discussion with someone is to tell them what you think they think until they think that what you said reflects what they said. We'd like. This is really useful thing to know if you're ever having a discussion with an intimate partner for example, is that you have to put their argument back to them in terms they agree with. It's very difficult. So I'm going to try to do that. And so. So the first thing is, I think, I think that partly what's driving you, if, if, if this is accurate, is that you want to ground a structure of ethics in something solid and, and there's two, there's two things you want to avoid to catastrophes. Let's say one is the catastrophe that you identified with religious fundamentalism and the other is the catastrophe that's associated with moral relativism. Is that, is that reasonable? Yeah, that's good. Okay, good. Good. Okay. Well,

Speaker 7:          00:07:44       okay. So it's crucially crucially important that we get this right now. So that's something that I think we really agree on because I've conceptualized that slightly different than you and that might be relevant, but I think of that as a pathology of order and a pathology of chaos. So the terminology is slightly different, but I think we're working on the same axis. So, so, so that's the first thing. And then in order to do that, it seems to me that's your first priority. Then maybe your second priority is something like, you know, you see undue suffering in the world, plenty of it, and you would think that things would be better if that wasn't the case and that this morality, whatever it's going to be is at least going to ground itself in part on the presupposition that the less undue suffering in the world, the better. So is that also reasonable?

Speaker 8:          00:08:40       I would just add to that the positive side of the continuum as well. So as you know the phrase, I use the word I use for this as well being, and I know from having. I don't think we spoke about this on my podcast, but from having seen in other interviews, I think you think that phrase doesn't capture everything one could reasonably want, but I think it does. I mean I've just, you know, it's, it's, it's an elastic suitcase term for a reason and it's, it's actually in reading your book, I realize there's a point of contact here because you used the word being capital b been with as though it were imbued with significant gravitas. And so for me, and I agree with you, that's an inappropriate use of, of being a and for me wellbeing is simply just the positive side of being, you know, there's, there's the negative side, the suffering we want to mitigate. But I think I think however good consciousness can be in this universe, that the wellbeing for me subsumes all of those possibilities.

Speaker 7:          00:09:42       Okay, well, so, so I focused on the suffering element I think as I've done in my own work because I actually think it's easier to zero in on in some sense, like I think it's easier for people. And I think you lay out the argument in the moral landscape kind of like this. I think it's easier perhaps to gain initial agreement between people on what might constitute a generalized ethic to concentrate on what we don't want. I'm not saying that what we do want is unimportant, but it seems to me to be harder to get a grip on. We don't want to Auschwitz, we don't want to go like archipelago. So. And

Speaker 8:          00:10:13       there are those and I would add to just closing the door to moral relativism here. Those who do want Auschwitz are wrong to want Auschwitz. I mean, obviously it's only happened because some people did want Auschwitz, not the victim side, but the perpetrator side. And so crucially for me is the claim that I'm a realist. I'm a moral realist and realism means is that it's that there are right and wrong answers to the question of this kind and, and you can not know what you're missing. In fact, we almost certainly don't know what we're missing on questions of human value. And then our job is to discover just how good life can be and just what variables are making it needlessly horrible and to, to mitigate all of that and live in a, in a better and better world.

Speaker 7:          00:11:00       Well, so. Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:11:01       so,

Speaker 7:          00:11:05       okay, so, so that's, that's a lot of points of agreement. So I also believe that there is a catastrophe of, of arbitrary moral injunction and that there is a catastrophe of moral relativism and that, that, that has to be dealt with and that there are genuine differences between the proper way of behaving morally and the improper way of behaving morally. And I think that they are grounded in human human universals, even though there's a wide amount of variation so that that's a lot of points of agreement, right? So we know that there's two things we want to avoid. We conceptually speaking, which is the most moral relativism in this kind of moral absolutism that's grounded in an arbitrary statement of facts that you identify with religious fundamentalism. I would identify that with fungilin fundamentalism more generally, not, not with religious fundamentalism per se, because I see it also happening, happening in secular states, let's say like Nazi Germany or or, or so. It doesn't seem to be religious fundamentalism per se. That's crucial to your argument.

Speaker 8:          00:12:08       No, it's not. Just to close the loop on that, the only reason why I would focus on religion in particular there is that religion is the only language game where in fundamentalism and of dogmatism, dogmatism is not a pejorative concept. A Dogma is a good word, and specifically within Catholicism and the notion that you must believe things on faith that is in the absence of compelling evidence that would otherwise cause a rational person to believe it. That in a religious context is considered a feature, not a bug elsewhere. We recognize it to be a bug and that's why the

Speaker 7:          00:12:46       focus on. Okay, so, so, so. All right. So is it reasonable to assume that the associate, we've already established, at least in principle, that there's an association between the totalitarian regimes, let's say, and a dog and dogmatism, dogmatism that characterize his religious belief. What do you think, although it, at least in principle, the secularist totalitarian states and the religious fundamentalists, totalitarian states do different, one important regard, which is that the religious types ground their axioms in God and the secular totalitarian types don't. And so there's got to be something about totalitarianism per se that's independent of, that's associated with religious belief in the manner that you just described, but that's not particularly associated with the belief in God. There's something that makes them, it's a commonality between them. And so do you have any sense of what that might be?

Speaker 8:          00:13:38       Well, I, I think one has to acknowledge that there's something uniquely pernicious, at least potentially about religious beliefs because they have the other worldly variable, the supernatural variable. The, uh, you're gonna get everything you want after you die. So this life doesn't matter. Issue that, that allows for a kind of misbehavior that is especially.

Speaker 7:          00:14:09       Okay. So, so it seems that, so that the claim would be that if you, if you put forward axiomatically your claim that God exists, then you can use that claim to justify whatever arbitrary atrocities your system might throw off.

Speaker 8:          00:14:24       Yeah, I guess the only point I was making there is that not all dogmas are created equal and some dogmas are on their face more dangerous and more divisive.

Speaker 7:          00:14:32       Right? But what I'm curious about specifically is because it seems to me that the dogmas of the USSR and the dogmas of Nazi Germany where as pernicious as any religious dog dogmas and they may also share important features with pernicious religious candles, but it isn't clear to me from your perspective what those commonalities would.

Speaker 5:          00:14:51       Well, so I mean in some ways your recapitulated in an argument I've made, and this is an argument that I would make against you. Were you declaim as you've had you have elsewhere that, that atheism is responsible for the greatest atrocities of the 20th century. The idea that Stalin, Ism and Nazi-ism and fascism were expressions of atheism simply doesn't make any sense in the case of fascism and Nazis, and it doesn't make any sense because the fascists and the Nazis, by and large, we're not even atheist, mean Hitler wasn't an atheist and he was talking about executing a divine plan and he got lots of support from the churches and the Vatican did nothing to stop him. And Fascism as you know, a coexisted quite happily with Catholicism in Croatia and Portugal and Spain and Italy. So, but even in the case of stolen, what was so wrong with that situation was where all of the ways in which it's so resembled a religion. You had a personality cult. You had dogmatism, uh, that, uh, held sway to a point where apostasy and blasts with me, we're killing offenses. You know, that the people who, who, who didn't toe the line were eradicated and you know, so and so to take a more modern example, North Korea is a religious cult. It just doesn't happen to be a one that is focused on the next life or, or, you know, supernatural claims.

Speaker 7:          00:16:20       So what we imagined if. Okay, so what would be the defining characteristics of a religious totalitarian movement that would make it different from a nonreligious totalitarian movement?

Speaker 5:          00:16:30       Similar. Yeah. They may, yeah, they're very similar, but the problem is dogmatism. The overarching problem is believing things strongly on bad evidence and B, b, and the reason why dogmatism is so dangerous is that it is, it doesn't allow us to revise our bad ideas in real time through conversation. It is dogmas have to be enforced by force or the threat of force. Because the moment someone has a better idea, you have to shut it down in order to preserve your dog.

Speaker 7:          00:16:58       Okay. Okay. So, so the commonality seems to be something like claims of absolute truth at some level that can't be, that you're no longer allowed to discuss. Yeah. Okay. And so, okay, so that's another point of agreement. Then I would say, because part of the reason that I've been, let's say a free speech advocate, although I don't think that's the right way of thinking about it, just because I think of free discourse, the discourse that we're engaged in as the mechanism that corrects totalitarian excess or dogmatic excess, and so I also think that systems of governance that are laying themselves out properly have to evaluate, have to elevate the process by which dogmatic errors are corrected over the dogmas themselves, which is why I think the Americans are right, say with regard to their first amendment is the process of free speech is the process by which dogmatic errors are rectified. And so it has to be put at the pinnacle, the hierarchy of values.

Speaker 5:          00:17:51       I think you and I totally agree about the primacy of free speech.

Speaker 7:          00:17:54       Okay. Okay, good. Okay, so that's another.

Speaker 4:          00:17:58       Thank you.

Speaker 7:          00:18:03       Okay, so then we could think there's

Speaker 9:          00:18:05       point that we should just a lock in our gains here. It sounds like what you're saying is that the reason to fear religious dogma is really on the dogma side and not the religion side, which at least leaves open the possibility that something could exist over on the religion side that doesn't have that characteristic. Right. That often they travel in tandem, but that the thing to fear is not the religious belief. It is the dogmatic nature of the way it is.

Speaker 5:          00:18:34       The other way to say that is the only thing that's wrong with religion is the dogmatism. If you get rid of the dog, I've got no problem with the buildings and the music and the and the

Speaker 7:          00:18:43       Dan's and. Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. That's not a trivial. It's not a trivial point and it's not just a joke because the buildings and the music are very important parts of their religious process and so I know, I know there's a humorous element to that, but it's not like Sam is throwing out the baby with the bathwater there

Speaker 5:          00:19:02       and to go further than that. I've got no problem. In fact, I'm deeply interested in the phenomenology of spiritual experience, so, so whatever experience, someone like Jesus had, whoever he was historically or any of the other, uh, Matriarchs and Patriarchs of the world's religions, that phenomenology is subjectively real. I mean, that is diverse. I'm not saying everyone's had the same experience, but there are changes in consciousness that explain both how religions have gotten founded by their founders and the experiences people have had in the presence of those people or by following their methodologies that seemed to be confirming of the dog. But that got, that grew up around those traditions. And My, my issue is that whatever is true about us spiritually, whatever opportunity being born to this universe actually presented a matter of, of consciousness, a spiritually, that truth has to be deeper than accidents of culture. And just mere historical contingency is the fact that somebody was born in, in Mesopotamia and not in China and got a different language game. Uh, so whatever is true, there has to be understood in universal terms about the nature of human psychology and the human mind.

Speaker 7:          00:20:25       Okay. So, so now another thing that I wanted to just point out obliquely and then I want to return to outlining maybe where we agree is that one of the things that was really shocking to me, I would say was the my reading of what was originally Jane Goodall's discovery about chimp behavior. You know, because there is this idea that is really in Rousseau in thinking that the reason that people committed atrocities in the service of their group identity, let's say their tribal identity was because culture had corruptive. So it was a uniquely human thing. But then of course good all showed in the 19 seventies that the chimps at Gombe, I think I'm pronouncing that correctly, would go and raiding parties. Right. And so there'd be like four or five adolescent chimps, usually male, sometimes with a female in there. They would patrol the borders of their territory if they found an interloper on the border near the border from another troop, even if it was a member of their troop that had immigrated, so to speak, and that they knew that they had had some history with.

Speaker 7:          00:21:30       They would tear them to pieces. And of course that was shocking to good old buddy and my understanding is she had some trepidations about publishing it, although she did, but then that's been noted repeatedly in other forms of behavior. So see, I've been really interested in the commission of atrocity in the surface of belief, and it's tempting to pin that say on on Dogma and then to associate that with religious dogma. I think that's all tempting, but the fact that chimps do it shows that it can't be a consequence of something like religious belief unless you're willing to say that the reason that chimps commit a trustee in the service of their truth and their territory is because chimps are religious and so they're not religious and they don't really hold a secular totalitarian viewpoint, but they act out. They still act out the atrocity element. That's characteristic of human behavior. And so to me, that makes the problem deeper than one of mirror, let's say surface statements surface.

Speaker 5:          00:22:29       It's of metaphysics. The obviously the problem of primate aggression, which we've inherited along with the Shims, is deeper or at least different than the problem of religious violence or, or totalitarian political structure is that, okay, get the worst out data people. So, uh, I mean we have, we have these primate capacities that we have to correct for and we're busily trying to correct for almost everything that we've have been evolved to do and we're not w w we don't like the state of nature for good reason. And virtually everything that's good about human life is born of our, I would argue, culture based and, and highly intelligent, unnecessary effort to, to mitigate what is in fact natural for us and that, and there's nothing more natural than tribal violence, which you have the source. You're, you're describing a chance.

Speaker 7:          00:23:22       Okay. So, so then it also seems like we agree that the core element of tribal alliance, which would have its roots say and in the chimpanzee proclivity to, or it's analog and the chimpanzee proclivity to identify with the dominance hierarchy of the troop is something that's a source of the proclivity for human social aggression. That's independent of it's at in independent of any obvious religious substrate. So there are other reasons for group belief and the Commission of a trustee that can't be directly attributed to two religious dogma.

Speaker 5:          00:23:56       What most worries me about religion and I was able to obviously religion can channel these primal urges in unhappy ways so you can get tribal violence that gets amplified by religious dogmatism and that should trouble everyone, but it's not unique to religion is also nationalism and his racism and his other kinds of dogmatism. But what most worries me are those cases where clearly good people who are not necessarily captured by tribalism per se, uh, are doing the unthinkable based purely on religious doctrines that they believe wholeheartedly with without good evidence. So you have the person who joins isis who wasn't even Muslim before they converted, you know, 16 months ago. And they go all the way down the rabbit hole to the, the most doctrinaire, most committed, most uncompromising view of just how you have to live in this world. If you're going to be Muslim and they join isis based on the idea that salvation only goes one way and the dine and defends it, the one true faith is the best thing that can happen to you.

Speaker 5:          00:25:09       There's no question that there are individuals who have made that journey. In fact, there are individuals by the thousands who have made that journey and they're far more benign versions of that. There are people who just waste their lives. I would argue converting to whatever the belief system is and just wasting a lot of time worrying about hell or warning about the fact that their child is gay and the, you know, the creator of the universe doesn't approve of that, and Oh, there are all kinds of suffering that striked me as truly unnecessary born. Not of, again, apelike urges, but ideas that any rational person would if believed, would, would follow to that same terminus. I mean, the thing is if you buy, if you buy the fact again to take Islam as as a current example, if you buy the claim that the Koran is the perfect word of the creator of the universe, never to be superseded by anything humanity does now or a thousand years from now that commits a rational per that then then the exercise of human reason is bounded by this I would argue pathological frame which leads to certain outcomes that we should really worry us.

Speaker 7:          00:26:25       So let's take that claim apart for a minute because that's not your claim specifically the claim that you were describing. See because that's. That's really not the claim that religious fundamentalists make. The claim they make is worse than that because they claim that the Koran or the Bible for that matter is the literal word of God, but more than that, they claimed that their understanding of that word is correct. Which means they conflate two things. Because you could imagine a situation where you had a book, and I'm not saying this is the case. It's an imaginative exercise where you had a book that had all the answers that was extraordinarily complicated and so that when you read it, it wouldn't be obvious that you understood it or perhaps it wouldn't be obvious that you didn't understand it either, but you're not going to be able to. You can't get an interpretive version of the book, and so the fundamentalists claim is far worse. It's that not only is there an absolute reality truth embedded in the book, but that their particular take on that absolute reality is the absolute take on that book. So they conflate their own. They, they, they make an assumption of their own omniscience and then pass that off quantic

Speaker 5:          00:27:39       yeah, except in their defense, and I don't often rise to the defense of fundamentalist.

Speaker 5:          00:27:46       It's, it's very easy to get there because some of the claims in the book are not at all hard to parse. In fact, many of them can only be honestly interpreted one way. So to take again an example that will be not inflammatory to you but makes the point. It just says that the remedy for theft in the Koran is to cut the hands off a thief, me that you, that that is the unambiguous injunction. It's not an allegory, so the you have to. You have to dodge some kind of tortured interpretive scheme to avoid the that the shocking fact that the creator of the universe, he thinks you should live this way for, for all time, and people like Isis. I mean this is my claim, is this most of what is in these books and this is what worries me about those books because they can't be edited. Most of what's in the books is clearly not the best that humanity is capable of in the ethical domain or in the

Speaker 3:          00:29:03       so

Speaker 5:          00:29:05       and and so and so clearly, and this is true for morality, most pressingly, but it's true for science, is true for economic, is true for anything else that we, we are wise to pay attention to. Say Slavery is condoned in the Bible in both testaments and in the Koran. There's no getting away from that. Now you can say, well, it's not the central thrust of any of these books, but if you, if you go to the books and try to figure out what the creator of the universe wants with respect to the owning and needless immiseration of other people, right? He expects you to keep slaves and he's told you how to do it. You know, don't knock out their eyes and their teeth.

Speaker 5:          00:29:48       You don't take if you're a Muslim, don't take other Muslims as slaves, but it's not an accident that the people who joined Isis thought that it was absolutely kosher to take slaves to take sex slaves, and they were even there. Their use of their sex slaves was conducted as a sacrament and that's not an accident. I mean, they weren't getting grain over there that the Fed girls before they raped them. So these, this is not unlike what many people expect. It's not that this doctrine is being used as a pretext for people who would otherwise do terrible things like take sex slaves and raped them. And so there's no net damage being done here by this belief system. No, these are. I would argue in many cases, psychologically normal people who are simply convinced of the absolute veracity of these ideas and and in in this case that the perfect example of Mohammed as the most self actualized human who's ever existed and what did Mohammed Mohammed Hooks.

Speaker 5:          00:30:58       Excellent, so you know, he and he's an and then once you, once you grant that, and this is, I mean this is where there's a tension between both how we pursue the same goals as we've just established. We have many of the same goals, but in so far as you make religion look palatable in so far as you suggest to your audience that they can. They can have their religious cake and eat it too. They can, they can have their reason. They can have their respect for science. They can have a 21st century worldview, but they can also hold on to everything they love and Christianity or fear to lose. And it's undoubtedly mostly Christianity, but whatever, any religion. My concern is that it keeps us shackled to these iron age philosophies and these iron age conversations where we should be having a 21st century conversation about everything. Ethics included. Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:32:05       Okay. So, so, but I want to ask you a little bit about your feeling about weight before. Before you move on, I want to get each of you to clarify something so that we know we're where we are. So Sam, you said the problem here is that the dogma can't be updated, right? That slavery is with us permanently because it's written into the dogma, but clearly most of the traditions in which it's written into the holy book don't practice slavery. And the people who, uh, who adhere to these belief systems wouldn't defend slavery. So clearly there is the capacity, an update mechanism,

Speaker 8:          00:32:40       but not really. I mean, they've been forced. It had beaten out of them, right? I mean, we, we fought a civil war in the US to get rid of slavery as Christians who abolished slavery in England though, was that it was Christians who were at the forefront of the movement to abolish Christians on either side of everything. I mean there's, there's no one else to do the job, but that's the update with specifically Christians who were using their Christian belief as a justification for slavery. The problem was they were actually on the

Speaker 5:          00:33:13       losing side of a theological argument and it would be much better. I think you would agree if one of the 10 commandments had been, don't keep slaves.

Speaker 4:          00:33:24       Yeah. I mean there's certainly one week of swap out for that one, so

Speaker 5:          00:33:30       it would've been much easier for Christians to have fought against slavery and it's much harder for Muslims frankly, to to fight against it. Now. The problem is, is that there's a point I made, I think in my first book, is that the, the doors leading out of this kind of fundamentalism don't open from the inside. They get bashed open from the outside and it's, it's, it's humanism and it's secularism and it's scientific rationality that has exerted such pressure, such winnowing pressure on Christianity, you know, now for multiple centuries that that's why we're not encountering the Christians of the 14th century on a daily basis. The way that we, we are essentially encountering Muslims of the 14th century, a not only in the Middle East, but in our own societies in terms of their intuitions about how we should all live, right. I mean, the fact that zero percent of UK Muslims think homosexuality is acceptable, right? Zero percent, but there's almost no question you can come up with the where we could pull this, this, this society and say, do you think that that the lizard king is his living in the Oval Office,

Speaker 8:          00:34:42       you, you, you never get a zero percent response to any

Speaker 4:          00:34:45       poll question. Right? But

Speaker 5:          00:34:50       if you ask Muslims on the streets of London, is homosexuality morally acceptable? Apparently you can find no one who says it is. That's shocking and it's not an accident. Right? And it would be much easier if the book actually said, actually you can love anyone you want and it's not a problem.

Speaker 9:          00:35:08       It is. It is shocking. But I think you know, there's a reason that you keep finding yourself at Islam, which may be the slowest to update for reasons that may be ancient, but I want to do that. That is a useful.

Speaker 5:          00:35:24       I can't do it for Christianity. I just want to make the. I want to make the point as cleanly and as undistracted loudly as possible. But yeah, it made it's true. I have the same kinds of concerns about Christianity or mormonism or or anything else.

Speaker 8:          00:35:38       And they're all. The point is they're all different and there's no reason to be because Islam to take the case where it's fine. Islam doesn't represent any impediment to stem cell research. Right? Because they just don't think that, that, that the design of the fertilized ovum is immediately and sold. They wait. It's 40 days or 80 days, 120 days depending on what you believe. So it's just that never came up when we were all complaining about how religion, in this case Orthodox Judaism and Christianity and in the states was posing and impediment to embryonic stem cell research.

Speaker 9:          00:36:12       Okay. Hold on. I wanted to ask you a clarifying question to same level. Would you agree that there are things written into these religious texts that are unambiguously unacceptable viewed through a modern lens and not because the texts are so complicated that we have misunderstood something, but there are things that are just written in there that we now understand to be wrong.

Speaker 7:          00:36:36       Okay. So, so the first thing,

Speaker 7:          00:36:40       the first thing I would say is that we have to be very careful about equating all the religious texts and I do actually think that you are careful about that, but that's something we can have a discussion about a little bit later. I agree with you there. So, so because you know, for, for a lot of my life I was, I would say more interested in the universal truths expressed in religious belief across different cultures. But I've become more and more aware of the important distinctions between the religious cultures maybe in the last 10 years. So it isn't clear to me that you can just throw all religious dictum dicta in the same bucket and there may be complex reasons for that. So, you know, one question which you kind of sent it, Sam already, is, do you see a hierarchy of unacceptability between different religious doctrines? You active. Okay, fine, fine, fine. So, okay, now, but here, here's an interesting issue and I think we're starting to zero in on. We've covered what we agreed on a lot of it, but there's another way to answer a question because I think. Sorry,

Speaker 4:          00:37:47       sorry,

Speaker 7:          00:37:48       I answered the first half of it. The second part is I think that this is where I'm going to sound like a postmodernist, which I really hate.

Speaker 7:          00:38:04       I would say sentence by sentence. Yes, you're correct. Paragraph by paragraph perhaps. But here's, here's the problem with complicated texts, especially ones that actually constitute narratives. So imagine, imagine this. So imagine you're at a movie and it's a movie with a twist at the end. And so the entire movie is set up to make you think one particular way and to have one set of experiences, but when you put the twist at the end, it changes the entire structure. And so this is the one of the complex problems that actually led to the rise of postmodern interpretations of literature, which is that if you take a complex narrative, there's a very large number of ways of interpreting it and it isn't self evident which of those are canonically correct. We can deal with that horrible issue later, but. But it's a good objection and it's true.

Speaker 7:          00:39:00       And what it does is it makes these sorts of things quite complicated because in the Bible is a series of books and they had influence on one another and they were sequenced with a very complex editorial process and there's actually a developmental narrative that links all the chapters together. And what that means. This is at least I'm going to speak from the perspective or in terms of analysis of the Christian Bible. What it means is that you have to read the beginning as if it's also influenced by the end, which is what, by the way, in case you think that I'm weaseling around here and I'm not, is that that's exactly what you do. Every time you read any story, any work of fiction, you say, well, you're claiming that the Bible is a work of fiction. It's like, don't don't. That's, that's just a cheap objection.

Speaker 7:          00:39:54       That's not my point. My point is that it's a narrative and everything in a narrative is conditioned by all the rest of the things in the narrative and it is well known. Like if you're a screenwriter, for example, there's an old dictum, remember who generate it was one of the great Russians that if there's a a rifle lying on a table in the first scene, that it better be used by the end of the second scene or it shouldn't have been there at all. So there's this coherence. I'm looking for the rifle in your answer to this question, one overused. My point is is that it isn't reasonable to take a single sentence out of a coherent narrative and say that stands on its own or it's rarely reasonable because you have to interpret the word in the sentence and the sentence in the paragraph and the paragraph in the chapter and the chapter in the context of the entire book. You have to do that now you could object and reasonably so that there are some sentences that are so blatant that you can't use context to to what paraphrase them, let's say, but I think you also have to give the devil his due that the Christian Bible is a developmental narrative and the beginning has to be read in light of the end and that's a. that's a. that's a fact.

Speaker 9:          00:41:04       So what does that do to Moses's laws of war? This is not a narrative. This is instructions about what to do when you invade a foreign land. If you intend to take over that land, you kill every break, right? There are other rules in there about killing husbands and taking the wives. Yeah, the old testaments are brutal document. Absolutely brutal. And so my point would be, I don't know that reading that portion, um, in

Speaker 10:         00:41:34       light of the end, even if you call the end of the New Testament, I don't know that it changes Moses's laws of war and their acceptability while you take the new testament. Seriously. It does because it's a suit. It's a document that supersedes it. And I think there's actually technical reasons but superseded.

Speaker 8:          00:41:51       I mean, this is the problem. Slavery is a very straightforward case because clearly the, the, the Bible thumpers of the South who were defending slavery with reference to the text felt they were on firm ground. And I would just, I would invite anyone to read what the New Testament and the Old Testament say about slavery to see that they were on fairly firm ground. That the balance of the, of the honest reading was on the side of clearly we can, we can keep slaves, right? Jesus. Jesus. Jesus never envisioned a world without slavery. And he admonished slaves to serve their masters well and to serve their Christian masters especially. Well,

Speaker 10:         00:42:29       the English Protestants wouldn't have agreed with that because like I said, they were at the forefront of the fight against slavery. Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:42:35       Clean influenced by something outside the text. And this is began as you're making this harder than it is. And my concern is why?

Speaker 10:         00:42:45       Right? But I don't think I am Sam, because I think that the fundamental message in the New Testament for example, is that so

Speaker 8:          00:42:53       the old hat, if we Jews are in possession of a book that has some diabolical passages that would be better left out.

Speaker 10:         00:43:04       You're not going to offend me. I'm Jewish. It's not like it's in the old testament itself and the Jewish Bible. There's, there's also the seeds of the same tension. So for example, there's a tension and this would be attention that's of interest to you because you, you stated quite clearly in your book, in the moral landscape that you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater with regards to at least to religious phenomenology. You said that, for example, I still considered the world's religions to be mere intellectual, runes maintained at enormous economic and social costs. But now I understood that important psychological truths can be found in the rubble while I'm trying to find the important psychological truths in the rubble and so and so, but, but we have to decide also if we agree about that. Like are there important psychological truth to be found in the rubble? Oh, absolutely. Okay, so so then we can. But

Speaker 8:          00:43:55       the problem with revelation that this notion of revelation, this notion that some books weren't written by smart people, they were written by God, allows you confines you to taking the whole tax, even though the text was cobbled together over centuries and some for whole centuries, but some books we're in the new testament and then they got thrown out the centuries later and some books weren't in and then got put in. So it's like it's an all too human process that got us these books in the first place. But once they were set to believers, imagine that you're stuck with every passage and there are passages in the old testament. Tell you to stone up a girl or a woman who's not a virgin on her wedding night. Take her to her. Father's doorstep and stone her to death. Right. And

Speaker 7:          00:44:40       probably agree that those are wrong. So yeah, there was another point, but you don't. You don't have to read the book to the end to know that it's wrong, but you can get. You can get that from the paragraph. Yeah, but that isn't what I said. I didn't say you had to read the end to the end of the book to know that it needed to end. You need it to read to the end of the book to contextualize those statements within the whole. I didn't know exculpatory.

Speaker 8:          00:45:03       There's no exculpatory context as to those kinds of statements and that's

Speaker 10:         00:45:07       there is in the Old Testament, there's a real. There's a real tension and this is. I think the tension that would be of interest to you is there's a tension between the dogmatic and the prophetic traditions and I think to the degree that you're interested in religious phenomenology, you find yourself on the side of the prophetic tradition and the prophetic tradition has implicitly in it, what would you call it? An implicit damnation of those dogmatic crew, those cruelly dogmatic rules. You see that emerge all the time,

Speaker 7:          00:45:36       well arguably in Christianity, I think going to see it clearly there in the old testament with the distinction between the once again

Speaker 8:          00:45:44       to Islam, but but every prophetic, the notion of prophecy is dangerous and worth worrying about. I mean the idea that any ancient book contains in it, a perfect description of rightly interpreted, however difficult to interpret it. If you're only smart enough, you could extract from this text a perfect window onto the future, right, and that that whole generations of people have lived by the lights of this cockamamie idea, right? That the world is going to end and it's empty and is going to be glorious, right? This is. This is at the center of most most eschatology is. It's just that the, when the wheels come off, totally right, that's on some levels the best thing that's ever going to happen because it's showing you that in this case, Jesus is going to come back and throw this enters into a lake of fire

Speaker 7:          00:46:36       and I've read to the end of the book is pretty scary at the end as well. I in revelation is, yeah, yeah, yeah, no kidding. Well, that's a really good objection,

Speaker 10:         00:46:45       but you know, like when I did my lectures on the Bible last year, I said they provided the psychological take on the biblical lectures and that's what I'm going to attempt to maintain here because I don't believe that I'm qualified to make fundamental metaphysical statements, but, but that, that, that scene, that's, that's limited out at the end of revelation. So that's a very interesting book read psychologically because what it is, and this is, we should talk about what we'll. Let me, let me, let me just address that. Only take a minute and I'll try to be succinct. So there's an idea that's expressed in that book is that it's something like things are always falling apart in a fundamental manner. It's part, it's built into the, there's an apocalyptic element to human life. We fail in small ways and we fail in catastrophic ways and everything that we have, we lose and we die.

Speaker 10:         00:47:40       So there's an societies come to an end. There's an apocalyptic element built into the structure of human reality and part of part of what's revealed in that strange book at the end, which is like a hallucinogenic nightmare in some sense, is that the hero is born at the darkest point in the, in the, in the journey, and it's a psychological truth and it's very, very apt because at at the darkest point, this is also why Christ is born near near the darkest time of the year. From a, from a, from a metaphysical perspective, there's an idea there that when things fall apart, that's the time for the birth of the hero and the hero in revelation is also the place where free. Where we're truthful speech most clearly manifests itself because in the Christian tradition, Christ is identified with truthful speech and so the notion there is that redemption under apocalyptic conditions is to be found in the revelation of truthful speech. Which is something that you actually believe.

Speaker 8:          00:48:33       Well, I believe in truthful speech, but I also believe that you can play this kind of interpretive game with almost any text. That this is this way.

Speaker 10:         00:48:43       But then you can do it with the world salmon. That wreaks havoc with your value from facts argument.

Speaker 8:          00:48:49       No, actually I didn't hear what you just said.

Speaker 10:         00:48:51       What was that? While I said you can. You can. You can make exactly the same objection with the world of facts is there's an infinite number of facts and there's an infinite number of potential interpretations and so pat tracking the pathway from the fact to a value is actually impossible. It's the same argument with regards to the local. We'll talk about that.

Speaker 8:          00:49:09       That I don't think that's a good analogy. I. There are more and less plausible interpretations of, of any situation, any data, and any text, arguably, but the problem is that you can. You can read into any story, some apparently meaningful set of psychological insights,

Speaker 10:         00:49:34       which, but you can do that with any set of facts too.

Speaker 8:          00:49:38       Well, no, I mean there's certain things you can't. You can't over interpret to your heart's content and come out any way you choose. My, my point is that the. First of all there are. This is why fundamentalism always has an edge over more quote, more sophisticated theology because the sophisticated theology is in, in most cases, inspired by a more and more modern recognition that what we can't read it literally because it either makes no sense or it makes barbaric sense, right? So we have to get away from the literal and the more you get away from the literal, the more you are unconstrained by the text and you can just broadcast on it. Anything you want to put there. And so, you know, the, the literal x, there's no question that most generations of Christians who read revelation expected the world to end in some literals sense of this kind of fat phantasmagoria.

Speaker 8:          00:50:38       I mean, there was, there was going to be a beast and it was. I mean, this is our, you know, undoubtedly they thought this was gonna happen in their own time, you know, under Rome. But, uh, this is a, you know, if you're going to go purely literary on any of these texts, you are, you on some level, you're playing tennis without a net. You're just, you're unconstrained by the text and you can do with it more or less anything you want. Isn't that, isn't that argument working at cross purposes with your other argument about. Well, no, because it's always tempting. First of all, there are lines that do not announce their, that they're susceptible to that interpretation. I mean, yes you can. You can say, listen, Allah does not want us to cut the hands off of thieves. He, he just, you know, he, he, he meant a, a cut the, the, you know, the, the hand of their volition rather than their actual hands.

Speaker 8:          00:51:34       Right? So you're, you're constraining them rather than kind of now. Sure. Undoubtedly there was some, some Muslim somewhere who wants to interpret it that way, but it gets harder and harder. The clearer the the line is. And the problem with all of these taxes that there are so many principles, again, I read revelation any way you want. It is still a problem that it it, it is perfectly rational on the basis of reading that text to expect the world to end and for Jesus Jesus to be the only savior of it. Therefore, if you happen to be born a Hindu or born a Muslim or or or born a Jew who doesn't recognize Jesus to be the Messiah, you are screwed.

Speaker 7:          00:52:18       Well, maternity is a funny thing though. I mean, it's a strange thing. Let's say that one of the things we already agreed on as far as I can tell is that the antidote to pathological dogmatism is, is free, truthful expression. Something like that. Is that? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, but one of the things I would say that's absolutely crucial to Christianity in particular is the notion that the thing that's redeeming is exactly that and it doesn't matter, so it's universal truth. Now, if we both agree on that, the idea that the free expression of truthful speech is the antidote, let's say both denialism and to totalitarianism. Then the notion that that might be embodied in something like the word, which is truly, I think the deepest of Christian ideas. It that why? How is that not the same claim? Now let. Let me elaborate more a little bit more, more, more completely.

Speaker 7:          00:53:14       So here, here's the strange thing. First of all, I agree with you by the way, about the danger of flying off the text. Write about as you move away from the text, your interpretation gets less and less constraint and I think it's also the same danger as move of moving away from the facts, which is I think why you want to ground values and facts. So I get that argument and I think it's accurate, but, but here's, here's something strange is that this notion that redemptive, that redemption is to be found in truthful speech is actually embodied in Christian mythology, let's say as a personality and not as an idea. It's actually something that you embody and act out. It's not just an idea and that's why there's an emphasis on the idea of the embodiment of the word in flesh. It's a very sophisticated idea.

Speaker 7:          00:54:00       I mean it's just, it's insanely sophisticated idea, so. And they will. And there's one more thing. Okay, so look you, you, you've made the case and I hope we can really get to this because this is the really tough part of our discussion I think is that you want to ground the world of values in something that's true. We can say objectively true, but let's just say true for a minute and I share that desire, but, but the problem is, is that I can't see, and you actually state this in your book, I can't see how you can interpret the world of facts without an a priori interpretive structure. And this is an old philosophical claim. It's not unique to me. It's, it's the claim of Khan, for example, that you can't get directly from the fact to the value because there's an interpretive framework that mediates between you and the fact that. So first of all, I'd like to know if you accept that proposition. And then the second question would be, if you do accept the proposition, then what's your understanding of the nature of the interpretive framework? Because I think it's best understood, at least in part as a personality or as a story for that matter. So

Speaker 8:          00:55:10       well, I think our intuition of truth, the intuition that there's a difference between fact and fiction or fact and fantasy, the intuition that we are in, we live in relationship to a common reality about which our understanding can converge, provided we're looking in the same direction with the same tools. I think that is certainly deeper than religion. It's not best captured by stories. Uh, it's, it. Even if it, even if you could, as a matter of historical fact, point to its roots in story and myth and religion, that's not an argument that it's now in the 21st century best captured by story and myth and religion. I think it's, it is a fundamental intuition to which our sanity, both personally and Inter subjectively is anchored me to lose a sense of objective reality is to lose the, the platform on which you can communicate with anyone and or, or, or rationally expect anything to happen a moment from now to think that your memory represents something about a prior state of the world and your beliefs represent something about a possible state in the future.

Speaker 8:          00:56:30       All of this is anchored to a sense that there's a difference between knowing something really and just imagining it, right? There's a difference between perception and hallucination and all of these distinctions are born of this, this intuition I think we do have clearly we have fundamental intuitions which, uh, are either impossible to analyze or can be analyzed with, with respect to only other intuitions which we, which we deem more rudimentary. Uh, we're upon which everything else we do as a matter of knowledge gathering and sensemaking is built. So the intuition that two plus two makes four, right? You know, you at some point you learn basic arithmetic and you learn what addition is. And it's demonstrated to you with objects and you're showing, you're showing, you take two apples and you take two more apples and then you have four apples. Look, just count them, uh, the, the intuition that, that can be generalized to any foreign objects, right? That it's not just a fact about apples, right? This is something that we are clearly designed to have their places where it might break down, right? They might break down and at the quantum level it might break down. And in areas where our intuitions fail, we recognize those failures in science and mathematics by, by recourse to other intuitions, which again, are unreliable. But so there is just this fact that we do pull ourselves up by our bootstraps. And that's not embarrassing. What's

Speaker 7:          00:58:09       the difference? What's the. And I'm not trying to trap you here, seriously, not so. So there might be mathematical intuition's a priorities, let's say identified time and spaces in a prior intuitions. But I think there's a third category of a prior intuitions that are in fact stories or their personalities or stories. So let, let me give you an example. So I'm going to do a quick rereading of the moral landscape. So because see, you talk about g dot Morris argument of infinite regress. If you claim that something's good and you equate it with something, you can also ask infinitely why the thing you're equating it with is good. Now it seems to me that the way that you step out of that argument, and correct me if I'm wrong here, as you tell this, you tell you tell a story. I'm not trying to be smart about that.

Speaker 7:          00:58:59       You tell two stories. You tell a story about someone who has an absolutely terrible life. They're in a, in a, in a jungle where nature is trying to kill them all the time and well, they're trying to be killed by nature. Wild nature is trying to kill them all the time. Horrible barbaric thugs are making their life miserable in every possible way. Okay, so that's one poll, let's say. And then another pool you identify and these are hypotheticals. So I guess they're fictions. That's one way of thinking about it. Even though they're extracted from real situations, they're there, they're met, have fictions there. Met a truths, that's another way of thinking about it. You contrast a good life and that's a life where the person has enough to eat and enough shelter and you know they have the things that you would expect people to want.

Speaker 7:          00:59:40       You say, this is a bad life and you say this is a good life, and so and then you say that's when you make a side move, which I would say is that that's an objectively verifiable fat. I would say. I don't think it is an objectively verifiable fact. I think it's a fundamental moral claim and I think that's where you put your stake in the ground and I would say when I read that, I thought, well, if you take your jungle story, which you've extracted from a bunch of horrors and compiled and you take your positive story, which you've extracted from a bunch of horrors or a bunch of of of Kwanzaa, utopias, let's say in compiled your two thirds of the way to a landscape of Hell and heaven while so then why not continue the abstraction and say, look, what we're really trying to avoid here is hell. We're really trying to move towards this heaven. Yeah, but. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:00:32       As soon as they do that, you name it. Just landscape. No, but my name for hell, this is very interesting because

Speaker 7:          01:00:45       like the,

Speaker 5:          01:00:49       you and I were talking, we were talking about this at dinner. We're talking about this at dinner and how the, the, the overlap or lack of overlap between our audiences and so like I just heard from your audience there and you might've heard from the odd convert, but, but what's amazing to me is so like I have to do some work to figure out what point they think you made because. Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second.

Speaker 4:          01:01:17       No, no. Hold on.

Speaker 5:          01:01:20       And I said if you're going to produce a fiction, why not go right to the end? So did produce a fiction. It's you, you can tell stories by way of communicating certain ideas. I mean that's obviously, I'm not saying stories aren't incredibly powerful and useful and inevitable, right? It's like we

Speaker 7:          01:01:39       wait, I think you are. You're not saying. You might not be saying that they're, that they're, they're not, they're not inevitable. But you are debating their utility and power because you know, you said that you don't need the story as an intern.

Speaker 5:          01:01:52       So now we have a few doors open here, which I think we should wait. We should extract the most out of these areas that we've touched and not run on something else. So I think there is to talk about the utility of story, right? Which is obviously the fact about the world and about human psychology that you're reading a lot into and more into that. I'm reading right? And the people we just heard from love that you.

Speaker 7:          01:02:18       Or maybe I'm reading more into it

Speaker 10:         01:02:19       than

Speaker 8:          01:02:20       that, but you talk a lot about the primacy of stories and you're trying to get me to admit that they are. That I even, I helplessly resort to storytelling to make my points right. Well I think is a good place for us to and I don't want us to get bogged down by. I think it's a good place for us to touch this topic of the distinction between the literal and metaphorical truth which you. I mean, you might want to introduce it, but I been [inaudible] that for in my mind that covers, this is different emphasis on stories.

Speaker 9:          01:02:52       Okay, briefly,

Speaker 10:         01:02:54       but we are, we are at, we are at

Speaker 9:          01:02:57       60 minutes and we had agreed to go an hour and 15 before we start q and a. So I agree that metaphorical truth is relevant here. Metaphorical truth is my argument that there are some things which are literally false, but if you behave as if they were true, you come out ahead of where you would if you behaved according to the fact that they are false sense that these things hover in a kind of intermediate space to call them false is, is incorrect.

Speaker 8:          01:03:25       Right? And, and, and I hear Jordan wanting to call them true because there are so useful,

Speaker 10:         01:03:32       but you also call it, look, this is what happens in the moral landscape. I think. Tell me about that. Tell me why I'm wrong, because I'm really trying to understand it. See, I think you dealt with Ge Moore's problem of infinite regress by by staking a moral proposition and your moral proposition was, look, here's a way things can be horrible and here's the way things can be good. Can we accept that this is horrible and this is good and that we should move towards good? And if the answer is yes, we can accept that, then we can proceed and maybe we can even proceed with extracting values from facts, but we have to accept that a priority presupposition first and you insist that we have to accept it because it's objectively true and I don't think that's correct. So

Speaker 8:          01:04:16       unlimited is get the proposition clear. So my argument is that the worst possible misery for everyone is bad. That's hell. That's hell is is the religious version of that. But I'm just. You can forget about religion or whether there's a god or anything else that we live in a universe that admits of the possibility of experience. I'm asking you to imagine a universe where every conscious mind, every mind that can have an experience is tuned to the worst possible experience for that mind. For as long as possible, so there's no silver lining, there is no. There are no lessons learned. Everything that can suffer, suffers as much as it possibly can for as long as they can. Now, that includes human beings, includes animals, and includes future ai that we might build that can suffer. It includes beings that we will never know about. Right? So my argument is that's bad.

Speaker 8:          01:05:15       If anything is bad, that's bad. Okay? We don't disagree that the hell is bad. If, if the word bad is going to mean anything that's bad and you can't say that's fine, but it's not a factual claim. No, it is is essentially it's a claim about. So I would argue to you, and again, it's hard to impart this intuition if someone doesn't share it, but if someone doesn't share this intuition, I have no way of interpreting any other word that comes out of their mouth after they admit they don't share this. So just imagine someone saying that doesn't make it a factual claim. Notes every. So again, you guys are going to get stuck here.

Speaker 1:          01:05:56       I think you're going to give us. Give us one more minute. Okay, one more. One more minute.

Speaker 8:          01:06:02       I don't think we'll get stuck here. Every claim, every claim we make about anything, at a certain point, if you trace all the tools we're using down to you, turtles all the way down to something that we can't explain and justify, right? This is true of physics as true of mathematics. I just said it was true of arithmetic. A good old proved it's true of arithmetic. I mean there's that. We have intuitions of truth that can't be cashed out by recourse to the system itself. Uh, and it's true. Morally, I would argue in this sense that yes, the worst possible misery for everyone is bad. And if you're going to say, well, who knows? Maybe it's good or bad. What does bad mean with a bad means? Bad things. Again, you guys are going to get stuck. What does bad I, I really, I really think that we're going to go down a rabbit hole here and this is a crucial issue. That's an absolutely.

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       Alright, so we're putting our. We have a mutiny here.

Speaker 8:          01:07:03       We're at, we're at war with our moderator. Give us two more minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       Okay, awesome. So let me. But what I mean honestly,

Speaker 8:          01:07:12       addiction, that two minutes we won't be any foreigners.

Speaker 1:          01:07:16       Okay, let's bet. I'll bet you

Speaker 8:          01:07:18       a dollar. You're literally playing devil's advocate here because you don't believe that it's that hell might be good. No, of course not. Okay, so it didn't say that so second. So you will agree that it's bad and this is an eight. I would argue that anything you would say, if you're going to use the word bad and good or better and worse or anything, any, make, any value, judgment about anything it will. Implicit in those judgments will be an acknowledgement whether you're going to acknowledge it or not. When I put the question to you that the worst possible misery for everyone is bad. You can't use the word bad unless you're not disagreeing in the least about that. So it's built into your good and bad in with respect to every other situation in life. Find. You know, if, if you, if you're going home tomorrow and you're a bus drives by and cuts your hand off and you say, well that was bad. It only makes sense with reference to this underlying claim. Well, it would be worse if the other hand got cut off too and everyone's hands.

Speaker 10:         01:08:24       You're beating a dead horse here, man. I agree with you.

Speaker 8:          01:08:27       So I'm saying that everyone assumes this epic whether they, whether they claim to or not. Okay. Okay. And so and to so to say, and this is, this is how I bring g Moore's argument to, to end the opera. He says his argument depends on it being intelligible at that point to say, well, is that really bad? Is it really bad? Okay, well, what would really band be if, if the worst possible misery for everyone didn't get you there, right? That there's no, there's no other space to occupy.

Speaker 10:         01:09:00       I'm also not disputing the utility of your move to bring g Moore's infinite regress to an end. I'm disputing something very specific. I'm disputing the issue that that's a factual claim. That's all bad. We should avoid it. It brings Moore's infinite regress to an end. All of that.

Speaker 8:          01:09:17       It's deeper than a factual claim. It's just a claim about the claim that is required to make any value, judgment intelligible, right? Any value judgment. So, so it's not an not an arithmetical claim. So an aeromedical claim about addition in this case is, is now you could say the same thing you could say when I say two plus two makes four, you could say, but is that a factual claim and there is some way of jiggering the way you talk about facts with respect to mathematics, because I. well, it's not a factual claim, but as it's an arithmetical claim, it's a mathematical claim. Well, I'm also not trying to organize our myosin this way.

Speaker 10:         01:09:59       Yep, fine. What I'm trying to do is to what I'm really trying to do, we need. See the problem I have with your argument and this isn't. I don't mean that you're wrong. I see what you're doing and I see why you're doing it. As far as I can tell, it's laudable, but for the problem is, is that as far as I can tell, there's problems it doesn't solve and there's other problems that leaves and address that don't have to be unsolved or unaddressed. And so one of the problems is this problem of the intermediary interpretive structure and you, you already said we need intuitions to guide our, our, our interrelationship with facts because we've already agreed on that. So the question is what are the nature of these intuitions? And I'm saying some of those intuitions take the place of stories, take the form of stories, but even more than that.

Speaker 10:         01:10:46       So I'm going to go after the health thing again. Okay. Because you said, well it's bad and you made sure that I also agreed with that, which I do. I agree with that. And then it's a point of profound agreement between you and I, like I've spent my entire life trying to understand why people get the worst things they could possibly imagine in the service of their dogmatic beliefs. And so I think that that's not good. Seriously. And I'm no fan of moral relativism, so we're, we're on the same page there now. But what I noticed when you wrote the moral landscape is you, you tell it, and I'm not trying to trap you, you, you tell a story about it looks to me like it's a story about heaven versus Hell essentially. Let me use that language momentarily. But it's also a story about good versus evil.

Speaker 10:         01:11:31       And this is why is because the question is, what's bad about hell? Now you say the suffering, it's like fair enough, man. True enough but not true, but not true enough. So what's also bad about how in addition to the actions that put you there, the malevolence that generation, okay, well that, that's part of the sufferings mean. Oh No, it's not. No, it's not. It's not the same as the suffering. It's not, it's not the having your hand cut off. It's the pleasure that's derived by the person who cut it off. And that is different. So. But that's part of my picture. But wait, it's an important distinction. That distinction is important.

Speaker 8:          01:12:17       Jordan, my picture of the moral landscape includes all of this. It includes everything that this is why I don't readily answer to the name of utilitarian or consequentialist because the way those those views tend to be taught, they tend to take as the in the in the tally of consequences. You leave out the psychological implications of being the sort of person who would, who would have sought those consequences or behaved that way. Right? So I would grant you, and this I'm explicit about this, whenever I talk about this, that part of the picture of any consequentialist discussion of wellbeing are it is everything about the human mind and social relationships and societies born of all the individuals living together, everything there that leads to different states of consciousness. So it's like like you having you having a negative intentions towards other people that give you that, that produce certain negative actions in the world.

Speaker 8:          01:13:24       They, those intentions themselves are part of the consequential picture. Those intentions themselves lead to close the door to certain kinds of positive mental states that you don't have. Let's say you. Let's say you don't have compassion because you wake up every morning just trying to figure out how to manipulate people. Well, not, not being able to feel compassion for other people is a bad thing for for many reasons. We could produce and if you get the usual consequentialist picture just looks at what's happening out in the world in terms of the body count and that's not, you know, that's. It's all part of this picture. It's all we're all talking. Anything that can possibly affect a conscious mind anywhere is part of the picture that I'm painting that I'm calling the moral landscape.

Speaker 10:         01:14:09       Okay? So I want you to let me step

Speaker 8:          01:14:11       in. I, I think we need to bring you somewhere.

Speaker 9:          01:14:16       Alright. I'm gonna Start with you sam. Okay. Let's swap out the idea of metaphorical truth for something a little harder headed heuristics, right? We have [inaudible]. We used them to perceive the world. They're often highly reliable. In fact, almost everything that you believed that lets you operate has to be a hero stick of some kind. I mean, if you decided to learn to drive and you got into the car and they said, okay, well it's all quarks out there, right? You need to understand how parks interact with each other, not useful, not useful, right? What you need, or some heuristics in which you can stipulate that there's something called a vehicle out there and you don't have to be overly precise about what it is and you learn to avoid it. Okay? The heuristics vary a lot in quality. Some of them are really good. The periodic tables are really good.

Speaker 9:          01:15:05       Okay? Um, the idea of a gravitational potential energy is kind of crappy, right? If I have a phone on a table here, I can tell you how much potential energy it has by measuring its mass and its distance from the ground. But if I've got a whole, at one depth on one side of the table and another depth on the other side of the table, I can't calculate it because it's a crappy heuristic. Works well enough in regular stuff. Now, here's the question. What if these religious texts are heuristics? Through which most people simplify calculations that they are in no position to do based on the limited amount that they are capable of perceiving, the amount that they understand about the things that are in play. So they're deploying these heuristics may be to reduce, um, things that degrade wellbeing. If it were true that religious heuristics increased wellbeing by allowing people to actually on average operate in the world in a way that, that increased wellbeing, what would you say about them that?

Speaker 8:          01:16:07       Well, I would worry much less about them obviously, and that's why I don't treat all religions equally there their religions I literally never think about because I'm not seeing the daily casualties of those belief systems.

Speaker 9:          01:16:21       So. But you say that as people get away from fundamental versions of these things, and I'm not advocating for fundamentalism here, but you say yourself as people get away from the fundamental versions of these things, things tend to go haywire and so in, in essence what you're saying

Speaker 8:          01:16:39       that lap tend to go haywire and one says, well, I thought I was interpreting multiplicity of interpretations, right? Well, yeah, but so people are in search of better or heuristics. I think the pressure is, some of these heuristics are obviously so bad that there's, there's civilizational pressure to find better interpretation and, and, but you said that the fundamentalists have an advantage. What is that advantage? Because if you just go back to the text and say, listen, I just want to understand what these words mean, right? You get the first pass the quote literal interpretation, right? And you're not bringing the armamentarium. You, you've brought your, you've got from the outside, from other parts of culture to Parse the tax. You're just trying to, if it's an English and you speak English, you're just trying to decode the words. Right? And when it says, if your, if your girl is not a virgin on her wedding night, take her to her father's doorstep and stone her to death. That you know what stone means, you know what girl means, you know what father means and you're, you're 90 percent there to uh, an obvious atrocity.

Speaker 9:          01:17:49       I get the horror of it and we'll get to that in a second. But, um, but the basic point is to say that the fundamentalists have an advantage, is to acknowledge something functional about those stories which I'm claiming are going to be some kind of evolutionary heuristic for living a life. Does that make him defensible?

Speaker 8:          01:18:09       They have an advantage. It's an advantage that it's an advantage. It's a, it's a mimetic advantage. It's an advantage that isis has the advantage when, when, when the people who, who share their interpretation of Islam, they slightly, it's why someone like Anwar, Allah, locky could, could make youtube videos that so many people found compelling. It's because it's, it's totally straightforward. Like the advantages. Listen that a lot of people spending a lot of time lying to you about what these books mean and what the profit and how he lived. Right? I, you, you, you know, in your heart that my interpretation of this is correct. You just read the words, right? And there's a strength in that. There's a, there's an honesty in that. There's a, there's a, it's just, it's clear when it says sacrifice a goat, goat means goat, right? Like you, you don't have to do something else to make goat meat having nothing to do with goat. Right? And so that it's, it's an. It's an asymmetric war of, of if you're going to try to make your dog knows more and more palatable by importing stuff that clearly was never even in the worldview of anyone who birthed these religions. You're playing, you're not doing that because you want to live even more by God's word. No. You found some of God's words unacceptable. Right? And that's an every fundamentalist can sniff that out and the right to sniff it out because in fact it is in fact the motivation.

Speaker 9:          01:19:42       Okay, good. So I think we have. We've got a tenuous kind of agreement that there might be some kind of utility that that utility might be morally questionable sometimes, but that there is some reason that people would resort to a fundamental, simple interpretation because as they depart from that interpretation, things get more difficult and to create some kind of disadvantage. While the part of the problem with that would be that as you move away from the texts, you fractionate

Speaker 10:         01:20:08       the moral belief system and you end up with a nihilistic city situation. So as you move away from dogmatism, you move towards the parallel danger, which is moral relativism and nihilism. And so hopefully you can find some ballots. So

Speaker 9:          01:20:21       let me ask you to know. I want to ask you a question. Oh yes. Okay. And also what time do we actually start this 10? I just missed the timecard but I think we have another couple of minutes. So

Speaker 10:         01:20:34       no objective reality to time. I think actually it's a pretty good conversation we could have, but. Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:20:42       So here's my question for you is if we agree that there is some way in which religious texts carry some kind of value because they allow people to figure out how to navigate their lives in ways that might reduce suffering, reduced the complexity of the choices that they have to make. Presumably you will agree that that would be consistent with an evolutionary interpretation that the fact that the stories themselves are functional would provide an advantage to those who were deploying them. Yes, so here's the problem, isn't it then also true that those stories are responsive to past environments and so the claim that these things might be timeless would be suspect and in fact you would expect a spectrum of durability. Some stories would be right in a brief moment and all that's true. All that's true. So far so good. Well, so far so good. This is. This is actually, I think quite excellent then because what we have is a recognition that there is something to these belief systems that has to do with practical realities in the past and we also have an acknowledgement that we cannot trust in these things based on simple faith because even if they aren't can be certain to have worked at some point in the past. We don't know what their relevance is to the president.

Speaker 10:         01:22:11       Right. Okay. Fair enough.

Speaker 10:         01:22:21       That's an I would say that's. That's two things about that. That's exactly why we're having this discussion and you see what happens in the most profound of such texts is the idea that the process by which your knowledge is updated has to occupy a position in the hierarchy of values that supersedes your reliance on dogma is the fundamental claim. That's why, for example, in Christianity, the notion is is that the word is the highest values and that's embodied word and that's the thing that mediates between order and chaos and everything else has to be subject to that and I would say that's not a claim that's unique to. So for example,

Speaker 8:          01:23:06       I think because we're, we're being, we're being told we're out of time here, so I want to give Sam his reaction to that as well and then we'll move on to q and a. I'm tempted to just asked Jordan the question here. I know this, it's hard to know what to save for tomorrow night, but I feel like we've got 3000 people sitting here who would really like an answer to this question. You say you believe in God, you have been. No, I say I act as if he exists, you'd say what I say, I act as if he exists a much more precise claim. Okay, so. So then what, what? But in this case what. So you act as though God exists and in addition I've heard you say that I act as though God exists, that I can't really be an atheist so far. We'll see that the night is young.

Speaker 8:          01:24:10       So in that sense I'm not really an atheist. I've, I've heard you say this, some of you is. Well, if I were really an atheist I would be far more poorly behaved and in fact I am right. I would be like risk on the cough committing murders and assuming there was nothing wrong with it more, it would be more likely. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So. So that's a big distinction I need to know more likely. What was that? It's a big distinction that you would, is very different than it would be more likely. Taking the safety off the gun is not the same thing as shooting it. Right. The temptations laid open to risk and would be more at hand. Okay. Just as they were to him. So what in that. So in what sense do you mean? What is the God that you act as though he, she it exists, and what is the what? What is the God shaped thing I must have in my life to prevent me from being a quote real atheist?

Speaker 7:          01:25:10       Well, okay. First of all, I have to point out that there's no possible way I can answer both those questions in two minutes.

Speaker 8:          01:25:16       Well, it's the same question. Like what? What do you mean by God?

Speaker 7:          01:25:20       Okay. Well, I'm going to tell you some of the things that I mean by God.

Speaker 11:         01:25:25       We do have to get the quizzes. I'm going to do this tomorrow. Maybe this is where we start.

Speaker 3:          01:25:31       Well, that was

Speaker 11:         01:25:33       pretty resentful. I seems like that constitutes an audience question, wouldn't you say? I tell you what, I'll tell you what, let's let's do this, but let's be deliberate about time.

Speaker 7:          01:25:49       Okay? Okay. Okay. Well, I'm, I'm, I'm going to read some things that I wrote because it's so complicated that I'm not sure that I can just spin it off the top of my head. And so you'll have to excuse me. So, and what I'm going to do is sort of paint a picture by by, by highlighting different things. So now are already made. One point here, I made the point that part of the conception of God that underlies the western ethos is the notion that whatever God is expressed in truth, the truthful speech that rectifies pathological hierarchies and that isn't all it does, it also confronts the chaos of being itself and generates habitable order. That's a, that's the metaphysical proposition, and that that's best conceptualized as at least one element of God. And so I would think about it as a transcendent reality that's only observable across the longest of timeframes.

Speaker 7:          01:26:42       The longest have iterated timeframes to your point. So, so, okay, so here's, here's some propositions and they're complicated and they need to be unpacked. So I'm just going to read them and that'll have to do for the time being. So God is how we imaginatively and collectively represent the existence and action of consciousness across time, as the most real aspects of existence manifest themselves across the longest of timeframes, but are not necessarily apprehensible as objects in the here and now. So what that means in some senses that you have conceptions of reality built into your biological and metaphysical structure that are consequence of processes, of evolution, that that occurred over unbelievably vast expanses of time and that structure your perception of reality in ways that it wouldn't be structured if you only live for the amount of time that you're going to live, and that's also part of the problem of deriving values from fact because you're evanescent and and you can derive the right values from the facts that portray themselves to you in your lifespan, which is why you have a biological structure that's like three point 5 billion years old, so god is that which eternally dies and is reborn in the pursuit of higher being in truth.

Speaker 7:          01:27:55       That's a fundamental element of hero mythology. God is the highest value in the hierarchy of values. It's another way of looking at it. God is what calls and what responds in the eternal call to adventure. God is the voice of conscience. God is the source of judgment and mercy in guilt. God is the future to which we make sacrifices and something akin to the transcendental repository of reputation. Here's a cool one. If you're an evolutionary biologist, God, God, God is that which selects among men in the eternal hierarchy of men, so you know, men arrange themselves into hierarchies and then men rise in the hierarchy and there's principles that are important that determine the probability of their rise and those principles aren't tyrannical power. There are something like the ability to articulate truth and the ability to be competent and the ability to make appropriate moral judgements, and if you can do that in a given situation, then all the other men will vote you up the hierarchy so to speak, and that will radically increase your reproductive fitness and the operation of that process. Long expanses

Speaker 10:         01:29:02       of time looks to me like it's codified in something like the notion of God the father. It's also the same thing that makes women men attractive to women because men, women peel off the top of the male hierarchy and the question is what should be at the top of the hierarchy and the answer right now is tyranny as part of the patriarchy, but the real answer is something more like the ability to use truthful speech in the service of let's say wellbeing and so that's something that operates across tremendous expenses of time and it plays a role in the selection for survival itself, which makes it a fundamental reality.

Speaker 8:          01:29:35       Jordan? Ivanka, I just cut in here with one question that for now

Speaker 4:          01:29:40       what?

Speaker 8:          01:29:47       So I was not hearing in that list of attributes a god who could care if anyone masturbated. I was not hearing a God who

Speaker 10:         01:29:59       depends on what else is stopping you from doing. Sam, sorry, I missed that. I said it depends on what else is stopping you from doing

Speaker 8:          01:30:09       well. Yeah. Okay, so it's serious. It's important to do something other than masturbate. Yes.

Speaker 10:         01:30:16       Yes. Which is which, which actually constitutes a problem, which is harder

Speaker 4:          01:30:21       sounds.

Speaker 8:          01:30:26       I'm not hearing a God, a personal God who can possibly hear anyone's prayer is much less answer them. Right, and I'm wondering what percentage of religious people who would say, Oh yeah, I believe in God and it's the most important thing in my life. What percentage of those religious people do you think have in mind a god of this sort you just described

Speaker 10:         01:30:50       know sam? It's a good question because when I go talk to people, when I, when I talk to people online and use exactly this terminology, millions of people listen, so it's not so obvious which, what percentage of people see it this way? It's maybe that they have the intuitions, but they haven't been articulated. Well,

Speaker 8:          01:31:06       I mean this is the problem is what worries me about this.

Speaker 4:          01:31:09       So

Speaker 8:          01:31:13       you. You could do the same thing with the idea of, of, of ghosts, right? So, so people traditionally have believed in ghosts. It's a, it's an archetype. You might say the ghost survival of death is certainly an archetypes and we know what most people most of the time mean when they say they believe in ghosts, and I say, I don't believe in ghosts, and you say, no, no, you do believe in ghosts. Ghosts are your relationship to the unseen. That's a ghost, so you have a new definition of ghost that you're putting in in place. Provided which I have to say, well, of course I have a relationship to the unseen, so I guess I do believe in ghosts. You win that argument,

Speaker 4:          01:31:59       but

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       that

Speaker 8:          01:32:01       simply isn't what most people mean by a ghost most. You mean using that simplified argument about my conception of ghost as an analogy for the proposition that I just put forward is when I see you do. I mean maybe you have more to say on the topic of Guy, but this is what I hear you doing with God. You have defined the God that most people believe in and we know this is the God that most people. I was asked what God I believed in. I'm asking you

Speaker 1:          01:32:26       percentage, yes, but

Speaker 8:          01:32:29       you, you by shifting the definition, you have robbed the now and the traditional now of its traditional meaning and you're giving your

Speaker 1:          01:32:39       partying to people. Wait a second. Wait a second. I mean by traditional meaning, look,

Speaker 10:         01:32:46       it's one of the. One of the elemental claims in the Old Testament is that you're not even supposed to under the name of God because by defining it too tightly, you lose its essence and so let's not be talking about what the classical definition of God is here. Okay? It's a historical

Speaker 11:         01:33:01       starter. Okay? Then there's plenty of religions that can make in my check in with the audience. Is the audience all right with us continuing down this.

Speaker 1:          01:33:10       Okay, so can I. can I jump in here? Sacrificing

Speaker 11:         01:33:15       your q and a so that it is at the expense of q and a that's, that's given out, but I

Speaker 1:          01:33:21       probably worth. So let me say, Sam,

Speaker 9:          01:33:29       I do not believe in a supernatural God, but the God that I've heard Jordan just describe. I do not have any difficulty understanding why he might care if you masturbate. And I also don't have any trouble figuring out how he might answer prayers.

Speaker 8:          01:33:49       Well, tell me more.

Speaker 11:         01:33:51       Well, I, I can tell you, I can tell you, I can tell you how our prayer might be answered. Okay? But these are so specific. So good. Let me do that. So it'll be interesting. So I'm not Jordan, we've not talked about this. If I

Speaker 9:          01:34:04       an answer from him that actually would satisfy me as to what the mechanism of action might be that, that, that'd be pretty interesting. And if he can tell me what I heard, I think it would, it would suggest that that we're not just making it.

Speaker 10:         01:34:18       Okay. So, so you might like this, you may be done, but it's possible. Okay. So imagine that. Okay. So let's imagine that hellish situation that you laid out. Okay, but, but let's, let's put the extra twist in it because one of the things that we both decided, I think was that you also have to build in the intent into that. So let's say the hell that we're talking about isn't the victim of the terrible massacres that you laid out in the jungle story. But a perpetrator, okay, so someone who's actually acted in a malevolent manner, truly malevolent manner, okay. Or, or maybe perhaps we wouldn't have to take that extreme case. We could say, well, perhaps you've, that

Speaker 7:          01:34:58       any of you, you've decided that you've seriously done something wrong and you want to get away from hail. You want to make things better. Okay? So here's, here's an exercise you can try. So what you do is, is, is you sit on the edge of your bed and you say, okay, what I did was wrong. And you have to really believe this, right? So you've thought about it's killing you, it's killing you. Now you're a penitent and you're confessing, let's say, and you're confessing to yourself as much as to anyone and you say, I really want to know what I did wrong and I really want to know what I could do to put it right and I'm willing to accept any answer that will manifest itself to me. Try that. See what happens. Yeah, that's a prayer that will be answered and it won't be answered in the way that you want it to be answered. I can bloody well tell you that. Okay, but, but that. Well, what are you communicating with you communicating with what you do

Speaker 8:          01:35:55       that that is something that. That is a process that I'm familiar with. It doesn't require any supernatural explanation.

Speaker 1:          01:36:05       Certainly. It certainly doesn't require

Speaker 7:          01:36:10       that. We imagine that any of our books were dictated by the creator of the universe. I didn't say anything so acquired any supernatural gifts. Nobody shouldn't order to require. My concern was asked to provide an instance of prayer that worked. That's what I did.

Speaker 8:          01:36:25       That's, that's fully understandable. In terms of human psychology.

Speaker 7:          01:36:31       It's not understandable because we don't know where the answer comes from. Well, we don't know where anything comes from. That's true. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:36:37       so. But that doesn't. That doesn't open

Speaker 8:          01:36:42       door of we one thing we can know with absolute certainty that that whoever wrote the Bible didn't know either and there's many other things. He or she didn't know.

Speaker 1:          01:36:52       Everything else we know scientifically, right?

Speaker 7:          01:36:56       So obvious with people. No one even knew. No one even knew the brain was involved in any of this. Right? So he probably knew about as much as we do. About how the brain was involved in it, but we've already, we've already established in some tenuous way that things that nobody understands could have evolved into these stories in some way that would be useful, but nobody knew what they were writing when they wrote it.

Speaker 8:          01:37:17       The problem is that you can so again with this has been focused through the lens of your attachment to Christianity largely, but the Hindus, Hinduism is a completely different set of stories right now and many of them, the logic, the emotional logic, the psychological import. Many of them have the opposite valence from any Christian story, you would tell the whole notion of like for instance, the whole notion of good and evil, right? Which has such primacy. I mean you talk about religion being deeper than ethics because ethics just deals with right and wrong and religion deals with and evil right at bedrock, okay, good and evil do not have the same meaning in the east. Buddhism and Hinduism do something very different. We're willing to accept your definitions of good and evil. For the truth is it's just not even evil is just ignorance. On some level, it's just an evil is just you haven't met any real evil people if you believe that, well, okay, so then all the Hindus and Buddhists are wrong about this.

Speaker 8:          01:38:22       That's possible claim. I'm just saying that there is over a billion people who have a religious system of stories from which they derive all kinds of meaning to which they're mightily attached to where we could play the same game of, of archetypal interpretation and valuing, and yet the cash value with respect to good and evil is irreconcilable with what you get from Christianity, but it doesn't, it doesn't have to be interoperable. Right? But, uh, but, but the point is we live in a reality. Presumably Hinduism is also useful as a set of heuristics to be for Hindus and if he, if Hinduism as a manner of doctrine and as a matter of the interpretations of the Heuristics by the devout in both systems, if it Hinduism and Christianity are irreconcilable, right, then there must be a deeper level of reality that explains why they both work. That can't be reducible to Christianity being true or Hinduism being true.

Speaker 1:          01:39:34       Right? Yeah. That's Sam, that's there's, there's absolutely nothing

Speaker 10:         01:39:39       wrong with that objection. Like so this is one of the immense problems obviously, that that actually leads down the road to the kind of nihilism that you were objecting to in, in, in the moral landscape. It's like one of the things that need you said was, it's very much apropos to this is that you know, it's one thing to have your, your belief system shattered by the observation that there are other belief systems that are incommensurate that seemed to have equal utility so that that's. But it's even worse is that once you make the observation that there are other belief systems that have equal utility, then it can shatter your belief in belief systems themselves and then you're in the postmodern nihilism landscape and that's a big problem.

Speaker 8:          01:40:24       Or You could just be in a, in a more fundamental landscape that subsumes both

Speaker 10:         01:40:29       fine. Let's, let's hope that that can happen, but that I would say that's the landscape that I'm trying to pursue. Now you said that this is, that I've been approaching this from a, from a Christian perspective in this dialogue and to some degree that's true, but there are reasons for that, but I would also say I'm also doing what you recommend doing because in maps of meaning for example, because you said, well, what about this problem of multiple interpretations?

Speaker 8:          01:40:52       You road maps of meaning

Speaker 10:         01:40:55       you wrote maps of meaning. I wrote the moral landscape. I must've, I must've missed it. Sorry, I must have missed it. I missed starting to get tired, but what I tried to do it well, I tried to address that problem seriously. Like it's a really big problem. Was the problem of multiple interpretations. It's the postmodern problem is if there's an infinite number of potential interpretations. Okay. So. Oh, so what do we do about that? And the answer is it's something you alluded to, I'm sorry, in, in the moral landscape, and it's part of the basis of your argument why these things need to be grounded in facts. So because that is part of the answer to the problem of an infinite number of interpretations in maps of meaning, I tried to do what Ian Wilson recommended, but this was before he wrote his book. I tried to use a consilience approach.

Speaker 10:         01:41:43       So I looked at multiple religious systems. I looked at Christianity, I looked at evolutionary biology, I looked at philosophy, I looked at neuroscience and I looked at the literature on emotion and motivation and the literature on play that was very nicely delineated by piaget and I tried to see where there was a pattern that repeated across all dimensions of evaluation, which is exactly what you do. For example, when you use your five senses to detect something real in the world. And that's what Wilson recommended was a consilience approach. And so my proposition was if it manifests itself here and here and here and here and here, six places, and it's always the same pattern than the probability that that pattern exists. Independent of my delusional interpretation is radically decreased.

Speaker 8:          01:42:31       My claim, however, is that many of these things don't repeat. In fact, they're flipped around completely based on different religious assumptions and different cultures, and again, I would just argue that this is. We can disband discussion is trying to dispense with those, but I'm just saying something as fundamental as evil doesn't run through all these cultures and all these religious traditions.

Speaker 10:         01:42:52       Then how can you make the claim that everyone would agree with your description of what constitutes bad

Speaker 8:          01:42:58       landscape? It would be. It just, it's just not. It's not evil in the sense that it's. There's banter, there's better and worse. There's better and worse. Can we? Can we? There's either universal moral intuitions or there honest no it. Yes. No. Are some moral intuitions universal? Yes. No, I would. I would think. Listen, we are just human beings, right? We're human beings first before we're Hindu or Buddhist or Christian, but we can all get indoctrinated into the religion of our parents. This is a, an artifice. This laid on top of something far deeper. That should be obvious. So. Right. So, so we're trying to get down to what's deeper. Okay, so there may be, there may be some moral universal's. Sure. I think Jordan would know, but possible that there are some moral intuitions that are highly specific to particular

Speaker 10:         01:43:51       and wouldn't translate over to others. Yes, so highly probable because there would be environment specific adaptations like the environment specific tool use of chimpanzees. Right, right. Or maybe it's not even the environment. Maybe it's the self consistency of the belief pattern in question, so I'm sure I would put that in the broader environment. It might be a consequence of the particularities of that culture. There will be things that look, think about it like languages, like many, and this is kind of an answer to the problem that you laid out, which is a real problem. I'm not trying to deny the problem. If you look at there's a lot of languages, lots of languages. Look at how different they are. It's like, yeah, at some levels of analysis they're fundamentally different and at other levels of analysis, they're fundamentally the same, which is how we know that their languages and you could say, well, there's into very large number of stories.

Speaker 10:         01:44:37       It's like, yes, there are, but the fact that there's enough commonality across the class of stories, the set of all possible stories so that we can identify what constitutes a story and I would say that there's enough commonality across the set of all possible good stories that we can say, well, here's a canonical good story, which is by the way, what you do at the beginning of the moral landscape because you say, this is horrible, this is good. We should move from what's horrible to what's good. Say yes, you're, you've, you've, you've taken a fragment of the universal story and you've made it the axiom of your moral system, which is what you should do it, but, but the claim that I think is not helpful, even though I understand it, is that that's purely a claim of like of unmediated fact. It's like, no, there is no need.

Speaker 8:          01:45:26       There is yes. Even facts aren't unmediated facts. I mean you can't hand. You can't judge something to be factual without presupposing the validity of certain intuitions. Like, right? That that causes proceed events, you know, so, or causes precede their effects. And those intuitions could be wrong. I mean, we could live in a teleological universe where everything is getting pulled into the future by some kind of attractor. Right? And our notion of causation is totally backwards. That remains to be discovered. And we have, we would use other intuitions to make that discovery again, again, that you do pull yourself up by your bootstraps and that there's, there's no branch of science or mathematics or anything fundamental logic that can get away from that. But that's another place. But given that picture, that doesn't render all intuitions equally respectable, absolutely. Someone says, Oh, I happen to have an intuition that, that Joseph Smith who saw those golden tablets and they were, you know, uh, uh, you know, in mormonism is true. That's not the sort of intuition we're talking about here. Your intuition doesn't give you insight into history. We could

Speaker 10:         01:46:37       say, and this would be an elaboration of, of, of, uh, Brett's point is that moral intuitions of the sort that you're describing have different zones of relevance. So there's some things

Speaker 7:          01:46:50       that would only work as an intuition in very delimited areas of time and space. Let's say there's a hierarchy of moral intuitions and the more profound the intuition, the more it works as a universal truth across context, just like in a scientific truth. So scientific truth is more profound. This is why the postmodernist readings of Thomas Kuhn are wrong, is that the idea that protons are real is really fundamental because no matter what span of time and space that you pick, you're going to encounter protons. It works everywhere. And then with moral intuitions, let's say, or moral a priorities you have the same issue is some of them are so limited that they only work here and now and those are sort of impulsive, low level intuitions, a whim even. But some of them are really, really deep. The ones, for example, the one that orients you to make the claim that you made in the moral landscape, that the hellish story is bad and the heavenly story is good. I would say that's one of the deepest, most context, independent moral intuitions which, which is kind of the claim. You make access.

Speaker 8:          01:47:54       You claim that as again, go back to my fundamental concern here in the difference with respect to the difference in how we talk about these things to call that thing. God is fine. That's a god I have no problem with. Right? But that's not how most people most of the time are you using the word and there's something misleading about that and that's.

Speaker 10:         01:48:15       That worries me. Yeah. Well, if, if the claim, if the claim that you're making is.

Speaker 7:          01:48:21       We're all deeply confused about the nature of divinity and ultimate reality, it's like, yeah,

Speaker 10:         01:48:27       yes. Clearly. The other thing we agree on, I also don't disagree. I don't disagree. Look, I've never said I've never made the claim that what I'm talking about is like what other people are talking about. I mean it is in some ways, but I've not made that claim so I don't see why that's a justifiable criticism. It's like,

Speaker 8:          01:48:49       no, it's a, it's a criticism can the with respect to the very likely effects of communicating in that way because I see the results of that communication. It's a little bit. I mean, this is going to sound more invidious than it is, but this is the kind of thing that I get into a Deepak Chopra. Yeah, Deepak and I agree.

Speaker 10:         01:49:08       I think it's more invidious than it sounds actually.

Speaker 8:          01:49:12       Well, you're not wearing rhinestone book classes with you if you graduate to that. We'll have more of a problem, but it's. Deepak clearly wants to let his audience believe that everything they're into is on some level justifiable by his reading of quantum spookiness. Right? So it's all. So if you want to go out and just buy a lot of crystals and think they're going to heal you, it has something to do with quantum quantum reality. Nothing me know, but saying, but I, I think deeply could say if, if I, if I got his back to the wall, Deepak could say, honestly say, listen, I've never said anything about crystals, right? I'm not selling crystals. I've never said they work, but it's the way in which he's failing to make the clear differentiation. The fact that the fact that it takes you 20 minutes

Speaker 4:          01:50:11       to admit that there is that

Speaker 8:          01:50:14       a lot of the Bible is filled with barbaric nonsense. It took me 20 minutes to it. We'll go to the tape on that. These things matter. These things matter and I'm just saying it's like you were saying, if you're. If you're

Speaker 5:          01:50:31       parish of one or in a parish of 1000 or a parish of 100,000 but not in the parish that has anything in common with the with the Bible. Thumper is in my country who think that Jesus is very likely coming back in their lifetime because he never died and he's going to judge the living and the dead and there will be a resurrection and hell fire and all the rest. If that's not the game, you're playing at all.

Speaker 8:          01:50:58       Own it.

Speaker 4:          01:51:03       Why? Why are you? Why are you? Why are you all applauding about that?

Speaker 8:          01:51:09       It's like, what? What do you mean to own it? It's like, I already made my claim. It's like I'm not playing a religious fundamentalist game, so what's all the applause about so I don't understand that

Speaker 4:          01:51:20       and own it. It's like I was as listened.

Speaker 8:          01:51:23       I was as clear as I possibly could be when I delineated my answer to the question. Some people say, well, what do you mean by God? Somebody asked you if Jesus one residence second answer, but no. Well forget it man. When a women. I think we can actually. This is a complicated.

Speaker 5:          01:51:43       No, I don't want to end on. I don't want to end on a note of acrimony, but someone wants to ask you whether you thought Jesus was literally resurrected and you said it would take me 40 hours to answer that question. Okay. That's, that's, that's the kind of thing I'm responding to here. You don't need to do that. If you have a clear cut answer to that question,

Speaker 8:          01:52:03       I don't have a clear head and if you don't and if you don't do that, that connects with many other things that we still have to talk about. Yes, definitely. Yeah, and I think because a cause that it isn't obvious in the biblical account that Christ was literally resurrected, so it's not simple. No. No, but if the question is, do you think he let? Let's, let's put it probabilistically. I mean anything's possible. I'll tell you that it's possible that he was physically resurrected. I mean it's, it's even pause. Wait a second. I did with respect to quantum mechanics, the point is it would take me 40 hours to answer the question. I didn't say that he was. How's this for an answer? Almost certainly not you. What's, what's, what's wrong with that answer?

Speaker 4:          01:52:54       I think I, I think I know what's wrong with that answer.

Speaker 10:         01:53:01       It's, it's a, it's a financer and people have been giving that answer for a very long period of time, but the idea doesn't seem

Speaker 9:          01:53:07       to go away.

Speaker 8:          01:53:08       Okay, so that evidence of what exactly.

Speaker 10:         01:53:11       I don't know. Well, I can tell you one thing. It's an evidence of deep idea.

Speaker 8:          01:53:18       Let this be the doorway to our next three hour conversation. Are they clearly were not sure. So sure we have. We have 10 minutes left. Okay. Well then let's answer that question in 10 minutes.

Speaker 4:          01:53:27       So wait, I want you to trust me,

Speaker 10:         01:53:29       me, hear you. For whatever reason decided I should moderate, so I want you to trust me. For one thing, you. You've been doing yeoman's work am. I really would like to answer that question, but I'm trying to figure out if people seem to think that I'm trying to evade the question. It's like not evading the question. I'm trying to figure it out. It's a really. People have been arguing about this for 2000 years. It's like it's not.

Speaker 8:          01:53:53       That's a sin. That's a symptom of the effect of religious dogmatism for $2,000.

Speaker 10:         01:53:59       No, it's not. Okay. It's certainly a symptom of that. It's also partly a symptom of the idea.

Speaker 9:          01:54:05       The resurrection of Jesus is clearly an important question, but you've raised a much bigger and more pressing question for the audience, which is whether or not God cares whether they masturbate. So

Speaker 8:          01:54:18       I actually think if we pursue that answer, that we will actually wrap this up in a way that you want to end this on masturbation. I think we owe it to them.

Speaker 4:          01:54:33       So

Speaker 8:          01:54:36       give me a little leash that the floor is yours.

Speaker 4:          01:54:39       Great.

Speaker 8:          01:54:41       How did I end up here? All right. So here's, here's the question. Let's just figure out if we

Speaker 9:          01:54:47       can determine why God might care if you masturbate. Right? So let's suppose that we have a story, a heuristic of some kind that stands in for something. And the story is God is watching. He sees you always. He doesn't want you masturbating. So don't you dare. What happens,

Speaker 8:          01:55:12       what happens? Yeah. Well it's uh, it's rubbed rather ineffectual idea. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think that story, but I think the reality was was that you had people masturbating and feeling terrible about it and you had a whole layer of sexual neurosis that we've got grafted onto human psychology unnecessarily. Christianity has a certain type apology of sexual hang up or a which, which, you know, the contracts have. So if I understand you correctly, you are agreeing that a certain amount, certain number of people will masturbate some of the, some of them battling the priesthood and rape little boys. I mean that is a piece. There is stick with the topic, so a certain number of people will have masturbated. They will have thought. Honestly, it's the same topic. I mean the, the, the taboos around masturbation, the taboos around sexuality prior to marriage, the taboo around divorce, all of the taboo, Taboola browned out of wedlock birth. The ideal of celibacy in the priesthood. All of that is a is a just a diabolical machine of needless sexual conflict and misery. Hold on.

Speaker 1:          01:56:25       Yes. Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:56:27       You have to take. How's the. How's the whole flood of pornography thing working out? Okay. Yeah, I will. I will grant you that. There is some interpretation that takes supernatural principles and magic and other worldliness out of the equation here. That gets you some wisdom in the heuristic. Yes. If you're masturbating all the time, you're not satisfying your, your monogamous relationship with your wife or husband.

Speaker 9:          01:56:53       We wouldn't even need to go there. Let's just. You're not procreating and we agree that a certain amount of masturbation was present, was prevented by that story, which made people fear the consequences of them engaging in it, which would result in, I'm pretty sure less less masturbation, which means that in seeking a release which we are physiologically programmed to seek, one might end up looking in a more urgent fashion for a mate.

Speaker 8:          01:57:24       Right? So it's. Oh, we going to enforce monogamy is a no. So look, I'm trying to take you somewhere I think. I think there is

Speaker 9:          01:57:32       way that we can rescue some important part of what both of you were saying that can now be reconciled and then there's a bitter pill for each of you. I mean that's just the way this looks to me. So if we can agree that this makes sense actually as a fitness enhancing adaptation, that this story would result in people behaving in a way that might result in the marrying early, might result in them reproducing earlier than they would otherwise. Right. Then we can understand it as mechanistic and we can understand what you said that you know maybe God would care about whether or not people masturbate because God is a metaphor for some set of stories that gets you to behave in an adaptive fashion, but the point for you then would be that Sam is arguing with reason. We can decide whether or not to employ this story at this moment, whether it's a good idea for us to urgently reproduce as quickly as possible, which for example, increases the size of the population of the planet. Whereas delaying reproduction keeps the rate of population growth down and might be a better choice for a moment in history when we have seven and a half billion people on the planet. So in some sense,

Speaker 8:          01:58:42       what I think I see is the religious story itself make some kind of sense. If you adhere to it in a manner that you are obligated and I have no tools with which to question it, then you will miss the fact that at this moment you might want to throw that story. Yeah. For the problem is it doesn't make sense and this is a problem with these heuristics in general, it doesn't make sense for the right reason and that's why it's not a reliable guide given other changes in the world, but with everything changing, you want to be making sense for the right reason. You don't want it so useful. Fictions have to be retired at a certain point. Useful truths stay true. I mean if you, because they're based on your engagement with reality and so to take your point about pornography, which I think is totally valid, you, we, you could have a completely rational conversation in terms of human psychology and sociology and what you want society to look like about the corrosive nature of pornography, right? That's not. You don't have to be a victorian, a prude to worry that there might be something wrong with the infinite availability of pornography to 13 year olds and above. Right? I mean, that's A. I don't know what what's generation of human beings were raising in the current environment. It's. It's quite worrisome actually, but again, you don't have to invoke mythology to do that and I would say the temptation to invoke mythologist said, well, you actually

Speaker 10:         02:00:10       no, how do you do it? Poseidon really gets pissed off when you master. How do you do it? How do you do it? You don't have any effects to have no mechanism for controlling about the effects,

Speaker 8:          02:00:20       human relationships and your own mind and your own intention and the way you view others.

Speaker 10:         02:00:24       That barely works for sex ed. It barely works for condom education. Well, what was already works like those sorts of educational interventions to stop that kind of fundamental behavior have very little effect when people aren't nearly as amenable to behavioral changes as a consequence of rational educational interventions as you might hope. I mean, and that's. That's part and parcel of the very broad clinical literature. They're not as. They're not as amenable to dogmatic intrusions either. I mean they are and living. That might be a problem and neuro problems with no because. Because

Speaker 8:          02:00:56       there again, this is just like the problem is that this, even if you could make the case that a dogmatic at attachment to one or another religion was better, all things considered than being a secular, truly secular and truly rational, right? It's vulnerable. It's vulnerable to every next thing we find out. I mean, that's why it's like you could have said if you go back 200 years before the germ theory of disease, you could have said, well, all of these dietary taboos and, and taboos around, you know, hand washing and clint foot washing. It's actually very wise. The wisdom of the germ theory of disease was sort of built into our scripture and people were survived. There's a kind of differential level of survival based on those who really adhere to these, these practices and those who didn't. Okay, but it one, it's blind to the actual variables. Like is there's nothing special about shellfish necessarily or there's nothing special about pork necessarily or whatever the example is. And once you get the actual variables in hand, then the whole edifice comes crashing down and then you really just want to understand that.

Speaker 10:         02:02:13       Right? Does that work? Look, I don't know if. I don't know if the whole edifice comes crashing down and it isn't clear to me that you want to claim that because one of the things you did say in the moral landscape, and I think this is associated with your interest in spirituality, is that there is some baby mixed in with the bathwater. And the question is how do we, how do we, how do we distill that out? And the objections that you're raising are the objections that are, look how difficult it is to do the distillation. It's like, yeah, absolutely man. And stuff like I'm a photo of the enlightenment. I think you enlightenment types and I put pinker in the same camp and radically overestimate the degree to that was. That was a cause of sweet. It's like everyone was barbaric and superstitious until 1750 and some miracle occurred and now we're all in what we all became enlightened. Like there was

Speaker 8:          02:02:59       the developmental habit. I mean with this, hence, hence to are complaining about the problem and most of the world, most of the world hasn't had the enlightenment true

Speaker 10:         02:03:09       look. I no folded the enlightenment, but I think that it had a lengthy developmental history that is radically underplayed by the people who, who grounded purely in rationality

Speaker 8:          02:03:19       is clearly still developing. My point is we we should be able to agree that having a worldview guided by a continuous honest engagement with reality and so far as we can apprehend it is better than having a worldview solidified or anchored to unchanging ideas that were born of people who had none of our present tools. None of our present insights into anything.

Speaker 10:         02:03:54       Well, it depends on. It depends on the principals. It depends on the principals. Like I would say there are situations where that clearly applies, but I think there are broad principles and again, we should probably stop with this. I think you have out there because I'm, I'm, I'm starting to get tired. I'm sure everyone else in here is starting to get tired. Well, I'm starting to get tired anyways and I mean the, the, there are, there are principles, there are higher order principles of the sort that I described that you also appeared to rely on in the moral landscape, the idea of these profound moral intuitions and so that's what I'm after is what are these profound moral intuitions and what is their source and like I'm also perfectly willing to make the claim and have in fact in, in detail that these moral intuitions see that this is a place where we differ a little bit.

Speaker 10:         02:04:43       It's like maybe we can go here tomorrow night. See, it seems to me that you, for you, for you and your argument is the facts are laying out there and you can extract out value from them and we already described why you want to do that because you want to at least not move into the nihilistic direction and you want to ground them in some sort of reality. It's like fair enough. But the thing is is that the facts as they are, have been around for a very, very, very, very long time, right? Let's say three and a half billion years, the entire expanse of life, and it's the operation of those facts on life that is produced, the a priori implicit interpretive structures that guide our interaction with the facts and those a priority implicit structures that have emerged out of this evolutionary course, have a structure that mediates between us and the facts that cannot be derived from the facts at hand. So, so then the question is what is that structure? And it's in both of our interests to get that right, because you use that as the source of moral intuitions like right? Agreed. That's the source of moral intuition. So and

Speaker 1:          02:05:53       Clint, clearly what we need to table this for tomorrow night, but that's a good guys. I'm just going to interrupt you. You guys. Let's give Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris and Bret Weinstein. Have you. Let's go.

Speaker 3:          02:06:06       Thank you. Thanks.
