Speaker 1:          00:01          Anyways, so you're always in a situation, and this is occurs across multiple levels of analysis because I could say, well, when are you in the garden? And one answer could be, well, when you're in a beautiful house or in a beautiful hotel or in a well functioning institution or in a city that's working, but I can also say you're in a garden when your conception of the world is sufficient that when you enacted it allows the world to be fruitful. That's a garden too, right? Because so your internal psychological structure, the conceptions that you use first of all, there obviously analogous to culture, but they're also analogous to a garden in that way and light culture, they can be disrupted. So you know what it's like people, they say this all the time. I wish that hadn't happened and what they mean by that is Jesus. I was in a pretty good place before that event occurred. You know, on a big moral eric and really do that to you. You know, you do something that you really think is stupid and you know you. You're just shattered. Really sometimes sheltered enough to develop post traumatic stress disorder so you can't get rid of the snakes.

Speaker 1:          01:16          That's the first idea in the story. Well then the issue is, well, what do you do with the stakes? What God basically told even Adam not well, he didn't really tell them not to interact with the snakes and he put a snake in there. I think it's partly because in a sense it's not possible to create a garden without having a snake in it because you can't keep everything out. It's not possible. Okay, so the snake comes along and it says, well, if you do this thing that God for bade a lot of wonderful things will happen. Well, this is where it gets. It gets extraordinarily complicated. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:57          let me finish this part of the story and then we'll go back. The serpent said unto the woman, you shall not surely die for God knows that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes will be opened and you will be as gods knowing good and evil. Okay, so what can we conclude from that? Well, first thing is, is that their eyes were closed because if they weren't closed and how could they be opened and the second thing is they didn't know the difference between good and evil. Okay? So that explains the whole shame naked and not ashamed issue because if your eyes are closed, while that's irrelevant and if, you know, if, if there's no moral knowledge, there's obviously no shame. So what's happening here is that there's a very,

Speaker 2:          02:41          um,

Speaker 1:          02:43          profound distinction being made between the before fruit eating state of being in the after fruit eating state of being or the before fruit eating and snake interacting mode of being and the after fruit eating and snake interacting mode of being. And I think it's reasonable to think of that on a historical timeline. You know, that that is one of the major. Those are two of the major forces that shaped our evolutionary history and the idea that things were different before that and after that is a perfectly reasonable presupposition. Something put us on the path to very, very rapid cortical development. Vision is certainly one of those factors. So, and the fruit eating element, well that's where we have color vision, so when it isn't obvious exactly what that did, but it did a lot and things so.

Speaker 1:          03:33          And then the next thing is, well there's no moral knowledge now that's interesting because it implies that there's some tight link between having your eyes closed and not having moral knowledge. So to have your eyes closed just to not to be able to see. So there's a kind of unconsciousness about it. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her. And he did eat

Speaker 1:          04:05          and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. Okay. So that's quite an interesting sequence of events. So they're tempted by this thing that's subtle and dangerous and the consequence of the temptation is the ingestion of something. The incorporation of something with transformative properties. And the transformation is profound. What happens is they open their eyes. Well, that's coming to consciousness. That's exactly what that is. You know, when a kitten opens its eyes, it finally enters the world. You know, so people had their eyes closed before this event. Well, so they weren't. They weren't conscious in the same way. And that would account for the unity of experience. They're not separated from.

Speaker 1:          04:57          They're not separate beings on the ground of existence. That's one way of thinking. But they have the same kind of life as animals too. You know, they're, they're just unconscious or at least non self conscious entities of nature. There's no nakedness, there's no knowledge of good and evil. I mean, do you, you don't blame a lion for eating it, for eating a sheep. Yeah. They used to eat sheep in the Middle East, right? You don't think that's an evil. They don't think of the lion is evil. You just think that that's what lions do. Now someone comes along and steals your sheep. Well that's a whole different issue. All of a sudden there's a moral issue that's overlaid upon that and you say, well, you might say, well, why is all of a sudden there were moral issue and then the answer to that would be, well, the person either does know the difference between good and bad or should know it, you know, and if he says, well, I'm just acting like a lion, that's just, there's just not gonna.

Speaker 1:          05:46          No one's gonna accept that as an excuse. And the reason for that is there's a basic assumption that there's something that you know that lions don't and why? Well, it's because your eyes are open in a different way. Okay, well that seems to be reasonable. So they opened their eyes and bang, they know they're naked. Now. That's an interesting juxtaposition. Okay, so let's say you develop a higher form of consciousness and that makes you self conscious. So there's two things happening here. There's an elevation of consciousness, but out of that spring, self consciousness, and then you've got to think, well, what does selfconsciousness mean exactly? Well, because you're not fully self conscious and the reason you're not fully self consciousness because you don't know everything about yourself, right? So you're, you're ignorant of a lot of your own being, but there's a lot of your being.

Speaker 1:          06:32          You're not ignorant about. Well, hey, you can identify yourself as an individual, so you've got the identify yourself in the mirror trick down, which is kind of the standard trick for animals, self consciousness, but that's only the beginning. It's the bear, beginnings of self consciousness. If you're so. If you're self conscious, you know where your boundaries are because what's inside the boundary is you and what's outside isn't you? But then there's other boundaries that you have. There's a temporal boundary. There's, there's the time when you weren't, and there was the time when you won't be, and so there's a boundary of space, but there's a boundary in time and that means that as soon as you become self conscious, you know that you're going to die. And so that's the type link between the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the and death in the Old Testament or in the genesis story.

Speaker 1:          07:20          So and you might say, well you were going to die before and fair enough, but there's a big difference between a death, that death of a self conscious entity and death in the one case. It's a natural process that you know that that's natural death, let's say. And the other one, it's a, it's a catastrophe of being for the self conscious individual. You know. And so the other thing that happens is in the genesis story that that discovery is portrayed as a permanent rift in the structure of Ba. That's why it's such a deep sin. It's like all of a sudden everything is different and it will never be the same again. No matter what happens, you know when you might say, well obviously God was an enemy of higher consciousness. It's like, well, there's lots of interpretations of generous. That took exactly that. Stats said, well God was an enemy of higher consciousness.

Speaker 1:          08:10          You wanted things to remain in an, in an unconscious paradise and that it was human, um, unwillingness to behave and curiosity that God has sent to the problem that we're in and it's actually actually a catastrophe, you know? And then other people who were sort of high that had more say, admiration for the illumination and self consciousness elements said that the thing that tempted human beings was a greater God than the God that originally did the creation. That was a gnostic idea. You know. So the serpent therapy becomes an agent of revelation in a sense, you know, but anyways, this, they've laid out the problem, this is the problems. All of a sudden people woke up and when they woke up, they noticed who they were and they weren't happy about it. So what do they notice? They're naked. Okay, well, so what? Well, you know, you see, so what? Instantly, because the first thing they do is make fig leaves.

Speaker 1:          09:02          They make clothing out of fiddly and cover themselves up. While you know, that's, that's culture and you think, well what's good? What is the utility of culture? But that's easy. Culture is the barrier between us and our own nakedness. It's the barrier between our nakedness and the natural world. It's like, why do you put on clothes so you don't freeze to death, you know, so you're not as easily attacked. It's like as soon as you know you're naked and vulnerable and you're self conscious, you extend yourself across time, you discovered time, you know that not only are you vulnerable now, but you're going to be vulnerable in the future. So are your children and their children. It's like the whole nature of being. It's like you've added a dimension to the nature of being. You've added time to it and it's a radical transformation. You might say, well that's good because lions don't eat you as often.

Speaker 1:          09:51          It's like, yeah, the zebras don't seem that upset on the plains of the Serengeti when the lions are around. One's going to pick one off now and then, but the lion, the zebras aren't running around, you know, with anxiety disorders, popping value them all the time because the lions are there, but that's not the case with human beings. We see a line and we think, oh yeah, some at some point that line's going to want to eat one of us and so, and lions in general will do that. So not only do we have to solve the problem of that line right now, we have to solve the problem of all lions for all time, which we actually seem to be doing a very good job of now because soon there won't be any of them, but you know, so that sort of thing can get out of hand. But, but you get the point. So okay. So they sewed fig leaves together and they made themselves aprons. So

Speaker 1:          10:44          you know, the sexual element of it too is I think also that the reason sexuality is tied in there so tightly is because the most sexual parts of a human being are also the parts that are the most vulnerable. So. So it's not only, you know, vulnerability to judgment and vulnerability to exploitation, which is a huge deal, especially in the case of women. But it's also the fact that just from a purely physical perspective, those are the most delicate tissues. And so the fact that they are fully exposed is really a big problem. So okay, so now they're naked. They got aprons on. It's like, no, they're not in unconscious paradise anymore. So then what happens? And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.

Speaker 1:          11:35          I can't imagine how you could possibly pack more meaning into two sentences. You know, it's, you can tell people have been at this for like 25,000 years because see what happens here is that there's an idea to begin with, that there's a complete unity between God and his creation, let's say, so that there's the natural order is undisturbed and all of a sudden that's fractured. And so what happens is that human beings are divorced from the divinity. It's. And not only are they divorced from it, they're unwilling to expose themselves to it. So, so think about. Think about this. I will take a take a side step for a minute.

Speaker 1:          12:26          You might say, well, imagine that you could exist in a manner that was on perfect. The question might be, well, what would stop you from doing it? Well, one thing might be that you couldn't envision something as useless as you are actually managing that you know, so you, you know. If you think about what stands in the road of people as obstacles to their full self realization, the easiest way to encapsulate that is that they view themselves as inadequate. Now there's other things as well. They don't want to take the responsibility and so forth, but you know it's very difficult to heat a divine call. Let's say when you're stuck in this little ratty contraption that is prone to disease and I'm prone to shame and prone to age and prone to death, and it's like how can you continue in some divine manner when you've come to the realization that there are, you are, you know, and people, certainly people derive the conclusion fairly frequently that there are so appalling, but it would be better if they were obliterated along with everyone else.

Speaker 1:          13:33          It's not as if the realization of the nature of our own physical being was something that freed people up to be courageous. You know, it was quite the reverse. Although I think people can still be courageous in front of it and in spite of it, but it's definitely in spite of it. You know, all the classic definitions of true courage aren't that you're not afraid. It's that you're afraid, but you do it anyways. It's like, well, you that fear is, and shame is an integral part of you. As soon as you realize that you're vulnerable to social evaluation and natural degeneration, you're stuck with it, and so then bang, you're divorced from your divine mode of being, we'll say partly at least because you're just afraid to manifest it. So anyways, that's what happened. So Adam and Eve hide from God. Now it seems to be really counterproductive because you might think that if they didn't hide from God, then there wouldn't be a problem.

Speaker 1:          14:22          They can be naked and no problem, but that isn't what happened and the Lord God calls onto Adam. It says unto him, where are, where are you? And Adam says, I heard your voice in the garden, so there's a call there, and I was afraid because I was naked. Well, that pretty much explains it and I hit myself. Okay? And God said, who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldn't show this naughty? Who told me that that was naked? I believe women told men that. I think that's a very accurate summation of the relationship between men and women. What all we develop consciousness across the span of evolutionary history. And I believe it for a couple of reasons. Number one, sexual selection is a huge factor in, in what created human beings. And women primarily do the selection.

Speaker 1:          15:11          They're the bottleneck and they're the bottleneck. Because women can't have that many offspring, they can only have a few. So that makes them the bottleneck by definition. And women are so choosy about men that twice as many women have children as men. Okay? So what that means is on average means that I know it's kind of hard to understand, but imagine every single woman has one child. And then imagine half the men have zero and half of them have to. Okay, that's the case. So statistically speaking, half man, half of all men were write offs. Now it's actually worse than that because some men have so many offspring that is not even funny, you know. So that Kinda cuts, it cuts the number of successful men down by many. So women are a bottleneck and they do judgment and and rightly so and they judged them according to their insufficiency.

Speaker 1:          16:07          And that is what makes men unselfconscious obviously. And it's the thing that makes them more self conscious than anything else. Now to men's credit, let me tell you about the bower birds. Okay. So bowerbirds, they're very cool. They live on the ground and the males make these incredibly. First of all, we've a nest. It's sort of like a hammock. It's real soft. And then they hang that into tree and then they sweep out their front yard and then they decorate it with bits of like the blue leaves are over here. And then there's some red leaves here and there's a nice display of green here. And maybe there's some glass there and it's like this little art work, you know, and the bower birds have these more or less enroll say in the same territory. And then the females come hopping along and they take a look at this thing and if they like it, well then they're willing to become a little more friendly with that particular bowerbird.

Speaker 1:          16:53          And if they don't, they fly away. Well. So if the male bowerbird has three female visitors and nothing pans out, then he, you know, he has a little fit and erases all creation that he asked to do another one. And so like you just have to think about that for 15 minutes and it pretty much explains human beings just like men. One response that man could have had was just to go hide in a shell. And some of them do that. That is absolutely a common response. And to never come out and spend the rest of his life playing video games in the basement and eating Cheetos, you know? But then you know, the other responses, well, all better transform myself into something that isn't going to produce that response. And that's a central part of, that's a central part of male motivation. It's a central element of male motivation.

Speaker 1:          17:39          So if you're ever wondering why men are the way they are, that real answer to that is because that's how they evolve to oppress women. So because obviously if that wouldn't have happened, given that sexual selection is such a powerful selecting force among human beings, well it wouldn't have worked out. So men, women don't make men self conscious, you know, when it's more than that too, because you could see a positive feedback loop emerging as we got more cognitively sophisticated. You know, when you can think of that. Maybe that was an arms race between men, women and snakes, something like that. You know, as we got more cognitively sophisticated, one of the prices we paid for that was that our hand expanded and one of the prices women paid for that was that childbirth became increasingly difficult and the babies kept getting born younger. And so that meant that women became more.

Speaker 1:          18:28          As we became more cognitively able, paradoxically, women became more vulnerable at certain key points of their lives because they had increasingly fragile babies. Now, how did women deal with that? Well, I think they shamed men into becoming caregivers of children because how else would it have happened? Like the typical mit mammo mail doesn't hang around provisioning the litter, you know, in fact, some of the males will eat the comms. You don't want a black male. Black bear around wolves are an exception to this and you know there are animals that are an exception. It happens in other species other than human beings, but human beings have this incredibly long period of dependence that also requires a relationship for that relationship to the remain in tact. There has to be a fair bit of integrity in the communication between the partners. So there's a real moral demand there as well.

Speaker 1:          19:21          So anyways, Adam doesn't show himself here as a particularly courageous individual because, which I think is quite comical when God says, hold, who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of that tree? Which I told you not to. The man says, the woman who you gave to me, she gave me the tree, the tree, and I did eat, which is it doesn't say much for his moral character because he rats out the first chance he gets so, which I also think isn't like the comedy of that is underrated in this story. That's a very funny sequence of events so and so the God talks to the woman who says, well, what's this that you did? And the woman said, the serpent. It was the serpent's fault. The serpent beguiled me and I did eat. Let me show you out. I think I've showed you this picture before, but it's such a crazy cool picture. I want to show it to you again.

Speaker 1:          20:35          Okay, well, for whatever reason this just doesn't seem to be working. So I'll tell you about the picture and still it's a very car with representation and Christian iconography and what it basically shows us that Mary is holding up this incident. You know, up off the ground. She's got her foot on a snake or a lizard. It's like, well, it doesn't take a biological genius to figure out what that means. It means like the good mother keeps the baby away from predatory reptiles, you know, and so you can see that as part of this feedback loop that developed, so there's predation, it's particularly focused on women and children, which is exactly what it would be focused on. So and then in order for that to not be to not the catastrophic, then the women are appealing to the men for protection and that starts to increase because the women gets more vulnerable as we get smarter and the babies get smaller.

Speaker 1:          21:20          And so there's this triadic, positive feedback loop that occurs that wraps up brain development and we need it. There has to be a reason for the brain development. This is called a baldwin effect by the way, in biology, the Baldwin effect is where something happens to produce an outcome, something biological happens that produces a cultural outcome that increases the probability that that biological adaptations will serve fitness. So for example, beavers cut down trees. So, and what that means is that the beavers that are more adapted to aquatic environments do better. So as the beavers get more adapted to aquatic environments and cutting down trees, they cut down more trees and make more aquatic environments, and so the thing spins until you get an animal that's really, really well adapted to doing precisely that. Well, something happened to our cortex up and very, very short order and it was shorter or you know, it was so short that the human female pelvic structure could barely keep up, which is why birth is so rough. And why so many children die in childbirth. I mean, it doesn't happen much anymore, but it used to happen a lot. But before that, middle of the 20th century, women were dying in childbirth all the time. Plus it's extraordinarily difficult. So even though the baby is born premature, for all intents and purposes, it's still hell. And the reason for that is the hand is so big and it's even compressible because the baby's head isn't fully formed when it's born. Bones have gaps in them. So the baby's head compresses and like, like mad visibly. So,

Speaker 1:          22:56          so the woman says, well, it was the serpent's fault, so you know, when you could almost, you could also say this ties into the issue of women induced selfconsciousness among men. So like if the woman's primary primary problem is predation, you know, for her and the infant because of her being burdened with the infants and the infant's complete and absolute inability to defend itself, then it's going to drive the probability that she's going to select someone for a partner who can get rid of the damn snakes. And then you know, when you see that echoed over and over and human iconography, it's like the hero is the person who confronts the Dragon. Okay, well what do you do when you confront? Drag it? You get the girl. That's the first thing. But more importantly, you get something of value. And that's a real transmutation. It's so interesting because what happened was not only we figure out how to defend ourselves against predators, we figured out that going after them voluntarily was unbelievably useful because you might ask, well, what the hell transformed, you know, frugivores into carnivores.

Speaker 1:          23:59          It's, you know, chimps will eat and they do hunt, they will eat monkeys, but they primarily live on leaves, which is pointless, you know, because the leaves have no calories whatsoever. Well, human beings like we got transformed. We are primarily fruit eaters and we turned into hunters and we're thin and fast, which is very unlike a chimpanzee. So not only were women selecting men who were able and willing to protect themselves against predators, but that got translated even farther into selection for, for partners who would go out partly to protect and partly also didn't want to bring something back. So I know it's pretty, it's a pretty smart arrangement. All things considered. But the problem is, you know, one of the prices that women pay for that is that they're partly selecting for male aggression. You know, because the males aren't going to go, they're not going to be able to do that sort of thing unless they're tough and they're not going to go out and do it unless they're relatively fearless.

Speaker 1:          24:58          So you know, and then you end up with a, you got this weird balance between needing a semi Predator and needing someone who's going to be able to integrate themselves into the household. So that's the beauty and the beast thing as far as I can tell. So. Okay. So the law God says to the serpent, because you've done this, you're cursed above all cattle. Cattle were generally animals and above every beast of the field, upon thy belly you will go and dust you will eat all the days of your life. Okay? So the serpent scoped a problem there. And uh, be interesting to find out exactly why those damn things lost their legs because you know that snakes, snakes, lizards aren't snakes that grew legs. Snakes are lizards that lost their legs. The question is, why did the hell did they lose their legs? Like what was it about the specifics of their environment and their diet and their locale that meant that legless movement was better?

Speaker 1:          25:52          Well, they're sneakier, you know, they can slither through the grass, they can climb trees to. Although he does do that, but I don't know enough about snakes to know exactly why it was that they lost their legs, but be interesting to find out and unto the woman, and I will put enmity between Dow and the woman and between seed and her seed, it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel. Okay, so it's just another representation of the fact that there's going to be enmity between human beings and predatory will say predatory reptiles under the woman. He said, oh, greatly multiply that I sorrow and thy conception. That's not hard to figure out in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee. Notice that doesn't say should it just says Shell, and that's not the same thing at all.

Speaker 1:          26:41          Remember, this is a curse. It's not a. it's not a proposition about how the world should be optimally structured. It's far different than not. It says, look, there's been a sequence of events and this is going to be the outcome. Childbirth is going to be hell. It's going to be really difficult to raise children and you're going to be subject to the oppression of men. It's like, yeah, well that's definitely what happened. And then to Adam, he says, because you listened to your wife and ate of the tree, which I told you not to, the ground is cursed for your sake. You'll eat it in sorrow all the days of your life. It'll bring up thorns and thistles and you'll eat the herb of the field. So that's the introduce deduction of the necessity of agriculture, right? You're no longer living in a garden where things are just growing for free.

Speaker 1:          27:26          You're out there like dig in with a stick and planting things, which is work. You know when you think, well, do animals work and the answer that is no human beings work. The answer to that is yes. Why do human beings work? How about because we discovered time, right? Because work means why do you work while you worked for the future? Obviously, and you don't have the future unless you've discovered time and you don't care about the future unless you know you're vulnerable. So these things are tangled together and so the cost of self consciousness is that we're life becomes work, life becomes suffering and work. So it doesn't necessarily seem like a particularly good deal in the sweat of value face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground for out of it. You were taken for your dust and unto dust you will return.

Speaker 1:          28:13          And Adam called his wasting eve because she was the mother of all living and add unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them. So okay, well, you know, that's certainly part of the origin of clothing, especially in the colder climates, right? It's like you get the animal, maybe it's a Predator and you wear it to. And to begin with, we lived inside of them, you know. So I suspect, although I don't know this for sure, although I know it fairly well, the earliest dwellings were mammoth skins with mammoth bone poles. And you can see, see how that might've come about, right? Because you're out there hunting a mammoth. Maybe you're living in a cave or wherever the hell people live, or maybe you made something out of, you know, grasp Heidi and I don't know what the Paleolithic people were living in, but it starts to get cold.

Speaker 1:          29:01          Maybe the ice age starts creeping up, right? And so you stab yourself a nice mammoth and a storm comes up. What are you going to do? What you've skinned it out, at least in principle. So you carry the meat home. The logical thing to do is to get the hell underneath the skin and after a day or two in his throw them underneath erotic mammas skin, you might think, well, it wouldn't be a bad idea to like do something to the skin so that it's not quite as intolerable to live under as it might be if that's a tent, like a tent. His skin with bones, you know? And then the movement from that to this is, well, it's a matter of degree rather than kind. So and then the Lord God sent the man and woman or the Lord God says, behold the man is become one of us to know good and evil.

Speaker 1:          29:44          So that's the sign of divinity, to know good and evil, to have a moral sense, and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever. Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken. So we drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. Well, the last part of that, it's very difficult to understand, you know, the tree of life issue. So the idea there is that there's, there's at least in principle, a substance capable of, of what, of conferring and mortality, but we don't have access to that. And so, and you know, part of the return to Eden, which is also the movement towards heaven, which is also the perfection of life, is to defeat death. Obviously into find the elixir of immortality, which by the way was the goal of the entire l chemical pursuit and that's what turned into science and well, what's the goal of science? Well, it's to make us healthy, wealthy and live, you know, conceivably forever. So you know, it's not like people aren't continually trying to get the fruit of the tree of life. Now there's a lot more to it than that,

Speaker 1:          31:00          the, the ending of that, but, but what you have there is the expulsion of human beings from an unconscious paradise into history. And that's exactly how the Bible is structured. Like what happens is there's these stories in genesis that are very, very old. There's the these stories. There's the story of Cain and Abel. There's the story of, of a Babel, the tower of Babel. There's the story of Noah. Then roughly speaking, although it happens a bit with no history starts because then when you get past that you get to the post flood period, select the pre flood period is so back in prehistory that it's all archaic mythology and the post flood period, which basically starts with Abraham, starts to become a history of the culture of Israel. So it's actually, it's actually literally it's the history of a culture instead of the mythologizing nation of radical prehistory of the past. So no, I think I'll, I'll also just tell you briefly the Cain and Abel story because we're there and we might as well do it. And this is, this story is

Speaker 1:          32:14          roughly speaking 12 sentences long. So, okay. So adamant. Any habit child came and add and eve says, I have gotten a man from the Lord. And again, she bore his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. So there's some antagonism between the, um, the shepherds and the farmers. And that's like there's always an between shepherds and farmers because of the shepherds, the sheep to graze all over the place. And that farmers want the shape to stay the hell out of the, out of the fields, you know, and that was all played out again in the American west. There was huge, you know, conflict between the farmers and the ranchers for exactly the same reason. So, and it came in process of time. It came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground, an offering unto the Lord.

Speaker 1:          33:04          All right, so this is a strange thing. So we've already talked about the discovery of time and the necessity for work. Okay? So, you know, we don't exactly know how people conceptualize if those ideas. It wasn't like they were cave men are all sitting around the fire one day and they said, hey, you know what? I just discovered tomorrow we should do something about that. We should get to work. It was God only knows how that happened. It came out of the inarticulate, biological substructure that is our past and started to manifest itself. God only knows and imaginative ideas, but one of those, imagine that the ideas is the idea of the sacrifice. You know, it's the conceptualization of God. The father as that, which extends across time and judges, then you make sacrificial offerings to that which could be of your labor. This is the fruits of your labor, but the difference is trivial.

Speaker 1:          33:52          It's like, look what I've done. Is this good enough for you? And believe me, you guys are asking that question all the time. It's like it's just nonstop. Is this good enough? Is this good enough? Is this sacrifice enough, you know, and what are you hoping for while you're hoping for the blessings of. Well, I would say for all intents and purposes, you're hoping for the blessings of God the father. Now you might think about it in pure cultural terms. That's fine. From a psychological perspective, it hardly makes any difference at all. The point is is that to conceptualize culture across time as a judgmental male is a really smart idea. It's a really, really smart idea. So. And then it's just judgmental mail that you have to make offerings to. It's like, yeah, yeah, that's, that's pretty much exactly right. Okay, so that's what's happening and so people are acting this out.

Speaker 1:          34:39          You have to make sacrifices. Cane brings some vegetables and fruit and, and, uh, able brings no, he brings like some lamps and these are the high quality labs right there, the choice cuts and uh, we know that partly because the firstling of the flock, so that's the first born, um, say lambs, they're there, they had a reputation as the most valuable and partly because of the firstborn son was the most valuable. It's the same kind of idea and there's a reason the first born son was most valuable and part of the reason is, is that unless you give all your land to one of your children by 12 generations, all of your offspring are living on something the size of a postage stamp and they're all starving to death. So it's unfair in a sense that it only goes to the firstborn son. But if it's an agricultural community, there's no better solution.

Speaker 1:          35:34          And then at least you can tell your second born son like, well, yeah, you're a fine guy. And you know, it would be wonderful if you could get something but you don't get it. And it's not your fault. It's not a mindful leader. It's just that's just the rule and so that's a good deal for everybody. You know, you don't get the farm, you have to go make your own way, but at least there's no enmity associated with it necessarily. So anyways, cane makes this offering that looks like it's about equality and God is happy about that and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering. Now the book, the story that makes this ambiguous say you can kind of guess that the reason that Abel gets away with it is because while a, he's bringing neat rather than vegetables. Okay, so that's higher quality, much more, much more nutrient dense.

Speaker 1:          36:20          It's much higher quality offering a food and then it's also the of the meat. It's the highest quality and so, and then the next thing that happens is it's acceptable to God. So you know, it might be the enabled just got it right and God was happy or maybe God's happy about able for some completely arbitrary reason it out it and it actually doesn't matter at all. You get value out of both interpretations. I mean, I would say to err on the safe side that offered the most valuable things is probably your best bet, but there is an art. There's some respect for the arbitrary nature of God to hear too. You can't exactly be sure why he's not happy with Kane. So anyways, it doesn't matter until Cain and his offering, he had not respect and Cain was very wroth angry that his and his countenance fall.

Speaker 1:          37:06          So like this is a permanent disappointment for him. He's angry, resentful, unhappy, miserable. All of those things he's failing. That's what it says. Fundamentally, like if God isn't pleased by his offerings, what happens is he's failing and this makes him very angry. And then the Lord says, what? What's up with you? Why are you angry and why has your face fallen the way it has? And uh, he says more, and this is where it gets. It seems. The story seems to reveal that this actually has something to do with Kane rather than something to do with God. So God says, if you do well, won't you be accepted? Well, that implies he wasn't doing well. And if you don't do well, then it's your fault. And so God is saying, don't, don't bring your damn problems to me, buck. Oh, it's like, if this isn't working out for you, it's because you're just not doing it right.

Speaker 1:          38:00          You know you're, you're not into this properly, you're not doing well. And also you're blending things that shouldn't be blamed. Now there's an interesting part of this. So the way that the story is sin lies at your door was told, it was told in a metaphorical structure and sin was something that was conceptualized as I lustful predatory animal like a cat. And so it was probably at Kane's door. That's the metaphor. And the idea is that cane allows this thing in to have intercourse with him. So there's this participation in like a sexualized merger. And so there's a, there's an implication there. And the implication is not only is there's sin out the door, but cain invites it in. And how's it creative relationship, like an intimately creative relationship with it. Now that's ridiculously smart because that's what happens if people are resentful because their offerings were either second rate or got rejected, you know, one of the pathways is first they get very, very angry and their accountant is false or they're resentful and hostile and then the next thing is, you know, the little resentful fantasy start to emerge and instead of thinking, Huh, that's not a very productive way to go because it is like a door.

Speaker 1:          39:17          They think, oh, let's just see where we can go with this. And like after five or six years of that, you're in a prime position to go shoot up Dawson College. No, you can go very far down that rabbit hole. And it's, it's, it's clearly motivated by the rejection of the fruits of your being by existence. That's how you're going to interpret it

Speaker 2:          39:39          so

Speaker 1:          39:42          well. And then so, so kane obviously he's not happy with that response. Not In the least because it says exactly the opposite of what he would like it to say. You know, first of all, that it's his own fault that he could do something about it and then he doesn't get to blame being and God,

Speaker 1:          39:57          so ken goes and has a chat with Abel and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother and killed him. Well, the first story about real human beings in the Bible is a murder. It's a fratricide and it's. It's the. It's the antagonistic brothers, one who is an archetype of good that's able, the others who have an archetype of evil and those develop across time. It's an it's an echoing or appreciate doing. That's another way of thinking about it. If the battle between Christ and Satan, because those are more. There are more purely archetipal figures and much more fleshed out, but it's the earliest manifestation of that idea. The hostile brothers and what you get. It's so sophisticated because basically what it says is that if you do badly or you work hard either way and God rejects your offerings and you become angry and resentful, the first thing you're going to do is go after the best thing you could possibly imagine and do your best to wipe it out and you might say, well, why would you do that?

Speaker 1:          40:57          Well, if there's a bunch of reasons, well first of all, it would feel good. Second, you get revenge against God because of course this is God's favorite, so if you can take him out of the equation, it's like that's a great deal. Third, the ideal against which you're negatively contrasting yourself is now gone because that's the problem with having an ideal. If you have an ideal, then you're unworthy and it that's okay. If you think the ideal is attainable or even if you can move towards it, but if all of a sudden the ideal is unattainable and you're sort of cast among the damned the probability that you're going to be able to view that ideal. Anything other than your enemy is very low and so cain kills them, so that's interesting because that really means that's the end of it. For cain, he's destroyed his own ideal.

Speaker 1:          41:45          Well, how do you live then? How do you live? If you've destroyed your own ideal, you've got nowhere to go, and so kane is so angry that he's willing to destroy his own ideal to obtain revenge and and, and, and that's 12 lines story right at the beginning of history and that's the layout for the spirit of humanity. It says, we became self conscious, our eyes open, we became self conscious. We recognized our vulnerability and an attempt to overcome that. We started to work and sacrifice, but the problem with that is sometimes that didn't work. Maybe because God was feeling particularly arbitrary that day or because we're kind of useless either way. When it doesn't work, that's not good because it's our only remaining defense. And so then what? Well then it's a choice. It's more, it's more choice right there between good and evil. And that's all foreshadowed in the first story. So now I'll add one more thing to this. It took me a long time to figure out, I thought, well, what the hell is the connection between the knowledge of good and evil and nakedness and vulnerability and an awareness, and I thought, okay, there's, there's production and there's evil, so the lion kills the foreign and eats it. It's rough. That's a tragedy.

Speaker 1:          43:05          Do you capture an enemy? And then you keep them alive for three weeks in pain before you kill them. There's a lot more there than tragedy that's malevolence. And then he might say, well, how is it that you can come up with malevolence? And I would say as soon as your self conscious, you can come up with malevolence because if I know how I'm vulnerable and I know that you're like me, all I have to do is figure out what the worst possible thing would be for me and then I can do it to you. And so you don't get the knowledge of self conscious vulnerability without instantly also obtaining the Norwich of the difference between good and evil. And that's also another thing that really distinguishes people because we can do things that are so terrible that they make any of the things that animals do look positively forgivable.

Speaker 1:          43:52          So you know that long without self consciousness comes this tremendous widening of the capacity for fracture from just natural tragedy, let's say just natural life to this whole spectrum of the ultimate in good and the ultimate evil. And then as soon as that happens, the first thing we have is a display of that in in dramatic form. And that's the Cain and Abel Story. Now, interestingly enough, and this is the last thing that I'll tell you, God doesn't kill Cain. We can talk about why that is later. But cain has children and s and keynes descendants, I think three generations down. So if you killed one again, sons, he killed seven of you. They kill seven of you. And if you kill one of keynes grandchildren, then they killed 49 of you and then and so forth until you get to this guy named Tubal Kane who is either the grandson or the great grandson. I don't remember which. And in tradition, he's the first person who makes weapons of war. So there's this idea that the sacrifice fails and that produces this descent into murderous resentment. And then that can amplify across a culture and possess more and more people until what happens is it finally erupts in full, full scale war. And that's more than territoriality, right? It's more than a territorial dispute because you can understand territorial disputes. This is territorial dispute with malevolence. And you know, that's something that you,

Speaker 1:          45:26          that doesn't need any explanation. We, everyone understands what that is.
