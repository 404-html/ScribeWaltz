Speaker 1:          00:00:02       That we will explore today is in many ways what I'm trying to figure out some of the deepest implications of what it means to be a human being. When we first formed the ocf worth our fellowship last year, one of the discussion, one of the very first discussions we had at our weekly meeting was one that dealt with how we see ourselves today, how we in our society and especially as students have lost something very sacred about ourselves and many currents of thought annual. Certainly in our hyper rationalized deconstructed postmodern world, one loses sight of the meaning of not only those things which are external to us, but in the process we fail to understand the very core of Rv. Many of you will know that recently Dr. Jordan Peterson has faced an amended set of controversy precisely for questioning the dogmas of our age and yet he has also stressed the importance of the divine individual and the Christian concept of the logos, which I will allow our speakers to elaborate upon today.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       A dear friend had told me once that one fundamentally divides orthodoxy from any other kind of videology is precisely this, the dignity of the divine individual and what this means for us as spiritual and physical beings. And so I'm immensely excited to be here. One are timeless, have to say the ninth. And so I'd like to introduce each of our panelists starting with Father Theodore across govopoly is uh, who is adjunct faculty of the Orthodox School of theology at the Trinity College. Uh, last semester he taught a course on the human person in Orthodox theology and Orthodox tradition. And in many ways it's something that touches upon orange, reduces the very core of what's being discussed today, what is the individual, what does it mean to be human? And he is also quite a positive presence at our institution fellowship and we certainly look forward to hearing his perspective tonight.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       Jonathon Hijo is a very well known icon carver from Quebec as well as an editor for the Orthodox Arts Journal. Many of us were familiar with the Jonathan and his work prior to this and so it was a great pleasure to have him here tonight and indeed it is entirely appropriate. Just this past Sunday, the Orthodox Church celebrated in the spirit of unity, the Sunday of Orthodoxy, the celebration of our triumph over iconoclasm. The tradition of iconography in the orthodox tradition is one of the theology and I'm very pleased at an expert on the matter is with us here today and many of you may be interested to hear Jonathan's online discussion with Dr. Peters and uh, the most recent one being concerned with one of the most controversial political symbols of this day, the metaphysics of Pepe, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson is a professor of psychology here at the University of Toronto. And I think it goes without saying that the activism of Dr. Peterson has inspired many in the room today.

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       Manny, who would have previously perhaps not even considered looking into the type of concepts which are going to be discussing today. Myself and many others have been deeply moved by not only Dr Peterson's insight on matters of a political nature, but also in his insight in human nature. The title of this discussion was influenced by Dr Peterson's usage of the constant of the Christian concept of logos and what that means for us as individuals. I'd like to thank Dr. Peters and for joining us and we are greatly looking forward to hearing more of your insight on this map. Last but not least, Father Jeffrey Ready, who was a co director of the Orthodox School of theology. Uh, the chaplain of Orthodox Christian Fellowship and the parish priest at the holy mirror is Orthodox mission, uh, located at Trinity Chapel from the very creation of our ocs last year on the Jeff. He has continuously blown our minds and enhanced our understanding not only of our orthodox spiritual life, but of ourselves as human beings.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       Apart from his remarkable Pesaro qualities, his wealth of knowledge and perspective has made it only natural that we would offer his perspective on this panel tonight. I'd like to thank all the Jeffrey for his work and great league. Look forward to hearing his perspectives tonight. So the format for the discussion today will be basically that each of our panelists will speak for for a time and this will be followed by a question and answer period. Each of you will have received a few hard, um, and each row has about two ends. So for the duration of the discussion, you can write down your questions and pass them up at the front and then we'll try to get through as many of as possible by the end of the night. And with that, I like to welcome Father Theodore Cross, give off lists to the podium to begin our discussion. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       okay, so there's not gonna be any mind blowing. Okay. That's reserved for Father Jeffrey. Thank you to the ocf at uft for asking me to come and to be up here on the stage with people that I kind of feel I feel outclassed. Definitely. Let's, um, I appreciate the invitation. Uh, so I was told to speak for like 10 to 15 minutes about what it means to be a human person in the orthodox tradition. So I don't know how possible that is. Um, but live just mentioned that, uh, in the past, uh, two days on Sunday, we celebrated any of the Orthodox tradition, the Sunday of Orthodoxy, which is the first Sunday in lent. Uh, for those of you who don't know what that is or don't know, we'll be celebrating that day, we celebrate the return of the holy icons into the church. Now, a lot of people who've been to Orthodox churches know that the church is full of icons and they wonder, well, when was there a turn and why was there a return considering, you know, to be ever not have.

Speaker 3:          00:06:00       Though of course, Christians have had images in their churches and in their places of worship from the very beginning. But there was a time that, um, there was an impression of the idea of using images as a, and it was considered for the idolatry, you from the church. And there was a faction within the church that I'm a font against this. And for almost a hundred years, a icons were burned, destroyed, and taken out of churches. And it was only with the seventh Ecumenical Council, uh, that they were returned. Of course. Why did we celebrate this on Sunday of Orthodoxy? And what'd we call it, Sunday of Orthodoxy is because those who are the proponents of icons, and of course all modern Orthodox Christians today knew that the attack on the depiction of Christ was an attack on the incarnation itself. Um, the idea that Christ is an actual mean actually existed actually live and lives.

Speaker 3:          00:06:53       He was an actual historical figure who live at a certain time and not a figment of our imagination as some people today would say. And this means that when we speak about God and when we speak about the trinity, when you speak about the second person of the Trinity, who is the son, the locals, um, as we were speaking about tonight, uh, we are speaking about a very specific person. And, uh, that is in contrast to many of the discussions that we see today, both in the Public Forum online, uh, that's symposia like this, uh, where we, where many people would like to think of God as an abstract for Orthodox Christians. And I would say for, you know, historical ancient Christianity, God is not an aspect that either God is an actual person, there's an objective reality, their prices and objective person, he thinks a certain way, speaks a certain way, act a certain way, even looked a certain way, and so we can depict an, an icon.

Speaker 3:          00:07:52       Now, the reason why I started with this and I kind of, you know, uh, begin, uh, my thoughts is a because there is a little bit of a contrast between many religions and orthodoxy. Uh, this is not, this is a generalization, but as generalizations go in many religions, whether they be Christian or not, um, the concept of God or the concept of the divine usually centers around the idea of the word of God. When the concept of God made text, and there are usually writings about this and writings that are usually very ancient, they're passed down. And the text is usually what is focused on even amongst many Christian denominations, it's all about the text. However, in the orthodox tradition, it is not about the word defending text, but rather about the word becoming flesh. I mean human being. And so our faith is not based on a text of rather on a deep mystical experience of the risen Lord throughout time.

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       Are you going to say, well, we read the Bible too, right? We use the Bible, we venerate the Bible. We have it in very high regard. However, for ancient Christianity, I love that cause I like star trek too. Um, um, when we, uh, when we speak about Christ and you speak about God, we speak about a living tradition, Christ and found a bull. Neither did he found the philosophy, but rather he found it a very real community, a living community. And the Orthodox Church, the last 2000 years is this living community that has never stopped with, has never ceased to exist. It was never a time where he did not exist. Um, we have no beginning. We have no reformer, we have no sounder. Uh, we have no school of thoughts, but rather a, we exist from the very beginning. So the reason why I say this is because our concept of God and our concept of our relationship to him is a very intimate one. And one that is in living for the last 2000 years. So,

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:10:06       going back to the idea of an incarnational theology and have icons, uh, if we are just saying that God is real, he actually exists. If we don't believe in that more than this talk doesn't really matter. But if we believe that God exists and that God is an actual person is a mine, his personality and that is Christ is God in human form, then uh, the reality is is that there is an objective reality to who god is. And by that we can say that there's an objective truth that'd be can speak about. And there is an objective good that we can speak about. And there is an objective understanding of the human being. It is not subjective but rather objective. And for us as Orthodox Christians, we tend to follow the model that was coined by seeing nothing else. The grades, same as fourth century father, the church, every theologian who said that God became man so that we may become God, not that we need to come, you'll God's like gone.

Speaker 3:          00:11:10       So for us, the goal of the Christian life is to emulate, right? It's to become Christ light. It's not about what I think of myself as a lot about why I want to be or what would I would like to create in my mind what I would like to be or what I think I am, but rather that there is Christ and Christ is the perfect human being. And I tried to discover what that is and I know that is diametrically opposed to the society that we live in today. For the most part, for the most part, that we live in a society that is a society of subjectivity, not object. And we live in a society that when he speaks about religion, speaks about spirituality in a speech about, speaks about theology. It usually refers to the subjective understanding of God, the subjective understanding of the human person as Professor Peterson has in the last few months.

Speaker 3:          00:12:02       Um, so when we talk about human identity, it is, um, it is something that is to be discovered and not to be kind of created or self created. So, you know, there's a, there's a writing at a very early second century writing in the church called the heat, which means the teaching, uh, one of the earliest writings of the church I guess we could say is one of the earliest manuals, um, uh, of how to be a Christian or the basics of the Christian faith, I guess you could say. And in the that he, it says the first line says there are two ways, um, one of life I want to death and there's a great difference between the two is the opening lines and a, and really when it comes to, you know, the, uh, the understanding of the human person from Orthodox point of view, we would say the same thing.

Speaker 3:          00:12:58       That there are really two ways to understand. There is either the revelation from God and how we emulate that or rather there's the movement towards the south towards self revelation, self understanding. And really, uh, we would say, um, self idealization and uh, and soul of course we as human beings are free to do whatever we wanted to do. Um, and we have free will. But how we use that and what we're, what do you do with it? And what you choose to become really depends on where we're looking for words, what do we want it to do and then, and who we want to be. So I would say that the, the modern existential crisis of our time can really be remedied by the simple statement that if there is a god, there's a God, I'm not him. So the understanding of that, if there's a god and I'm not, that him would mean that I need to discover who that God is and what he expects of me.

Speaker 3:          00:14:06       Why am I here and what am I supposed to do with my life? And that's diametrically opposed to the subjective understanding of that God is whatever I wanted to do or what I would rather him eat and go from there. So in pre modern Western civilization, um, society was predominantly, you know, society of these kinds of values. It's kind of objective truths. Uh, it was kind of like the social glue that provided stability for the family and social institutions and religion and, uh, and even business ethics. Like people believe that there was a good, there was a truth out there that we need to discovered. There was a god that we needed to somehow figure out who that God was. Um, and the humility that was required to set that we are not gods, uh, was what held all that together and the social and psychological fabric of society.

Speaker 3:          00:15:02       So without it, and this is where I think, um, as a peterson would also agree in has said many times without this kind of a understanding of an objective reality, um, there is an endless movement towards the individuals word, subjectivities, tours, what is relative and ultimately towards nihilism. Because if there is no objective meaning in life and there's no objective truth in life, then everything is whatever I made it and everybody has right? And really everybody is wrong. And then really what you have to listen for. So real ultimate meaning life. And so this is the problem, you know, and then there's a movement towards the delusion that everyone has their own God and everyone is free to create themselves in their own image. And this breeds and this fragmentation as professor [inaudible] said, a volt, socal individual truths and also individual identities. So if there is no god, as we said, this conversation doesn't really matter.

Speaker 3:          00:16:02       However, if there is a god and he has a personal God as a Christian his claim, then we cannot go on ignoring him without suffering a serious identity crisis. I believe that this crisis has arrived. And the question is how do we as Christians continued to see the world, see the word of God, the divine logos in those who refuse to see it in themselves? Like how do we speak to that? How do we speak to a world that doesn't even acknowledge that there is such a locals? But there is such a truth in the first place. This is, this is the conundrum that we find ourselves in the difficulty. How do we witness to a world that is not speaking the same language anymore? And I think that is uh, something that, uh, you know, discussions like this are, are super important and attend the first steps.

Speaker 3:          00:16:50       Because here we are attempting and I, and I applaud the ocf for doing this, attempting to find points of convergence between a Christian tradition, Orthodox Christian tradition and also um, the secular approach, psychology, sociology, history, biology, places where these things converge and they'd tell us and they preach the same truth. And this is why I was so enthused about coming and speaking today because watching a lot of Festo Peterson's, uh, uh, videos online, I saw that there are a lot of points that he makes that not only are congruent with Orthodox theology and Orthodox anthropology, but speak common sense to the world in a world that is completely fragmented, a world that is completely disengaged from the idea that there can be a truth outside of ourselves and that there needs to be some type of seeking, some type of understanding of what that truth may be.

Speaker 3:          00:17:58       The main difference between philosophy and theology I always tell my students is, is that philosophy comes from us. It is us trying to understand the world, trying to understand the metaphysical, try, understand glaad punters stand, anything you can philosophize about anyway, but the source of the human being, we have this wonderful thing called the mind is so powerful. They can do so many things, but that's philosophy. Theology heals with a revelation. He was with what has been revealed from outside the community of someone else and that's what, that's what the church has to deal with it. That's what the Christian, what does Shanti has to deal with the idea of what God has revealed in himself by becoming a real movie, becoming one of us have. We can't negate that as much as we try and to do so would mean to negate an important part of ourselves because we believe as tuition is like the say all the time and as would like to quote genesis where God says in the very beginning, genesis one 26 God makes man in his image and his likeness.

Speaker 3:          00:18:59       He gives us this great ability to shoots great of his ability to reason and to figure things out for ourselves and to decide whether we want to be like him or whether we want to be more like something else. So this is the great dilemma. It's not just a theological dilemma, it's not just a spiritual dilemma, but it's an existential dilemma and it's becoming social dilemma. You tell me a political dilemma I biological dilemma and a whole lot of other climbers. So I will end there. Um, I will let a folly Jonathan take it from here, but I think this is a general introduction to at least the way we see it as Orthodox Christians, that God becomes man so that man can become God. The words of the Apostle Paul, there's lot I who live but Christ who lives within. And this is our, our ultimate hope. Thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          00:19:50       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:20:14       did. Thanks cory. Appreciate it. I appreciate being here. I appreciate it. Being in Toronto, it's a great town. Today I spent the day going to the museum and visiting, so I really enjoying the city. I'm going to start with this story. Um, it's March, 2015 and uh, I'm driving good to pick up my children at some friend's house on Friday night and it's about half an hour drive. So I'm settling in and I'm listening to the CBC like I usually do. Would that particular evening, the content is not usually what you get on the CDC. So on the air, this University of Toronto professor and what are you saying rings a bit off from what I usually hear on that show. And at first he's talking about religion and religious symbolism and he's doing it in a way, let's say he's doing it without the usual smugness that we tend to hear when people talk about religion, especially about Christianity. And so here he is talking about Christianity, but I can tell he's not, you're not a priest, he's not a preacher, he's a psychologist, he's a scientist. And so as a talk on folds my, let's say my attention heightens, and after a few minutes, just a few minutes, I just, I can't believe what I'm hearing as this profits is going to stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel jumping to Shakespeare and Milton and Jerky and then to Darwin and Nietzsche and you'll and, and immediately I see what he's doing.

Speaker 4:          00:21:48       He has, I'm just trying to communicate information. He's dancing across this wide variety of references because what's wants to do is he wants to bring out, he wants to trace this underlying pattern and by doing so he's trying to awaken something in his listeners. He's not just trying to get them to understand, which is what we usually hear when we listened to talks. No, he's trying to provoke, like to shake people into experiencing how the world is built with meaning.

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:22:28       So he talks about logos, which is true, meaning express in words. This search for purpose and logos, transforms, transforms chaos and potentiality and to being and in opposition to this lies, deceit, resentment, gradually dismantle the world and plunge it into ever-growing chaos. I mean, of course he's taking this from the Bible, the Book of Genesis from the Gospel of Saint John Sprinkled with some phenomenology, but he's very clearly describing this process at all levels of reality at the individual. The interpersonal is social, political levels and this interaction between logos and chaos is the main manner we could say by which the world is constantly sustained.

Speaker 4:          00:23:27       So by this point, I am, I literally cheering in the car. I'm like, I'm hitting my steering wheel. And all I can think is who is this? Who is this person talking and why have I not heard of him before? Like why is he not famous? I guess we don't ask that question anymore. Right? And especially I'm like, how does he know this? You see like, so the attempt to help people see experience patterns of meaning and religious symbol is, or how it connects to all levels of reality. That's what I've been trying to do for years. That's, that's been my goal in life. I would say in my carvings and my articles and my talks, no, 10, there's only a handful of people that I know that I can relate to at that level.

Speaker 5:          00:24:15       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:24:16       And, and it's not that people don't talk about religious symbolism actually, a lot of people do, but usually when you hear people talk about religious symbolism, at some point you can kind of picture them in like a tin foil hats and then, you know, they, they soon extra terrestrials become part of the, of the discussion. Um, but not this guy, he's just as clear as can be. So when I get home, so I reach out to him and I send them just a little message. Uh, you know, just thanking him and expressing my surprise and linking into a few articles. I'd written a few talks I've given, you know, that was it. I didn't expect, I didn't really expect an answer, but then the next morning I get, I get a message thanking me for my message and pointing me to a few lecture that he had given more specifically on religion. I thought that's pretty cool. Like, that's, that's nice. This was random crew, Becker's sending messages to him. Um, but then about about an hour and a half later, I get this call and I can't do that. I can't do the criminal voice. So anyways, my memories, my memories of that moment are kind of vague, but I think I probably acted like a 14 year old meeting, Kanye West or something. And now his tone is one of surprise. Maybe a bit of confusion. And his basic question and, and he's been asking me this question ever since is how do you know this?

Speaker 4:          00:25:53       Because they listened to my talk and he saw the relationship between what I was saying and what he was saying and the talk. That's exactly, I had been talking about how logos organizes potential into experience been it's a, why am I, why am I telling you this? I mean, first of all, I'm telling you this as an excuse because despite with father, Ted said, here's this carver who standing on one theologian. Then professors though the reason why I'm here is because since then professor Peterson and I have developed this, this relationship. Some of you might've seen the interviews that we did together.

Speaker 5:          00:26:33       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:26:35       But mostly I'm telling you this because I know, I know that it nears the story of so many people that are probably here in this room and, and, and a lot of the people that might hear his, uh, on Youtube, we're in the podcast. I know that it years. And I know because dozens of people have told me of that experience, you know, I have this image, I don't know if people have seen it, of Joe Rogan hearing Dr. Peterson talk for the first time and his jaw dropping, you know, and all of a sudden he sees religion in a completely different way. And I've even received dozens of message from, I would call them in process atheists who say, you know, Mike questions. And my thinking had been tilted slightly in unexpected ways. And that experience I think has been strongest for Orthodox Christians like myself. In fact, I stopped counting the number of messages I received from priests asking me soap. It says, Dr. Peterson Orthodox or what? And to which I usually answer, no, he just likes dusty Fgli. And there was even one clergy, clergy men who who, who answered to that said, Oh yeah, he's Orthodox. He just doesn't know it yet.

Speaker 4:          00:28:00       With this correlation has been persistent. So what is this connection? What made the connection between a traditional Christian like myself and Dr. Peterson? So obvious, so immediate, and all of this I believes resolves around the notion of logos.

Speaker 2:          00:28:21       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:28:22       The language of logos is the underlying language of Christianity. Of course, we know the, the, the, the first vision of logos in Christianity comes from the gospel of Saint John. In the beginning was the logos. The logos was with God and the logos was God. He was in the beginning with God and through him all things were made without him. Nothing was made that has been made in him was life and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it. And this vision of logos would be continued and developed in the life of the church. And especially in the seventh century. There was a saint, his name is Saint Maximus, the confessor. And he really brought this image of logos I would say to it's most detailed or most elaborate vision. And he did so by taking uh, the notion of logos that was in the new testament and he, he brought and united it with the best of what the western tradition had already offered, who was able to prune, let's say what had come from philosophy and and join it with what the Christian message was. So it would attain some clarity and maybe some detail.

Speaker 4:          00:29:48       And so saint maximus explains that all things have a logos which are, which is its reason for existence, its purpose and its origin all at once and even its end. So it's all those things at once. And on top of that, each thing has a multitude of low g, that's a word we would probably never heard before. The is the plural of logos. And so the, the, the low being there, like the different qualities of things. So the blueness of the blue or the slowness of the slow and all of these logies are brought together. They're woven together, we could say to sustain the existence of the world. It's really a map of meaning to use Jordan's words. Now these logo, he's essences let's say, or things, they don't exist independently. In the same way that scientists, they leave things exist out there. Uh, rather they exist as they come together, as they're joined together in our encounter with the world. And a pattern we could say,

Speaker 5:          00:31:03       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:31:04       so we could say for example, like had a sunset, has a certain amount of low view, maybe even an indefinite amount of characteristics of a sunset. But as they come together to be the experience of this sunset, that's how we experience reality. That's how we come into contact with reality. So all these qualities, it's a light color, vertical, horizontal, and the things, the, the sun, the sky, the earth, all of these things. And I could go on, there's an indefinite amount of them. What's important and making that experience real is how all those logos are united.

Speaker 5:          00:31:49       So,

Speaker 4:          00:31:51       and in a way they're, they're united within us. And human beings for Saint Maximus are seen as this laboratory where the whole world finds its cohesion and he expresses it in the sense that the human being is a microcosm, if you could say a condensation of the cosmos, the place where the cosmos comes together to make sense in a good way to see it is, is that human beings actually participate being in the image of God, they participate in creation. We see that in the book of Genesis, the book of Genesis. God tells Adam to name the animals. And so by his logos participating in a limited way, in the same manner that the divine logos was the source of everything. And the human participation in this process is not a relativistic thing. Uh, it's not an individual thing. I mean though it is flexible. It's nonetheless the most objective of processes as father Ted mentioned. And so we need to be cautious though because Saint Maximus warns us that it's not just a philosophy or it's not just a technical description of the world.

Speaker 5:          00:33:15       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:33:16       This is important because thinking that religious stories are exactly the same kind of encyclopedic knowledge of modern science is the wrong way to go with this. These logos, these truth of most things are, or categories of our engagement with the world. So maybe today we might call them phenomena, fifth phenomenological categories.

Speaker 5:          00:33:38       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:39       So the discovery of truth of logos, it's a personal journey. It's similar. Tang is Lee or refinement of our understanding of the world. But at the same time he becomes a refinement of our person. So to discover the true nature of things is to walk on a path of truth. So food is a wonderful thing and it's useful for life. But gluttony leads to our destruction well is useful to accomplish important things, but avarice Ross the soul. So you see, it's not just a description of the world, it's a path that we walk as we discovered with world. And so sin in this vision of the world, that horrible world, that horrible word that no one wants to hear sin.

Speaker 5:          00:34:26       Okay?

Speaker 4:          00:34:26       Is it just the breaking of arbitrary rules, but it, it's in the misuse of the world. And that misuse of the world ends up being an untruth, ends up being a lie or, or, or something that's false. Something that separates things from each other. It's found when things are not aligned with their purposes. So for example, a person,

Speaker 5:          00:34:54       uh,

Speaker 4:          00:34:56       it's not only a tool for my own gratification person is not just a tool so that it can advance myself in the world. And if I treat a person exclusively like that, then I will inevitably sin against that person. I mean, of course, it doesn't mean that a person cannot act as it's cool for my gratification. If I go see the baker and I get bread from him, he's the method by which I get my bread. But the baker is not just a baker. He, he is a full person just as myself. So when we steal or we lie or we cheat if he, cause we're not considering that the person facing us to be a full blown person, to be what they are according to their logos, where we see them only as limited things only as tools.

Speaker 4:          00:35:48       So this is true of people of things and of actions. So I was thinking about, I was trying to think about the best example that I could think of to, to show this in terms of action and, and, and uh, I thought of giving the example of, of sex. So we did the metaphysics of peppa. And so I think we can get away with the metaphysics of sex, I hope. But it's a question that desperately needs to be answered today in our topsy turvy times, let's say. So what is the logos of sexuality? Well, it has many Loci, many purposes. It's for the propagation of the species. I hope at least a few of you still think that despite what many people would want us to believe,

Speaker 5:          00:36:37       it's

Speaker 4:          00:36:37       creates families and communities. It brings two people together and that type of communion in an expression of love and it brings pleasure those. So those will be, would be some of the Lobi I'm sure we could find more that some, those are the, some of the Loci that sex exists and there could be more. But yeah, idea in division of logos is that all those things need to be brought together in a pattern of some sort for them to be a path towards logos.

Speaker 5:          00:37:12       Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:37:13       so if we think of the different logo and we bring them together, trying to think of the word, what does that word when we, all those things are together, I think we have a word with a sacrament of the church. I'll let you figure it out. What it is. When all those things come together, and so each of the separate purposes of sex that I mentioned, they're not wrong, they're fine, but they do come alive when we bring them together. If we don't, then each separate purpose appears as a kind of false hood. It appears as a kind of lacking. That's not enough. Let's say for a truly traditional or a truly complete vision of sexuality, it cannot end. There has to move towards he infinite. It has to move towards God. And so the ultimate logos of sexuality is to be an image of the mystical union with God. I mean it's to be an image of our union. With that, with what is beyond us. I mean, and that image of the Mystical Union of God with the Soul, with cross of Christ, with his church, the marriage of heaven and earth is a completely traditional image we find in, in the church. Fathers are in our tradition.

Speaker 5:          00:38:39       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:38:40       And so that, that image of the ultimate union, the highest union with the infinite,

Speaker 5:          00:38:47       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:38:47       then it comes back down into the multiple lobe. All those other reasons for sexuality that I mentioned and it feels dumb. It makes them participate in the transcendent purpose and become the very relationship that binds them together. And everything in our life can follow that process. Work, food, sleep, ut. And to engage the world in that frame is, is to find light everywhere. To see life everywhere the world is no longer made of the dead, lifeless, dirt, the dead, lifeless material that you use to, to make things with. And as we become better as people, more truthful, more grateful, more free as he come closer to one another in love. And, and by the way, that's what love is. Love is the manner in which all different things, all different people, all different intentions, can join together and exist in communion and can become one while at the same time preserving the multiplicity. So as we follow this path, the hidden logo and creation, they shine through the world. And today we might say that they re-enchantment the world and the world appears bright and full and not the gray and dead shadows we often live in.

Speaker 4:          00:40:22       So that would be, I hope, a summary, let's say, of that path of logos. But I haven't really explained what the source of my excitement was on that Friday night yet. What the source of the excitement was that has caused all this flurry of attention to Jordan. And I can tell you I didn't thinking about this now for months now. I mean, some of us have, and Jordan has been thinking about this for months now.

Speaker 5:          00:40:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:40:54       And I, I think by now we can say that it's really not about gender pronouns. It's not, it's about something that is a lot bigger than that. And I think I can say confidently by now that it's about logos.

Speaker 5:          00:41:11       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:41:12       entire project or postmodernism. The last 30 40 years of higher culture and higher education has been a systematic assault on logos.

Speaker 5:          00:41:23       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:41:24       To decenter logos to deconstruct narratives and value hierarchies. So we are less slipping and sliding without purpose and direction. And now we've reached the end of what postmodernism has to offer. You can actually say we've, that we've come to a point where postmodernism has one. Basically the cultural debate and a philosophy was decries the center and certain certainty has pernicious Lee become the very center and unquestionable authority despises. So everything is upside down. Everything is inside out. Everything is becoming its opposite and all these inversions and chaos or not to be taken lightly, it has brought about a sterile age, literally stare while as people are not having enough children to to fill this society. I think I keep thinking that maybe they're missing a bit of fall census. Yeah. But it's also stair island that it has brought about this narcissistic and fragmented culture. You see, they told us that the center cannot hold.

Speaker 5:          00:42:48       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:42:48       And how things fall apart and now everybody's decrying the end of truth. All of a sudden, right? Everybody is saying that we're entering an age of post truth fake news. I mean my goodness. Even use it as an argument against Dr. Peterson, the debate on gender pronouns. It's the postmodernist that heralded the end of proof 40 years ago and now they're surprised to see the effect it has. How chaos does not discriminate. How is turning against them? Just as they turned it against their ideological enemies, he wanted to change the world to sin. Now they're surprised to find he's slipping between your fingers. What is most surprising and what is most shocking to them? He's defined that now having reached the end of their pursuit, having thought they had won. He see from within the decomposing residues of western patriarchy, he see that there is a seed that sprouting that in the darkest place, here's a flame that is lit, logos or weekends. The darkness has not overcome it. Saint John promised this, that my postmodern friends, if you had just paid attention to the stories, if you just paid attention to the stories which are woven in the fabric of our consciousness, he's very stories you tried to deconstruct, you would have noticed that don always comes. That is seed is always planted. The logos regains the center, Christ raises from the dead.

Speaker 5:          00:44:35       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:44:36       and I think that's the excitement we're feeling right now. The find that small sparks that seed of a meaningful pattern surprising us in a collapsing world. And it's not just a pattern of meaning, but it's the beginning of a network of people. I mean just in the past two years, there's a whole new strange group of public figures that's arising from the margins. People who are at least trying to figure it out, who are at least trying to think clearly and work out ideas and people who are as different from each other. As you can imagine spending across gender, race, and cultures, even religious and atheists alike trying to figure it out. And yet the media and the activists, they scream hysterically, bigot, racist, sexist, Nazi, all the usual litany of attacks and they're losing their minds. The sand is slipping out of their hand and it's only two years ago we would have probably collapse before this attack. But now you look around and we find that there is a still silent center which to sand in which to stand. There is an eye and the overwhelming hurricane and we can finally say, we will not accept your frame. We will not accept your definitions. They are weak by the very process you use to deconstruct them, to deconstruct the categories. And we will speak for ourselves

Speaker 4:          00:46:17       what a relief. But it is a dangerous time to time of transition. A time of chaos is, it is a dangerous time. First he, the enemies of logos will ramp up their hysteria and totalitarian tendencies as logos awakens, but it is also dangerous because that's Christ himself told us the terrors grow amongst the week. The recentering of logos is the reawakening of identities. He can't avoid that. And that's a frightening thing. Cause if identity stops at the relative low yogi without aiming, without uniting itself to the highest of high, it can be murderous.

Speaker 5:          00:47:08       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:47:08       And it has been increasingly murderous just in the past century. And it is in fact the very murderous and genocidal tendency of identity, which provoked the postmoderns to deconstruct identity in the first place. And there's a part where we can't blame them for that. I mean, in the shadow of Auschwitz, what else can you do?

Speaker 5:          00:47:35       So what

Speaker 4:          00:47:39       we'll strive from this new sprout hand on us will depend on whole of us. What will rise from this chaos you've seen excite me? Exciting, but also frightening possibilities of what that might look like. I mean, will it be race again so that we inch towards genocide? Would it only be nation? So we're tempted to revisit the world wars. Well, they'd only be gender lid only be class. The schemes run out first. My Saint Maximus, the ultimate identity, the place where all meaning finds its resolution is the divine logos, the source of everything. That is our trajectory as we walk. The path of logo says we are transformed by truth. The finality is to be united with God. And I know that for some people just the word God causes allergic reactions. And I'm sure people listening to this will be developing hives on their skin as the cause they hear this. Then maybe we can just think of it this way. For identity to be more than a weapon, it must reach its highest point in something that is beyond who ally. And so finding, seeing our highest identity in God is finding unity with everything and the source of everything.

Speaker 4:          00:49:02       And in terms of Christianity in particular, the identity was Christ is different from other identities because it's the identity with the cross and he needs to identify with suffering. I mean it's not the identity of a self serving power with the identity of a self emptying, power of power, bound in low at empties itself out of love. I mean it doesn't mean that we shouldn't struggle. Does it mean that we should just lay down and give up? Okay, you should let our enemies destroy what we value most and he cry. Christ bought, brought a whip into the temple after all. But what it really entailed would it w what's important about it, and this is something that is echoed profoundly and with Dr. Peterson has been telling us, is that we must first walk on the path that logos ourselves. We must embrace our own suffering in that truth. You must take up our cross. You must do so with a desire to first get rid of the lies which to blind us. Just straighten our own path and in doing so well that is how we will change the world. Since Sarah Finn was sorrow is known to have said save yourself and thousands around you will be saved.

Speaker 4:          00:50:26       As we walk that path, as

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       we strip away our own excesses rather than look, rather than looking at the imbalances of others, as we strip away our bad habits in our narcissism, rather than acting like victims,

Speaker 4:          00:50:43       the rule change and we will start to see and to experience logos to fully live within the patterns of meeting that constitute the world. If you take that journey, I guarantee that the universal patterns of meaning will manifest themselves so strongly in your life. Yeah. At first you'll use the word synchronicity, but soon you will have no other word to use besides here. And the postmodern chaos with vantage has wax melts before the fire and logos, very logos that rises from the grave will fill your world and the world with life and light. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:51:30       [inaudible] yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:51:59       so I'm going to start with a hypothesis. No, I spend a lot of time thinking about,

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       yeah, religious symbolism in archetypes, but there's, there's, there's a

Speaker 6:          00:52:16       problem with that and the problem is it lacks concretization notes to think about. The ultimate ideal is as, as only something that's symbolic. It moves away from the real world. And it's for partly for this reason

Speaker 2:          00:52:37       that

Speaker 6:          00:52:38       there's an insistence in Christianity that the logo says two things at once. It took me a long time to figure this out and I was guided in my attempts to understand it by Carl Young was truly remarkable person and probably orthodox in his fundamental conviction. So I would say he talked about the logo says the thing that existed at the beginning of time. This is a very particular way of looking at things. And so the idea is essentially that, as Jonathan pointed out, that there's something about consciousness that calls forth being from chaotic potential. And you won't understand what this means because when you look at the future, or if you look at yourself, you know that what you confront is a field of potential. And everyone tells you that. They

Speaker 7:          00:53:26       tell you you're not living up to your potential. And potential is a very strange thing because it doesn't. You have to exist. And so by the canons of the same modern science, it's not something that has any reality whatsoever, but everyone knows precisely what it means. And everything around it was full potential because you can interact with it and bring forth new things and you know that. And you can be called for your failure to do it and you, you, you, you call, you call out yourself for your failure to do it because you wake up at three in the morning and you, and you torture yourself with your inability to bring forth the potential that's within you and it, and it haunts your soul. And it's hellish. And the reason it's hellish is because it is hellish. And if you don't call forth the potential that's within you and outside of you, then in the world does transform to hell because that's its tendency anyways. And we've had no shortage of evidence of that in the last 100 years. It's, it's part of the Christian doctrine that at the beginning of time, the logos of Yahuah

Speaker 7:          00:54:36       operating on potential and brought forth habitable, the habitable world or, and it was perfect in some strange sense. It was the paradise in which Adam and Eve were placed in the paradise was a walled garden, a well watered place in the walled garden is a place of order and chaos, culture and nature. And that's because people inhabit a garden of culture, nature, that that's, that's our environment. And if those two properties are properly balanced and inside that garden, everyone can flourish. And human beings are principal made in the image of that logos.

Speaker 7:          00:55:17       And that's why we can speak things into B. And we do. And when you speak truth, then you speak paradise into being. And when you speak falsely, you speak heroin being, and that's the truth. And what that means is that with every decision that you make, you decide for yourself and for everyone else, whether you're going to tilt the world a little bit more towards hell or a little bit more towards heaven. And that's the burden that you bear for your existence and the choices that you make as you pass through life. And it's the fleeing from that. That's at the bottom of the nihilism of postmodernism and the escape into the totalitarian certainties of idol worship.

Speaker 2:          00:56:05       Okay?

Speaker 7:          00:56:06       And none of this is fictional because we've seen the consequences. Jonathan said quoting, I don't remember the source that there could be no poetry after, but that's wrong. But the poetry has to be about Auschwitz.

Speaker 2:          00:56:30       Okay?

Speaker 7:          00:56:31       The lesson for Marsh, which was never again and fair enough, but you, you can't decide not to repeat something terrible unless you understand it and way you don't understand it. Is that

Speaker 7:          00:56:52       the smallest things that each individual culminate in a great sense of the state. And so when you ask why terrible things happened in the world, the answer's quite simple. The answer is it's because you're not good enough and it's because you don't tell the truth. And you know, John, if it said something I thought was very interesting, it's something I've thought about, but I haven't talked to him about it at all. What happens as you move towards the truth and the answer is everything comes together. It really, really is. The answer is everything comes together. There's even a sexual element to that because of course, the highest element of sexual ecstasy is to come together

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       and

Speaker 7:          00:57:38       around someone who's telling the truth. Everything comes together and that's the potential guests, any of the world. It's something that you can partake in. It's the calls, it's the call to the [inaudible] greatest adventure that there is. You can bring forth something akin to paradise by speaking the truth and you can start in your own life and you can start it in the life of your own families. And these are people in principle that you love and so why would you do anything but speak the truth to them to protect them from reality? There's no protecting anyone from reality. Reality just is you interact with it on your, on its terms and you do that my face and get forthright and you do that by not shying away from the challenge. I spent a lot of time trying to understand the sermon on the mount. It's a very strange document. I'm going to tell you what I think it means. It means conceptualize the highest good that you can

Speaker 7:          00:58:41       and so you might think that would be the highest good for you and it would be the highest good for the family around you that you love. And it would be the highest good that family in the state and it would be the highest good for the state. In the world and that would be the highest possible. Good a bit that even though you don't know how amy, that make that what you want and then tell the truth and it's an adventure because you don't know what's going to happen. You have no idea. Because if you treat things instrumental, you treat people instrumentally, you use them as tools for your own desires and not. The problem with that is what do you know about what you've designed? Many things that you chased will turn out to be empty.

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       Okay,

Speaker 7:          00:59:22       well what happens if you just tell the truth?

Speaker 7:          00:59:25       Well, the world will unfold around you in very strange and mysterious ways and there isn't anything gets more exciting to now and it's perhaps something excited me enough. So that is suffering hits attendant on being would redeem itself. Why not adventure? And that's the call. That's the western call to the individual is suffering of being can redeem itself through truth. And it's not, it's, it's not a rule. It's not a proposition that you need to adhere to like a good citizen. It's, it's the proper way of when did your way through the terrible world without making it worse than it already is, and with the possibility perhaps of making it better. There's no more exciting possibility than not and no higher moral demand. And the thing is, is everyone knows that you know, when you lie according to your own conception of the truth, that there's something something shameful and demeaning about that and know that it hurts people and you think, well, why do you do it? Despite all of that, in part because it's easy and partly being, you do it because there's a crooked, horrible, hellish part of your soul that's more than happy if part of what you do is make everything worse to paid for the sin of its existence. And I would say we should stop doing that and see what we can do it, but got ourselves together as human beings are remarkable creatures. We put together an amazing civilization working out at half time. You know, it's like 55% of humanity.

Speaker 2:          01:00:59       Okay?

Speaker 7:          01:00:59       On a good day is working to make things better and 45% is working to make it worse than you wonder what would happen if we all just decided that we were going to make things better. As simple as that. Start where you are, make things around you better. Where would we be? What would the world turned into around a civilization of people who were genuinely trying to make things better? I can tell you, we better find out soon because if we don't try collectively to make things better given the current state of affairs, they are going to get a lot worse.

Speaker 2:          01:01:37       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:01:39       I thought for a long time, I wonder why people find themselves adrift and meaninglessness and there's a lot of answers to that. There's the classical criticisms of traditional faith and being put forth by brilliant people like Friedrich Nietzsche.

Speaker 2:          01:01:54       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:01:55       There's the idea that there were a fairy tales that people live by prior to the modern age and revoke girl knows and that's left this in a cosmo sticks bereft of meaning and so it's a consequence of the inevitable unfolding of a kind of counting rationality. And some of that's true, but there's a lot of it isn't true because I've also come to understand that the reason that's many of us proclaimed that life is meaningless this because we actually would rather have it be meaning less than to take responsibility for it because you can imagine this, you can imagine this scenario. Imagine you were offered a choice and this is because you are offered this choice. If you'd say, well, absolutely nothing you do matters and who the hell's going to know anyways? Million years and so you can do whatever you want moment to moment, right?

Speaker 7:          01:02:44       That's the payoff for that perspective. As you can do whatever you want moment to moment and you will not be held responsible by anyone including yourself for pursuing your heading, impulsive, immoral, foolish, destructive genocidal tendencies or the alternative is that you can assume that everything you do is meaningful and everything you do has an impact on the way the world unfolds and take responsibility for that and it's something that you'll have your meaning. All right? That's for sure, because you have an infinite amount of responsibility for every mistake that you make under those circumstances and perhaps as a, as a medic come in for that, the knowledge that when you're on the path properly that you're helping you world unfold and the best direction that it possibly could. Well, there isn't anything better than that. If you want something to set against the inevitable suffering of, of life, that's what you said against if eat endless adventure of trying to make things better in every possible way and God only knows where we could get if we did that around the perfect man, everything comes together and I don't believe that that's, that's, that's where the infinite logos that express, that stretches across time and space comes together in a single individual.

Speaker 7:          01:04:10       That's the Christian story. The reason for that is that every single person is embedded in a specific time and place. That's you as an individual, but at the same point, you're also the involvement of this thing that is active across forever to call chaos into habitable being. You're both his divine, eternal, transcendent essence and the finite shell that you inhabit. It's like the genie, right? A genie is genius and the genius is something that can grant three magical wishes, but how's to inhabit his tiny little space? It's the same idea. Well, you can act that out in your life and you can transcend it, and as you do that, things come together around you and everything becomes musical. That's the right way to think about it. And then everything becomes alive and you shy away from that because you're resentful about the fundamental structure of being and you don't want the responsibility and it's

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       no bloody wonder because the responsibility is the responsibility for everything. You know? That's why it's part of the Christian story, that Christ took the sins of the world

Speaker 7:          01:05:26       well themselves, because that's what you have to do in order to put yourself together. It's your fault. Everything isn't going right is because you're not good enough. Well, who wants that? Right? Welcome. The postmodernists has the lighten the burden, it consequences that nothing has any meaning, but that's a small price to pay to get rid of that particular burden. Well, maybe not. Maybe the meaning of life is to be found in your voluntary willingness to take on that burden and carry it. Right. Well, that's the notion that's embedded in the idea of the cross, right? To pick up a full conscious knowledge of your own vulnerability, your, your subjugation to be trail, your tear, your, your slavery at the hands of the state, your insanity and your mortality and to say, I'll bear that voluntarily. It's okay, I can handle it.

Speaker 6:          01:06:36       It seems to me that we're at a kind of crossroads. I don't know exactly why you always meet the Devil at the crossroads, by the way. And the reason for that is because every crossroads is a choice, right? And it's always a choice between good and evil. We're at a crossroads and I don't know why. I guess it's because of the terrible 20th centuries and it's energy and now we have something new. In the aftermath of that, it's time for everyone to pick up the chaotic pieces and carry them voluntarily and to make their way through the world and to try to speak their truth and to see what happens. It will

Speaker 7:          01:07:14       eel yourself, well, heal your body, heal your soul, heal your family. It'll heal the nation. That's what truth now is and how could it be any other way? The reality is the truth and how are you going to adapt to it without using the truth. While the problem,

Speaker 6:          01:07:29       his reality is the terrible truth and it's certainly possible that a terrible truth is its own medicine. With regards to my connections orthodoxy, I have kind of a funny story to tell about that. Oh, 15 years ago, a student of mine who, who I've maintained the relationship with since I taught at Harvard.

Speaker 5:          01:08:01       MMM.

Speaker 6:          01:08:03       I'd helped him through a difficult period. He, his family had been at the center of a real storm of publicity like this, a front page story for a number of months. Recently, he

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       returned the favor with me, but he proposed at one point that I fly down to Los Angeles and act as the officiant at his marriage. And I thought, that's interesting. I never expected that to happen. And so I thought, well, if I'm going to do that, I better get ordained because that's obviously the logical thing to do. And I thought, well, how do you get ordained on short notice? And obviously the answer to that and see you go online. So, so I went online and I, I signed up, I could name my church. So I did, I have this church, I'm the only member.

Speaker 2:          01:08:51       Yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:08:54       it's called the, it's called the Church of the spirit of St your chem of florists, which you know, isn't necessarily the name that you would expect. Um, I like to say Yo Kim, from what I knew of him, because he had this idea that there were three, he paused. There would be three parts of Western civilization and one would be the epoch of the father. And that's what was like the Old Testament and Old Testament reality that has to do with following rules. And then there was the park of the sun. And that was of course the equal Christian, he parking for the last 2000 years. And he believed that what would come after that would be the power of the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost is this weird

Speaker 7:          01:09:32       spirit thing hypothetic Christ's left behind in habit people and guide them on their path. And it seems to me that that's very much in keeping with the Orthodox idea that the proper, um, moral pathway for each individual to take is to attempt to bear the burden of the perfect individual, right to become Christ, so to speak, in an attempt to transcend more calorie infinitude into and to unite with God. And I thought, well, that was kind of a cool idea. So I thought, well, I might as well have that as a church. And then I thought, who should I be in this church? And I thought, well, poke was probably a little bit on the narcissistic side, let's say. So I thought I'll be nips or Paula.

Speaker 2:          01:10:17       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:10:17       Because I thought that was kind of archaic and House and sort of out of the way enough so that it was a good joke. So I'm my own metropolitan, my own church. It only has one rule. And so you can show you it if you want. Um, the rule is that if you're a member of my church, you can't follow stupid rules. Yeah. So that's a good rule because it's actually, it's an anti rule, rule lay, which is really funny as far as I'm concerned. Anyways, I went down to La and I did marry these two and you're still married and so that's good. Yeah. Yeah. So I know that's a good family, but it's been a long day. Um, I talked to Sam Harris today. Again, for those of you who it went great.

Speaker 7:          01:11:02       It went great. Anyway, so look, the idea is pretty straightforward, you know, as far as I can tell through this tremendous idea that's at the bottom of western culture that's taken the human race millennia and perhaps an endless amount of time before then, an eternal amount of time before then to formulate. The idea is that our consciousness, and that's the center of us, the soul, whatever that happens to be, partakes in the process by which creation comes into va. And we do that through the logos, which is our capacity to think and to other words and to engage in dialogue. But more importantly to do that truthfully and to the degree that we're able to do that truthfully, we bring paradise into being rather than hell. And it seems to me that that's as close to objective reality, although it's not precisely objective, it's more than objective reality to kind of Metta reality.

Speaker 7:          01:11:56       It's, it's the most profound truth that you'll ever encounter. And the thing that's cool about it is you can even, you can put it to the test if you want, you know, you start deciding that you're not going to lie because how the hell are you going to tell the truth? What do you know? You don't know what the truth is, but you certainly know when you're lying and you know how to stop doing that. So I would say, well just try, stop lying and see what happens. Try it for like a year. You don't get to lie about anything anymore. And that also means you can't do things that you would be afraid to talk about because you know if you're going to tell the truth, you have to tell the truth about what you did. And if you do reprehensible things, then you can't just run around telling everybody about them.

Speaker 7:          01:12:32       So it also means that you have, if not act in a way that you wouldn't speak truthfully about and try it. You'll find out first of all, that you're so full of lies and deceit that you just bloody wall can't believe it. When I started doing this 30 years ago, it really just about drove me crazy because I divided into two people in some sense and one person, one person was talking and the other person was watching, the person that was talking in the talking person was a puppet and the watching person was the right person. And every time the talking person said something to watching, first person could go eop elite that that isn't true, that isn't here idea. And I thought, wow, that's really not good because it looks like 95% of what I'm saying isn't mine. Or I'm saying it for show or I'm saying it can be dominant primate or unsaying it so that I can be, you know, so that I can use my language instrumentally and get what I want or, or you know, I swiped it from the book and I really don't deserve it.

Speaker 7:          01:13:28       But I'm saying it like it was horrible. It was 95% seriously. And so then I learned at least in part to only say things that made me feel like I was together. And that's a part of that coming together. You can feel that physically, you know, if you, if you say something deceitful, you shrink and you cower from it, it makes you embarrassed and it makes you weak. You can feel the weakness. So like, well stop saying things that make you weak. If you don't want to be me, then if you want to be strong, stop saying things that make you feel weak. Try it. Try it. See what happens. You can test this out and here are things will be way different for you in five years. You won't even be the same person and God only knows what will happen in the decades. So it's really worth it. We started, you don't have an embedded to do anyways because here you are, you know, suffering stupidly away, you might as well do something useful with your time while you're waiting to die.

Speaker 2:          01:14:16       So, and there isn't anything

Speaker 7:          01:14:20       I think more interesting to do than that. It's so cool because don't, I mean it's part of what I decided to do last September when I made these, you know, crazy videos, which really have more of a necessity and I certainly thought they would. I thought, well, I've got some things to say and why don't I say them and see what happens. That's sort of, that's an excellent way to live. Why don't I say the things that I think and see what happens. Well, this is one of the things that's happened. So that's kind of cool. I mean, how long likely is this? It's completely absurd and ridiculous. Here. I'm with Jonathan, this crazy French Canadian carver and these two guys in dresses here on you.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       Exactly. That's exactly what you'd expect given what I've been talking about recently

Speaker 7:          01:15:05       because it's very unlikely. And all of this is being very unlikely and life is very unlikely. And you know, maybe it could be absolutely magnificent, wonderful. We could make everything into a holy temple in which we did live forever, peacefully only searching for more remarkable and spectacular things to do next. And that's what people do with parents. They sit around dreaming about how the paradise they already had could give rise to a paradise that's yet greater than the one that's there. And with the collective imagination that we pursued, that could be a never ending thing. And we could bring it into being. And that's what we should do. Because the alternative is to let everything degenerate into chaos and hale. And how about we don't do that? Well, that's good enough.

Speaker 2:          01:15:48       [inaudible] MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:16:10       Thank you. To Metropolitan Jordan at Toronto. Um, I just wanted to quickly say,

Speaker 1:          01:16:18       uh, uh, following other Jeffrey's talk, we will have the question and answer period. So, uh, five minutes from now, uh, we'll have people walking by the isles taking your um,

Speaker 2:          01:16:30       okay.

Speaker 7:          01:16:31       Question sheets as well as

Speaker 1:          01:16:32       on the balcony. So, um, and uh, after Father Jeffrey, his uncle will have the question and answer period and if you have more

Speaker 7:          01:16:39       questions after that we'll collect those as well just

Speaker 1:          01:16:43       and if you're on the balcony, just give them to Aden. Thank you very much. And the different,

Speaker 2:          01:16:52       good evening.

Speaker 7:          01:16:55       Well, the Ted and I have had a, an a running debates over the last few weeks as to what would be worse going first or going laughs, how do I follow that?

Speaker 8:          01:17:10       The second century church did something rather strange and quite astonishing stories about Jesus, which had been circulating orally for some generations, began to be written down in the second half of the first century who are numerous versions in circulation, which came over time to be associated with the traditions of one or another. Epistolic witness to the risen Lord Jesus.

Speaker 8:          01:17:38       And at a certain point, a choice had to be made. The church could have come up with a definitive accounts, the single canonical version. And that approach was, was certainly a temptation. One of the first to do this was a dualistic heretic called Marcy. He settled on one Gospel, the gospel of Luke as it happens. You liked that, huh? Which he redacted. However, the suit, his vision, incidentally, he also rejected the entire Old Testament and the process teaching that matter was evil and therefore the creator God of the Old Testament was responsible for it. But the point here is that he wanted a single goal, spoke to reflect Jesus, who he saw as offering salvation from this material world that was a harrison. This thing, this idea of a single gospel continue to be a temptation even for those within the canonical church in the middle of the second century and otherwise quite orthodox believer rotation apparently scandalized by the plurality of the gospels, created his famous via Tesoro.

Speaker 8:          01:18:46       In this, he wove the gospel accounts into one seamless consistent narrative and it had some traction. In fact for some centuries, particularly among the Syria a tradition. This was the main gospel use, but the church rejected both of these attempts and from the beginning of the process of the canonization of the New Testament, it accepted that there should be different gospels leading the charge was the second century bishop of Neil [inaudible] who insisted or what he called the oven Galyon Techco Morpho the four fold gospel already in his days day. Those were the four gospels we have in our new test and today this is important, fully aware of the significant differences in the accounts, not only different emphases and theological visions, the contradictions the church chose to canonize diversity. It shows to retain for separate and distinctive literary compositions witnessing to the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. This is interesting for all kinds of reasons and of course it points to the experience of Jesus being more profound than any one account with capture but not least. And for our purposes and theme tonight, it also says something about the meaning of what it is to be human. As a new testament scholar, Luke Timothy Johnson drives the diversity of the Gospel. Accounts signifies the infinite recommended replicability of the story of Jesus in the lives of human beings.

Speaker 2:          01:20:27       Okay?

Speaker 8:          01:20:27       The story of Jesus is not simply a pass. The church declares it continues as the spirit of Jesus transforms the lives of human beings according to the mind of Christ, but in what sense can the story of Jesus be replicated? Surely not in the specifics of his ministry, which are irretrievably in the past. It's not about being a celibate, bearded Jewish male growing up in gallery in the first century Palestine technology. Someone who works with his hands like it's awesome. Father. Such historical elements are not repeatable. Neither are they important to the piece, rather the plurality of the gospels in their variety of and contradictory historical details. Oh, it's beyond all this to a deeper significance. That is to the meaning of the story of Jesus contained in these. It's not the facts of Jesus's life that matter and find new expression in the lives of others, but rather a pattern of his existence. Jesus' existence as one of radical obedience towards God and selfless service towards others forms a pattern for all humanity that can be written in the heart by the Holy Spirit.

Speaker 8:          01:21:48       It's this pattern that Paul designates as the normals. History often translated the law of Christ, but it's better understood perhaps as the pattern of Christ, the pattern of the Messiah. As an aside, his concept of the pattern of Christ etched into the multiform narratives that witness to the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. It was also the reason for the limits that were placed on what could be considered gospel. You see, a diversity was not just allowed but a requirement to express the fullness of truth. It was nevertheless a bridge too far and the rejection of the so-called gnostic gospels with which I'm sure many of you are familiar, was precisely that. They were not narratives but often just collections of safe and that makes sense. The gnostics were not interested in the material world, and to have a story requires materiality. There sacred texts as much as they purported to be about Jesus lacks precisely the narrative element of the passion of Christ.

Speaker 8:          01:22:55       Now, time does not suffice for us to explore together this evening. How across all the various writings of the New Testament, this underlying pattern of price, the or maybe each outline, the very brief list of sketches in the four gospels and the letters of Paul and the other early apostles. Behind all the collected facts, there's a deep consistency and the earliest Christian literature concerning a focus not on wondrous deeds or even wise words or on the character of Jesus as Messiah on the meaning of his life and death. They all reveal the same pattern of radical obedience to God and selfless love towards other people. They reveal a journey that plunges to the depths of alienation in solidarity with all and then rises in glorification, having not nearly overcome suffering, sin and death, but empty of their power. They reveal a pattern of joyful sacrifice, voluntary death, and glorious resurrection.

Speaker 8:          01:24:02       And they also all agree on this, that discipleship is the follow the same messianic pattern. They don't emphasize that followers of Jesus performs certain deeds or learn certain doctrines. They insist rather on living according to the same pattern of life and death shown by Jesus. To be a Christian therefore is not about dogma. We've been morality, although there are dogmatic and ethical implications. It's not about all that religious baggage. We so often associated with it. It is to live. It is for each of us to enact in our unique human existence. The numinous is to a pattern. Now, there are numerous ways we can describe this pattern of prize. For instance, the eastern fathers principal mode of exegesis of understanding scripture is tychology, so we can add to pattern the word pattern. Another word, depots or type. A type is a person and object or an event that is connected across space, time to others.

Speaker 8:          01:25:09       Without losing its own historical reality and identity, it shares in a greater reality of meaning, that greater reality, which it points a greater reality called the anteater. This is how the apostles and the church fathers read the entire Old Testament. For example, Adam Saint Paul says, is a t posts a type of Christ, the first created man pointing forward to the recreation of the human rights race in price Jesus. The exodus narrative as an event is a type of a true Passover or Pascal Christ, deliverance of old people from suffering and death in anyone is familiar with the writings of the church. Fathers are of the liturgy of the Orthodox church who know how abundant types are within them. But this is the key. Topology is not just a way of reading and understanding history in seeing how people and Events Point towards Christ. Topology is for eastern fathers the fundamental structure of reality of a world that is symbolic of an, uh, an epiphany or theophany of God and of our own apprehension of this reality, our own finding of meaning within it.

Speaker 8:          01:26:26       So it's not just figures from scriptural history that are types, we too are cold to typify Christ, to be symbols of Christ. Participants in his archetypal journey and life is dissent in self offering. And he's a scent you Lord. If we are to be truly human, we must follow what distinguished scholar of this university. Northrop Frye calls the u shaped story. That is the foundation, not only a biblical narrative and the Christ story, but a story after story, Myth after myth in Christ, the archetype of archetypes we have in the words of Cs Lewis myth become fact. As we've already heard this evening in the gospel of Saint John, of course, this pattern is above all called logos. It's not an abstract pattern, but it's a direct and in these latter days in the fullness of time had direct incarnate expression of God himself. The logos is the principle of order and creation as we've heard.

Speaker 8:          01:27:35       It's through the logos that God speaks and all things are made. It is logos, God's verb, perhaps better than word verb in whose image we are creators whose likeness we are called to attain. And the lesson here is simply this that are properly ordered. Human life is one lived in accordance with the locals. The concept of logos has a long and venerable history and it did even before the Greek translators of the Old Testament and the new testament writers appropriated it and one of the first hour, the first of the Greek philosophers to speak of logos was the pre socratic hereclitis and he said this to low bu the end. Those seniors who seen equally, although logos is common to all all have the locals, the many live as if they had a wisdom of their own. In other words, lobos may govern the University of Macro Cosmos and our own inner world, the Amico Osmoles, but most people don't choose a properly ordered life, a life aligned with the compass built into the fabric of the world built into their own hearts and minds.

Speaker 8:          01:28:54       We've heard already, we are now in the season of Great Lens. The great 40 days is at school and this has significances. It's a season of course, have a set of labor of renewal. If faith redoubling of our commitment to prayer and the service of others. It's also the season and preparing catechumens apap above over. It's the season where we're called to come to our sense and to awake to the fundamental meaning, shape and pattern of our lives. We realize our alienation. We repent with Tanya, we embark on our journey of return, a journey which involves self sacrifice, a journey which necessarily passes through our own voluntary death and resurrection. Lent is in essence the totality of our life, but it requires the remembrance of death. It was a famous practice in ancient Rome as a general came back victorious from a battle and during his triumphant parade receive compliments and honors from the crowd of citizens.

Speaker 8:          01:30:01       He ran the risk of falling victim to his own pride and delusions of grand jury. And to avoid that, a slave would be placed just behind him, whispering into his ear saying, hey, speech a post post-stay onm team momentum. We'll look after you to the time of your death and remember, you're only a man thereafter. It was enshrined and picked up in Christian tradition as Memento Mori. Remember that you will die, but better yet remember to remember to write and think we need that remembers, but maybe because eventually all of us will probably improve equal to the task but remember to die because remember to find and follow the logos, the pattern of our true life which passes through death to resurrection, very frequent theme and patristic tradition. Saint Gregory, the theologian often repeats the saying of Plato which suggests that the present life or to be a meditation on death and he advised his friend for luxurious to live instead of the present the future and make this life a meditation and practice of death and could go on from the church fathers, the focus on death is front and center remembrance of our journey that passes from death to life.

Speaker 8:          01:31:23       This is also the connection of lent with a preparation for baptism. Baptism in its deepest in primary sense signifies death and burial and resurrection with Christ. This is very clear in Romans chapter six the epistle which we read on the eve of Easter, Costco, we have been baptized into Christ death. We have been buried with him by baptism into death. We have been united to Christ in a death like his and united to him and as a resurrection like his. So baptism means death and resurrection. Saint Gregory of Nissa says the is both to and mother

Speaker 8:          01:32:04       you Orthodox theologian Paul Ever hemos writes about this is the extended quotation if you're there with me and just him, he says, means sharing mystically in Christ's death and his burial, but also in what happened between his burial and his resurrection, his descent. He's a hell. What is the meaning of the incarnation? God becoming truly human in Christ identifies himself with all human anguish, alienation, and despair in the garden of get 70 he says, my soul is exceedingly sorrow. Even unto death. You shares in the fullness of human pain. He enters into the fullness not only of human life, but if human death, and we are to understand Christ descent into hell as being the full expression of God's solidarity with our human alienation. Christ descends into the hell of human suffering. And if human loneliness, loneliness, a human despair, surely he has borne our griefs.

Speaker 8:          01:33:09       And carried our sorrows as we read in the book of Isaiah and we may add that Christ has worn all, all our silos. There was a total identification here and unreserved solidarity of priced our God in our human fallenness. He who is sinless yet became sin for us. He became one with us in our foreman's age as the Paul says, and that is part of the meaning of this descent into hell. All things are full of uh, even hell though I go down to hell, thou art there also maybe you so much, 38 so when we are baptized, he love continues. We just send it priced into hell. We also commit ourselves in solidarity with price to the scene. Total unreserved identification with those who suffer. Each of the baptize becomes by virtue of his descent into hell with Christ, a man or a woman for others. Each of us is called to bear the griefs of others is it carry their sorrow. He a Christian ne to be a human requires us to journey to hell. It is in use terms to journey to hell and become hell oneself. That's how we can make sense of the words of a great elder of the 20th century seems sort of Rooney who went as a young man, asked him, how will we be saved? Answered he your mind in Hell and just bearing on

Speaker 8:          01:34:41       why can't, why this archetyping descent before ascending? Why The you pattern of Christ that we must follow, um, as in how much her of physics, if you will indulge me. Let me offer a metaphor from physics. And I'm this from a scholar of Orthodox Christian liturgy. David bigger book archimedes was a Greek physicist who was fascinated by the mechanic and mathematics. The lever, and you may remember from your science classes and simple machines that are lever is used to exert a large force over a small distance. I exerting a small force over a greater distance at the other end or a child and that's lift with one hand and a man standing on the shore. And if the child presses down on the long, archimedes was so fascinated by the leavers potential. Then one day he famously swing, give me a lever and a place to stand. Am I? Shall move.

Speaker 9:          01:35:40       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:35:42       And he realized three things in order to move here, a long enough lever, a correctly placed fulcrum points and a place to stay. But that of course was the problem when it comes to moving the earth. How could he apply leverage to the world when he himself was standing on the world? How could he step off the thing he lives on in order to move it? He has no footing. So in philosophy, the riddle becomes known as searching for the archimedean point. That is an objective standpoint. Removed from the object of study is hypothetical point of perspective is thought to be far enough removed from something in order to afford an outsider's view of it. How can we remove ourselves to a point of site oh seven this is our human condition. A gustin defines sin as Info vacs was insane. Being curved in upon oneself. I like oriented inwardly towards self rather than outward towards scarf and others are egocentrism exert so strong gravitational pull that it bends the light of glory back on ourselves. That light that should be glorifying God. How can we move ourselves off center movie or the center of our universe? We have no leverage overseeing. We have new standpoint outside our vanity and pride. We have no rock on which to stand that is beyond ourselves. Interests, whoever desires to get outside himself, eat some sort of our Canadian points, the owns and stuff,

Speaker 8:          01:37:18       our self offering and are just sent to hell is precisely this archimedean point. If we are to lift the war, if we are to transform the world into a true symbol and epiphany of God's own life and when he was first, he said, we cannot lift up the world in sacrificial trace along as we placed in our footing on the world alone, it's like trying to lift the carpeting. Why we stand on it. Archimedes, his problem was applying leverage to a world that he could not step off of in order to move it.

Speaker 9:          01:37:50       Well, we can.

Speaker 8:          01:37:53       I dying with Christ. We freed from the roads. We leave the world's for the sake of the world. We die so that we in the world with us, they live. This is not nearly our spiritual life, our religious vocation, some crazy notion dreamed up by men with black dresses are true life. It is our proper life. It is our life ordered according to the logos and it is a journey we must undertake. We undertake not on our own, the only in Christ or Christ and Christ alone is the one who took that journey so that we could be reconciled to God. In closing, I would like to turn to one of the greatest in my own estimation, poets of the past century, one who saw deeply into these realities of locals and journey through death and resurrection. He his poem, the wasteland, Tsl, he depicts a bleak world. It's a world in which we fail to take up our journey, where we stay put amidst the civilization that's been reduced to a wasteland that has lost its fertility and its ability to bring forth life.

Speaker 8:          01:39:08       The world is filled. He says with a heat of broken images and the dead tree gives no shelter. There is no easy fix and certainly nothing in that civilization or society could offer. There no levels. It's such a world. Sound familiar to us today. We need to look at Elliot spinal work, the four quartets for hope of renewal and spiritual replenishing, telling me above this series of four posts. The last thing he wrote, he's inscribed those words of hereclitis that I mentioned before. Although logos is common and many live as if they had wisdom of their own elliot headset. The solution to our wasteland is not your new civilization per se on its own terms, but a journey undertaken in the pattern of the logos. He says this, it's a symbol perfected.

Speaker 2:          01:40:10       Yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:40:12       all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well by the purification of the motive in the ground of RBC CIBC, he goes on to evoke an image, this beautiful image of the fire of the Holy Spirit, purifying as a de horrifying the world is. It just says as a dog and he ends with this on a whole. For them in which descends to death is the source of life and meaning and transformation.

Speaker 8:          01:40:39       We die with the dying. See, they depart and we go with them. We are born with the Dead Sea, they return and bring us with them. The moment of the rose and the moment of the huge tree equals your Asian people without history is not redeemed from time for history is a pattern of timeless moments. So while the light fails on a winter's afternoon in a secluded chapel, history is now and be the drawing of this love and the voice of this call, we shall not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time through the unknown remembered gates. When the last of the earth left to discover is that which was the beginning at the source of the longest river, the voice of the hidden waterfall and the children and the apple tree. No, no, because not looked for but her half. It's still miss between two waves of the sea here. Always condition of complete simplicity, costing not less and everything and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well when the tongues of flame or enfolded into the crown at and off the fire. And the fire and rose

Speaker 2:          01:42:18       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:42:29       what an amazing engine to artists commissions. And I just get another round of applause for all our patterns.

Speaker 2:          01:42:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:42:45       so it's eight 47 right now, but just letting you guys know, even though a, the event says that the event ends at 9:00 PM we do have the room til 10, so we have plenty of time for questions. Um, so with that said, if you guys have anymore questions that develop along the way, you can just write them down and asked them up. And I always try to get to as many as possible and if I'd ask the questions that kind of answer as many other questions as possible. So with that said, and this question does not adjust to any analysts in particular by whichever of you feels like you would like to answer this question. Um, the do. So a statue in Rome depicts the suffering of the Trojan priest Lado Con, I'm pronouncing that correctly. And his sons, unlike the noble suffering of Christ on sufferer, lot of sufferings science seems neither awarded nor justified. Do these two

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       differing visions of suffering form part of the divide between postmodernists and their opponents and do the postmodernist justify their nihilism and or believe in other ideologies by pointing to the pointless suffering a lot of time and others like him. You don't have a harder question. He'll be answering this

Speaker 9:          01:44:17       like to anyone.

Speaker 6:          01:44:24       It's about sculpture. Well meaning, well, indeck is just meaningless suffering. Is that the core of the postmodern understanding goats, the problems in the world?

Speaker 9:          01:44:46       I don't know if it's at the core, precisely

Speaker 6:          01:44:50       of the postmodernists view. I think it's at the core of the problem that every human being has with manifesting sufficient faith to engage fully in life.

Speaker 6:          01:45:04       We look at our lives and the lives of others and we see that the one certainty is suffering and loss and we're at least in principle, the only creatures that are aware of that. That's really the story in genesis of Adam and eve. Right? Because Adam and eve wake up and become aware of their own nakedness there finitude your mortality and that throws them out of the paradise of being and that's, that's precisely right. That's the situation we all find ourselves in. The fundamental question is all that without ultimate meaning. And it's a very profound question.

Speaker 9:          01:45:42       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:45:44       The answer seems to be something like it's without meaning unless you take it on voluntarily. And I don't, I certainly don't understand the full implications of that answer, although I know that in so far as you can test that as a theory in your own life, it seems extraordinarily robust.

Speaker 9:          01:46:05       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:46:05       To the degree that it's a postmodern issue, I think that the postmodernists postmodernists feed us very thin rule because they offer nothing in the face of that suffering except the collapse of everything into the sound that Jonathan spoke up. That's the best I can do with that.

Speaker 9:          01:46:29       Great.

Speaker 6:          01:46:34       To Mr Patio, how do your icons and icons and general function on their day to day search for the logos?

Speaker 9:          01:46:51       MMM,

Speaker 10:         01:46:53       I think, I think they, there's many ways in which they function.

Speaker 9:          01:46:58       Okay.

Speaker 10:         01:46:58       Uh, one of the things that I did I talked about is the idea that the, the path of logos is a path of coming together. And one of the things that icons provide is that image of coming together. So when you engage with an icon, especially in a church where there are many icons and many saints, then you get that sense of uh, your path being one in which you are in communion with others. And so for Orthodox Christian, for example, when we prayed before icons, we, we, we pray before them because through the, through those images, we, um,

Speaker 10:         01:47:43       we can, we can, how can I say this in a, in a way that can, everybody can understand. So the image becomes a vehicle for the presence of that person into our prayer lives. And there's this relationship which is, which is set up. And so that's, that is how we live with icons and icons become a, a, a vehicle for that, for that path towards, towards unity. So I hope that helps. That's on, let's say, on a experiential, a sense, I think in a technical sense, in terms of the making of icons for myself, uh, for me that's what they have done exactly is that my struggle in life before I became orthodox was how to fit art that I loved into my life. How to make that fit and how for it to all come together. And in discovering the language of traditional Christian art, I found how here's this art, which is both grounded in absolute practical use in the lives of people.

Speaker 10:         01:48:44       It's, it's used in people's devotions. It's using the church to teach and to participate in the liturgy. Uh, and at the same time I can participate in that by making them, uniting me with, with the tradition of all the fathers before me uniting you with the church. And at the same time, these images, what they're talking about and what they're revealing is that ultimate reality, that reality that is beyond all realities. And so being able for myself, I feel great blessing to have the chance and have the, uh, the blessing of the church to be able to, to do that for a living. It's amazing every day I get to participate in that process. And so, uh, that's my other answer to that question.

Speaker 9:          01:49:31       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:49:34       Just quickly to add to that point, icons in the Orthodox church or not merely seen, but they teach us to see, um, you will have noted that there is a, they're not just an aesthetically beautiful medium. They have a kind of stylization even, uh, even though the mini styles of iconography, they share a characteristic and that there is something about them that forces the viewer to reflect and to come to a new way of seeing. So icons are not merely symbols as such, but they teach us to understand all of reality in that symbolic sense that I spoke of earlier, that everything ultimately isn't referencing itself. That's the problem that we are in. That things have become self referential, that everything in the world is an icon, is a symbol of God. And it's referring to something much more than what it is beyond itself without losing its identity. So icons teach us that vision not just depicted. That makes sense to teach us a way of seeing.

Speaker 12:         01:50:41       Just a quick reminder that I'm following up on a professional. Peterson said, um, there's the average person wants to take the easy route, right? So when you take a look at icons and Orthodox church, there's a lot of people who've never seen them before. They say, well, those are weird. They, they, they're not realistic. They're very strange looking. Uh, they're done on purpose because the icon involves you. Okay? It forces engagement with the local, well, we've been speaking about tonight because from the colors that are used to, you know, the subtle code that exists within iconography that, okay, if you haven't studied it, you wouldn't know. But if for the people who read up on it and begin to engage, um, it forces you to read the icon and to get deeper and deeper into what it's trying to tell you. Even the prospective. And Jonathan knows us very well in most icons, not all, but in most Byzantine icons, the perspective is even reversed and if those of you are taking basic art, you know vanishing point is far away, right?

Speaker 12:         01:51:41       Things get further away when you get, when you get, when you look, when you look into the distance and things get bigger when they get closer to you. But if you look at the geometry of an icon, a lot of times you'll see that it's reversed. Wait, why? Because the vanishing point is actually pointing towards you, towards the viewer, which means that when you look at it, you become part of it and the orientation of the icon is actually looking at you. You're not just looking at the icon. The icon is looking at you and that forces a type of involvement and it's hard work because if the learn how to read it, you can't just look at it and I don't want to contrast it as with with, for example, renaissance painting as as better or worse. It's just two different things. But when you look at renaissance painting, it's realism. It's just, it's there to depict what exists as it is. And there's not a lot of work there. There's a lot of work from us from a technical point of view. But to look at it, you know, there's, it is what it is. It stops there. Whereas the icon, as Jonathan was saying, it kind of reveals another world,

Speaker 6:          01:52:45       the world that could be the world that we would want to be. Um, and, and, and that is a beautiful thing because it's a constant engagement with, with um, with our hope in the eternal.

Speaker 9:          01:53:03       Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:53:05       This question is for Jordan Peterson. Can you comment on the cyclical or non cyclical pattern of history and if our society is doomed to decay or can it be renewed culturally?

Speaker 9:          01:53:17       Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:53:20       in order of society, state and laws.

Speaker 9:          01:53:25       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:53:33       Well, I would say it's cyclical at every moment. In some sense it's nested patterns of cyclicality and I think you can hear that best in the best representation I've ever seen of that is inbox Brandenburg concertos. Here. They're really worth a listen. Um, the new videos I'm going to release that I'm doing with interviews use Bach's third Brandenburg Concerto, which is an absolutely phenomenal piece of music because it its cycles and climbs continually and stays in the same place. I have no idea how he managed it. It's, it's absolutely overwhelming and that's what history is like. The apocalypse is always on us, right? I mean, you all confront an apocalyptic yesterday because you're all going to die and everything comes to an end and everything is continually regenerate it. And so that cyclicality is built into every moment. That's the u shaped journey that northrop Frye talked about too, which is order a descent into chaos and the reestablishment of order and everyone knows what that means in their own life.

Speaker 6:          01:54:40       You're somewhere stable where you understand everything and things are going well for you and then the rug is pulled out from underneath your feet and you don't know where you are or you fall into chaos. Someone close to you dies or you don't get the promotion you were looking for some dream collapses on you. You discover a new fault that you were never aware of before and you fall into this chaotic state. And in that chaotic state, that's the underworld of mythology and one of the suburbs of the, of the underworld, the most horrific suburb of the underworld is hell. Because when you go into the underworld in chaos, it's easy to become desperate and then angry and then vengeful and then murderous. And that that happens to people with a tremendous, tremendous frequency. If you haven't observed that in your own life, you haven't watched your own interior interior landscape with, with any degree of accuracy. And so that cyclicality is, is built into everything and it's the structure of, it's the structure of being that's the right way to think about it. And okay. No, I,

Speaker 13:         01:55:44       I think the optimistic part of that is that there is a spiral upward as far as I can tell her. At least there can be. And you get some sense of that when, when you participate in your own life, in the sense that you've found a good direction and that's, that's in viewing you with a sense of positive meaning. And I really regard, I don't regard positive meaning as a epic, phenomenal manifestation of a deeper material reality. I don't believe that's true at all. I believe that there is nothing more real than that sense of, of engaged meaning. I think your nervous system has actually evolved to tell you when you're in the right place at the right time. It's something that informs you. It's literally beyond your census, but, but it's absolutely central to proper being. You can tell when you're engaged with the world property because all of a sudden the world becomes worthwhile around you.

Speaker 13:         01:56:34       And that's, that's, that's not an illusion we'd been taught for so long. That meaning is some sort of illusion or an epi phenomenon. I think it's absolutely central and certainly no one ever thinks that suffering is an epithet. Nominate everyone acts as if their own suffering is the most real thing there is. And so, and a no wonder. So if you experience something that enables you to transcend that suffering or to justify it in your own life, which is that sense of meaningful engagement, why wouldn't you regard that as even more real than pain? The only thing more real than pain is that which can transcend it and you can experience that in your own life. You do that all the time when you were in the right place at the right time. It's a real thing. And I also think that's the place that truth puts you well now, how that relates to the cyclicality.

Speaker 13:         01:57:20       Well that's the pathway out of it. You know, life is order, chaos, reestablishment of order. And you could say, well, you're the order. Or You could say you're the chaos and lots of people or the chaos, or maybe you're even at Denison of hell inside that chaos, or you're the reestablished order and all of those things are reasonable things to be. But the most reasonable thing to be is the thing that constantly moves along that pathway ever upwards. Like, like that staircase at the back, which is what that represents. It's that spiral upwards. You know that leads us up into the beyond. That's the stairway to heaven and that cyclicality and and it's, it's, it's a genuine thing and you, you know it but you don't know you know it. And some of these stories, the icons that Jonathan produces in these stories that we've been talking about her are humanities attempts to make that pattern articulate and all we've really managed so far is to capture that image and story. We haven't enabled to make it fully articulate, but the time for that I would say is approaching because we need to understand these things consciously so that we could participate in them properly.

Speaker 9:          01:58:31       Thank you.

Speaker 13:         01:58:33       This one I suppose would be most appropriate for our reverend fathers. What role does Jesus Christ and the church play in helping us to become

Speaker 11:         01:58:42       more like God? Is it possible to become like God without this person and this institution?

Speaker 2:          01:58:49       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:58:51       One wants to start.

Speaker 11:         01:59:02       This is obviously one of the hotly debated subjects in Church history. It's also a major subject in the New Testament Teaching New Testament. This term and reading Paul recently and whole wrestles with this question, you know, how is it, you know, under the law, outside of the law, how do people, you know, come to uh, this sort of center of being this, this school film into a few manatees, potential human flourishing, you know, with or without Christ and I, you know, depending on how the is asking, you look at different, different answers. But I would just recall one of the main things from tonight, which is that logos is inherent. This isn't something that's been kind of concocted and positive as some sort of philosophical premise. Wouldn't it be nice if we all kind of agreed with this idea and then kind of move towards it together? Even if it was that it would be a good thing.

Speaker 11:         02:00:01       But it's so much more fundamental than that. Every human va, not just those who adhere to this philosophy has the image of God within them and is he is operating to some degree or another according to the logos. In fact, the eastern tradition would tend to argue that our very existence is good and therefore every human being is good in so far as they exist. If there was no goodness in us, we would not exist. Like the evil is eclipsing, not uh, actually tangible force, not a real thing. And so is it possible for someone without Christ to somehow come into touch deeply with logos within them, therefore with Christ? Um, I think the argument would be ultimately yes at them it was the best means would be too, to hear the Gospel proclaimed Jesus Christ is Lord and to respond to that in faith. As you know, the, the new testament talks about, but even apart from that, everyone already has locals and therefore everyone already has that pattern etched into their very existence.

Speaker 11:         02:01:11       And so that's how we could possibly see the capacity outside of the sacramental boundaries of the church. People coming to a position of, you know, harmony would there, would there be one of the early church fathers? Uh, Saint Justin martyr refers to a, and it picks up, actually this is a pre socratic idea. The, the logos, spare matticus the seeds of the word which are all through creation and so this is the fundamental essence of, of all of reality, not only in us but in all of creation. So he was dealing with the fact that people were pointing out, well, how come there's dying and rising gods in all sorts of different cultures? How come all of the things that you find in the the the Christian faith or already present in many myths and cultures and so forth. And he said, that's brilliant. You know, of course they are.

Speaker 11:         02:02:00       This is true. If it wasn't true, it wouldn't be so and so in that sense, absolutely. What we are trying to do as Orthodox Christians is simply live in complete harmony with who we are as human beings. This isn't an outside in position. This is the very core of what we are. This is the fulfillment and trajectory of creation. And so that's why it's coming back to the earlier point about how can we have this dialogue, this engagement with the world, with social sciences, with physical sciences, with pure physics and mathematics. We can do that because it all ties in any way. We, we are hoping as Orthodox Christians, we are in touch with what is fundamentally true of creation and of our own human person. So,

Speaker 9:          02:02:48       okay,

Speaker 6:          02:02:50       thank you for that too. Oh, I suppose Dr. Peterson would be best equipped to handle this, uh, are or, or anyone our union archetypes in accord with or opposed to Orthodox theology. I don't know too much about what that means, but maybe,

Speaker 9:          02:03:11       yeah.

Speaker 14:         02:03:15       Well, the problem

Speaker 13:         02:03:18       with answering that for me is that I'm by no means an expert on Orthodox theology.

Speaker 14:         02:03:23       So, um, but what,

Speaker 13:         02:03:26       from what I understand of it, I would say

Speaker 13:         02:03:34       you believe that you was a student of nature, right? It's something that isn't well known about you because most of the history of psychoanalytic thought was written by the Friday ends and they think of you as a student of Freud. And of course that's true human was really introduced to the idea of a profound idea of the unconscious through Freud and also at least in part to the idea that there was an interior world of symbols. But at the same time, human was a student of nature. And you see nature announced the death of God in the late 19 hundreds and what he meant by that in some sense was that he meant that the spirit of trees that had been instantiated by Christianity had turned against the, the Dogma of Christianity and destroyed it. And what he meant by that was that the emerging, the emergence of science in that context of Western culture and the elaborate description of physical reality that he that was developed as a consequence ended up in apparent contradiction with the Teresa, with the truths of, of our religious tradition.

Speaker 13:         02:04:48       And we pick the most developed truth and let the other one go. And nature was not celebrating that contrary to what most people think. I mean, when he spoke of the death of God, he said that it was an absolute catastrophe and that would, we would pay for it with millions of lives. And that was his prognostication for the 20th century, which happened to come true in precisely the manner he indicated for exactly the reasons nature believe that we would have to invent our own values because we had become, because the old values that we had lived by had had bled themselves out and die. But the problem with that, and this is something you picked up on, the problem with that is that you can't invent your own values. And you know that because all of you have tried on New Year's Day to decide that you're going to eat less than go to the gym.

Speaker 13:         02:05:40       And you'd think if you could create your own values, you know, being this sort of Demi God, that as soon as you told yourself that you would eat properly and go to the gym, you'd be up at six in the morning, you know, eating carrots and Rutabagas and then going off to lift heavy weights. And of course you're not, you're sitting in your chair at night eating cheetos and watching, watching pornography, you know, so how in the world is something like that supposed to create its own values? You're, you're not in control of yourself to that degree. And so yones answer to that problem was to, was essentially to, to look partly within and partly to look in the symbolic domain. And what he realized as a consequence of doing that was that there was a profound answer to the question of the resurrection of value.

Speaker 13:         02:06:28       And for him that was really the embodiment of the pattern of, of Christ. That was the self as far as [inaudible] was concerned, there was no difference between the, the architect will self and the symbolic Christ. They were the same thing as far as anyone was concerned in so far as Christ is the vision of the perfect man, right? Which is a symbolic vision. So you could say, well what is Christ? And the answer to that is while Christ is whatever you think of as the perfect man, now you're going to have diverse representations of that. So you could think about it Christ as the totality of the visions of the perfect man. It's something like that. And then that the goal of life was to embody that as deeply as possible. And you can also believed that the world would transform itself around you to the degree that you did that to uh, to, uh, to an unspecified double degree.

Speaker 13:         02:07:23       And that's where the symbolic reality and the historical reality unite because, and we know it's true. We also know this is true. If you look at people like Gandhi or you look at people like saussure knits and for example, these are great people who stood up as moral icons, let's say, in the midst of absolute chaos. And they transform entire civilizations by doing that, by standing up for what they believe to be true. They transformed the entire world around them. And of course, they're only partially perfect. Someone like Solzhenitsyn or someone like Gandhi or, or perhaps someone like Nelson Mandela, there only partial incarnations of perfection, but even to the degree that they were flawed, know they were perfectly enough so that despite their remnant flaws, they were able to reorganize the thing itself around them. And we don't know what the ultimate limit of that is.

Speaker 13:         02:08:14       We really don't. It could be that everything will align itself around people to the degree that they put themselves together and I actually have, I've had experiences that make me convinced that that's the case. I, I truly believe that that's the case. So, and that's also what gives me some, some belief in these strange Christian ideas about the harrowing of Hell and the overcoming of death. It's like we have no idea what we could do as individual embodiments of the logos, which is clearly what we are because we're all conscious. We have no idea what obstacles we could overcome and what, what massive transformations we could undertake if we actually lived our lives properly. God only knows what we could get rid of. We could get rid of malaria, we could get rid of schistosomiasis and the Guinea worm. Those are going to be gone soon.

Speaker 13:         02:08:59       Anyways, polio, we're going to get rid of hunger. Maybe we can get rid of death. Maybe we can get rid of hell. Who knows? And I know I'm certainly someone who believes that hell is real because I've read enough of the accounts of what happened in the 20th century to know precisely that it's as real as the most warped imagination can possibly make it. And that's plenty real enough for me. So well, so I would say humans vision is very much in keeping as far as I can understand with the central traditions of the Orthodox Church, because he believed that it was the highest moral duty of the, of the awake soul to participate in manifestation of the self. That's, and that's this union of things that the Jonathan talked about. That's beyond duality. It's, it's to bring everything in you together into this kind of harmony that then extends beyond you into your family and, and pass that it's musical. That's what music represents. That's why we find it so intensely meaningful. That's what music tells us. It's a, it's a, it's an artwork based upon the meaning of pattern and it, and it infuses everyone. You know what it's like to listen to music. Even the darkest punk rocking our anarchist atheist is overwhelmed with the glory of God when he listens to his punk rock music. So yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:10:23       Okay.

Speaker 13:         02:10:25       Just a quick comment on that. Um, going back to the central part of that question, which is about archetypes and with her they're the same, same thing. I would

Speaker 11:         02:10:34       largely agree with that point. Uh, to the extent to which anyone is in touch with the logos within them, they are going to be in touch with fundamental archetypes and those would be the same at the church. Fathers refer us to and and so forth. The one element that, and it's kind of relates to the previous question about can you do this without Christ? The thing which is the possibly the unique elements of Christian faith, Eh, it's not love. Love is what defines Christianity. In fact, love can be found throughout the world. It's more hope and what I know about young, which isn't all that much, but absolutely the archetypes are there. We'll go with that. Does he come with the same level of hope that we would as authors? I don't know. I mean, sometimes you wonder whether the Coteau Vasquez, the descent kind of leads us to a hell where we inhabit without hope and rather with despair.

Speaker 11:         02:11:35       Can we back to that point about a archimandrites software? Knee puts your mind in hell, but don't despair. Another was have hope. So is it possible to have that hope without ultimately what we have, which is the cross and the message of the cross as an archetype is that we stare into the depths of darkness and death and we proclaim light in life. In fact, you know that's what Jesus himself says when he refers us back to the old testament to when the people of Israel were dying in the wilderness, having come out with Moses and they're grumbling because they said we, if only we were back in Egypt where we had it so good. Of course the reality of Egypt was slavery, but they thought, no, no, we're just going to grumble and they're afflicted by serpents and the in God says this most incredible thing.

Speaker 11:         02:12:27       Put a serpent on a stick and hold it up. And those people that look at the serpent look at the source of the suffering and death will be healed. And so Christ says, Jesus says, the son of man will be raised up. So we have to look upon death and suffering. We have to descend into hell with light, with light, the light that it is never extinguished. Come back to the prologue of Saint John. I don't know whether that's there and younger and I can be corrected on that, but that's possibly the point where, you know, a, a purely social science or psychological approach might be lacking because I see the Christian virtue, Alex Sinners is hope because it's, it's almost unique in its capacity to look into everything that is so dark and say there is yet life. There is yet late. So one of the things that really affected young, who by the way worked for the American government, the CIA during

Speaker 13:         02:13:32       World War Two, um, sending them psychological reports on Hitler, um, young meditated for a very long period of time on what happened in Nazi Germany and young's the dictum that he derived from his l chemical studies was in [inaudible] tour, which I'm probably saying wrong, but it means the thing you want most will be will be found the place you at least one look. And so for young you, cause one of the questions you might ask yourself is that if enlightenment is possible, let's say if union with the self as possible, there's some sort of mystical transcendence. Why in the world aren't we just all that way? What's the barrier? It's like, well, we could be way better. Well why not just do it then if it's just right there ahead of us. But, but the answer to that is I think is something like you cannot conceive of how good a human being might be until you can conceive of how evil a human being can and will be.

Speaker 13:         02:14:32       And that means to encounter in yourself, the Nazi that the prison guard, the Auschwitz Guard to understand fully that there is no difference between you and the people who were killing children in the Nazi death camps that you, and that's that encounter with hell. That's literally that encounter with hell. You're a dentist and of hell. Insofar as you're capable of that and you are capable of that and there isn't anything I think that can scare you straight, except that knowledge you can be, you can be and are a vessel that can be used for absolute evil and you would participate in it, you would participate in it. And so for young, the pathway to, it's like Dante, you don't get to paradise before you go to the lowest levels of hell. Right? Right. At the bottom where betrayal lurks for Dante, that was the worst of all sins.

Speaker 13:         02:15:26       And so it's a terrifying process. I tried to teach my students in my maps of meaning class, which is the opposite of the safe space as far as I'm concerned. I, I, and I mean that technically, I truly do mean that. I tried to convince my students, I try to get them to meditate on the fact that they're that Damn Nazis. Really? Because what is it? It's, what is it? The Germans like come on. Really? No, obviously not. It's people. And so the pathway to paradise is through hell and that's, it's no wonder no one goes there. I mean, who wants to go there? No one. Well, if you don't go there voluntarily, you'll go there accidentally. So it's better to go there voluntarily because then you can go with hope. You can say, I can withstand this. Maybe I can find a light at the end of the tunnel. A question for Mr Pojo. Uh, you have spoken in the past about the contradictory

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       nature of symbols. For example, water represents both healing and dangerous chaos. Can you speak about how we can resolve this apparent contradiction and to follow up, how does this apply to the relationship between the internal mental world and the external material world?

Speaker 10:         02:16:52       You might have to repeat the second part of that question after I answer the first part. Um, um, I think, I mean, I, I've been, one of the things that has, as you said, that I've been thinking a lot about is the, is the duality of symbols. Um, every, every image, every symbol has like a dark and a light light side. And you can see it when you read the Bible, when you read the stories or even when you look at icons or when you look at images and, um,

Speaker 2:          02:17:24       yeah,

Speaker 10:         02:17:25       the, um, it has to do with, with, with this idea of a, of a cent or this idea of moving up because, um, what's important when we're in on the spiritual journey is the direction that we're facing. It's at, it's not so much where we are. Like if you can imagine the ascent of the world or of ourselves up to God as a ladder, which is how often it's represented in, in, in Orthodox icons as this ladder that we ascend towards God. Um, you could be pretty high up the ladder, but if you fall, there's no point, right? The idea is to ascend. And so all of the symbols that we see in m

Speaker 10:         02:18:10       in the Bible have those two sides. And water is a, is a perfect example in the old testament, all through the old tests, old testament water is an image of death, um, in the flood. Um, and then the crossing of the Red Sea crossing of the Jordan, he's, he's constantly this symbol of death. But the key to resolving the a duality of symbolism is Christ. He is always the key to all the stories I believe. And so when you look at the story of Christ and you see how he takes let's say, the dark side of a symbol and he flips it over and then makes it into something else. So that's the mystery, let's say, of baptism. You know, why, why would we have to be baptized? I mean, it's a very strange that this flood, you know, this Red Sea that the Egyptians were drowned in. Why would we have to be baptized?

Speaker 10:         02:19:07       Well, it's because the Christ takes this death and changes into, he changes it into a process of let's say washing or a process of purification. And so the same symbol, which is, which is death, can also be a symbol of washing. Um, so, so, so it's the same with fire. Fire is the perfect example. I mean, we look at icon, you'll see fire and hell. Then you'll see fire coming from the sky as the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. So how, what does that mean? Um, and so it's the same thing. Let's say you, you, you see fire as division. Well, there's a negative division, which is the division in which we scatter ourselves and we're, and we're, we're consumed. But there's another type of division that say the division of Pentecost, which is the division which embodies the multiplicity of how God manifests himself in the world. And so it just depends on which side you take each symbol. So I hope that answers that question. What was the second part again? Don't think about, okay. Yeah, I think I understand. I think I understand what that, what that means. Um,

Speaker 10:         02:20:28       I think it did well. It is my real, my belief that symbolism is anchored in experience. And I don't think that most symbols are not just these abstract things that that float above us. So for example, um, a good example would be, for example, the mountain you, we see in the Old Testament, we have this sense that Moses ascends the mountain and then encounters God. And then we see it repeated over and over in, in the patterns of the stories where Christ ascends a heel or a sends a mountain and then something happens. There's a revelation on the, on this mountain. And you think like, well that's strange, right? I mean, why would you want, what does the amount and have to do with anything? Um, and so I think the key is to understanding a lot of symbolism is to kind of see it as, as an, as an experience.

Speaker 10:         02:21:19       And so if you ask yourself, for example, what happens when I go up a mountain? Just physically, what happens as you go up a mountain, you, the, the, the base of the mountain, which is the large, this huge thing starts to refine itself. And then it starts to become smaller and smaller and smaller. And that up to you get to the point and then everything is one. And then if you stand at the top of a mountain and you look around when you were at the bottom of the mountain, all you can see is the trees and that are right next to you. And you can see a very particular part of the world. But if you ascend to the top of a mountain, then you have this vision of everything. Um, and so the symbolism of the mountain, which is found in the Bible and the Gospel in the icons is akin to the, the, the, the phenomenological reality of that thing.

Speaker 10:         02:22:14       So we often, it's difficult for us to get that because we're so caught up in a scientific vision of the world that it's difficult to understand the symbolism. But if you, if you just put yourself in the position of someone who does something or someone like, water's the same, I mean water would, would we do with water. We wash ourselves with water and what, what is washing? Washing is removing all the external and dead things that we have on our hands. So that we are purified. Well that's, that's one of the symbol. That's one of the, the, the symbols of baptism. So, yeah. So I think, I hope that explains that

Speaker 1:          02:22:56       this question isn't addressed to anyone in particular. So anyone wanting to answer can do. So, um, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the concept of free will. As many as many of the modern atheist believe that free will is an illusion. Uh, according to their belief in mature in materialism. How does one reconcile freewill with an omniscient God who knows the end from the beginning who knows your future and created you such that you were compelled to realize it?

Speaker 12:         02:23:37       So believe it or not, we get this question all the time. We get this question from teens, believe this. It's the perennial question. You know, if God knows what's going to happen cause he does, if he, if God is everywhere and fills all things, he is past, present and future, then how can you have freewill? And then of course all of those other implications, right? So know if, if I don't have freewill or if God knows what I'm going to do in the end. And then does he create some people too to go to hell or it could be away from him or not, you know, reach union with him and others. And if so, then how can it be love and all these other things. So, um, I think the fundamental misunderstanding is I would say the concept of time of a, of creation itself.

Speaker 12:         02:24:25       So the idea that God, we think as human beings in a linear way, right? We have no other way of thinking. So we have a beginning, we have a president and then we have an end. And this is the way the world works and moves in one direction. Um, we have no concept of God's reality and the idea of being outside of time, we have no concept of that. We wouldn't even know how to begin to think about that if, if we tried and people have tried. Um, the easiest analogy I guess for example, that I could, I could give would be, um, the idea of perspective and what do we mean by that? Let's say I'm the camera person here, right? And I'm watching this kind of whole event unfolding, um, after it's happened. So it's, it's been videotaped, right? And somebody else can watch this and they can watch this event and they can forward, they go back and they can back to see something that they really liked or something that they forgot or they can fast forward to the end and see how it all turned out.

Speaker 12:         02:25:29       Um, the person who is watching that, who is removed from that reality, uh, they can see what's going on and what's not going on. They can jump ahead in the past, but they don't cause it. Uh, it's just their perspective is different. So this idea, and of course this is kind of a crude analogy, um, of course it's much more complex than that. And it's much more nuanced than that. And, uh, and, and of course we would, we would leave at least as Orthodox Christians is that God is, is, is much more, um, permeates all things and is working in people's lives. Um, but there is a strange paradox between free will, the idea that we have the choice whether we want to follow God to believe in him, uh, or to believe rather than ourselves. And I think, uh, as professor [inaudible] said, you know, the reality of the hell that many of us live in and the reality of the hell that has been created by societies and civilizations all over the world is a proof of the reality of freewill proof.

Speaker 12:         02:26:27       Um, at least for people who believe in God. Now, if you don't believe in God, different story and then you would say, well, that's not proof of anything except that we're just, we're just animals living on this planet and there's no meaning to anything. But if there's a god and there are still horrible things happening, we'll either that God is, you know, an evil being or rather that we have the free will not to believe in him, not to follow him, not to do his will. Um, and, and that may seem like a horrible, horrible thing for God to give to us. You know, this idea of free will. Um, and yet it is also the greatest thing, the greatest thing because it's not only the idea of us avoiding suffering or US avoiding sin or US avoiding the evil that we created within the world, but is the idea of the, you, the idea that through our own sin and through our own difficulties, we somehow find meaning. And we, and we come up on the other side. So, um, I, I don't know how much better I can, can try to explain it. It's a, it's a complex thing, but

Speaker 13:         02:27:34       so in the mythological world, I would say there are three continually intertwined causal elements. One of one is consciousness. You could say that's the logos. One is the interpretive structure within which that logo's exists. And that's the framework that you used. Organize yourself cognitively within the world, your point of view. And then there's the world itself, the natural world. Let's say those three things are always in interplay and they're each given causal primacy. Um, you see this echoed in popular culture motifs and I think Pinocchio is a very good example of that where Pinocchio has it farther. And that's tapatio who's his creator? And he's a, so we're very deterministic sort of creature and he has a mother and that's the blue fairy that comes down from heaven who's really f a figure of the vitality of nature. And so Pinocchio is portrayed in the movie as child of nature and culture, which is of course how we're portrayed scientifically.

Speaker 13:         02:28:38       But, but there's a third element in that movie, which is really what drives the plot forward, which is Pinocchio's capacity to make choices. And that's his consciousness. And that's also what elevates him above the status of deterministic puppet. Now you might say, well, there's no evidence that we're not deterministic. And I could say, well, that's fine because there's also no evidence that we are deterministic. So we can leave that as a draw, but we certainly treat each other as if we have freewill. We treat ourselves as if we have free will. We even those of us who regard each other as deterministic, believe that or has determined to believe that in their own actions, they're going to be perfectly irritated at whatever choices you make that happen to infringe upon them. And they're going to act towards you as if you're an agent with free will.

Speaker 13:         02:29:26       So they can say they regard people as deterministic, but they don't act it out. So I don't believe that they believe it. And I also don't believe that you can produce a functional society without having something like that at its basis. And I've never seen any evidence of a functional society being produced with that, without that as a metaphysical presupposition. So, but there's something more crucially crucial involved here too, is that in order to accept the inevitability of determinism and human action, you have to accept the presupposition that consciousness is nothing but an empath phenomena of a deeper material reality. And first of all, we do not know that. We certainly do not know that what we know about consciousness scientifically, you could put in a thimble and still have enough room for another thimble. We know nothing about it. It's a mystery. We have not cracked at all.

Speaker 13:         02:30:19       And people have been battling away pretty hard on it from a scientific perspective for the last 40 years since it's become in vogue again. And I don't think we've moved forward a little bit. And then finally, so it's a mystery. And, and, and I, I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever that it isn't. I read Dan Dennett spit book on explaining consciousness and it does nothing of the sort. It explains it away. And that's that. And many critics have made the same comment. But I also think that phenomenologically speaking, it is the case that we seem to encounter the world as a field of possibility from which we extract out choices. You know, you think, well, when I talked to you about your future, I mean, you know what your future is. It's a branching set of pathways, which you can envision because you, you can envision the future. It's one of the very strange things about being human. It's a branching set of pathways of possibilities and you can pick from among them. And I do believe that's what you're doing is I do believe that the world is a well of possibility and potential and that you interact with it by choice and transform it, it within your limited power into what you wanted to be.

Speaker 2:          02:31:28       And,

Speaker 13:         02:31:31       and I don't think there's any evidence to the contrary. And besides determinism is a, is a scientific philosophy that probably lost it's vogue in about 1850. So, you know, there's no, there's just no reason to from a scientific perspective to describe human beings as deterministic creatures. There's no evidence for it. So we're partly determined obviously, because there's lots of things we can't do, but that does not by any stretch of the imagination mean we're fully determined yet. So,

Speaker 2:          02:32:07       yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:32:09       Can I just add to that that, I mean, first of all, that's a thoroughly Orthodox answer. I have to say. Um, we only can deal with what we have in front of us. I mean, picking up on Jonathan's point earlier about experience and our our own going forward with the church fathers tell us the contrary to this scientific notion of, you know, time moving forward at a kind of regular rate or anything that we might have conceived in our minds. It actually, each infinitesimally small moment of our existence is pregnant with infinite possibility and so it's precisely what has just been set that we have that within our grasp. If only we have the eyes to see it, the only we have the hearts and minds oriented to that, the logos guiding us then I mean the church fathers talk about the fact that we can actually experience infinity.

Speaker 2:          02:33:04       Okay.

Speaker 11:         02:33:05       In the tiniest of moments. That's what fails. This is all about, that's what coming into contact with uncreated energies is all about. In the, in the eastern spiritual tradition, that time and space are elastic. We knew that before Einstein ever even was born and that's what we have in front of us. So let's not get into philosophical arguments about how God works and how he sees his precisely other Ted's points. I mean that's irrelevant. What we know is that every tiny, tiny moment of every day and every space of this macro cosmos is the possibility of encountering the infinite and that that's what we have to reach forward and grasp. And that's what our whole tradition is about. And so absolutely, it is our position on that point. So we don't get into debates about predestination and, and, and not, it's irrelevant to us. We just need to grab a hold of God where he is, which is right now in this moment, in this space as we are.

Speaker 2:          02:34:05       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:34:07       Thank you very much father, and thank you very much to each and every one of our panelists. Uh, could I just get a round of applause for all of you

Speaker 1:          02:34:34       to conclude this night? Thank you to absolutely everyone for coming. I hope we've managed to learn a lot. This has been recorded. So just in case this was too much information to take in, which is certainly was for me, it will be available at some point or another. So once again, thank you all for coming out.
