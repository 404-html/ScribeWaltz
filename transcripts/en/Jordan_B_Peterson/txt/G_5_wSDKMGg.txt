Speaker 1:          00:00:38       Looks like everybody's here. For those of you who were, so does everybody have a copy of this? I rewrote. I'd been rewriting the introduction to this bearing script. I did. I do do. I mentioned to you before that it terms of techniques for writing an essay, the essay that you should put aside what you wrote. I do that all the time. So what you have here, let's see, in terms of payment on the first page, 1616 and a half, that stuff you've already read, it's hopefully written more clearly but from 17 and a half to the end of 18 is actually an outline of the argument in the whole book. Hopefully that will provide the transition to the second part of the course which starts today.

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       I tried to start the last week, but I had a hard time because I wasn't in the right sort of mood to discuss the sort of material and also because I've been working on the first half of this manuscript for about a year. I spent the previous year working on the second half, but a year ago was a long time. Can I forgotten a lot of what I was trying to say and it was really, it took more effort than I was willing to engage him last week and the week before to make sense of the chapter or contamination of the experience with death. I mean what I'm trying to do in that chapter is to describe the difference between consciousness and self consciousness and also to portray how mythology represents the consequences of the emergence of self consciousness. And I want to do that for a particular

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       reason. It's not because I'm really necessarily all that interested in that as a topic is sort of a precursor to discussing why it is that we differ in our emotional response was from animals. Why our emotional response to that I think are are more heightened and also maybe why do we were actually more conscious. So it's a lot of background work to describe that. Trying to figure out how self consciousness differs from consciousness. That's difficult. That's a difficult procedure in and of itself, let alone when it's just the basis of another argument. So let's go over the outline of the manuscript and hopefully that help clear up in your minds. Some of the things that I've been discussing. How can me help clear them up your mind, mind? Okay, so this is the basic argument. We'll really can be construed as a forum for action as well as a place for things.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       I want you to discuss that and be ready. I would say, well scientific methodology constitutes the formal process whereby we described the world as a place of things narrative. On the other hand, myth, literature and drama portrays the world as a forum for action. The two forms of description had been unnecessarily set it odd because we have not yet for the clear picture of their respective domains. The domain of the former that is the world as a place of things is what is from the perspective of interest, subjective perception, so we can get a description of the objective status of things by comparing a perceptions, the domain of the ladder as the domain of pathology describing the world as a forum for action

Speaker 2:          00:04:49       is what he is and what should be from the perspective of emotion than the action. You can see why those two things would have been confused because both in a sense are an attempt to describe what is, although myth also with to describe one should be and you can describe what is in terms of its implications for you and behavior, which is a perfectly valid approach. Or You could describe what he is from the perspective of objective description, which is also a valid approach because in both cases you're engaged in a process that looks similar. It's easy to confuse one form of description and its purposes with the other, and I would say, well, that's being basically that confusion has led to the dissociation of scientific knowledge from from moral knowledge or for mythological going one gen chem two they're unnecessary opposition.

Speaker 3:          00:05:40       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:42       I mean, look, either they're both valid and we don't understand how that can be or one's valid than the other isn't and it looks like all the evidence suggests that it's scientific if one's valid than the other is all the evidence suggests that the scientific knowledge it's smell seems a bit unreasonable given that all human conscious up to the European culture essentially 500 years ago lived according to the mythological presuppositions. We get pure science sciences. We also have a lot of my clinical psychology and in any, in any in designs we talk about basic research, but also applications. A sure. Talking about that second domain. I would say absolutely science is meaningless if it doesn't imply what you should do, but the application of science necessarily implies that you should. But I would say as soon as you're applying science to what should be, it's not science anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       I guess since it's side it's it's mythology that's operating under the guise of science and this all this explains for me at least why for example, there are, I teach personality course though. There's endless numbers of competing personalities. There's many of them predicated on completely different presuppositions. They all provide a coherent story more or less fairly coherent. As a matter of fact, even though they don't agree and the truth of the matter appears to be that if you're a therapist and you pick any of those stories and you apply it according to the rules of that story, it works about as well as any other store. I mean people don't like to admit that if their adherence of one theory or another and behaviorism seems to be good for per some specify things better than perhaps some other doctors, but I think you can understand that not from a scientific perspective.

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       So watch us from the perspective of mythology which is to say that if you've come to therapy and you have no story whatsoever, the provision of a coherent story for you is already an improvement over your current status even though you might not be being exposed to the basketball possible story so to speak. But I'd also say that this is part of the reason why there's such a problem in constructing psychiatric classifications from liberal illness cause they're not scientific at the bottom of them is some conception implicit or explicit. It's implicit in the DSM by design about what constitutes mental health. Because you have to define your own is in contrast to hell and as soon as you start talking about health, whether it's mental or otherwise, you're not in the objective domain anymore. You have to make judgments about what Pumpkin to the ideals. And I think this is part of the problem that psychiatric diagnosis has has not dealt with explorer. It's part of the problem with psychiatric diagnosis in general and has a problem. It's generally not dealt with explicitly, so if it's an applied science, it's pulling in some mythological presuppositions. I don't think there's any way around that. I think we just have to, we have to recognize that that's the case.

Speaker 2:          00:08:43       Okay, so you have the world as a place of things in the world is a forum for action as a forum for action. It appears to be composed of two, the three constituent elements that we've discussed in detail, unexplored territory, explored territory and the process that mediates between the two. If you analyze the characteristics, emotional responses of the human brain, that analysis reveals that the brain has adapted itself to the world as a forum for action as well as place of things. This implies to me the fact that this biological adaptation implies that the environment is in reality a form for actions. We'll also place for things, so that implies mean if you, if you buy the argument that adaptation does take place to the environment. If we've adapted to the environment as a forum for action, then it applies. The descriptions of the world as a form for action are in fact descriptions of something that's real.

Speaker 2:          00:09:41       I think that's a strange idea, but it still strikes me as as if you accept that preset positions, then that's a necessary conclusion. Each of the three constituent elements of the world as a four for action has a characteristic nature or personality and it has garnered mythological or narrative representations. As such, these representations have the structural aspect of natural categories and appear relatively stable across cultural place in time. It's unexplored. Territory is the great mother source of all determinant things. Creative and destructive, threatening and promising explored territory is bringing father cumulative ancestral wisdom simultaneously protective and tyrannical. The process that mediates between the two is the individual son of the great father and mother, the hero word who creates the cosmos. That's a Christian viewpoint and the adversary who spitefully rejects that creation about who we will talk for the remainder of the course group identification, which I think might be conceptualized as ritual limitation of the debt, protects the undeveloped individual from the terrible forces, that rural, unexplored territory, which is only to say that when you're on familiar ground, you're not anxious.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       You know what to do and the reason you know what to do is because you're imitating the actions of people who at some point in the past figured out what to do and transmitted that knowledge to you across the generations. And you also tend to act in the presence of others who also constitute your own culture, who are also beneficiaries of the same way as the men who therefore act predictably kind of these, the fact of the predictability, in fact that protects you from unpredictability. By definition, absolute identification with the group, however interferes with the process that maintains and updates the group and increases the likelihood that protective strategies designed to maintain the integrity of the group with necessary strategies will escalate into uncontrollable warfare. So then the question is, given that if you identify with your group too strongly, it will actually come to your group in the long run plus increase the likelihood that you'll engage in perhaps unnecessary and counter productive.

Speaker 2:          00:12:00       How do groups that surround him group? So why do people do it? What is it that motivates us to adopt absolute identification with the group? We know burke proof identification has its problems. I identified with a group and you identify with a different group of stage is set for our conflict, but we also know that you have to identify with the group. Yeah, so there has to be a balance struck while people, there are situations in which time balance is on your mind and people I talk to absolute identification with the group and you get the construction of totalitarian or authoritarian states and the Mo, the, the motto of a totalitarian state, his every one should act exactly the same way. So they're all, we're all absolutely predictable. That's what totalitarian means. Act The same way. You think the same way, look the same way.

Speaker 2:          00:12:46       Believe the same things in your individual. These absolutely constrained by your dogmatic identification and the advantage to that has been everyone becomes extraordinarily predictable because everyone is a clone. Fundamentally question is why would people do that? What's the, what's the attraction of absolute identification? Given that it's evident that such identification also has negative consequences, why would you bother with, well, that's what we're going to try to discuss for the rest of the class. What forces motivate us to subjugate our individuality to the group? Well then the question, the question immediately rises essentially what are the consequences? Like first of all, what is individuality? What does it mean? And second of all, what are the consequences of that individuality? And that's what I'm trying to address in the chapter on self consciousness and the contamination of experience with death. Where would you put something like a religious order in terms of group identification and individuality?

Speaker 2:          00:13:42       Well, I actually discussed this. Emilia invited me for dinner last night at the faculty dinner and this is something that we discussed there. I mean, it strikes me that the purpose of a religious order or any discipline for that matter is partly that the erection of necessary boundaries of order, I mean you have to have boundaries of order. What those boundaries are can differ. I mean to some degree there's, there's variation across groups, but the fact that the boundaries has to be that it's partly so that you can carve out a domain in which you're comfortable to act. But it's also partly because, and this is niches, observation primarily. If you don't identify with the group, you never, you never disciplined yourself, he never subjected to any discipline. And as a consequence you're never able to actually foster any sort of true individuality. So I would say voluntary slavery is a precondition for freedom and a dogmatic group or a doctrine, let's say a doctrine because that's less rigid, a doctor and is something to which you can adhere voluntarily.

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       And the purpose of that is that while and excludes all sorts of possibilities so that it's, that's it's negative aspect in a sense. But it also allows you to develop the skills necessary to do something. And so I mean, the example I always thinking about that's the apprenticeship or, right, so you want to be a concert pianist. What you do first is learn how it was that all other concert pianists essentially behaved in the past. Do you develop your technical skills and that means your, is that your individuality is essentially subjugated to it, to a discipline. Once you've got the skills, then you can transcend the limitations that that that discipline placed on me. So that's why I wanted everyone to read the abuse use and abuse of history because this is a, this is a problem that gt dealt with for a long period of time, despite the fact that he was a radical antichristian.

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       One of the things you constantly pointed out in his philosophy was that catholicism was net worth was a precondition to European greatness in a sense because although it was arbitrary and unfair and authoritarian and doctrinally bombed and destroyed, all sorts of useful things, it also forced people to discipline their other spirits in a sense. But their minds at least to, he said if you could learn to think one way in a discipline manner, then once you develop that ability, then you could use the ability to think and all sorts of different ways. But you never, you could never do that. You'd never have the freedom without first of all having gone through the disciplinary procedure, so like the jesuits were the Franciscans you would, would you consider it a totalitarian group? Well it would depend on the particular group. I mean groups tend towards a totalitarian groups tend to worst totalitarian status because partly because they have to for a group to last for any length of time.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       It has to protect its structure, which means it has to exclude information that would result in the undermining of instruction. So for a group to exist, it has to say, so to speak, this group is the best group and if you, and the best thing you can do is be an eminent member of this group. So that's a perfectly reasonable moral statement. It's just incomplete because at least as far as I'm concerned, because of the problem with that statement is that it eliminates the fact that in order for the group to maintain itself, at least some of the group's members have to transcend this limitation so that they can update the group, but there's a tension, there's a tension between the group and the individual that cannot be resolved or, or I think that's a, that's more or less reasonable statement. I mean, if you're, if you're a great newtonian physicist at the end of the 19th century, what that might mean is that you're actually such a great newtonian physicists that you undermine the whole structure of Newtonian physics. So there's a tension there and you'll see this in mythologies as well. Okay? No New Testament, for example, Christ is presented as someone who had mastered his culture, his dark truck completely by the time he was 12 that's why you could argue with the elders, the temple. So there's, there's tremendous theirs, theirs, theirs

Speaker 2:          00:18:08       recognition in that story of the fact that before a doctrine can be transcended, it has to be absolutely mastered, otherwise you risk otherwise your hero is so to speak, risks only me being surface heroism, which is, it's actually undisciplined rebellion and you're just using the mask and here was to hide the fact that you're on discipline from yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       See this, it's an important, I think this is particularly important for people and cultures like well like the north and North American culture because we tend to think, we tend to have a notion in our minds that I think was fed by humanistic psychology. Most pain in the 60s that groups are necessarily tyrannical. And what a group does is squash your individuality. That's true. Yeah, it does that. But the other side of the coin as well as its squashing it, it's also fostering it and there's no way that you can get one without the other. Although some groups are more totalitarian than others. So that's what it group does. It has to do that or it will disappear and if it disappears, well we know what the group does is it brings order to chaos. So if your group disappears then there's just, there's nothing but chaos. So you know, classic, ample viewpoint is that the cosmos is supposed to be property now it's right for there to be the proper meaning. There has to be the right amount of order and the right amount of chaos and I both, both things are absolutely necessary.

Speaker 3:          00:19:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:19:37       So I said absolute identification with the group is motivated by the negative consequences of the development of self consciousness. So I guess you see, all right, I'm interested in, I was interested in trying to answer a number of questions sort of simultaneous. Why is it that you would say you're in Neil Knox, that's a good exam.

Speaker 2:          00:20:00       Just say that you're a Neo Nazi. It's kind of a strange thing to say because if you're a neo announcing that the same as all the other agencies, so the you is almost disappeared entirely. You pick this group identification. Now the consequences of the group identification are that you surround yourself with a whole group of people think exactly like you, so there's no threat in the group whatsoever. All anomalous information is placed in the outside of the group. But the other thing that's interesting about being a Neo Nazi is that, okay, you're in it theoretically at least as far as your concern, because that's the best group to be a part, so you're very moral and upright as a consequence of your identification thing. That's peculiar is that it also gives you an immediate target, and the target is the target for all your resentment and hatred and cruelty and all those things that you wouldn't really think that you would have as the member of the most optimal conceivable group.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       Of course, you justify that to yourself by saying that all that cruelty and resentment, hatred is necessary in the service of the group ideals. But to see this makes me very skeptical and that's, so that's a rationalization as far as I'm concerned. I think the person that situation has constructed up the world so that simultaneously they can be protected. Although they're cowardly. They can be protected from anomalous information with the group identification and they can have all the advantage of those, of retaining their cruelty and resentment and hatred while justifying the morally. Now the question then becomes what, where does that, this is something I think psychology has real problem with cause we don't have, we don't have very good time grappling with higher order emotions like resentment or jealousy or cruelty. And we have a hard enough time with like base level emotions like anxiety.

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       So why or where does the resentments and cruelty come from? What's at the base of it? Why is it that someone would turn against, well let's not necessarily say turn against life, although you certainly do see that, but at least turn against large segments of life and attempt to stamp it out of existence. But that's why I tried to write this chapter on the consequences of the emergence of self conscious consciousness. So this is the basic idea. Development of human self consciousness has contaminated the domain of unexplored territory with the threat of death. It's not something that makes us different than out can. I think that the valence, we know from a very early age, it's hard to say how early or five maybe that we not only are able to react emotionally to phenomena that we can't predict. I mean we can do that when we're too and animals do that like a long ways down the phylogenetic chain.

Speaker 2:          00:22:39       We have added to that the possibility of inferring from the mere presence of the known that the possibility of our imminent demise or painful demise one, one of the two and that's something that's unique to people and I think that's a big, it's a very large part of what it means to be self conscious when that's the sort of thing we're going to try to discuss today. When you're self conscious, it means that you can view yourself as an object, although you're a subject, you can view yourself as if you were an object in relationship to other objects. And the thing about an object is that it's something that has defined characteristics, right? If you, if you can identify an object, you know its borders. So this book has four sides basically, and it's certain extension in space. That's what makes it an object. Well, if you're self conscious, what that means is that you can view yourself as an object that has limitations.

Speaker 2:          00:23:28       And we know our spatial limitations, they're not that hard to defined. Maybe even animals are aware of their spatial limitations in the sense theory, extension space. But the thing that really makes us unique is that we're aware of our temporal limitation, which is that if you have a beginning and an end, and that is something, I think there's no evidence for it all. And you know, we'll paint. It's something that makes us absolutely unique. And one of the things that that's done to us is height I think has heightened the emotional significance of the unknown. Because w you know, we know that well you see this say in hypochondriacal conditions, you know, someone has a, well maybe they have what a normal person would regard as a backache. And the normal person, so to speak, would say, well, my back hurts and the way they go to work, but the hyper can drive.

Speaker 2:          00:24:15       Gold person says, my back hurts. That's the phenomena. But the inference is I might die. And so you say, well, the anomalous information is the backache, but it's a window into a realm of unknown phenomena. One and t hen you know, those are known phenomena have a range of possibilities and the range of possibilities defined by death fundamentally. So I think that's one of the, when when we say that we're conscious are much more conscious than animals sort say self conscious. One of the things that we're saying is that the emotional valence of phenomena is heightened for us because we can understand cognitively the consequences of things that strike as emotional. So there's a theme that the way things are supposed to work is that so to speak, same report, you didn't exist it and recognizing something as anomalous. So you focus your attention on a message goes out to your prefrontal cortex and the messages, anomalous information, reconfigure behaviors so it goes away or be configured mode of interpretation so that it's no longer threatening.

Speaker 2:          00:25:17       That's perfectly fine. But if your prefrontal cortex then it says, Oh yes, that really is much more friendly than even then you might think as a consequence of your natural impulses. Then there's a feedback group that develops where you see this and panic attacks, for example, heart palpitations. Well No, I might die. Well, right. The whole system cycles out of control. The point being that the inhibitory mechanisms that have developed evolutionarily to help us conquer our fears can also be used to dramatically heighten them. And when we talk about the development of self consciousness, that's one of the things that we're talking about cause that's one of the things that implies selfconsciousness passable.

Speaker 2:          00:26:03       Well it's much less possible. That's the whole, that's one of the underground purposes of group identification. That's that's that's like underlying the argument that I'm trying to make all along. Why identify with the group subjugates years. That's exactly right. That's now. That's now, you see the problem with that is, is that, well, the question is in some part, well, what's the architect of self consciousness? What's the hero? Now this is a strange thing because it's pretty, it's very paradoxical, right? Because something that's self, something like us, that self conscious, part of that self consciousness itself, consciousness of vulnerability. And you think, well that's the opposite of something as powerful as the notion of the hero. But it's not at all. It's a precondition for heroism because courage, which is an essential aspect of heroism, is predicated on recognition of vulnerabilities, right? You have to know you can be hurt before you can be brave. Otherwise you just, well, you're just stupid basically.

Speaker 4:          00:26:58       Hey, saying two things. One of which I agree with though in that I'm going to show, if that's what you're saying, the first is that we can abstract a death. We can think about it and make racist, emotional valence,

Speaker 2:          00:27:08       right? It's also a defining characteristic of our b, the fact that we're vulnerable to it.

Speaker 4:          00:27:14       Okay? And the second thing that I hear you saying is that humans respond, uh, stronger to the presence of anomalies. That's right.

Speaker 2:          00:27:21       That's the argument I'm making. We, we, we react more strongly to the presence of a normal knee in general because we can make, we can make inferences about what the unknown might mean, which is only to say your plan for the future. And why is that? Well, it's because you can draw conclusions from the present, from occurrences in the present about possibilities that may happen in the future. For example, you have a healthcare program. Well that's because you've drawn the inference that uh, being such as yourself is vulnerable to a whole class of phenomena, which includes, well, certainly the possibility of illness. Any, any set amount of severity up to a fatal illness. So you, you make plans to take that fact into account. The fact that we'll do that, it's one of the things that drives us to construct cultures, I think. And that, and that's part of the argument I try and make as well. Why do people, why are people engaged in construction of cultures?

Speaker 4:          00:28:13       Okay. I, I, I still tend to to see it as I would, I wouldn't say that humans react stronger to the nominally because like you said, when a rat is presented with, with an an endless something in the cage, it freezes. And you rarely see humans phrase that's like that. But the reason is I think because animals cannot, don't have this cognition to be able to, to, they don't, you know, they can't necessarily remember or, or make these natural category as well as we can. And so what we would say is anomalous information, it only breaks certain levels and when it does break, you know, maybe we can break these levels consciously what I thought, but I wouldn't say that that, look, I'm actually stronger. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       Well I'm not, you're, you're, you're touching on another argument that we'll get to really near the end of the course, which is that although selfconsciousness heightens the effect of valence of something like the unknown, it also provides a mode of dealing with it that, that animals don't have. That's why, well, fruit, I can, I don't want to get into that part of the argument right now though, because it's very complicated and it sort of presumes that we've gone through all of this as a presupposition. So because self like I'll, I'll put it in very quickly. The Christian, the Christian myth essentially presuppose it's two things. One is that I'll, I'll, I'll talk a little bit about Buddhism, the here in a minute too. What is it that it was the development of self consciousness consciousness that knocked people out of paragraphs. So that's what number one, into the normal world and mass, the world is characterized by awareness of as manifested as shame, which I think is precisely equivalent to knowledge of vulnerability.

Speaker 2:          00:29:48       What else would it mean? And knowledge of death and knowledge of good and evil, right? All those things are congregating together and the genesis story, but the rest of the Christian story, so to speak, the rest of the story is how heightened consciousness can actually be used as an antidote. So the thing is is that although a small dose of something might kill you, a larger dose might curie and that's basically the notion that's that's under law that well that underlies adaptive mythology in general as far as I can tell, so a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. That's the apple at the snake provides this. You're like, God, you know who you are and what happens when you know who you are. When the human cases, you get all the knowledge of God so to speak, without any of the power so you can see your borders.

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       All of a sudden you know that you're going to die. You have to start making plans for the future. That means you have to work, which is another thing that happens in genesis as well, so you're condemned to work. The why you worked was because you can view the future as a place of negative possibilities, all of which are hypothetical. All of which you attempt to conquer even before they appear. That's planning and when you, when you start up grain for the winter is because you can perceive anomalous information where it hasn't even manifested itself in a sense. That's intelligence. We don't, we don't, we don't tend to to emphasize the emotional aspect of intelligence that much, but extraordinary anxiety I think is part of the force that drives intelligence. So anyways, we'll get to the other part of that argument lead. Okay. So I, I'm trying to make the point that the fact that people are developed selfconsciousness has made us much more susceptible to anxiety and also the curiosity, I think as it turns out than other animals are.

Speaker 2:          00:31:29       And it's also provided motivation for us to try to reject the fact of our consciousness in any possible way. And that provides additional motivation for adoption of an authoritarian stance just to save me. It's the fact of your ignorance and limitation that bring about all the painful things that are associated with, with hall humility basically. I mean, you think about the occasions when you have to admit to making a mistake, for example. It's very, I mean it's absolutely necessary, but it's very, very annoying. It's embarrassing as a matter of fact because because what it means to make a mistake is that you admit to yourself that you know that an essential aspect of your vulnerability, which is that you're obviously you perfect and so and so on. You have to actually make a statement about pattern. It is the case. If you want to embarrass someone in that space, what you do social ways, right. It's like there are doing a good job of hiding their vulnerabilities and just pop a little information that makes one absolutely evidence. They'll turn red fall into themselves, so to speak.

Speaker 2:          00:32:30       That's one way of dealing with that is to try to read you one way of dealing with it is to try to rid yourself of the of your individuality as one of the things group identification serves. Okay, and the contamination of the unknown with the threat of mortality. I can animal a deer or something. It's in, it hurt her and her dad. If they see a why am nearby or honestly, herds of envelopes will raise quite quiet lions. Your, as a general rule, the lions have to manifest a particular pattern of behavior before the lopes become afraid. And that's not really because there are, it's not because they're afraid that the envelopes would kill them. It's because they're hardwired to recognize a particular pattern, predatory behavior and responding to it with fear. And if antelopes were self conscious and could think they'd get the hell out of the way, and whenever there was a line anywhere near and they don't, they're not afraid of death, they're afraid of the, normally we're afraid of anomaly, but it's contaminated for us.

Speaker 2:          00:33:30       It's contaminated with the possibility. It's not just death. That's just the biggest aspect of it. But it's all imaginable suffering basically. And that's what you know how your imagination can grip on to things. Say It's, you know, if you were alone at night, that's a good example. You a little bit less stable than you might otherwise be that day. Some little nagging thing is worrying you. It's easy for your imagination, take that little chunk of information below it up and you know any number of possible ways. So it seems like Brandon was the anomalies either either gives you this emotional balance or you're here, but as humans had this huge array of, of, of, you know, we're normally it down here because we can track these, these, the stories that protect us, but then the thought can, can bring us, can titanus to, to the level where we might need it to get us the heck out of.

Speaker 2:          00:34:18       Well that's, I mean I, I you're referring to the possibility of moving the information stored of up and down levels of stories. While I think that's one of the things that's another one of the things that are cognitive flexibility has allowed mean it's, it's a negative thing in some ways because it does, it means that you can make a mountain out a molehill. It's positive for all sorts of other obvious reasons, but maybe look regards to her original, what the threat of death does for civilizations. You think about the Egyptians in the Egyptian spent their whole time essentially dealing with death. That was the basis of their whole culture. I mean, there are civilizations were devoted in large part towards construction of these massive pyramids and that took a lot of work. It took a lot of cultural energy. We know some of the methodology behind that.

Speaker 2:          00:35:07       I mean for the Egyptians, the Pharaoh was the intermediary between heaven and earth. And to the degree that you participated in the life of the Pharaoh, you were granted at least partial status, the partial status of having an immortal soul. Well, that was a potent enough motivator for the Egyptian so that, you know, they engaged in what was essentially a recreational cultural activity. You can't really define what they're doing in terms of any simplistic notions of, of making sure there was enough to eat or any rational economically motivated, uh, ideas as far as I can tell anyways, a lot of work into building those, those more than monuments. It's the same thing was true for this medieval Christians. With regards to the cathedrals. Often those were the constructions of those cathedrals sort of equivalent to in a sense to that can alter the space program and the 1960s height of technological endeavor and you know, a lot of our cultural activities motivated by fear of death because we plan then it's not just, yeah, it's vulnerability in general.

Speaker 2:          00:36:07       All right, so the idea is this, the fact that the development of self consciousness has meant that for us the unknown is contaminated with threat of death has much more extreme emotional valence for us than it does for other animals. Now, one of the consequences of that is we're much more motivated to plan for the future and to construct how to construct cultural structures in general. The other thing is we're much more motivated to get ourselves away from any information that's anomalous, to reject it, to protect ourselves from it. And that's one of the things that underlies our temptation towards the adoption of authoritarianism as an authoritarian says in what's that? The basis of authoritarian is it is either the personal adoption of omniscience hit inhibitors cases, Darlin's case, or it's the secondary adoption of omniscience and uneven, more cowardly mattered in someone like Hitler, at least this is the way I look at it.

Speaker 2:          00:37:08       He was sort of out on the front lines of the authoritarian struggle and someone could have taken a shot at him at any time, but all the followers of hidden and they've got to identify with his power and his beliefs, not actually putting themselves on the line and that's the essential nature of an authoritarian stance. Yes, I know everything that needs to be no. So if you offer any information that's forward to my foreign, to my my particular theory, it's obvious that you're an agent of, while we say an agent of chaos, way something to be eliminated as is as efficiently as possible. Hence adoption of omniscience. That's where the authoritarian is a means and the motivation for that is that if you know everything, there isn't anything unknown and if the unknown has this sort of vantage, you can understand why people are motivated to get rid of it.

Speaker 2:          00:37:58       Now the problem with the development of an authoritarian personality, this is why I wanted you to read Milton because the note in this parable, paradise lost, is about the consequences of the adoption of the numbness in stance. That's the devil sin, right? So as I will be like, God, I don't want to take the place of God. As soon as that happens in Middleton story, devil's cast down into to help where and you can get out of it at any time just by admitting he was wrong, but he won't have been. He was wrong. And the reason for that is that if he admitted he was wrong, you have to face all the chaos that he'd been avoiding. I think it's a good, this is one of our fries meeting of the same parable. It's a good or a little about the rise of states.

Speaker 2:          00:38:38       Like in union, there's a cumulative evidence gathered up over the course of it. I mean it was certainly, it wasn't evident by the fifth. Harmony doesn't look at working with certainly evidence by the end of the sixties it still took another 2030 years before the system. Well, it's not like people gave it up really. It's just more like the, it just, it wasn't even self supporting anymore. Couldn't go on any farther. They wouldn't admit to any anomalous information, which was inflammation that would suggest that there are particular theory was wrong. Having just not, it's not as if it's a stance that only characterized as communists that certainly it's just this is the stance of authoritarianism in general. Hell, you know, while we've talked about so far. Yeah, and the constituent elements of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:39:37       Okay, awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:39:47       We've only talked about positive aspect of the individual, not the native aspect. That's what we're going to talk about. The positive aspect of the individual methodology is the part of that voluntarily admit to the existence of the unknown and that admission is a precondition for the next stage, which is creative exploration of that unknown and then its transformation into something that's either irrelevant or something beneficial. And then communication of that among the group while on the question is what's the, what's the pattern that's opposite to that? And you can't sum it up in a, in a sentence or in a few words. It's like these other, these are all natural categories. Natural categories are full of all sorts of big related information so to speak, and I actually think this is the reason why mythology Ken's to present these different domains of the world as a forum for action as personalities because the personality is something that's very complex and it's got lots of different levels of motivation, lots of different potentials for action and the adversary of the hero is a personality.

Speaker 2:          00:40:48       Christianity left personalities, the devil one, it is the case. This is a claim by yell yet anyways. Then Christy I think has the most well developed notion of the negative aspect of the individual potentially arguing. Anyways. All right, I wanted you to read Milton's. Well, the funny thing is if you look at, if you look in the old and New Testament, there's, there's almost no reference at all to the mythological figure if the devil just like a few sentences and that's it. And the entire book. I mean all of the methodology that we all vaguely know about what describes the devil, that's all. It's dreamlike imagery that sort of surrounds the canonical writings of Christianity. It's all storytelling and mythologies. Milton tried to codify it. It's kind of interesting. I would say, well, why did this develop? And it's because people have always been fascinated by what constitutes the essential aspect of evil and the theory that we'd be discussing in this class suggested evil for the sake of argument.

Speaker 2:          00:41:52       It's a pattern of action and a pattern of interpretation leads to actions. We tend to those patterns of action, although we see them in story form. First of all emerged from the forms of behaviors and people observe the behaviors and told stories about the papers and so on. Until we got to the point of abstraction where we could construct an image about the pattern of the say, well, mythological representations of the devil. It's not just the devil, but the negative counterpart of the hero throughout history are our cumulative attempts to formulate it. Image of the pattern of behavior and interpretation that characterizes all of the negative aspects of the individual. So we're going to try to figure out what those attributes are. Well, one of them is, this is the why. I think perhaps the one milton stress is above all else is pride. And that's refusal to admit to error.

Speaker 2:          00:42:45       And what does that mean? If you think about it means that refusal to admit to error, his refusal to admit to the existence of anomalous information, it's precisely the same thing. Yes. And you know, it seems to me to figure out too, because all you have to do is observe yourself in the course of an argument. So you're arguing about someone arguing with someone about something that's meaningful to you and, and you know what you're wrong. Because you know, sometimes they'd be either their argument is just so much more destructive than New York or you know perfectly well that the moral ground they stand on, it's much firmer than yours. It says, well, the thing that stops you from admitting to the anomalous information, which is actually that you're nowhere near as good as you think you are, the thing that stops you use pride.

Speaker 5:          00:43:31       Why is it pride and arrogance for that matter in the context of the devil and who was telling the stories and what context, why is it simply the refusal to submit to the authority well into the authority of God? Look often white interpretation instead of the

Speaker 2:          00:43:50       well, okay, that's a good question. Look, there's been a lot of books written lately by Elaine Paige Hills for example. She wrote a book about the devil and she basically said that the whole concept was extraordinarily dangerous. It was primarily a Christian concept. She said, Perp, the function of the image of the devil was essentially to, uh, to allow Christians greater ease in and defining and bills who didn't hold the same beliefs as them as an entity in there. I mean, you can see that, you can see the rationale in that argument. I mean, it's, that's what happens. As soon as there's a war, the enemy gets demonized. Well, it's not as much of a leap because a stranger is an of chaos anyway. It's chaos has a reptilian aspect, so to speak. You don't have to push people very hard before they're willing to buy that interpretation.

Speaker 2:          00:44:39       What I'm trying to say is that basically is that the least natural categories may tend to merge and Meld and mixed together sort of helter skelter in our heads. They're not very well defined and they have fuzzy borders. Now it's very, it's very simple for someone to say all those individuals who do not accept established order our prime of facie agents of the devil, and you can understand why they would say that because if you don't accept establish order, then you're a threat to stability and you are an agent of chaos. Fine, but the problem with that line of argument is that by that definition you can't distinguish those who update the group from those who want to destroy it. Right. Is that in fact quite often couch, yes it is difficult to tell, but if you want to make a categorical statement about what constitutes the essential aspect of evil, you can't say that evil is the process that undermines the group because you can't distinguish the process that undermines the group from the process that updates it and you know the process that updates it is the board.

Speaker 2:          00:45:39       So whatever evil is has to be something else. So like people also tend to like, I would also say that in the Old Testament, one of the great sins for the ancient Hebrews was making idols on go on, which is essentially the say that it was considered immoral to categorize something light go on. In terms of something that was actually understandable, you always had to allow for the transcendent aspect of God. But I would say that people make the same mistake when you're discussing evil. They want to make an idol out of, which is to say they want to make it the thing that's definable. So it might be the process that undermines established order or it might be a aggression, might be jealousy, might be whatever. Because know there's all sorts of emotions. It might be sexual desire and that's being demonized time and time again, that's making an idler well, I would say just as just as you have to regard the individual, no one has a thing that can be defined, but as a process, which is to say, I would say in archaic language of spirit, you also have to do the same thing with the negative aspect of the individual process.

Speaker 2:          00:46:48       No one other thing, and it's the process by which an almost inflammation has rejected. So is that a reasonable answer? Does that satisfy your question? Well, the thing is low, it's confusing and what we're trying to do to some degree is clear up the boundaries of these natural categories because it's very easy for the figure of the devil, so to speak, to take on the aspects of the tyrannical aspects of a border and also the negative aspects of chaos. I mean Girtha described the devil knows the strange son of chaos and we tend to think of anything that's at the moment negatively valence as evil. That's, that's an, that's just an example of fuzzy thinking and w w w what since we're trying to get out the basis of what constitutes motivations for social conflict here, it's very useful to start clarifying up the descriptions.

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       We can't say, well the unknown is evil. That's not any good because although it's very dangerous if you don't have any around, you come to a halt and you can't say, well cultures evil. Although you can say, well it tends towards authoritarianism. That's a problem. It also provides you with necessarily security. You can't say that the process that transforms orders, he believe it because although it can be very upsetting if you don't have it, you come to a halt as well. So by process of elimination and sense, your left to the questions, what can you define as evil? Where does it go? Assuming need exists? Assuming an exist is a good question. Well it depends on your death. It exists. I mean, cause there's some news. No, it doesn't just exist as a religious abstraction and we know that it exists. I mean that's why we have things like the Nuremberg trials and that's why we have things like Holocaust museum in Washington.

Speaker 2:          00:48:30       I mean even though we're not very good at defining it and we don't exactly know what it means when it occurs even in in terms of consensus, people can tell. So hopefully what we can do is try to figure out what it is and what it isn't because it's easy to say if I'm part of Group Bank, all members of Group B are Evil and you can understand why there's motivation to do that. Like Group B poses a real threat to group bates non trivial threat has nothing to do with their moral nature in a sense. And it's very easy for people to make that presumption. So one of the things I want to do is clear up the categories so that it's no longer possible to rationalize the notion that just because you're a part of Group B and I'm part of Group A, you as a member of group, we are necessarily evil and I necessarily all good.

Speaker 2:          00:49:20       So, so in a sense when you label another group, when you say that group is the devil, you're sort of taking on the devil more protective stuff. Well I, I I, I would say that that's necessarily the case here as soon as, as soon as you adopt because, well that's one aspect of it. Anyways, it's the inappropriate adoption of omniscience. Like level, let's say you can even know it is necessary for me to protect my group and also that my group is valuable to things, which for me, whenever you would never create any debate, we know the function of group. The problem is when, when you say one, I personally am actually, uh, what would you say the most admirable possible exponent of wine group, which means first of all that I actually understand its structure and that given such understanding, I actually acted out both of which are highly debatable propositions and also that my understanding of my group processes is sufficiently profound for me to determine what the absolute certainty that you're wrong. That for me, that's arrogance. I think that's pride. It's also, it's the underground adoption of, and I'm missing steps soon as you do that. Well there are certain consequences which

Speaker 5:          00:50:34       detail. Oh Man, I,

Speaker 4:          00:50:38       okay, I'm confused. Um, we have the positive part of the individual as somebody who accepts a nonlinear, we had the, the negative individual how do the individual as a process that rejects anomalies. However, and we've already discussed the positive part, uh, update society and yet we've also discussed how the negative part is a process that also a bait society, uh, you know, through, through fire. The devil, uh, updates.

Speaker 2:          00:51:02       No, no. The idea here, the idea of essentially was that if you're in a group, like say you're the spoke of a particular group from within the group, it's very difficult for you to determine the difference between the power of that wants to just lay the group to waste and the power that we'll update it cause they look very much the same, which is why revolutionary heroes who are often heretical are so badly treated by group members. It's like it's because they're dead. They're indistinguishable from random maintenance of chaos from, well at least for less than distinguishable. Usually I think you can tell the difference but people are not necessarily willing to.

Speaker 4:          00:51:37       It was minute. Okay, so it's, so we're still saying that the negative part of the individual is the one that rejects anomaly,

Speaker 2:          00:51:45       right? Knowing that it's there, knowing that it's there, which is the second one, something occurs and at least at one level of analysis, you know that it's undermining one of your theories and you say it,

Speaker 5:          00:51:58       well, no, it doesn't exist. I think given that the individual is the houses, the positive aspect of the individual would be an aggressive like means toward the unknown which would be the hero and then the negative would be the group or the culture which is instant.

Speaker 2:          00:52:20       Well it's partly that. I mean that's why in the diag for that growing the relationship has always been like this cause because the negative aspect of the individual heightens the catastrophic danger of the group, which is to say that if you take a group that's entirely composed of individuals who reject it, normally what you have is a tyranny. So to the degree that the group is composed of individuals who reject the normally it will become integrity. One of the things that we're trying to discuss in this class and to formulate overtime is it the relationship between individual action and group identification, which is to say like what can you do to ensure that your group does not only your group tending towards tyranny as it necessarily will, will not absolutely transform itself into tyranny over time. And the only thing you can do as an individual is to ensure that when an anomalous piece of information pops its ugly head up and makes you realize that you're vulnerable and mortal, that you admit to its presence and take the necessary action, whatever those actions happen to be. Now the problem is under some circumstances that doing so will be very dangerous to you.

Speaker 5:          00:53:27       That's essentially what culture is. Culture is protect is protecting. You are denying that which you know, um, can threaten to you.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       Well that's part of it. It's also, that's only part of it. It's also, I think to think of it as a parent, which is to put it in its personality, guys is very accurate because of parent. Both protects you but exposes you at a rate that you can tolerate. Now, one of the things we're going to talk about at the end of this class is how, how you can tell if you're being exposed to the unknown at the proper rate. And I would say just in passing that you can tell when you're doing something that's interesting to you that's meaningful. That's the indication that you're sufficiently secure so that you're not going to fall apart, but also sufficiently open so that your stability will be maintained over time. The way that manifests itself is in the feeling of interest. That's when self consciousness vanishes in part and time tends to disappear as well, so therefore can the hero be part of the group? Well, the hero's necessarily what the hero has to be from

Speaker 5:          00:54:31       heroes, the group. Right, right. But the hero can't necessarily can know of the hero identify with the group while still being a euro.

Speaker 2:          00:54:39       No, I don't think so. I think it's a matter of recognition of the value of the group and also the necessity of its being. Yeah. Without saying, without trying to get from childhood to individually. I think about any group intermediation whatsoever or without saying that the group is the be all and end all, which is what all groups wanted you to say about them or without saying that the group is only an impediment to individuality, which is just not, it's also a precondition so it's more a matter of appropriate. Look, here's an example. This is a really good, this is a good little parable. It's from the gnostic gospels that were discovered in the late 1950s. Christ is walking down the road and it's Sunday or Saturday, actually, it's the Sabbath Day. And uh, there's a man in a ditch and his sheep, his fallen into a hole and he's, he's picking the sheep out of the hole, which you're not supposed to do on the sabbath because by prostitutes were in Christ test.

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       And Amanda, if you know what you're doing, then you're blessed. And if you don't, you're a transgressor of the law and you're cursed. Well, and then he wants you saw him down the road. And that's like, that's really quite an interesting philosophical position because he said to the man, if, if you actually understand the significance of your actions, which has bit, you're breaking a moral rule that's there for a reason, you know, the reason why the rule is there, you appreciate its necessity and you've decided as a consequence of that appreciation, it's still worthwhile to par the sheep out of the hole. No problem. But if it's just a casual gesture, you know there's something wrong with the way you think and you'll pay for it. So really it's a nice little story. So in fact, there are a number of parables in the New Testament. They're very much like that, but that's not so it's very simple. It's a very powerful little story. Anyways, I want to read you a Buddhist myth briefly because it will, it will, uh, put into story form some of the ideas I've been trying to describe to you about the relationship between the development of self consciousness and the contamination of things with the idea of death.

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       Uh, before you start, I just wanted to ask you something because there's been bothering me, which is, uh, our reference to the identification of the individual with the process rather than to the individual sort of as the process. Yeah. The thing that strikes me is that the group is, can be no more than a bunch of individuals. I mean, I grew group is a, it's a way of, it's an abstraction that that puts a bunch of individuals who are similar together there. And furthermore, an individual is not the process unless it's already has something to work the process on. Yeah, I'm saying, I mean the, the known is as much a part of the individual as the process is fine. That's a perfectly good objection. This is the Arctic individual, right? Like

Speaker 2:          00:57:35       this is a map of experience in total, the whole thing. And you can say, well you're the sum total of your experience, which basically means that there's an aspect of you that's characterized by both participation in the unknown and the consequences of being exposed to it and the group inside you and the architect will individually inside you. But as we are all these things and the grow your experience or your experiences, all of these things, and you can say, I am my experience. Okay. And I think that's perfect. The reason, no, but it's the architectural rep representations of the individuals that constitute the process because there's archetypical representation, the wise king for example, that's an individual who just occupies a part of the whole, the whole of, of all of experience. So yeah, I mean what got me into this to begin with, at least in part, was the recognition that to the degree that there's a group, it's in your head.

Speaker 2:          00:58:29       Right? Right. I mean because it is an abstraction. It's like people, you know, I see people, you go to the Canadian, the u s border, they get out of the car, they look at the border because they think the motors on the ground, it isn't. It's in their head, but they have it confused with actual world, so the group isn't in the same way. I mean the group is an intra psychic is something that has an interest psychic incarnation and as part of the reason that this course is called socialites got a terrible title. It's called social identity and information processing because social identity plays a role in the way you process information. It's incarnated inside you, so to speak. All right. Yeah, because I've just been seeing him every once in a while in this class. It seems like we're confusing the arc to the archetypes with actual, right, right. Well, and then not to know. That may be the case as well. I guess part, I guess maybe that emergency in part people's natural tendency is to identify them more, particularly with the group and to counter balance that. I guess I'm trying to put more stress on this, this aspect and perhaps even someone on this, the negative, the negative switched on.

Speaker 2:          00:59:46       You've gotten both from above of young nuns are positive. Oh, nice. That's a good problem. Alright. Um, positive. Right. Thank you. Okay, so let me read you this story. What I want you to do is to, you maybe read it. What I want you to do is to think about it in terms of the categories that you know, because you should be able to figure out what story means. Now, the father of Prince Gautama, the Buddha savior of the Orient, determined to protect his son from desperate knowledge and tragic awareness built for him and enclosed pavilion, a walled garden of earthly delights. Walled Garden, by the way, means paradise.

Speaker 2:          01:00:41       Only the healthy, the young and the happy. We're allowed access to this earthly fair. That's all signs of decay and degeneration were kept hidden from the prints. Now you remember what, what food, his father had been visited by an oracle and the Oracle told him that his son was either going to grow up to be a great religious leader or a leader of like an earthly leader, politician. Basically his father wanted him to be a politician, so he was trying to keep him away from anything that would lead them towards more spiritual concerns. So you could say in a sense go Thomas Farley wanted him to identify with the group, which is perfectly reasonable. So he built this wall enclosure and inside it we're only things that were good. Everything terrible. It was kept outside immersed in the immediate pleasures of the census in physical law, dance and music and beauty.

Speaker 2:          01:01:35       Azure Gautama grew the maturity protected absolutely from the limitations of portal being. However, he grew up curious, despite his father's most particular attention and will and resolve to leave is seductive prison. He wanted to find out what was beyond. So as far the main preparations to, I think this, you know, there was a, this was a procedure that was often fault, the fault in the Soviet Union, I think it was called a Potemkin village. You've heard him correctly, is that right? Yeah. So I'm from tech village was a village that the Soviets would construct a full, stupid, gullible Westerners. So the Soviets would say, we have a wonderful society come and looks that they construct this beautiful, whatever it happened to be, prison camp. And the Westerners would come with him and everyone would look at that and healthy and the western is, would go back home and say, this will be, aren't so bad.

Speaker 2:          01:02:24       Look at this model prison. Anyways, that was a Potemkin village and Thomas Farley as basically trying to do the same thing here. So he wants to get outside of the wall. So his father like whitewashed yourself all the shacks and gets the beggars and everyone off the street and there's a little root carved out. And uh, that's the first trip. So he covers his path with flowers and displays alongside the road, the fairest women of the kingdom. The print sets out with all of his retinue in the shield and comfort of a chaperone, chariot and delights in the panorama prepared for him. So things fall outside world is not so bad. The gods, however, decided to disrupt these most carefully laid plans and sent an agent man to hobble in full view alongside the road. Prince as fascinated gaze fell upon the ancient into local compelled by curiosity.

Speaker 2:          01:03:14       He asked his attendant, what is that creature stumbling, shabby bent and broken beside my revenue and the attendant answer. That's a man like a man who was born in the infant became a child. Youth, a husband, father, father, fathers. He's become old subject to destruction of his beauty, his well in the possibilities of life. Like other menu, say hesitantly acquired the brands. That means this will happen to me and the attendant answer inevitably with the passage of time, lots of piece of anomalous information. What happens, it's like back to the walled city. The world collapsed in upon guitar and he has to be returned to the safety of home. That's a story about creative exploration and that's exactly how children offered. They use their parents as a stable base and the explore outside that base of stability to the limits of their tolerance for anxiety and when that cards is exceeded, they go back to their parents and the whole exploratory procedure, which is in fact the procedure that leads to maturation is a constant interplay of moving out and coming back and moving out and coming back. Theoretically each move out, being slightly farther out as the child learns that he can in fact tolerate exposure to the, to the unknown world outside of the family.

Speaker 2:          01:04:36       So you got home as far the bills, him a walled city and only good things are inside of it. That's exactly what we do for our children. Fundamentally. I mean what you do if you have a child, if you treat the child properly, is to protect it from all those forms of anomalous information that it, that it cannot by any stroke of imagination deal with so you know the for or even understand for that matter. And there's all sorts of things that you don't discuss with children unless the necessity arises and it's absolutely, it's absolutely necessary and that's what it means to take care of them. Fundamentally. By the same token, you don't shield them from those things that they are capable of actually conquering anyways, he's back home in time. His anxiety lessens, his curiosity grows and the adventures outside again because time to go, it's sent a sick man to view this creature.

Speaker 2:          01:05:31       He asked his attended shaking and palsy, horribly afflicted, unbearable to behold, a source of pity and contempt. What is he and the attendant answered that is a man like other men who was born hold but who became ill and sick, unable to cope, a burden to himself and others suffering and incurable like other men, you say acquire the prints. This could happen to me and the attendant answer, no man is exempt from the ravages of disease. You see, this is a story about the development of self consciousness because what Gautama has discovery are aspects that he encounters in the external world that are actually also characteristic of him. So it's a consequence of being immersed in society. He sees that it is possible for people to die knowing that he is in fact person. The inference is pretty easy to draw that that changes the structure of the world substantially.

Speaker 2:          01:06:23       So now he knows that he get died and now you can become sick. So back to back to the castle once again. This time, however, it doesn't work so well because he's not so happy with the things that used to make him happy. So he goes out a third time. This time, the godsend. Send a dead man in the funeral procession. This creature, he asked his attendant laying so still appearing so fierce. I'm surrounded by grief and sorrow lost. And for Lauren, what is the intended answer? That's a man like other men, born of woman I loved and hated. Who once was unl. Is there like other men you say inquired the prints, then this could happen to me. This is your ends and the attendant and the end of all, man, the world collapsed the final time and get time. I asked to be returned home, but the attendant had orders from the princess father and took them instead to a festival of women who concurring nearby and Grove in the woods.

Speaker 2:          01:07:14       Prince was met by beautiful assemblage who offered themselves freely to him without restraints, song and dancing play in the spirit of central love. Good time I could think of when we have death and the inevitable decomposition of beauty to feel pleasure in the display. So for him, the consequences of the emergence of self consciousness for the contamination of all good things with the possibility of death. That's a funny story because it's a descent from paradise right when he falls out of the protected city and that's a catastrophe. But it's also a precondition to his eventual regeneration as the Buddha. So you know, that story is the story that we've been talking about over and over, which is this story.

Speaker 2:          01:08:09       So this is the wall of the city and outside of the walled city, and there's but chaos. And if a piece of the Nautilus information knocks down your structure, then you end up in a place that's defined by chaos, which of course appears to be a complete catastrophe to you because your emotions are dysregulated and there's nothing left but anxiety and depression. But it's also the case that this descent, which in, in these stories, it's, it's absolutely inevitable. This is so, it's very interesting because the concept of original sin isn't explicit in Buddhism, but it's very much explicit in that story because the reason that Buddha goes outside of the walls, because he's curious like, hey, he's happy. Everything's going real well. So you might think, well, you know, why spoil a good thing. But the point is he does for the good things, like it's not good enough.

Speaker 2:          01:09:00       What's outside the wall? Awesome. And so it goes and looks and the consequences are, it's like that's the end of the paradise foy. And you're not going to get back. He's, you're not going to go back to the same place to get it. It's gone. Well, that's, that's exactly the same idea as original sin in Christianity as Adam's Adam and Eve's sin, right? They take the apple as the forbidden thing that makes themselves conscious. It makes them, makes them aware of their own death, makes them aware of their own nakedness, makes it necessary for them to work and tosses the amount of paradise, curiosity, original suit, miscarriage. That's what it is. And it, while, and it's a funny thing because it's also, well, it's also the auto fill. That's an original sentence. Also, the precondition for, uh, for the whole redemptive story because although this was paradise, so to speak, this place is on a higher order of being than this place was, I guess at that.

Speaker 2:          01:09:54       I think that's because here, the paradise that precedes the original descendants characterized by complete lack of consciousness. There's no consciousness there. And the paradise that re emerges as a consequence of this whole story is one in which self consciousness exists and his whole, so it's, well I think personally I think that's partly because here's one reason in a sense, this pretty conscious paradise is nothing. It's paradise because it's nothing, which means there's no suffering there, but there's nothing else either. And here at least there's actually the world, but it's the war. So there is a world, there's the possibility for suffering, but it also represents a sort of mode of being where there can be a world and simultaneously people can live in it. It's just the question that gets that everyone's always trying to figure out how is it that there can be a world and that it can be tolerable at the same time.

Speaker 2:          01:10:54       So because isn't it also that story because that's simply what those happened. Everything. It's an explanation. Well, I mean how did we get, we can't be were originally simply by watching what does happen. Right. Well the other thing about this story too is that it's the story of maturation. Like you can think of it as it's, it is theoretically a description of what happened at the dawn of time, so to speak. And in a sense that's accurate in a sense because there wasn't time back. Who knows how long ago when we weren't self conscious. And this is something that's emerged as a consequence of, of you know, who knows what processes and it seemed to emerge very quickly if you assume that the development of self consciousness is related in some way to the expansion of the Cortex, which seems to be pretty reasonable hypothesis.

Speaker 2:          01:11:38       The human cortex expanded unbelievably quickly from the evolutionary viewpoint. So our development of self consciousness was that historical event. I wouldn't say the business, an accurate description of historical event is, it's not really trying to be that. It's trying to describe the meaning of a series of processes, but more importantly also it's a story of what necessarily, how it was when you mature. Because the thing, like when you're, you're, you're say you're very young, two years old, your mother does protect you. I mean it is literally the case that she shields you from your vulnerability. It's right here. You have a screwdriver and you're heading towards the electrical outlet and your mother says, well, no, you know there's a wall, there's a wall there. She tries to make sure that you don't fall down the stairs or at least that they're soft if you do and the old stick your hand on the oven and so on and so forth.

Speaker 2:          01:12:25       She's always there as an intermediary and that's a form of paradise and you say, well, what drives you beyond that paradise lost your curiosity. As you mature, you get, you develop a larger and larger repertoire of behaviors, more and more interest in what's going on and outside world who finally you get to the point where the things you know because of your own curiosity because of your own exploratory activity are so complex that your mother and father, they can't protect you anymore. It's like you're outside the walls. That's it. If you try to go back, it just means you're sick. That's all. I mean it's not a solution. It's, it's really going to solution. We'll just make things worse. So this is this story, which is a mythological story is a story that characterizes everyone. That's, that's why you know, it's not such a very, not very logical idea too, to make light of a notion like original sin.

Speaker 2:          01:13:14       So you figure out what, what is it a heritable heritable characteristics kind of humanity. It's fair enough, far as I can tell, especially if you look at the consequences once you're self conscious, you know, it's very easy to view the world. There's an unfair place and we can look at it. It looks like a pretty ain't fair place and think about it. And it is the case that you know, your tooling along doing just fine and acting appropriately as far as your concern. And it's like one day bang of cancer, something equally horrible. It doesn't seem to be any justice in that at all. It's not very difficult to turn an animal into something that's aggressive. Oh, you have to do is punish it. Unpredictable and unjustly. What does that mean? Well, it means that the animal can't figure out how to avoid the punishment and also that the punishment, well that's the primary aspect of it.

Speaker 2:          01:14:00       As far as the animals concern and we're in that position all the time. It's like terrible things happened to us. That seems completely independent of our particular behavioral patterns and that's one of the things that turns people against the world. But that's what makes me, right. Absolutely. That's in fact in an earlier version of this manuscript, in this chapter I had a sexual and learned helplessness because it is the case that if you punish an animal and it can escape, but what happens to them also get aggressive? Well Gretchen is one of the things that might happen along the way. I handle the circumstances. For example, like if you take an animal and you shock it, it's in a cage. Well it Kevin you get aggressive cause there's nothing to get aggressive about. Like, like let's say you take out, take a wrap, Nelson, his cage and any shocked the wrath killed him ups.

Speaker 2:          01:14:52       So to some degree the effects of punishment or a situation dependent and punishment does do two things. It's an unconditioned stimuli for aggression and it's also conditioned stimuli for for extinction of behavior, which she has learned helplessness. So there's these two pathways to, and it's almost the case. Like you say, it's a thought experiment. There's a cat here and you chase around with a stick. Any corner, any neck if you're an you poke it with a stick was going to hiss, hiss and fight. But if you keep doing it sooner or later the aggressive response has been extinguished and it'll just pass bath is to lay there and take the punishment. That a thing of the thing that's funny about your example, we are in that situation, sorry, the learn like our conditions of existence are very much and now it gets to those experiments that psychologists and conduct that produced learned helplessness. We are close to at least some subjected to um, unpredictable.

Speaker 2:          01:15:50       Our problem is we have to learn how to deal with it nonetheless. Yes. Part of what we're trying to just discover in these messages. Is there a possible way of doing that? Also while admitting to the fact that it is the case, because one way of doing it is just to deny it, deny the fact that terrible things out fafsa and the recent social psychology, psychological literature, there's a whole body of studies that suggest that that's the best way to do it. That's right. Has themself allusions. Um, I know it's only all these things that happened to one or only one thinks that there's some reason they're not, and then it wasn't there. I missed the trend. Is that a punishment because it's a negative experience or it just happened that I missed the train? It's not anything can do well. Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:16:43       See, yeah, I see what you mean. I think the inference that we generally drive that regardless of whether there's a will behind it, it's arbitrary and unfair. I mean the training things slightly, it's me, it's too minimal to make a case out. But I mean, if someone close to you and develops, like say someone that's close to you, that's also universally recognized as good, develop some absolutely atrocious disease, which happens with a fair amount of frequent frequency under conditions. It's very difficult not to draw the inference that despite the lack of will behind the disease, it's evident that the world as it's constituted is a very unfair place. It because it certainly those sorts of things would run contrary to all our notions of what constitutes fair.

Speaker 1:          01:17:25       Do you have an expectation that the world is at their place? That's how you define it as unfair or do you think that, I mean, it seems to me, nevermind. No, that's what, go ahead. Well, seems to me that until the current age where everyone fairly well accepts the whole idea of evolution. Yeah. When there's no real reason, there's no meaning for us to be the types of creatures that we are. It just sort of happened before that I think philosophers strove very hard to find the meaning to explore why it was the way it was. Yes. Um, in, in that sense that there was an expectation that the, the, the world should be just right. There's no reason for it not to be unless, unless there's, if it's not just, there must be a reason it was worth uninsured now that,

Speaker 2:          01:18:20       okay. I guess I would say that I see the logic in your argument. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is that you like is it possible, is it possible for us to exist in any sane manner? Which I would say saying being in part not in adopting authoritarian identification with groups and civil tediously pa be able to accurately after him the fact that the fundamental structure of the world is falling, neither fair nor I'm fair, but at least it appears to us under many circumstances. It's very unfair. And the answer that seems to be no, I think all right, is that people who are faced with that sort of choice frequently take a route out of the problem that actually makes it worse over time. For example, they'll adopt, uh, in an authoritarian stance as a means of protecting themselves against types of information.

Speaker 2:          01:19:10       They kept tolerant. So I guess part of what I'm trying to find out is there, is there a story that makes sense out of things that we necessarily perceive as unfair one? And that's kind of one of the things we'll try to discuss it over the rest of the course. So I'm just saying what are like I want, I'm trying to do today is line some of the consequences of did this. I think people do have a implicit idea that the world is fair because the part they're given that when they're brought up, when their kids, that's one of the things he tried to do with the child's environment. Sorry, do you make sure the rewards and the punishments are distributed in an equitable and predictable manner and not towards the twos justice in large part and one of the things the child discovers and it's necessary to do that. The child would just completely like, we'll be in developed by chaos and terrible things will happen. It's necessary to do that. But if you do do that, then when the child goes out into the world, he will discover,

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       she will discover in short order that there are all sorts of things that have that don't fit into that framework even though the framework that has this. So I would say that that is our natural response is like this is unfair. And that's, I think that's part of the reason why tragic things, especially those things that appear possibly unnecessary. Like say someone that say something that you're very close to is brutally murdered, sort, sort of on a whim by something halfway did psychopath. I mean that's the sort of thing that's not only seems incredibly tragic but also completely pointless. It is those sorts of things that really undermine our ability to believe that our existence is have any meaning at all. And then distance is predictable. I'm not people in their hands very close to uh, develops cancer. Saying the attribution could be that this is unfair, but what you're really saying is that it was unpredictable. There's no way. Well that's one aspect that would be unfair attribution. It's unpredictable. Plus, I think it's also an unjust judge. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:21:10       But if you're just not intelligent enough, you don't add that up. It's not true. If you don't have what, you don't have. The fact that it's adjustable because I don't know if you do, like what do you think? You might say it's not logical to do so, but I would say that if it happens to you you will do it. Yes, I agree with it. That is generally the way we work, but I don't think that, I don't think that's across the board the case. And I think, I think, I don't see why you couldn't, why you can't get beyond that. What I really wanted to say that was something that you said about when you were saying that children that you teach children that the world is fair, but it seems to me that that's often not the case because I think chil children often use that as, as their complaint.

Speaker 2:          01:21:50       That's not fair. You know, is not fair. And one of the things that I've always heard parents say to kids as well, well life isn't fair. You know, one of you say that to a child, you're not actually communicating any information. You'll just rationalizing the present situation because of the truth of the matter is, is that if you set up a stable environment, everything you've done has led the child to believe that in fact, the world is fair, which means it is predictable and it's just, but I do think that maybe you're just exposing them to that you're exposing it to them slowly, like in the small thing, like you can't have the ice cream because, well, I do think that's what you're doing eventually. Maybe they will learn that life. Why shouldn't they learn eventually that life isn't fair? But the question is, once they learned that life isn't fair, what do they do?

Speaker 2:          01:22:33       Let's this fear. Let's see the unabomber for an example, because I know, I know what I think. I know what he's like. He's someone who thinks that the world fundamentally is an unfair place, and then it's his moral obligation to take revenge against it. Now he's picked certain aspects of the world to take revenge against. But his, like in his self consciousness, he construes himself not only as a victim of unfair then just forced us, but as the kind of victim and who has the right to cast judgment on is victimization and to take action in a vengeful action essentially. So look, where does he live in a cabin in Montana? Why is that? Well, I'll tell you, it's so that he won't get contaminated by the rest of the human race, that's for sure. So he might've been rejected, but he's sitting there thinking like in the back of his dark and stormy and little brain that that, that half the human race is fundamentally evil and the only appropriate thing to do is to detach yourself from it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:34       And there's also an, a tremendous amount of volume, the scn posturing and arrogance at the back of that, which is why he could spend all this time constructing bombs and sending them off to more or less random targets that he inappropriately identifies with the natural methological categories that make up this thinking. You know? So he's mad at university. So we bombs individual professors. I mean, you know, this is, this is not, this is not inappropriate. So the question is, if you construe the world he has an unfair place, what did you do? Well, I would say one of their, I mean we can either change your action or you can change your thinking. Have an alternative. Yeah, but you need an alternative that you can believe. You can't just, you can't just say, hey look, this is a problem. I mean, the, the problems that self consciousness pose, it's an emergent problem.

Speaker 2:          01:24:25       Let's say it's only a problem that's been around for a million years. It's nobody's figured out what to do about like, because as soon as you become self conscious, it appears that the world is an arbitrary and unfair place. Then the question is, if the world is an arbitrary and unfair place, how should you respond to them? Now an animal subjected to evidence that suggests that the world is arbitrary and unfair develops, learned helplessness, just depression. Now lots of people develop that like they quit. It was because why bother? Which is a really potent argument. Why bother if such and such is likely to happen to you, which it undoubtedly is. Why do anything? Well, that's that. Lots of people don't accept that our to because they never think about it or whatever. For whatever reasons they're protected from that line of logic. But another line of logic is, well, let's take some revenge against the world.

Speaker 2:          01:25:19       That's a potent line of logic as well. Group girth that for goods and for example, his, his notion of the, of the fundamental philosophy of Mephistopheles, who's the, you know, literary incarnation of the negative aspect of the archetypal individuals west. This is memphis off these credo. The world is such a horrible place intrinsically, but the best thing you can do for it is to work for its eradication. Hey, lots of people except that line of argumentation. I mean you say, well, why? Like why did the Nazis killed 6 million Jews? Well, it's hard to say exactly why, but I suspect that at the bottom of the individual psyches that participated in that sort of act was the notion that, you know, after all the world isn't relatively harsh an unfair place and it might not be so bad to take a little bit of revenge against it.

Speaker 2:          01:26:10       It's like balancing that, you know, it's done. The world has done a lot of terrible things to me. It's like what's your attitude to that? Revenge is one. It's like all she'll do those all show those whatever the hem to be. I'll show those jeeps, whoever you pick as your target for having inappropriate be persecuted you. So, and I, I, what I'm trying to do is to get at the bottom of that. So why would people be like that? I think it has something to do. The necessary consequences of self consciousness as soon as your self conscious. Well, the genesis story says it quite clearly. What happens when you cover yourself up because you're ashamed and why are you ashamed? Because you know you're naked. But what does that mean? It means that you can view yourself as a somewhat vulnerable pink thing. That really could be who's also subject to all sorts of social pressures, many of which are negative, who needs a substantial amount of protection just to ensure survival continued from day to day.

Speaker 2:          01:27:07       Give an even that that survival is a doubtful, is doubtful in the long run. That's the basis of shame. The other thing that happens in the genesis story is as soon as Adam and eve discovery, they're naked, God comes walking through the garden and they're hiding. Why would, this is a strange bit of the story is why would you hide one? A few things, say maybe you could look at it this way then from the mythological perspective, God's voice, so to speak, is the thing that calls you to do your basket to perform to the maximum of your ability, and why wouldn't you do that? Why would you hide from that? And the truth of the matter of reasons that we all hide from that. Because what we recognize most profoundly about ourselves as our inadequacies and those inadequacies make it impossible for us to believe that we could do our master that would even be worth doing.

Speaker 2:          01:27:57       And that's what the story about hiding. And certainly the case that we do that. So what happens if you hide from the best in you? Well, we know if that's the archetypal hero, you hide from that, then you have no defense at all against chaos because that is the defense. Abandoned that because you're afraid what's left. The only thing that's left is the protection of the group. So if you abandon what's best in you, the only thing you can do is become authoritarian. As soon as you do that, while lots of things happen. So you have to have the group that, because if it disappears your gap because there's nothing left of you. Plus anyone that's out there that reminds you of what you might've been you hate. Wow. So then you have a good reason for rubbing them out. What's the job's doing through this?

Speaker 2:          01:28:43       Isn't this what Joe, the book of job is been? Well you don't view that book as a sort of a narrative precursor to the story of a Christian redemption. So he said it was like the whole, the whole Bible basically tells a redemption story and that one of the things that the story of job necessitated was the emergence of a full blown hero myth. That's why fry says for example, that the idea of Christ is embedded in the old testament. It's implicit in there, which is to say that the Old Testament is a story that cries out for a hero and that's also why there are notions of prophecy. For example, saying this person, the millennium is going to arrive, which is to say where we are in a position, which is this position that calls for the, we know the story, we have to be here. The rest of the story is the arrival of something that will move us out of there. It's like these are all people that are caught in the belly of the beast. For example. They're waiting for the hero to go down into the belly and freedom. So it's such a kind of unsatisfying story. The job's story. Right, right. Makes perfect sense. Right? Yeah. Well that's a chunk of on, why is Joe Joe his story?

Speaker 2:          01:30:01       Well, cause he never learned what to do. That's right. The arbitrary nature has this big speech about how wonderful wisdom and isn't how God created the world. And since he created it, he has the intimate knowledge of how everything works and to wisdom. And then God comes in a world when instead it's like I'm God European on suck it up. You're right. I'm sorry. And then he gets all this stuff he ever lost. What would you rather suck it up or figure out what to do for yourself? Well, there's nothing you can do. It was it like, oh completely. But that's not the message. The message of Christ is that there is something that you can do. But this was the message of Christ and the story of Joe, the whole like, look at what job's like predicated on like Gods and God and Satan there.

Speaker 2:          01:30:46       Which is kind of an interesting thing. Like, okay, sure. Anyways. Well there, there, there is a book, there's a book that was written specifically to address this problem, which is answered to Joe. I assume stealing spoke it. Him. Yeah. Describes this issue particularly, but we also want to make sure that we can distinguish g, uh, or that we put the story of job sort of on a broader perspective, which is the story of someone who's desperate fundamentally for very good reasons. And the thing about desperation in general is that it calls out for a solution. That's all. That's all off. The only appointment I was making is that the story of job is the story of someone who's in as desperate as circumstances as can be imagined. And that's how the story is structured, right? I mean, it doesn't get us and he doesn't get solution. It's a solution, but it's not the best solution or one they appeal to our sense of fairness. That's exactly the issue though. That's exactly this problem. That's what makes it on satisfactory. That's exactly the issue. We demand. Fairness exists, right? That's what we do to map that. No, we don't. No we don't. Because as soon as you get past that, then you're like, let's say we'll abandon fairness as a, well, you better

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       watch out for me then well then if you look at it from God's point of view, it was fair because God is God and you can do whatever he wants and there wasn't preexistent bet, which it's very hard for us to separate them. And that's what religion is for. You have to have faith. There's some greater like plan out there that we can only see a small snippet up so we can't possibly understand so well. Well let's just consider for a moment that some of the fundamental interpretations of these things are culturally bound by the Christian tradition that they're necessarily universal questions are, yes, yes. Well this is, this is a problem, but that's why I said that we should try and look at the story sort of outside of both traditions, if that would be possible. And to see it as a story of something of someone who's getting the aspiration.

Speaker 1:          01:32:49       That's all true enough. I mean unless we got a very diverse representation of peoples from all the time. Well that's kind of what we're hoping seeped in the Judeo Christian. True enough, but that's what we're trying to do in part in this class. Even though in terms of personal representation we don't have like we're not as diverse a group as well. You might be. What are the things hopefully that we're trying to do is contrast and compare enough traditions so that we can see the stories that are common to all of them. Now this is going to be a problem in all sorts of different ways, but I'm hoping that the enough information in general, not just in the context of this class has been gathered so that we can start to see patterns that transcend particular, particular viewpoints without undermining how do you avoid the problem of seeking confirmation and other conditions so that you have already within one tradition a sense of what the fundamental elements and then because traditions are broad and inclusive you can find good question.

Speaker 1:          01:33:54       Good question. The ones that are most important to you and how, how do you avoid that problem of bias? That's an excellent question. I mean, look, that's an absolutely, absolutely solid question. The fundamental like I think one of the reasons why there has been such a discrepancy between scientific viewpoints and mythological viewpoints is because in science we have a mode of determining what comes to or institutes of truth, at least provisional truth, regardless of the desires of the exponents, of any given at any given truth. Here's a methodology. The problem with moral viewpoints is that we don't have a methodology now, and this may be in some ways, in some ways it's an insoluble problem I think because I don't think that we can come to a conclusion about what is good by the same sort of process of consensus necessarily that we use in science because it's hard to point to an object. Okay, so then the question as well, so how do you get to, what comes to mind? What might constitute a fact? Well, the only way that I can see that it can be done is by looking

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       at various cultures and various historical traditions and also by drawing in information from other fields of endeavor, if that's possible. That's why I've been trying to look at both the neuropsychology of the emotional brought an information processing plus looking at at various historical traditions. So the problem of looking for what you want and finding it is a big problem and maybe there isn't an entirely satisfactory solution of the present time. But it strikes me that there's enough data gathering so that we can at least make some movements towards that end.

Speaker 1:          01:35:31       So I think I have a solution.

Speaker 2:          01:35:39       Oh, this is good training program. Well, the, uh, I think it would, I think that would be the hardest way to do it. The way you're doing it now is I presented it in a conscious level, but I think you'd be presented on an unconscious of them. Create your own story. And of course you have to have confidence in you and what you've come up with and see that it is, you know, something that is more right or whatever. But anyways, you create the story and through the behaviors that are embodied in the story, you are passing on this kind of wisdom knowledge, the same thing that Jesus did in making his parables and other figurative language stuff. And he said, well he was able to pass that on through those stories. Not necessarily. This is also, this is also an issue with regards to the methodology.

Speaker 2:          01:36:15       The problem with with discussing truths about how to add is that the only form that you can actually test them out and use it in your own experience. It's like, so if you say, why should act such and such a way you can't ask anybody else, should I act this way? Because they can't tell you. I mean you might go to hell, you should listen to them. Maybe they have some good information for you. But in the final analysis, you're the only one that can figure out if the way you're acting is right. And not only that, it's worse than that because you have to define the criteria by which you determine if the way you're acting is appropriate. Right? So you're, you're kind of caught with decisions to make the matter which way you look. Well, that's one of the things that I'm going to try to address later in the later in the course because these sorts of things, these sorts of things pop up being, since you can't rely on anyone else in the final analysis, you have to rely on yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:37:02       And then the question is, well, how is it that you can be sure that you can rely on yourself? Why do you say that you can't rely on anybody else? You have to realize, well, partly because nobody else can feel your pain. I mean, that's the basic, because there's an aspect of your experience, the subjective aspect of no one else has access to and what's right for you. It's going to be, it's going to share, there's gonna be overlap between that and what's right with other people and what's always be going to be right. But it's gonna be unique to you.

Speaker 1:          01:37:29       What about the what, what about recap? We cast a lot of this whole thing in terms of interpersonal interactions as opposed to an individual's actions against the world. So for example, when you were talking about how the child learns, the child explores his territory, it's a very, yeah, Jillian [inaudible] information and the mother is there as sort of a protector to protect you from the world rather than using a whole nother way of looking at that same child learns, doing, interacting with the mother. I think absolutely top of the story of Buddha, Buddha goes out into the world rather than anomalous information. Part of the interactions with the sick person, an old person in a dead person, but these are interactions that were previously, look at this diagram. One of the ways that an individual generates information is through going back with the unknown, but the other way that he generates inflammation is through contact with culture.

Speaker 1:          01:38:26       And in the case that you're describing of the mother who is providing information as an intermediary for culture but also another person, I mean people, sure. But a lot of cultural information is embedded in other people, not just in what they say. Let me how many APP? As soon as you interact with someone else, they're providing you with all sorts of cultural information in the interaction or is there still something else you mean? Yes, yes. Asking some of these questions that asked a lot of these same questions, but my area of concentration in social psychology and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what level to ask a question. Um, why does an individual harbored, for example, to create, to do her ethic that or what is it about a group? Okay that needs the group to do clarifications or what is it about the dynamics between two groups that causes one of them to do these things to the other one?

Speaker 1:          01:39:24       And it seems to me that you can ask the question at every level and it's hard for me to understand why one, is this views of all of those levels put together or is it focusing on one limits to things like it's an attempt to integrate ideas about group car. The, the, the question really for me as an why do groups engaged in cons? It's why do the individuals that make up those groups actually conducting individual acts that make up the conflict? Okay. And since I'm interested in, in the individual as like the four runner of the group, what can the individual do personally to reduce the likelihood that given the preconditions they will engage in those sorts of peripheric actions? That's my, like specifically that's my concern in which individuals are doing these things. So for example, if I were a Nazi teachers Nazi in Germany, German, and my job was to, I dunno, throw the switch on the train line somewhere down the line. And you may ask, now why would I do that? Well, one reason is because if I don't do it, somebody else will do it. Well, that becomes irrelevant. What, why did I throw the switch? Because the switch is going to get thrown whether I threw it or not. Okay. Well that's, you know, that's, that's uh, that's, uh, well that's a very untoward or arguments similar in some ways to also carrying it on as a consequence of borders. It's like, you know, you're a hierarchy.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       Why did I throw the switch? I'm asking why are you asking why did I throw the switch? I'm telling you, don't ask me why I did it. Ask me why the switch got thrown in. To answer that question, maybe you'll have to look at something beyond me. Maybe. I would say you don't have to look at something. I would say that it was the pattern of your whole life up to the point where you threw the switch that made you into the sort of creature that would think that that was a normal app. Like Kinda Rod said, people has been out. I think she was wrong actually. I think that it's not valid. It's just that many of the things that we think are but now are actually heat. So that's this things, so to speak, that we do every day that don't have any immediate consequence.

Speaker 2:          01:41:36       We write them off. So there've been out, but they're not by now. Because if you look at what you're doing, the consequences of that over time or say why does society is going say well it's because the individuals that composable conduct the activities that they think are saying no one notices, no one said anything. They're not saying they're completely off the wall. And the culmination of all those [inaudible] actions is a society composed of individuals that all things are good, who are acting on mass and an absolutely boring way. So say in part, I mean one of the things I'd be trying to answers, they just question posed in the late 18 hundreds he said are their psychopathology is of health. And what he meant was, was it possible for someone to be perfectly normal and well adjusted, well adapted, and they did an admirable by the standards of their society and still be sick.

Speaker 2:          01:42:27       And you know from the perspective of cultural relativism, the answer's no. But from the perspective of the number of trials to answer is, Oh yes. So what I'm trying to figure out is if you can be sick by doing what everyone else is doing, does that imply that there's some universal standard by which being sick can be judged? I'm going to say, well yes. Three this says if you are open to the existence of anomalous information, you admitted it when it occurs and you update your behavioral models as a consequence, then you're healthy. If you're not well then you're not. How can an individual do that?

Speaker 2:          01:43:03       How can I in the train station admit the anomalous information? Actually there's two preconditions. What has been, you have to admit that you're vulnerable to even to being killed and to accept it. And the second is to to risk putting up with the fact that the group might actually do it too. So that's what you have to do that delete the group. That's right. No, not only that, you have to leave the group knowing that if you do leave, they might kill you and are very motivated to do so. And that's a classic hero myth as well as the hero. There's two things, death weights at the end. And so does the negative reaction of the group. So if you want to transcend the group that's, that's what you do. Say can you do it? And I was too much for any individual to do. Well that's the, that's the question. I would

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       say it's, it's kind of, there's a paradox. It's a paradoxical solution. Actually. If you tried it is possible that if one tried it, it might be possible. And if it were possible, it may be that there were side effects to doing it. It might actually eliminate all the things that appear negative about it. So, and I would say, well look, I mean the, but the basic problem is how do you adapt to the presence of chaos when it's unfair and unjust aspects? Cause what ways do you identify with the group? That's what the groups for the other way is that you learn how to deal with it on your own and the questions can you, and if the answer is yes, then that implies that you're a different sort of creature than you think you are. And if you're a different sort of creature than you think you are, maybe the world is not configured it unfair and unjust, man. It may be that it appears that it is because you have an inadequate opinion of your own power to adapt. And I would say that the purpose of pyramids generally is to provide you with some evidence home from history. Then there's far more to the individual that meets the odd enough, more so that the conditions of existence that we normally regard as unjust and unfair are.

Speaker 1:          01:45:14       But the only way you can find out is if there's a big risk. We know what the risk entails. I mean, what we've been trying to figure out the whole time is why do people identify with groups when there's a big good reasons? So helps them regulate their emotions and protects them from terror. So people are well motivated. You can you get me on that? That's the issue. Okay, so that's that for this weekend.
