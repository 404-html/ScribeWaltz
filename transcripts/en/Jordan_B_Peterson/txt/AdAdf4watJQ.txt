Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay. If I remember correctly, we stopped with the clocks. That's true. Yes. Good. Okay. So one of the things I mentioned was that the emphasis on the clocks here is to divide time up and the film makers emphasize time to tell you in some sense that we're in the prosaic normal world. And then in a sense you could say that when the clock stops, which you'll see happening, we, we move into a different dimension completely. And I think I mentioned when we went through this last time, that young hypothesized for example, that there was no time in the collective unconscious. And what that means is that there's a strata of knowing, I suppose, that you can think of as outside the normal stream of individual life. So it's sort of Super Ordinance and, and you know, here's one way to think about it. So it's pretty obvious that your personality can transform.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       So then you might ask yourself, well, what is it that guides that transformation? Because in some sense it has to be outside the thing that's transforming. And you could say that the, the place that's outside of that transformation is this place out of time and space that you is describing. And it would be, it's the same place as a long time ago, you know, in a fairy tale which refers to some, it's like you've been collapsed pass. That's another way of thinking about it. Or you can think about it like the amount of time that passes when you're asleep as far as your consciousness is concerned because there's no real sense of duration. There is if you, obviously if you wake up and remember a dream, but even dreams take extreme liberties with time. I'm sure you've had the experience where your alarm goes off and the sound is incorporated into the dream and it's as if the dream has been going on for a very long period of time and the alarm makes sense in the context.

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       Even though it may have only been ringing for a few seconds. Freud observed how much time could deal dilate and extend in dreams in, in, in his book the interpretation of dreams. And, um, it's a fairly well known phenomena. So we're in time now. At this point, Pinocchio is already got his mouth. So in principle he's capable to speak. And so now we're in time and then the next week we've got the created creature at this point. So you might think about that as the, as the first stage of development. And the way I look at it with regards to this movie is that, you know, really the next time we see Pinocchio with Japan. Oh, he's off to school. And so you might say that this is the moment that ends childhood and that's the developmental stage we're at. He's ready to launch himself into the world or he has at least after this next scene. And so that's where we pick them up in the developmental progress is entry into the world.

Speaker 2:          00:03:34       Oh No, please.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       Okay. So obviously obviously all this is signifying the transition into unconscious.

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       Oh No. Well we can sneak in name. Yeah. Hi. Okay. You are most yolks. Aw, come on.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       Okay. So at that point did your pedo expresses his, I would say the key element of his value system as a father or you could say the key element of his archetipal role as the good father. Because of course the father is separated archetypically into the, you know, the positive farther in the negative [inaudible] and you know, we've already established the proposition that your values guide your perceptions and actions. And so if it's Japan, it was fundamental desire is to produce something real well, first of all, we don't know exactly what's what real means at this point, but we obviously know that it's not merely a wooden marinette Marionette, right? Because it's contrast it with his current state and your patio is resigned to the fact that that's a highly improbable event. And so it doesn't necessarily always occur. And I would say that's a hint in the context of the movie of a variety of things.

Speaker 1:          00:06:21       But one of them is that it isn't necessarily the case that people get out of the marionette stage. So now I think the thing that makes you pedal a good father rather than a terrible father, a son devouring father, let's say, is that he's actually aiming at developing an autonomous individual. And so that also means he's aiming to produce something that will transcend him and leave him right and that's capable of operating on it on his own. It's the very definition of a good father. And so that's why he's invested in this process so far. That's his goal. And we know the background, we know that he's a master carver and it looks like he's a good guy. He likes kittens and he likes fish and he likes to sing and he likes music and he likes to play and he likes to make toys.

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       You know, those are all, and his place is comfortable and warm and inviting and all of those things. So you know, there's a very maternal element to it almost because you know the house is so cozy and so well kept. You might ask yourself, what, where's the feminine element? You don't have to wait very long before you get it. You had a clue about that. Now, and what happens next is that the star that we saw at the beginning of the film, when it was shining over a scene that looked very much like a, like a Bethlehem Nativity scene, that star makes its reappearance. And we already talked about what a star might represent, but we'll go over it very briefly. You can say, well, a star represents a light shining in the darkness and it's, it's a symbol of value and purity and light and illumination and enlightenment.

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       And it's also something that transcends the horizon. It's above the horizon. And what happens is that Japan, no wishes on this star and what he wishes is that Pinocchio, he could become a real boy. And so partly what the film is indicating through that ritualistic gesture is that the desire to produce an individual period or the forces that have to conspire to produce an individual cannot be brought about unless the, the participants in that process have elevated their, their value structure to something that's beyond what's immediately evident. And you might even say secular or, or, or earthly or, I mean, I know those are all medieval terms, but, but that's really the idea that unless you raise your eyes above normal, the normal value structure, you won't be able to participate in this process. Now, you know, if we make reference back to the story of the Buddha, you remember when the angel comes to visit the Buddha, he tells us, he tells a story.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       When the angel comes to visit the Buddhist farther before the Buddha is born, he tells him that his son is either going to be a spiritual leader or a great king. And of course the Buddhist farther being a practical man immediately goes for the great king theory. He, he stuck to earthly desires, so to speak. And instead of looking for something that's transcendent, and then you might ask yourself, well, what constitutes transcendent? And I would say a variety of things that we'll explore in the course of the movie. But one of the things, one of the ways that you might conceptualize it as that it's the difference between horace and no cyrus or maybe it's the difference between oh Cyrus and the union of Horace and earth. Oh Cyrus, you can look at it. I either of those ways. You remember now when horace goes to rescue a cyrus, he has to go back into the underworld and haul his father out of the depths and as fathers down, they're sort of half blind and three quarters to dad then.

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       And so the transcendent things, which is often represented by the eye, it's, it's also often wreck. You see this in Christian symbolism of fair bit. So on top of cathedrals in the dome, often what you'll see is tears of people and or tiers of angels. And then at the top you'll either see God the father or Christ. And the idea there is that what that represents. So let's say the logos, which is roughly equivalent to horace, I mean men, by the way, I think I probably told you this, but horace and Christ share many, many features in common. You know, and the notion is, is that as the methodology of Christianity developed, it encapsulated a tremendous amount of the symbolism and story that was already present in the Egyptian myths and incorporated into the, into the new religion. So it's not that surprising that they share a parallels, but it's very useful to know what the parallels mean.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       There's, there's a pyramid of power, there's a hierarchy, but there's something that stands outside the hierarchy that fixes the hierarchy and reshapes it and gives rise to it. Well, that's exactly it. It fixes it and shapes it and gives rise to it. And that that's something that you might think about as roughly equivalent to the autonomous individual. Because at that point you're no longer a marionette and tell us, so piaget's highest stage of moral development, by the way, because when children hit that stage, if they do, and not all do, instead of conceiving of morality as following the rules you conceive of, morality is following the rules when that's appropriate, but adjusting the rules when that's necessary. And so you start to view yourself not only as a follower of the tradition, let's say, and not only has something that's obedient but also as something that has a say in what the game is going to be going forward.

Speaker 1:          00:11:41       And so, so we're going to surmise that what Japan is trying to produce since he isn't producing and Marionette is something that has a certain amount of autonomy and thus the, you know, the right to interact as an autonomous being with his, with his own cultural context. So now he knows that it's unlikely and it's also a transcendent wish. It's sort of outside the dominance hierarchy because you, one of the things you could say is, Oh, you know, do you want your child to become an engineer or a lawyer or a doctor? Heaven forbid a psychologist. And in some sense all of that is irrelevant in relationship to this more transcendent goal because you can get to the place of transcendence pretty much through any disciplinary pathway. There has to be a disciplinary pathway, but which one doesn't matter. What matters is how you conduct yourself while you're on the disciplinary pathway.

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       And so, you know, that's an interesting observation too because it's another thought that radically undermines the idea of moral relativism because the idea is while there can be many disciplinary systems and so in a sense that borrowers to the idea of moral relativism, but there can't be a situation where there's no disciplinary system. And you know, part of that is obviously that human beings are inculturated creatures and, and we, we just cannot exist in the absence of a disciplinary system. And you might say we can't exist. Well in the absence of an optimized disciplinary system, so okay, so your pedo wishes upon this star. And so he makes, he makes content contact with something that's outside the normative world and well we'll see how that unfolds.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       Oh God.

Speaker 1:          00:13:52       See Japan, I was also a little bit of a trickster, you know, and you saw that quite repeatedly. He Makes Pinocchio Fall over. He kicks his little cat in the rear end with the puppet. Now he's making him go open the window. Like he's playing little tricks all the time. No one, the trickster figure is a very complex and interesting figure. Yo describe the trickster as a psychopomp. And a psychopomp is someone who mediates between conscious and unconscious life. And you can think about that in relationship to comedians because what comedians always do and what jokes often do is revealed truths that no one is willing to face. You know, when the more extreme the comedian, the more likely they are to transgress social norms. Well, similar caneously making you laugh, you know, you can see, um, Russell Peters for example, all he does is tell racist jokes, you know, and everyone in the audience is thrilled about it even though they're all there in an essence identified with ethnic group.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       You know, he calls on the Arabs and then he makes fun of them and they all cheer. And then he calls on the Indians and makes fun of them and they all cheer and the Chinese. And it's a relief for everyone to get out of that sphere of the unspeakable and to, and it puts everybody in a place of transcendence because for a moment they're outside their ethnic identity, you know, and they can laugh at themselves as something that can stand outside of their own definition. And so a psychopomp is, you know, Freud also talked a fair bit about this with regards to humor because he said like slips of the tongue and so forth. You can also often use them as as doorways in some sense, into unconscious contents. And there's just no doubt about that. Like if you listen to people very, very carefully, you'll make little jokes or little unconscious slips and you can see if you're trained to see it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       You can see whole complexes of of often, you know, terribly chaotic masses underneath those sorts of things. And so their portals in a sense, into the underworld. It also is very strange. You see this when people talk about their dreams. I've seen this numerous times where I'll have someone, what I do is I have people bring me their dreams. If they remember them, they've written them down, and then I listened to them once and let my imagination start playing with them. And then I go have the person, they read the dream out loud. Then I have them go through it sentence by sentence. And we, we do what's essentially free association from a psychoanalytic perspective. You know, if they talk about uh, let's say a big box department store, I might say, well what, what first comes to mind when you think about that? And they'll have associations and that sort of lays out the cloud of concepts that surround that particular image.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       And so you keep doing that, expanding it. And I'll throw in my associations as well. And then we have a discussion about, you know, how that might pertain to the current state of their life. And it's like, it's like understanding a book in some sense or understanding of movie and often know what's so cool is that if you really, really listen to people when they use words to describe their dreams, they'll use sentences that mean two things at the same time and one will mean it will be a description of the actual images, stick content of the dream and at the same time it will be a description of what that means and people don't even notice when they're doing it. It's so cool. You have to detach yourself and listen carefully because if you're following only the semantics of the conversation, all you'll see is the reference to the dream.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       But if you remember simultaneously that the dream pertains to their life, then you can often, I wish I had an example for you, but it's so complex. I can't, I actually have dreams recorded from one client, about 50 of them in a row all laid out and we're thinking where we're, the plan is to put that into book form and publish it because there isn't anything like that. But, so there are these holes portals through which you can pass into an unconscious realm. And you know this look when you're having a conversation with people you know now and then if it's a group conversation now and then someone will say something that brings the conversation to a halt, right? You can think of it as a non sequitur or, and it's something that a non sequitur is something that doesn't fall. And so particularly an unconscious person who isn't following the trail of the conversation will pipe up with something and it brings everyone to a halt.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       And the reason for that is that the person has just manifested part of their own unconscious structure at an inopportune time. And it's like everyone's on one story and then bang another one comes to to join it. And, and that person isn't on the same wavelength, so to speak. There is somewhere else. And you know, sometimes you can figure out where they are and generally speaking, that is far from pleasant. So you know, because as Freud pointed out, the things that you tend to keep unconscious are not the most positive things about you. At least you don't think so. There might be lots of positive down there, you know, but you're going to only get to it through the negative. So, so anyways, a trickster figure who's playing tricks. The other thing I think I, I'm not, I'm not, I had an experience once when I was remembering, I had a memory that from when I was very young, my father had this friend who was Russian, very good friend who basically served me as a grandfather.

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       And I can remember when I'm just very little, three or four sitting on the floor on a rug between this man and my father with that fireplace going and you know, farmhouse, very, very warm place and a very nice family. I really enjoyed going there. And my dad and this gentleman whose name is Nick Zinner off would sit and talk. And while he was doing that, I would take my fist and try to hit his toes, you know, and while he was conversing, he'd move his toes around. And so we were playing this game and now and then my dad would say rather kindly, you know, enquire whether or not I was bothering him and he would say, no, no, it's fine. And I realized just recently that partly what he was doing with his tricks was sharpening me up, you know, because I'm trying to hit a moving target.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       Right. And so he keeps moving it and that means I have to adjust. It's a, it's a goal directed activity training, you know, and I know with kids, the more you, it's like you're willing in some sense or carving them. I think carving is the right word. The more you interact with them attentively, the more sharp and focused they get. And I can see people walking down the street with no problem, who I know were never played with, cause they sort of lumber along there, sort of like, they're like, don't, they're not carved and attentive. They're vagan unshaped and I kind of think of them as uncarved blocks to Taoist idea. Uncarved block is what the world is made out of before you encounter it. It couldn't be anything, but it's nothing. And so, and often I've also dealt with children in places like preschool where I can see the kids who are sharp and who've been played with.

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       They know exactly all you have to do is look at them with a little bit of a playful glint and they'll laugh and they're ready. Whereas the kids that haven't be played with there so pathetic know, I mean this, I mean this in the literal sense of the word, you know, it's, it's, it's unbelievably pathetic to see them. So you'll sit down and the kid lumber over kind of blindly even and sit right on your lap, you know? And it's basically, maybe that's a four year old kid, three year old kid that's like pre toddler behavior. That's all they know how to do. You know? And so if you have a kid that does that, just go and sit on a stranger. They're so desperate for attention, they can't even help it, but they're so far behind, the other kids can't even play with them.

Speaker 1:          00:21:50       Cause it's like playing with an overgrown infant, you know? And by that time it's damn near hopeless. So, so you know, this, this use of humor and tricks and teasing and all of that, I mean it can get mean, you know, if it's not bounded properly, you have to stay on the funny side of, of Tz. But if you're constantly playing with kids, they sharpen up. And so that's another thing that tricksters do. So I used to steal my daughter's dessert all the time when she was little, you know, right from the time she started sitting at the table, which was about probably 10 months older soul, you know, I tried to get her to look out the window or something like that. And every time she did it I'd take her dessert. And so she got very good at it after a while she could tell when I was joking and when there was actually something there.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       And by the time there she was about three, I could hardly ever fooled her. And soon after that she learned a new trick, which was if I told her to look at something, she grabbed her dessert and then turn and look at it and put it back down, you know. But, and I could really see this with mark probably to some degree more with my son than my daughter because he was an ornery little rap and very disagreeable, very disagreeable child. And um, I mean in the big five traits sense and you'd lay down a rule for that kid and he would worry that thing to death. You know, here's the rule. You have to be embedded date. Well do you mean seven 59 do you mean seven 59 and 30 seconds? What about 79 you know, seven 59 and 50 seconds or maybe eight oh two or maybe eight oh five.

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       And just constant battling right on that edge to find out exactly where the contours of the social structure was. And a lot of that is also playing around rules. And if you're ever wondering why your children are teasing you and bothering you, because they will do that nonstop. It's partly because nothing is more valuable to a child and adult attention and partly because they're trying to figure out who the hell you are. And so because you're the, you're the Avatar of the social structure and so they want to know everything they possibly can about you. They're not going to leave you alone. So well, that's all comment on the utility of the trickster. You know, the other thing that tricks your daughters sometimes from a methodological point of view is trick you into behaving properly, you know, with humor or something like that. And that's partly why the trickster is a mediator between the normal domain of consciousness in the sort of transcendent archetypal realm. So,

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       oh, stop. First Star. I see. Which I think my thing of Pinocchio, just thing

Speaker 3:          00:25:19       very loving.

Speaker 1:          00:25:25       Okay. So there was a couple of interesting things that happened there. You know, first you see that cuts back to the cricket. So it's clearly that he's, uh, he's clearly involved in this and he's listening to see what's happening. So, and then of course he comments that that's not a practical, that's not, it's not practical. That's in, in some sense that's exactly right because practical basically means instruction and how to climb the particular hierarchy. You know, impractical means no instruction whatsoever. But there's a transcendent practicality, which is more like how to operate in this space between hierarchies. And so that's, that's more than practical. You could think about it as metta practical. And I think really the purpose of most religious ed education when it's still grounded in its original materials so to speak, is to catalyze this Mehta identity. You know, it's sophisticated being, Yup.

Speaker 3:          00:26:20       Can you give me,

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       well, I would say, you know, the best example I know is the story of Horus. But if you want to relate it to your own consciousness, you know, so here's an example.

Speaker 3:          00:26:32       Wait, wait, sorry we're late.

Speaker 1:          00:26:40       No, no. It's more than that. It's outside of principles because principals have already been laid down as rules, but rules have their problems. You know, because once you formulate something in a static manner, you limit the number of situations that it can apply to. You know, cause we couldn't say, well don't never kill another human being. Well, that's a pretty good rule of thumb. But there are situations where it's not tenable. There has to be something that operates outside of the rule framework that that's, that extracts out the spirit of the rules. That's a way of thinking about it.

Speaker 4:          00:27:19       Universal.

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       Well that's, that is what this is. But I wouldn't call it a principle, I would call it more of, it's more like a process and the process is tightly aligned with paying attention. Let me give you an example. You're playing a musical piece. Okay? Now when you're practicing that piece, what you're doing is building a motor hierarchy. You know, you start, it's very difficult to do it. You, you practice and practice and you're automating these motor routines and you're driving the action from your whole cortex to the left hemisphere and then backwards and making these little micro machines that are specialized for these operations. But let's say you make a mistake while you attend to that, you know, so that's a, that's a trigger of error. And then what you do is slow down and analyze the motor programs that you've already programmed and you see where the error is and then you correct it slowly and practice the correction that practice the correction and practice the correction.

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       So what you're doing in a sense is tuning the hierarchy, the automated hierarchy. And the thing that I'm talking about is the thing that pays attention to error. And that might be the best way of of conceptualizing it. There's something that pays attention to error or there can be, and it's also the thing that moves up and down hierarchies and tries to find the optimal level of analysis for correction and then does the correction. And sometimes that can be minimal, you know, when it's down at the real, you know, details of motor output. But sometimes it can be revolutionary. Now I can tell you a couple of mythological rifts on that. So Horace is represented. Remember Marta? Marta is represented mostly as the force that that goes into combat with ty Mac. So chaos. But that's fine. So chaos is what emerges. You know, when the social order is disruptive threat. In a minor way. He also organize the society. It comes up at the top because you remember before he's willing to go fight time mad. He forces all the gods to meet, to organize themselves and to proclaim him king of the hierarchy. So He's two things. He's the principal at the top or the process at the top of the hierarchy, eyes and mouth,

Speaker 5:          00:29:43       and he's the determiner of destiny's, which is explicitly stated in the Mesopotamian myth. And as that thing, his primary role is to go and combat chaos. Okay. By the time the Egyptians come along, there's two major problems that are emerging as sort of architectural. I would say one is while there's still the underworld to deal with, that's chaos, but the other one is the rot of previous structures and that's Cyrus and seth, right? Because you could, you could think of, oh, cyrus is only protective. You're culture is functioning. It's protecting him for the terrible element of Mother Nature and it's working perfectly. But the problem is it doesn't work perfectly for two reasons. One is it just decays with time because yesterday's solutions are not necessarily appropriate. Today's circumstance and it sped along by people's unwillingness to attend to errors and correct them refusal to do that, and that's refusal to make the proper sacrifices.

Speaker 5:          00:30:42       So that's what gets cane in trouble. For example, he will not make the right sacrifices. Somebody kindly sent me another translation of Gods gods conversation with Cain when Cain goes to complain about the nature of being, and God basically tells him straight out that if he's, if things aren't going well for him, it's his fault. And so it lays explicit stress on the idea that they're, part of the reason that things are going wrong for cane is that he's, he's not doing the right thing. It's not only the arbitrary decision of God. So, so the thing, the thing that stands above in some sense is the thing that corrects errors or you could eat, you could say, you could say that in a slightly different manner because one of the things that I've, I've been trying to figure out in some sense what might constitute the highest virtue.

Speaker 5:          00:31:33       And I don't think it's an answerable question actually, because there there's an interdependent, there's an interdependence of virtues. I think the primary decision that people make is whether or not you want to make being better or worse. That's, that's the pinnacle of any of any particularized hierarchy. So you're always making that decision better works better or worse, better or worse. If you want to make it better, then you're the optimal tool you have is true. And then if you're in that hierarchy, that thing that stands above it, the eye, let's say, or the transcendent feature is the thing that attends to error and repairs. And if you squelch that, which is exactly what happened in the Soviet Union, then the whole bloody system starts to shake. You know, the psyche because people have to falsify their experience constantly, never updating it, never repairing it. And then the whole bloody system starts to oscillate too because you can't voice your detection of error.

Speaker 5:          00:32:35       You know, in part of the utility of free speech, and this is precisely utility of free speech, is that people get to voice their error detection. Now, they might be wrong. You know, everybody has to figure that out. But if you stop people from objecting, then the system can't correct itself and it will become corrupt because it does that. But it'll just careen off the path. So what Japan was doing, what he's trying to do in generating a genuine individual is to produce an entity that's related to the divine, hence the star, but whose function is to, to, to be socialized by the hierarchy, but then to repair it. Now that's manifested most particularly in this movie on a couple of levels. First of all, Pinocchio has to make minor course corrections. He, he makes mistakes and gets off the path and has to return.

Speaker 5:          00:33:30       So that alters his character. And sometimes, sometimes in a way that's a mixed blessing to say the leaks, you know, cause he's damaged by deviation from the path. But so that's one part of transformation. But this movie takes the transformation all the way to its logical conclusion. Because in order for Pinocchio to completely catalyze his transformation into an autonomous individual, he has to go to the very depths, right in the bottom of the underworld to the most monstrous thing. And it's from that rescues his father. It's the same story as the story of o Cyrusone Horace. And there's an idea there, here, here's, here's the ideas. You will not understand the value of your culture until you face the thing you're most afraid of. And that's what this story means. And it's partly because you can't tell what the utility of the ideas are until you experienced a situation where the most profound ideas become necessary. And that won't happen unless you face something terrible. So,

Speaker 3:          00:34:40       okay,

Speaker 5:          00:34:42       no, you know, what the movie is doing is constantly hinting at what that transcend that and figure is, you know, and, and I would say what human beings have been doing ever since we became self conscious was attempting to define the parameters of ideal Ba. So, and a religious story. Buddhism and Christianity are very intent on specifying the nature of ideal Ba. And the reason they're doing that, it's because they, they match ideal being against mortality. And they say, look, we faced this terrible problem. It's the one outlined in the fall. He's the one outlined in the story of the Buddhist, you know, inability to go home. Again, it's the same idea. There's a mode of being that allows people to live properly and for society to be maintained in the face of that. The question is what's

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       that ideal mode of being? And the answer is we'd been trying to figure that out individually and collectively ever since history began. And what we have as a record of that is the trail of profound religious ideas that, that you know, that we're, that we're leaving behind us as we move through time. But you can't understand why those are useful until they become necessary. So you don't go deep enough, you don't go deep enough into the underworld, you know. So for example, your conception of good is pretty

Speaker 1:          00:36:11       unsophisticated and naive until you know what its opposite is. You know, and I've encountered a fair bit of that, I would say in my psychotherapeutic practice because a lot of the problems that I attempted to solve that are rooted in individual and then also in the family because there's almost no barrier between those two things. You know, it's like a trip. It's like Donald Tastes, inferno, you start at one level of hell. That's really not too bad. It's sort of like vacation hell. And then you know, and that's like the outside circle in, in Dante's inferno where the ancient philosophers were, you know, they weren't Christian. So as far as the Catholics were concerned, they weren't going to be in paradise, but they were starting about the Chief Club Med version of hell. And then Dante takes you down layer by layer to the ultimate hell that's at the bottom.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       And in that hell in Dante is poem. That's where the betrayers are. And that's also where Satan, if I remember correctly, sometimes I get this confused with paradise lost. That's where Satan, who's the archetipal figure of evil is lodged and immobile, immobilized right at the center. And so the journey is down to the lowest level into the underworld to encounter the archetype of evil. And it's at that point that religious stories start to become the values that are put forth in religious stories start to become crucially necessary cause they're the only thing you have that can fortify you against that level of catastrophe. So, and you know, so partly what this developmental process is supposed to be accomplishing is the production of a personality that's capable of doing that. So, you know, part of partly I figured this out in part because I was, I did a lot of meditation on the things that I read about, about the concentration camps in Germany and in the Soviet Union, but, but things that were worse than that because there are things that have happened in the world that are far worse than that.

Speaker 1:          00:38:15       I think the worst things I ever found were the actions of unit. I don't remember one 72 it was a Japanese unit that went into China. It's like, it's just, it's so terrible. It's traumatizing to read, you know? And partly what I was doing when I was going through that material was trying to imagine myself as the person who did that. And that's, that's no game. You know, like if you're really imagining it because you have to put yourself in the place where you could do that. And that's a terrible thing to realize that you could do that, to realize that that's part of your character. And until you realize that you don't have enough motivation to mess with any ideas that are actually profound, it's just too difficult and unnecessary. So well. So we'll continue with this.

Speaker 2:          00:39:12       Great.

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       Okay, so, so one of the things that, that appears to be the case, you know, when you have two hemispheres, okay? The reason for that appears to be that you need to neural networks in order to negotiate the world, you need one to produce stable warbles of reality and you need another two. Identify deviations from that and then feed the process deviation information slowly into the system that imposes a stable view. Because you know, I, I'm sorry I don't have the details of this quite right, but if you train a neural network, for example, to identify birds, and so it learns how to do that and to identify fish and it learns how to do that and you feed it a penguin, then all birds become fish. What happens is the anomaly blows the category structure. And so the category structure now ranges from fish to birth.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       And so in order to prevent that, you need a separate system that deals with exceptions. Now that's what we have in our right and left hemispheres roughly speaking. And what the right hemisphere does is identify anomalies and start to formulate a theory around it. That's a fantasy essentially. And then when you were asleep at night, while you're dreaming, the right hemisphere is communicating with the left hemisphere, the left hemisphere is categorical structures loosen up and you can experience that in the dream because things become somewhat irrational, right? And then the brain plays with how it might recategorize information in the least damaging fashion in order to incorporate this new information. And a lot of that's a dream. So that's what's happening at night. Your brain is basically updating itself and it's a very important process. If you deprive people of dream sleep, they become psychotic and quite quickly. So it's a nontrivial necessity. So

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       now this, this is complicated so that we've got this bug now and he's the only thing that's awake and he's being driven mad by time. That's what's happening here. And you'll see his eyes start to move independently. And that's a very common cartoon representation of insanity. And it's quite interesting because one of the things that you see in schizophrenia is eye movements that are unconscious. And so it's as if you've got voluntary I direction fields at the front of your brain and involuntary ones at the base of your brain. And when you're dreaming, the involuntary ones are the ones that are in control. And when you track a moving object, that's also the involuntary one. So you can, you can experience this. So if you put your finger up here and track that, it's no problem. Smooth vision. Okay, now try to do that. Try to move your eyes that smoothly without having that thing to track.

Speaker 5:          00:42:26       Try it. So you do this first, don't move your head, but just track it. You'll see it and feel your eyes moving smoothly. Okay? Now put your finger down. Now try to move your eyes that smoothly and you can't do it. You go Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, and it's partly because the old eye movement system is more sophisticated than the new eye movement system. One of the things you see in schizophrenia is that the person is using voluntary eye movements, but there's emergent grip of control over the eye movements by these archaic parts of the brain. And you could think about that as the emergence of the dream up into waking consciousness and that's associated with the schizophrenia symptomatology. So okay, so anyways, back to this bug. Okay, so what is the bug do while we know he's associated with a star, we know he's a tramp and we've already covered the possibility that he stands for those things that bug you.

Speaker 5:          00:43:20       Now, one of the things that I would suggest is that, and this is union idea, is that those things that bug you are the portals both to the unconscious world or to the underworld and also the portal to further development. So, and it's part of an error detection system. So let's say you walk into your house and you think, Jesus, that really bugs me at why does it bug you? Well it's because your anomaly detection system is saying, look, there's something out of kilter here. This territory is not property mapped or not property groomed. You know, cause you can map, you can make your map accurate by changing the map or changing the territory either way. And sometimes the thing to do is change the territory. You don't remap your bedroom when it's messy, you clean it up so that it matches the map. And so lots of times you walk into your house and something bugs you and it's like, that's an anomaly detection. And you might say, it really bugs me. Well or you'll say it really bugs me when my mother does that. It's like, yeah, go, you go investigate that. And see where you get and that'll take you right down to the depths to find out exactly why that's happening. And it might be depths in her, and it might be depths in newer, it might be depths in both of you, but, and it's just

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       a bloody nightmare to get to the bottom of that because first of all, people will block you at every level. You know, the first thing they'll do is say, I don't want to talk about it. And then the next thing you'll do is leave. And then if you chase them, they'll tell you that you're, you know, something associated with the scum of the earth and you know, cause you won't leave them alone. Then they'll, then they'll get angry and then they'll burst into tears. And then if you can still pursue it, then you can have a conversation. But no one, hardly anyone ever gets to that point because you just have to be brutal to, to peck your way through those defenses. The only way you're going to do it is if you're more afraid of that stupid thing continuing than you are of the terrible conflict, you're going to have to have to fix it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       And I don't think you can be that scared unless you know what's at the bottom. You think that is not good. And you know, if you know what not good means, that new think, hey, we can have a fight for a couple of days. Man. That's nothing compared to where this is leading, you know, or where it to where it's from. But people will rarely do that. You'll see when you have your, you establish your intimate relationships, you know, this is a critical element of forging a longterm union because there will be things about you and your partner that bug each other. And those are places where your maps do not coincide. And sometimes that's for cultural and familial differences. But sometimes it's because one or both of you is deviating seriously from the proper script. And those are hellacious fights, you know? And those are the sorts of things that happen when someone gets really upset about nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:46:13       You think that's not about nothing. It's just, it's like the nothing is is one hair on a camel or something like that. You know you don't have the damn camel without the hair and even if it's one hair, you know there's a camel around so, okay. So anyways, what bugs you? Well that's that anomaly detector saying something isn't right now you think about the things that could be not right. It could be the external world, it could be someone else and their value structure and their behavior. It could be your value structure and behavior and when the thing that comes up that bugs you hits, you don't know which of those it is and one of your tendencies and is going to be to say it's the outside world or that other person because the last place you want to look as inside and that, that's part of the reason that I find increasingly find university campuses intolerable because the default theory when something isn't right is that it's someone else's fault.

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       And I think that is pathological beyond belief because the step from someone else's fault too, they should be punished for that is it's trivial, it's insignificant. So you know, the default position might be it's your God damn fault. Find where you went wrong and fix it. And you might say, well, how can I be at fault? It's like, think about it for an hour. You'll figure it out. Like what? Here's a very useful technique. If you're fighting with someone that you love, you hit an impasse, man. You can't get anywhere. You're misunderstanding each other, you know, and your tempers are flaring and you know, maybe it lasts for a week. It's not entertaining. You go sit on your bed and you think, all right, I probably did something stupid in the last like three years that set me up for this somehow. And if you just allow yourself to imagine your memory will take you to some bloody idiotic thing that you did that might seem to be only tenuously related to the current circumstance, but maybe it's the best you can offer.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       Maybe you're only 5% at fault. Well then you go tell the person while I was thinking about this, and it seems to me to that I set this up like this, and then they're all shorted out because you know you've admitted fault and then that may be allows them to admit fault. They don't have to drive the spike home. And then you can often have a dialogue, but you don't get the dialogue until you're willing to see yourself as a contributor. You know? And the alternative, and this is a terrible alternative, is that you win the argument with your partner. Well, good luck with that because all of that will do is make the person who's better at formulating the arguments, the tyrant and the person who's worse, the slave. And then you got to decide, well, is this slave what you want as a partner?

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       And maybe the answer's yes and no. It could easily be because Japan, oh, could've just as easily picked the but over the boy. So, so there's this, so this, the thing that bugs you, you could think about that as a moral responsibility. And so maybe you go to work and something bugs you and you think, well, I can just ignore that. It's like, don't be so sure your whole damn brain is telling you there's a hole there, there's a hole in the fabric of being and something terrible is going to come out of it unless you do something about it. And you can say, well, I'll ignore that. But all that happens is the whole grows and the monsters inside of it get bigger and you get weaker. And so eventually what happens is the whole gets really big. You get really small and something comes out and eats you, so you get fired or you get royally screwed over at work or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:52       Or maybe someone sets up a conspiracy where you're implicating something you didn't even do and then you get fired and you know it, it doesn't have to end there. And it's all because you didn't pay attention to that thing that was bugging you. You know? Maybe it was, you were supposed to say to some extraordinarily annoying coworker to leave you the hell alone. You know when it, when it was still possible to say that maybe even cause I politely, so you know, once you understand that your brain is an early, an early warning system and the things that bug you are markers for holes

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       in Mba, then it's a hell of a lot easier to attend to them. Now, one more thing, when I first watched this film, or the first dozen times I watched it, you know, I was struck by the concordance between Jimminy cricket and the figure of Christ. And it's weird because obviously Pinocchio to some degree is that is the infant save you, right? But then you have the cricket, his initials are JC, he serves as the conscience, you know, he's a moral guy. So they're kind of inter twined in a very weird way. And when I was thinking about the cricket as the Voice of value, you know, I thought it kind of thought about it as an omniscient voice has a divine voice, but that's not how the film portrays it. What happens is it's so cool. What happens is, is that Pinocchio develops, his conscience develops. It's like there's a dialogue between them. So the conscious, the conscious starts by just spouting rules and you know, your conscience does this to you all the time. If you watch what's going on in your head, you'll see that it continually

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       okay

Speaker 5:          00:51:34       assaults you with doubts and questions about the validity of your Ba. But if you, if you notice, and I dealt with this with people a lot, a lot of the criticisms are sort of generic. You know, it's like a chattering critic and you can ignore a lot of it once you learn how, because you know like the criticism, you're no good that's useless. It's so low, low resolution,

Speaker 5:          00:51:57       you just can't do anything with it. What the film indicates, and this is a very sophisticated ideas that as you start making moral judgments, the first judgments your make your mate are going to be low resolution and generic. They're going to be cliched. But as you attempt to hone yourself and maybe you start fixing the errors in your, in your mode of being, then your ability to detect errors gets better and better and finer and finer. And so at some point you get to the point where you're shipshape enough so that you're going to detect little deviations and jump on those suckers right away. And you won't even no one leave a notice that you just fixed the problem. And you know, if you read any Dallas writings like the Dao de chain, once, you know what I just told you, read the Tao Te Ching, it'll make perfect sense because the Dow, which is the pathway between chaos and order, the Dow is what you're supposed to follow. And the Dow is exactly what allows you to avoid conflict without anybody even notice it. You know, you just, you see the thing pop out when there's nothing to it, you can just smooth it over maybe even gently and no one even notices that you did anything so

Speaker 5:          00:53:09       well. So that's something to aim for. You know, that's definitely something game for it. So, and I, I, I've seen in my own life, the best path to that is truth. That's the best path. And so, you know, part of what you might be thinking is that as you're willing

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       to face the things that bug you, sometimes when you intervene, you're going to make a mistake. You know, you're not going to handle it. Well, maybe you'll even make the situation worse. But one of the consequences of that is that you will learn something. And so the more you learn, you know, the more you're informed and the more you turn on your capacity to, uh, what would you say? Creatively confront. The sharper you get and the better you get at it. So you know, it's going to be like this. You know, at the beginning you're, you're going to be a pretty wobbly system because what the hell do you know about fixing things? But if you practice it a thousand times or 10,000 times or 100,000 times, you know, you'll get very good at it. And that's exactly what this film portrays is there's this dialog between the generic conscience and you could maybe think about that as the superego or something akin to the 10 commandments or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:19       General principles of value. There's a dialogue between the individual and these general principles of value so that the value principles are updated and the individual gets sharper and sharper. And I can tell you a mythological example of that. So there's the scene in the New Testament. One of the things that happens quite frequently in the New Testament, and this is eventually why Christ gets crucified, is that he does moral things that are forbidden. So for example, um, there's a couple of episodes where it's the Sabbath Day when you're not supposed to do anything. And someone comes into the synagogue or the temple and their hand is all withered up and he fixes their hand. And then everybody was pretty freaked out about that whole fixing thing. But they also accused him of breaking a divine rule. And his answer to that is, is the sabbath made for man or a man for the Sabbath?

Speaker 1:          00:55:13       So, and that's a very, you got to understand that that's an unbelievably revolutionary answer because the prevailing morality, and it's always the prevailing morality was follow the damn rules. And his action and response was not when they don't serve the purpose for which they were intended. And so there's another explicit statement of that in, in the New Testament is very, very interesting. So the, by the time this story emerges in the developmental story, the Pharisees and the scribes. So you could roughly think about that as the priests and the lawyers, that powerful, powerful clique are already, they already want to get rid of this guy and they're trying to trap him into saying something that's outright heretical so they can lock them up or kill them. And so the lawyers are always coming around them, pestering him with complex ethical ideas in the hope that it will trip up and make a mistake. And so one of the things they ask him is, which of the 10 commandments is the most important? And that's, uh, you know, that's a hierarchy of principle. Um, question. Well, no matter what he says he's,

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       he's done. Because if you say, what is the most important, you say the others are less important. And so you can get hung out to dry on your argument. But that isn't what happens. He says, if I remember correctly, uh, love thy neighbor as thyself and then says all of the commandments are emanations of that single principle just bypasses the question completely brilliantly. It's brilliant. It's a paradigm shift in mood. And of course that makes the people who are pursuing him even more angry because he made them into fools and showed them how advanced his ability to debate was over. There's, and then there's one other scene that comes to mind where,

Speaker 5:          00:57:05       again, I think it's in this, in this situation where he's being accused of undermining tradition and they, he's asked what his relationship is to the tradition and he says, I didn't come here to break the traditional rules. I came here as their fulfillment. And so it's, it's those sorts of things. You see those in these mythological stories and you think it's, I do not buy for a second that that was invented in any normative sense of the word. No statements are so sophisticated that there that it's, it's unbelievable. They are so sophisticated now, you know, I see them emerging as a consequence of a very lengthy development of mythological imagination and knowledge. But Ah, I just don't understand. I cannot understand for a moment how that could have possibly been thought up. So at least not by a single individual. So you know, when did the idea there too is that passing through the narrow streets of a rule system is one of the ways to emerging on the other side of the rule system. So, you know, and that's all with regards to proper relationships with the great father.

Speaker 5:          00:58:16       You know, the other thing too is that if you allow yourself to be passed through that disciplinary process, you also have firsthand experience of its errors, right? Like if you want to fix the system, unless you subject yourself to the system, how in the world are you ever going to know what it did wrong? You can't just stand from the outside as an observer without having been passed through it at every level and say, well, this is how it needs to be fixed. It's like, what the hell do you know about it? There's no direct personal experience so you don't necessarily even have a right to comment. So one of the things human suggested should, I think it's a boggling idea,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       he thought you were always dreaming awake or asleep, but the dreams just went on continually like maybe not 100% of the time, but you were passing through dreams continually. And what was happening when you were awake was that the, the sensory pressure of the real world was such that it just obliterate it. Your knowledge of the dream. And then when you went to sleep, what happened was you shut off all your sensory input roughly speaking and then the sensitivity of your, what do you say? Signal to noise ratio changes so that the background activity of your underlying neural structures can start to manifest itself and you can detect it all that that might be the dream. And I think there's a reference to that here. Whereas night progresses, one of the things that happens to this cricket is that it gets so sensitive to anything, you know, it's getting more and more sensitive as a detection device. And so at some point it stops time after all enough. So that's pretty interesting because now all of a sudden this bug is the master of time. He can bring time itself to a halt. Okay, now we're in a completely different dimension. We're in the real world, so to speak. Although it was obviously also with dream, like what's that movie where you go through levels of dreaming. Inception. Yeah. So you know the Pinocchio Stories are all, all, all obviously a dream. And then we go down a level to a dream within a dream. And that's what we're in right now.

Speaker 1:          01:01:17       Watch out,

Speaker 3:          01:01:29       let's go.

Speaker 1:          01:01:38       Oh Hey. So like what the hell do you know? Really a star. Dot Star comes down and turns into a ferry. It's like, okay, no one has any problem with that. I mean the crickets a little freaked out, but everybody else seems to think that's a perfectly reasonable low currents. Which really begs the question, how in the world can you understand that you understand that? Cause it's not understandable. It makes no sense know, like from a conscious or rational perspective. Okay, so here's, here's what's happening. We notice that there's a real absence of femininity so far in, uh, in the story. It's sort of implicit in the comfort of the home, but there's nothing explicit it now

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       you can think of Japan as the beneficial element of culture. And so here's the way of conceptualizing it. If the beneficial aspect of culture is put into place, the beneficial elements of nature is called forth. And so, you know, I can give you an example. Like if you have a neurologically damaged infant and that infant grows up in a chaotic environment, the probability that that neurological damage will result in severe behavioral and social impairments is quite high. But if you take an individual like that and you raise them in a stable environment, then they can often stabilize their nervous systems. And so you can see that there's a dance between nature and culture as a child develops and that, you know, if you set the culture up properly, then the child's nature has the capacity to manifest itself in the most beneficial manner possible. Now it would be partly the facilitation of individual development.

Speaker 5:          01:03:17       You know, because the child is a variant of a human being and you want to apply or cultural structure to it, to the child so that it becomes socialized and, and disciplined and able to do things. But at the same time you want it to manifest its particularities. So you've got to get the balance right. Well Japan or made the wish, it's the right wish. So nature comes to the rescue and in its most benevolent forum and it's attractive and seductive. This is almost like, you know, Buddhist farther setting up all the dancing girls in the forest because this, this figure is part of what entices people into life, but certainly entices babies into life. You know, the love that a mother provides is a seduction into life. And no wonder because you need to be seduced into living. It's too hard otherwise, you know, and if babies don't have that primary relationship with their mother, they just fold up and die, fed, warm, bathed, irrelevant. They have to have that relationship. Great.

Speaker 5:          01:04:31       So right away, you know, there's a, there's a hint to give them so much happiness to others. There's a hint of the sexual element there. And so this particular ferry was modeled on a screen queen of the time, you know, a woman who was famous for her beauty. And you know, there's, there's a knob here to something which is that there are multiple elements of being that have nothing to do with rationality that are necessary, that are necessary components of the nature that entices you into life. You know, and one of those primary sources of energy obviously, and delight and motivation and all of those things, his sexuality and his Freud pointed out, it permeates all levels of human endeavor. And you know, we have some trouble with that because it's, you know, sexuality is such a powerful force that wherever you introduce, it's like a divine force. It produces rifts in the cultural structure. You know, hand sold a continual debate about sexual harassment and so forth in the workplace. You know, you have men and women in the same places all the time. And so there's the normative day

Speaker 5:          01:05:40       to day cultural things that are supposed to be occurring, narrow in goal directed and the consistent, you know, eruption of sexuality into that well and you could say, well that should just be stopped. It's like be careful what you say. Do you really want to stop it while you think, yeah, it gets out of hand and rudy fast. It's like, yeah it does. But two attempts to suppress it. So you know you're stuck with it. It's, it's an unalterable element of life's complexity and it's also something that pulls you forward into life. So you can imagine the level of tyranny that would be necessary to eradicate all sexual interactions from the workplace. You just, everyone would wear a uniform. Everyone would have their haircut exactly the same. No one would ever wear makeup. You know, you, you have to be rendered as neutral as possible and even not wouldn't do it. But that would be the start of doing it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:37       Come through little puppet made a pie.

Speaker 5:          01:07:03       See Young would regard that little blue fairy as an anima finger. An animal. Anima means soul. And so there's an idea here that you know, the masculine great fathers sort of constructed the structure that's an oak hill. So that would be the nuts and bolts of the individual as a cultural construct. And then the sort of divine and enticing feminine spirit breathes life into it. And so, you know, there are situations where that causal sequence could be reversed depending on what was being exemplified or amplify. But that's what's happening here. So he wakes up and he becomes self conscious per pretty much immediately.

Speaker 2:          01:07:49       I've given you a nice host tonight. You her wished for real, no Cahokia to make two pillows wish come true. It would be entirely up to you, prove yourself truthful and unselfish and someday you will be over your gone.

Speaker 5:          01:08:10       Okay? So there's a variety of extraordinarily complex things going on here. So you know, one of the things that you'll hear constantly bandied about in a quasi scientific community is the role of nature and nurture. Okay? So we could say architecturally for, for our purposes at the moment in this film, nurture is being represented by Japan because he's constructing things in nature by the ferry. So you can say, well, nature nurture the role of biology versus culture. Well, it's a, it's an interesting ediology we'll say because it makes a proposition and the proposition is that's the only two causal elements that are operating, right? Nature, culture, mother, father, let's say roughly speaking. Then you ask yourself, well, where the hell's the individual in this equation? And the answer is nowhere at all because there's no causal role for the individual in a scientific psychology. It's either nature or nurture.

Speaker 5:          01:09:11       Now that the film, weirdly enough, has a theory that's I would say is more sophisticated than that. It says nature's necessary culture is necessary and it would be best if they were optimized. So you get a head start, for example, if your father actually loves you and so does your mother fair enough? But that isn't sufficient in and of itself to produce, you know, an individual who inhabits the transcendent zone. There's actually choices that have to be made. Now, I would say our entire culture is predicated on the idea that people actually make choices. You know, our, our culture is predicated on the idea of individual responsibility and choice. So we recognize that in our legal system and we recognize it in our individual interactions because you always treat people around you as if they could have chosen something different. You know, unless they can make a really strong case that they couldn't.

Speaker 5:          01:10:03       And then you say, oh, well, you know, then you're not responsible for it. No, I was in a court case at one point and the person who was on trial had been forced to help kill someone with the rock after she'd been stripped naked and threatened with death and rape. And it was a credible threat because she'd already watched the people that were threatening her, beat someone 95% to death. And so she dropped a rock on the guide and you know, then there's a rule in, in law, you're not, no matter what duress you're subject to, you don't get to do that. But this was such an ex she got there accidentally. She just blundered into the situation. She was a single mother and also very worried that you know, if she got killed, you know who the hell was going to take care of her kid and well and so forth.

Speaker 5:          01:10:55       But you know the, the court eventually found in her favor. And the reason for that was that the court, that was the first time in English common law history that that had ever happened. But the court decided that under those circumstances she wasn't acting as an, she had no will, like the circumstance was so compelling that she did what you would expect someone to do. Because the law is also by the way, optimized for the average individual, not for the hero. The law does not demand of you that you act like a hero. And thank God for that. So I know. So if someone says, look, I couldn't help it, and then you believe that you don't judge them, but if they can't make that case, your automatic presupposition is you could have done something differently. And you might ask yourself, you know, to the degree that you're an admirer of nature versus nurture, you know, culture versus nature or biology versus culture. Why in the world do you believe that people have any, any avenue of choice, but you do you act that out in your beliefs all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:11:55       Um, or like more human options, like the results. It doesn't just like, I feel like there's no,

Speaker 5:          01:12:09       well, you know, the problem with that viewpoint is it's fundamentally deterministic. Yeah. Yeah. But, but the reality isn't deterministic. It's probabilistic. And so you can't, like the, one of the things that quantum mechanics makes quite evident is that you cannot draw on airinc cause and effect chains.

Speaker 4:          01:12:29       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:12:29       Yeah. But I know, I know it is. I know it is, but we also exist at the microscale and I'm also not saying that what the movie is putting forth is true. I'm just telling you what it's putting forth.

Speaker 4:          01:12:42       The movements, it's still worse. We'll,

Speaker 5:          01:12:50       well this seems non random to me. Okay. Well yeah. You know, we know what I mean.

Speaker 4:          01:12:57       That's, but that's more like, because I haven't started this conversation, you wouldn't have done that sort of, again, it's a result of link.

Speaker 5:          01:13:06       Lord, you know, I, I'm, I'm, I'm not making a case for the, I'm not making a case for the ultimate validity of this viewpoint. Okay. Or at least if I am, I'm not expecting you to believe it. What I'm saying is that there's a tension between this viewpoint, which is an archetypal and mythological viewpoint and the scientific viewpoint. And you know, the way that a person would object to this viewpoint is by saying, hold on a minute. There's deterministic causality at work. You know, I would say in favor of this perspective is we don't act that way. And you know, maybe we're wrong, but we do not act that way. We shouldn't. Why not?

Speaker 4:          01:13:47       Well, because, because it's an attractive, because I like it wouldn't work,

Speaker 5:          01:13:52       but then I wouldn't object if it, if it wouldn't work. That actually indicates that it's wrong. And that goes back to this sort of debate between Darwin and Newton.

Speaker 4:          01:14:00       Yeah. This is wrong. Not objectively wrong in the sense that it gets not a good way to

Speaker 5:          01:14:07       sure you can say it's wrong. Pragmatically you couldn't say that. And that could be the case. You could make a case that we act as if we have free will because that's the simplest solution to the problem. Yeah, you could. And you know it's a perfectly reasonable argument. Just say that, I don't believe it but, but it's, but as, as a coherent argument, it's, it's fine. It's partly why there is such tension between scientific and mythological views of the world. This is a huge part of the tension. You know, part of it is evolution versus creationism. It's like who cares about that? That's a stupid argument. But this one is much more difficult, you know, that's determinism versus choice. That's part of it. And there's much to be said on both sides. And of course are deterministic models of the world are extraordinarily powerful and we use them all the time.

Speaker 5:          01:14:58       So we also act out our belief in those models. So, okay, so back to Pinocchio. So now he's got his own voice. So that means, you know, partly what that means is that by the time you launch your child into the world, they should have their own voice. You actually see that developing in kids. You see that really developing when they're about to because that's when they learn to say no and like 50% of what a two year old will say to you is, no, I used to fool my son cause he would say no to everything. He'd say no to things like 10 things in a row. And then I'd ask him if he wanted some chocolate ice cream. Then the first thing he would say is no. And then he, you know, startle a bit and think, wait, I actually do want some chocolate ice cream.

Speaker 5:          01:15:40       So but, but we know people called the terrible twos, the terrible twos because that is when the child discovers it's voice, it learns how to push back and then so it's dependent, then it's oppositional, then it starts to become cooperative. You know when you want the child to be a nice balance between opposition land cooperative roughly by the time they hit three and for sure by the time they hit four, because if they don't do it by the time they hit four, it's like the crucial developmental period in many ways his past. So, or you're too stupid to learn how to interact with your kid and you know what, it basically boils down to the same thing. So now he has his voice and he has some limited autonomy. And the first thing that blue fairy tells him is that he has a moral adventure in front of him and that it's going to involve following some rules and they're pretty prosaic and stereotypical rules. You know, they're like a lecture from your, maybe not so favorite act or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:16:41       Easy. You was hard to choose between right and wrong. But how do I know how I know your conscience with your options? Just that still small voice but people won't question.

Speaker 5:          01:17:00       So He's kind of a loud mouth at this point and he holds himself up a little podium to, to, you know, speech or fight from. And one of the things you'll see us, his voice is quite patronizing and phony and it's also very hard to listen to him. Like the next five things he says, they have no life in them. They're boring. And that's because they're basically debt rules. They're necessary, but they've got no spirit in them. And he's also got this pointing thing going on, you know, so he's like a hectoring, superego type of creature and he's too dumb to stay out of the situation. Right. He leaps into it, you know, without even thinking really. And so it's a good commentary on your conscience because that damn thing can drive you crazy. And the thing is, even though it's necessary and partly right, it's also destructive and not completely right. So, you know, that makes it very difficult to know how to relate to it.

Speaker 2:          01:17:53       Just the problem with the world today. Oh hello. Would you like to be conscious about? How does your name Oh credits you have any quick neil, Mr you can. Oh, countries not high. Keep her counselor and guide it on the street and down. So jimminy cricket, but don't we get a badge or something? We'll see. Well, I shouldn't.

Speaker 5:          01:18:55       Okay. So again, a variety of very complex things happens there. Um, first of all, but conscience undergoes a transformation at the same time as the boy does. And so I think the way of thinking about that is that it's something like, you know, obviously human beings are predisposed to learn language, whatever that means. One of the things that infants do when they're in their crib, you'll hear them badly and they're playing with, they're playing with sounds, and I don't know if you know this, but an infant babbles every human phony. So there's four different phonemes speech elements in different languages. You know what one interesting, different saves between many Asian languages in English. There's no distinction between the r sound or end. The old found in many Asian languages and so often Asian people can't even hear that difference. And they certainly can't say it and there's, there's lots of sounds, but that English speakers have a hard time with many, many sounds in Asian languages, lots of sounds in German.

Speaker 5:          01:19:58       Um, you know, there was throat, throat sounds that are kind of guttural. And then there's click languages and you know, there's all sorts of things that not only can you, not by the time you're an adult and trained in one language, but you can't even hear them. Now the child is sitting there battling in every single phony, which is amazing. It's as if it knows the units of every possible language. And then what happens is it loses the ability to admit phonemes that are of that language. It's so not what you'd expect, man. You'd expect that it doesn't know a damn thing. And then it learns the particular full names, not that it knows every phoneme and then loses the ability. That's very peculiar. Okay. So you could say in some sense that the child has a low resolution, broad adaptations to possible languages now.

Speaker 5:          01:20:46       And I would say, well the same thing comes with regards to conscious is the child has the inbuilt mechanism for conscience. You know, and it could be developed in a very large number of specific ways. You know, they, they fit within a universe of potential, what would you call playable moral games. So it's not unbounded, it's not infinite but, but, but it's, it's large. And then so the child comes equipped with that. And then what happens is that it's an, as it's inculturated, the conscience starts to pick up the specific rules that underlie that cultures, motive, social interaction and that sort of the generic corn chance. And so that's what it is at this point. You know, it's been well developed. That's why it's got this sort of rich nature. It's not fully developed, ignores that itself. That's why it's still wants the damn gold badge.

Speaker 5:          01:21:38       It's a lot better than it was when it was just a tramp that had been everywhere. Right. Cause now it's specifically allied with an individual. And so that's interesting too because the movie posits that the conscience requires the individual to develop just as the individual requires. The conscience to develop. It's very cool, very sophisticated idea. And so now they're both sent out fundamentally to learn. Now the conscience is a little wiser because in some sense it's been everywhere. Right? Well that was partly why it was a tramp to begin with. But it also, the interesting thing too is that it doesn't have full control over the individual. You know, and that's a strange thing too because it's not, it's also not what you would expect from a purely deterministic system. You know, a deterministic system you think would be bound by the rules. Well, maybe we are in a very complex way, but certainly not in any simple way. That's rule two, two behavior. You know the rules, but you don't have to follow them. We all always let your conscience,

Speaker 2:          01:22:57       oh yeah, I almost forgot about you. Well, hello. Maybe you and I better have a little to heart talk. Want to be a real boy. I don't, you know, you see the world is full of him page. Yeah, they're in the wrong things, but seek right at the time. But, um, even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes and sometimes the wrong things, but maybe right at the wrong time or vice advisor had a boy and I'm going to help.

Speaker 1:          01:23:47       So there's a nice little philosophical conundrum there. It's quite sophisticated. It's even the conscience can say state explicitly the rules of the game, right? So, so much of it is implicit now he's kind of narcissistic at this point and thinks he knows a lot more than he does know. When he tries to articulate the rules, he finds that he doesn't know them. And even if he did, the thing to which they're being articulated cannot follow matt an articulated level. So, you know, and what that really means is people do this with your two year olds all the time. They explain the rules to them. It's like, it's virtually pointless because a two year old, they don't, they aren't governed by rules. Adults aren't governed by rules. Why in the world would you ever expect that the two year old to be guided by rules and they certainly can't articulate them.

Speaker 1:          01:24:35       You know? Now, if you're careful, there's certain things that you can articulate for a two year old, but explaining complex moral concepts to them is that's just not how they learn how to behave. They learn how to behave by bugging you, roughly speaking and seeing what happens. But not only that, they come for comfort and they laugh like they're, they're charting the interactions constantly and extracting all rules. They're learning it through experience. And that's basically what happens here at the, the, the, the conclusion for the conscience and the puppet as well. We have to learn through experience. It's something that has to be acted out, not explained in an articulated way. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:25:12       Just like, all right, we'll skip the little song.

Speaker 1:          01:25:29       Okay. So now it's the next morning.

Speaker 2:          01:26:02       Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:26:03       So, you know, you can see by his behavior that he's being raised well because he's very enthusiastic. Hence the hopping around, you know, and he's not powering, you know, you could also say, well, he's got the temperament for it and fine. He's not cowering, you know, afraid of the world and Japan, Oh, isn't going to walk him to school, you know, old Japan. Oh, is courageous enough we could say and know, but also confident enough in Pinocchio's capacity at this point to say, okay, you know you're going to manage it. And it's not like he's naive and figures that there's no, that there's no danger. That's not, that's not it at all. It's that he feels that the child is developed enough so that the next logical step is to allow him some freedom of choice in the actual world. So that's what he proceeds to do. Now there's sign that he's a good father. He's not, Pinocchio isn't cotton. They need a whole family that won't let him go. It's encouraging him to move out into the world.

Speaker 2:          01:27:08       One teacher, ow. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:27:36       He doesn't forget to give them a book.

Speaker 2:          01:27:40       Come back. Listen [inaudible] school, I'm no institution would be stupid.

Speaker 5:          01:28:19       Well, well Stromboli so the battle arrest, so this farkes is well, cynical and shallow at the same time and all he ever does is lie. So every single word is a lie. And you can tell that in the falsity of his voice. And so I was back in it.

Speaker 2:          01:28:37       I could give you the time. I tied sleeves on you. We nearly put one over on that old gypsy. That time you might not want to be with a fortune to someone. Let me see.

Speaker 1:          01:29:15       That's it. Okay. So because of long practice, these two are more adept deadline line and Pinocchio is at detecting false hood. Okay. So he, he's, he's still naive and that's not the same as good. He's not doing, he's not evil. He's neither. He's just naive and people often mistake. Now evd for good. I couldn't imagine doing that. That doesn't make you good at, just makes you naive. And so it's definitely one of the, you know, direct threats in the world when the puppet goes out. He actually doesn't encounter like an Avatar of tire map. It's not a natural force. It's not a crocodile. It's not danger lurking somewhere that's, you know, off the natural world. It's the corrupt social world. So you could think about this as his encounter with seth. Although these guys are like low rent versions of Seth, you know, they're, they're petty evil.

Speaker 2:          01:30:11       Speak on the cons, right? You Sleep, oh my name is molly's job. How's that? No one else, any cops. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:31:03       So he's off to school. He's gone. His book soul, you know, he's, he's heading straight towards the, the conventional path to knowledge and enculturation safe and something trips them up. Well we know how that works. And so what trips you up is chaos. And then, you know, chaos can manifest itself as many forums. And what it manifests itself here as is, is like low level of malevolence. So they've got plans for him that he knows nothing about and all the plans are, is exploited. And so you could think about that as one of the canonical existential problems that people face in the world. And what happens is Pinocchio faces a number of canonical existential challenges and they're not trivial. Obviously. He's no match for these characters even though they're like, you know, they're pretty rich. It as far as thugs go.

Speaker 2:          01:31:56       No,

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       I see a man of letters, that personality, this party is more relevant now than it was when it was first, when it was first produced. I mean, you know, people were obsessed with fame at this point, but it has nothing like it is today where we have people who are famous merely for being famous. And you know, part of the reason that they're famous is because they're there. They're like anti stars indicate in a sense what they indicate to people, and this is partly why they're popular, is that you can get to the top of the hierarchy of power and influence without having anything that distinguishes you whatsoever except maybe some random attractive feature. You know? And that's, that's precisely what's being talked about here. And so it took me a long time to figure out why in the world was this film so critical of actors?

Speaker 5:          01:33:20       I thought it was produced by Hollywood. It's like they're engaged in this dramatic game. So what's wrong with actor, but it's not actor in the actor Sam's, it's persona in the psychological sense. Do you want to be the real thing or you want to be something who appears to be the real thing? It's a lot easier. And that way you could, you can attain all the advantages of status and power without having to have done anything that actually contributes to the system in which that kind of status and power is actually possible. So basically what you're doing is you're Europe, Europe, simulacrum of of competence. And you know the fox here like that already. He's cynical about school, but when he holds a book, he holds it upside down. He has no idea what he's being cynical about. And so you might think of this as the first, it's what?

Speaker 5:          01:34:09       It's not necessarily bow first temptation, but it's at first temptation. It's the temptation of persona. Are you going to be really who you are or you're going to be an actor? Well, Pinocchio obviously picks actor and no wonder, you know, it's, it's, it's a convincing possibility and that would be associated with youngs idea of development of the persona. But the persona is also a necessary thing to develop. So you could also think about this as a developmental phase. You need to learn how to act in public. And so if you learn to well how to act in public, well then there's nothing left of you and it's a catastrophe. But if you don't learn at all, well that's equally it. Catastrophe. So, okay. So anyways, he's suckered in by these guys.

Speaker 2:          01:35:01       I can see your name in lights, lights, six feet high. Name no po P. Dot. William wasting precious come home. Yes. Horrible thing.

Speaker 5:          01:35:45       Okay. So the conscience basically tells him it's very interesting. You see this little look where he is.

Speaker 2:          01:35:57       No,

Speaker 5:          01:35:58       that thing in the background there.

Speaker 2:          01:36:04       Well I don't know if I can eat

Speaker 5:          01:36:06       and explain it. I'll try to explain it. One of the holiest Hindus symbols is, is the Yoni Lingham. Um, combination, masculine and feminine. It's like a container and a phallic cylinder and it's often in gold and it's often the thing that's at the center of a temple and it's a car. It's a symbol for the original juxtaposition of masculine and feminine. The creative juxtaposition of masculine and feminine. Okay. So it's also a symbol, it's like a taoist symbol. It's also very similar to the Jewish star, which is a female triangle. And a male triangle put together. And so it's a combination. It's, it's a symbol of the unity out of which valuable things spring Hanse it'd be gold. Well the cricket is speaking from that. And so you could also say that the conscience in some sense is the voice of, it's the voice of the combination of masculine and feminine from him from a mythological perspective. And it's trying to speak natural wisdom or, or maybe it's trying to speak wisdom. That's the optimal combination of natural and cultural wisdom and trying to convince Pinocchio that this isn't a good idea, but he doesn't listen. So then he gets, he meets this Italian, a scam artist fundamentally who in slaves him well pretending that he's doing a good thing and you could see them. The cricket is

Speaker 2:          01:37:35       not very happy about this. Where is that? Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:37:39       Right there. He's Very Unhappy About Pinocchio. Was d two or into cheap attention getting okay.

Speaker 1:          01:38:21       Yeah. So you see there the emergence of the tyrannosaur farther, like you know, in that explosion of Rage is Pinocchio was not acting his puppet part. And so there's instant rage on the part of the tyrant now when he finds out that the crowd is happy about his now a slave making, a fool of himself, that that's also funny and that that can garner attention, that it's all, it's all, you know, put away. So, and you know, it's certainly possible for children to be caused by celebrities by acting badly. Like if you've been around badly behaved children, especially if they're kind of professional added, that's exactly what they do there. You know, they absorb all the attention in the room and they do that by acting in a suboptimal way. And it's a terrible thing to see happen. And that's exactly what's being played out here. You know, their parents think they're giving them freedom, but they're not there. They're quite the contrary. Okay. So anyways, so Pinocchio does his Little Act and shows that he's capable of autonomous action. He makes a fool of himself again at the end and

Speaker 3:          01:39:30       Oh shit.

Speaker 1:          01:39:31       Okay. And then this scene, Japan goes out to look for Pinocchio because he hasn't come home. All right? And so then now we're back after the performance.

Speaker 3:          01:39:46       Boom. Sure. I would push you in the public's eyes, your face. She would be on everybody's down. Yeah. Uh Huh. Uh, you, my, you go to her no heel. Yeah. God, you're going to go home at the old mother Mary called beat.

Speaker 1:          01:40:47       Well, you obviously know what's going to happen next. So he's now become a prisoner of this thing that's exploiting

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       him and it threatens him. And then of course he's kidnapped. So the cricket goes off to look for,

Speaker 2:          01:41:15       what was that show? Don't you worry, I'll have you out of here in no time at all. Why? This is just as easy [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          01:41:36       animosity. Okay. So neither the conscience nor Pinocchio can make it out of here. And so they're both trapped because this is actually a very sneaky, difficult position to be it all right. But anyway,

Speaker 2:          01:42:06       I tell her the truth.

Speaker 5:          01:42:16       You know, there's an idea about creative people that they have a muse and the muse is often a feminine figure. And there's a variety of reasons for that. But some of the were played out in this movie. But the idea to some degree is, is that, you know, if you're out in no man's land in chaos, maybe you've broken a social rule that there's the possibility that you can garner something positive from it if your attitude is proper. And that's part of what's happening here is that he encounters the positive element of deviation deviating from the path. But there's also something a little more subtle, which is the idea that your nature is robust enough to tolerate a certain amount of deviation from the proper course. You can tolerate like oscillations back and forth into too much order. It too much chaos without it completely undermining you.

Speaker 5:          01:43:08       But then the movie also makes a point is that that works best if you're not falsifying your own experience. And of course this is the part of the movie that, that Everybody Who Watches Pinocchio always remembers is that when he tells a lie, his nose growth, right? Making him making the lie obvious to others fundamentally. And you know, the, the simple moral from the stories don't lie. And of course that's, that's a primary part of the developmental sequence in the movie. Part of the problem with the lie is that it prevents you from repairing your own structure because you deny the existence of the error. And what do you do then is accumulate errors as you move through time. And if you do that long enough then all you are is there and then you're really in

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       trouble because part of your conscience is speaking from the error ridden domain. And so the more you pathologize your own internal structure or say your relationship with the broader community, the less it is possible for you to realize it. To rely on that in build voice of conscience because it gets pathologized too. And so you can imagine that as the development of a positive feedback loop. The more you tell yourself lies, the more ben your perceptions become. And and the more unstable the self guiding mechanism so to speak inside of you becomes. So that's the corruption of the self is. And then the corruption of the state.

Speaker 1:          01:44:39       You know, one of the things you hypothesize where's the people are almost always bugged by, by things that are also partly that are connected in some important way. To the social community. And one of the things he suggested was that if you really fix your own problems, you know the problems that have announced themselves to you within your own personal space, if you took them on is your problems to fix. You would also be simultaneously retooling the social structure in so far as you were able to do that. Because there's no, there's no only fixing you, you know, you, you change the social structure around you just by fixing yourself. And so what that also means is that to the degree that you failed to respond to your own knowledge of error, and this is what makes it so cool. It isn't, this process is isn't someone else telling you that you're wrong, it's you telling yourself that you're wrong. And so it doesn't, failure to abide by the rules because the rules, while the conscience is the arbiter of the rules, they're unstable, necessary but unstable. But you're, you're, the moral battle that you're obliged to pass through is it is a product of your own construction. And so it's as if you're playing a game and then where you make up the rules and then cheating, not useful.

Speaker 3:          01:45:59       Cool. Oh, it's writing it. Anyway.

Speaker 1:          01:46:11       So now he's given up back to nature.

Speaker 3:          01:46:21       I tell her the truth. Ah, oh wow. This Nokia, why didn't you go to school? Go ahead Tom.

Speaker 2:          01:46:53       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:47:00       The other thing that's happening here obviously is that he, as he lies, he becomes less human and more would like. So hence the, you know, the nose growing. So anyways, he learns that that's a bad idea and the ferry gives them a hand and he escapes out of that. Hypothetically having learned something.

Speaker 2:          01:47:25       Okay,

Speaker 5:          01:47:26       now I want you to follow this. So you remember at the beginning of the movie, Pinocchio, God, his smile, you saw that negative male figure glaring out of it. And then we saw the same negative fee figure male figure in the, uh, you know, in the Gypsy who the kidnapping gypsy. Now they're harsh, tyrannical male. Okay. So what you're doing is, and then of course there's the Fox and the cat. You're seeing different incarnations are avatars of the, of the negative. Great fodder. And you know, with, with, I would say some contamination by the adversary, but we'll, we'll just stick with the negative. Great farther. Right now, what happens here is the actual archetype reveals itself. So you could think of this as a, you know, it's a daunting is inferno model. Pinocchio is coming into contact with things that are more and more serious.

Speaker 5:          01:48:12       And what you see here is the petty petty evil guys bragging about how remarkable they are to the coachman coachman's that typical archetipal a representation of Satan. So the coachman is someone who takes you where you don't want to go. You know, it's something that, that it's, it's your, your placement within the confines of an autonomous force. So what you see here is they encounter the coachman and the coachman doesn't reveal who he is except in one place. And what's interesting, so it's all of a sudden he transforms from a, a mere character in the movie. So to speak, to the archetype itself. It reveals itself. And then the gates slam back shop. And one of the things that's very interesting is that that revelation is sufficient even to terrify the thugs because in some sense they have no idea what they're messing with. You know, and they're very art. They're very narcissistic and egotistical and they think that they're going to get away with what they're doing forever and you know that they're really not so bad anyways. And that the people they're praying on it deserve it because they're stupid and you know, they're full of rationalizations, but they get a glimpse of what it is that's animating them and it terrifies them.

Speaker 2:          01:49:54       This job's too coach man. What's your brother's name? How would you like to make some money? And who do we ask to it? Nothing. You see, you'll know the disability. No, no, no crossing.

Speaker 5:          01:51:33       You always meet the Devil at the crossroads, right? Cause every blues singer notes. Why? Because the crossroads is a binary choice. Right. And there's the right road in the wrong road. So the devil always be two at the crossroads. So, and that's where the coachman meets the boys. It's a decision point. So, okay. So something up is something is up that isn't good. So Pinocchio is going back to school and then he gets stopped again.

Speaker 2:          01:52:03       Okay, the snake to go, no sir, nothing can stop me now I will. I'm going to school. That's it.

Speaker 6:          01:53:16       Victim. That's the next temptation.

Speaker 5:          01:53:20       So, and the victim Motif is a deep one. So basically what the Fox tells the boy now is that there's a bunch of things wrong with it. Well obviously right? Because there's a bunch of things wrong with everyone, but, and so he can make a perfectly reasonable claim of that. And then he convinces the boy that the fact that there's something wrong with him justifies his deviation from what he's supposed to do. And that's, that's a classical eatable trick, by the way, if you want to keep your kids at home and make sure that they never leave and render them completely useless, what you want to do is watch them toy with their own vulnerability and then encourage that, you know? So if the kid, you ever use this being ill as a, an excuse, which every kid will absolutely do, especially if they have to go do something they don't want to do, like go to school, you just give in every time they do that.

Speaker 5:          01:54:08       Or if you really want to do a good job, what you do is you reward them every time they do that and you punish them every time they do the opposite. And if you do that 150,000 times, then you'll have someone who will be absolutely incapable of standing on their own two feet. And that's very helpful for you. If that's the sort of person you want to have around that, usually you're usually inclined to do that if you don't have a life of your own, you know, and you can't even tolerate the possibility of ever being alone. So you cripple your child so they can't leave.

Speaker 6:          01:54:39       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:54:39       So that's essentially what's being offered to Pinocchio now. And then the, the Fox says, look, you're way too stressed. Everything's too terrible. What you need is a vacation. So what we're going to do is replace the, the duty, so to speak to them. You know, the movement forward towards the proper goal with nothing but fun and games. So it's, you could say it's a future discounting in the extreme, forget about the future. Life is hard. Concentrate on the present, do the easy fun things and you deserve it anyways because you're in such rough shape, you can see that that's a very compelling temptation. I mean, I had a child who is quite ill for a long time and one of the things we really struggled with was if you have, you're with someone who's really ill, how the hell do you know when to excuse them from their obligations?

Speaker 5:          01:55:26       You know, like I could never, we had to, we had the negotiate this all the time. So my, my, my one child was very, very tired in the morning, terribly tired. It was a secondary consequence of this particular illness. But you know, we were trying to negotiate that. It's like you have to go what you have to do, unless you absolutely can't. Okay. When can't you? Well, God, can you do it if you can crawl out the door? I don't know. Did you ever see my left foot? It's an amazing movie. It's based on a true story. It's about this kid who, I think he had cerebral palsy but he couldn't really do anything with his body except with his left foot. He could drag himself around with his left foot and he learned to write and he learned to draw and he learned how to communicate.

Speaker 5:          01:56:10       And you went to school. But as far to just wouldn't help him. He dragged himself up and down the stairs. Like he had to do everything with his left foot. And you know, he managed, he managed to live that way. But you know, I just, I can't, I don't think I've ever met anyone in the modern world who would be tough enough to do what his father did because you know, you'd say, well, have some compassion. It's like, yeah, well compassion is a double edge sword, you know, and the basic rule, I can tell you what the rule is, and this is a rule that's often used in nursing homes. Never do anything for anyone they can do themselves. And you think, well that's, that's harsh man part because you have to find out what they can do. But it's also respect for their autonomy and encouragement to continue developing so

Speaker 5:          01:57:00       well. So that isn't what happens here. You know, one of the things I told my child was never use your illness as an excuse. Not even once. Because as soon as you do that, even once, you won't be able to tell the difference between being sick and wanting to be sick. And when you're sick like that and you know, 50 things is wrong with you, it's already hard enough to figure out what you can do and what you can't do, man, you drop a little bit of poison into that brew and like it's just toxic mess everywhere.

Speaker 5:          01:57:31       We must diagnosis cases once we got the, Yup. So basically what happens here is that by over attending to Pinocchio's, let's say neurotic doubts, the parent figure produces, uh, like hop, hop, hypochondriasis, you know, because partly what parents kids are doing is saying, I feel like this, what does that mean? My throat hurts a bit. Does that mean I don't have to go to school? Well, for sure you don't have to go to school and there's probably eight other things wrong with you. You know, and then let's spend a bunch of time looking for them. Maybe we can have a hug and a cuddle while we're doing that. And I don't have to watch my stupid soap operas and you could stay home from school and keep me company. It's a little conspiracy, you know? So the child learns to do that and to bloody will exploit that like mad. And the parent can justify doing that with the feeling that they're being compassionate. So it's a nasty, nasty little game. And that's partly why it's laid out here. So anyways, he convinced his Pinocchio, the sick, making him sick in the process and then telling him he needs a vacation. So off they go. Vacation time.

Speaker 3:          01:58:51       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:59:06       Okay. So this nasty little character we're going to beat now, meet now. His name is lamp wake. And I think that's a reference to Lucifer. It's the same category of word and he's a prematurely cynical, delinquent type of kid and he's got a very superior and arrogant attitude cause he goes everything cause nothing's worth knowing. And he's the adversary. He's Pinocchio's shadow. That's, that's one way of thinking about written. So Pinocchio meets a Chateau, which of course every teenager meets when they're a teenager because that's who you meet when you're a teenager, right? It's, it's that part of the developing ego that's challenging the structure of the community and often doing that by breaking rules. And so that's what people always talk about as pure pressure. You know, are you going to try this bad thing or are you going to try that bad thing? You know, kids have to experiment with that. And so it's part of the deal. It's part of the developmental progression. And you know, the question is well, why not behave badly and break all the rules and be on disciplined and you know, take every advantage it's at your fingertips. That's a perfectly reasonable question.

Speaker 3:          02:00:22       Let me say it's a swell job. No school, no. Nobody says, oh boy. Oh boy. That's the place.

Speaker 5:          02:00:39       The other thing that's interesting about lamp wait cause he completely narcissistic, like I don't give, it doesn't even exist for him. And so he's basically, he's got tremendously well developed psychopathic traits and he's also delusional because he thinks this is all going to be free. So they go off the route of the main culture out to an isolated place. All right, so it's like, I would say that we're there going, I told you that [inaudible] was a suburb of the underworld. Well that's where they're headed. So, and they're also in a mall, not an easy thing

Speaker 2:          02:01:38       to escape.

Speaker 5:          02:02:02       One of the things that's quite striking about horror movies is that they're often, they often feature clouds and they're often said at amusement parks and you might say, well, what, what the hell is the connection between the Amusement Park and horror? Well, I don't know if you've ever been to amusement park, but if you have, you can see the connection pretty much right away. You know, they, it's, it's mindless entertainment, roughly speaking. And now it's not like there's anything particularly intrinsically terrible about mindless entertainment. But there's this, there's a dark side to amusement parks and carney life and the gambling that goes on there, like it's low level. It's a low level place. It's a low class place roughly speaking and it's because it's associated. It's associated with this idea of fun in the moment with no care for the future. And that's its dark side.

Speaker 5:          02:02:52       That's the part of it is, is it's tinted with horror and that's what happens here. These kids have abandoned culture. They don't care about it at all. They're cynical about it and no doubt they have their reasons and they move. They not only are they cynical about it, but they even hate it. Maybe it's being too tyrannical for them or maybe they just don't want to bear the responsibility of having to live up to its demands. In any case, they moved from, you know, ceasing to identify with it, to wanting to pull it down completely. And they do that partly by engaging in mindless entertainment. But there's more to it than that. And this is, this is where the Nazi mob thing starts to happen.

Speaker 2:          02:03:53       So you can't find your car chase in the mall.

Speaker 5:          02:04:02       Now you see that center symbol that's a Mandela niche. It's very commonly portrayed in cathedrals and the Mandela is the symbol of the self from a union perspective. And why that is is ridiculously complicated, but it's the best way that I could describe it as like there's this Buddhist idea that a lotus flower grows up from the depths through the water and then lays itself open on top. And then the Buddha emerges in the middle. And that's what a Mandela is. It's that flower process. It's like emerging being manifesting something perfect. And that's that thing represents.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       So

Speaker 3:          02:04:39       no, all right,

Speaker 1:          02:05:04       I've been there. And then you start to see what's going on. And like as I, as I mentioned it at some point, like remember what was happening in Europe at the time that this movie was being made. You know, like the dark forces of fascism were really starting to gather, you know, in the movie is an unconscious dram of sorts. And one of the things that it's suggesting is that there's a tight connection between the abandonment of individual moral responsibility. The turning to deceit and the degeneration of society into something that's pleasure, short term pleasure on the one hand that absolute slavery and brutality on the other. And so you have this faceless figures moving in the background, locking the doors to begin with. And it's all a conspiracy in some sense to conspiracy by the coachman in order to entrap the unwary

Speaker 3:          02:06:04       awesome themselves. No.

Speaker 1:          02:06:21       So you know, Pinocchio is become separated from his conscience. I would say that happens to lots of people in, in their teenage years. You know, they experiment with all sorts of things they know they shouldn't be doing. It's not a particularly pleasant life and they lose the thread that guides them. Now there's some necessity in that because in some sense they're wandering through places that they need to explore, but it's also very dangerous because it can leave you permanently damaged, you know, you can fall out and never get back on. Okay, so Pinocchio is in there and he's like playing pool and smoking and drinking and acting like a narcissist. And this guy knows some cool tricks and they're Pinocchio. He takes a little swig of his cigar and you know, it makes him sick. Right? So there, that's, that's deceit right there, right. He's willing to falsify the nature of his actual experience, even at a deep physiological level in order to impress this character

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       who, you know, was the last person in the world that anyone sends a postcard to impress. Okay. And now he can't end. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:07:51       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:07:52       That's also very interesting. You know, you see the sideways eight ball and that's a symbol of infinity and it's starting to wander. And you know, partly what the, partly what the images are suggesting is, first of all, Pinocchio's aim is very unsteady because he's pathologized himself and he's also like, he's facing an infinite number of problems and can't aim straight to fix them. Losing your grip.

Speaker 5:          02:08:27       I also think that's pretty funny from the perspective of teenage experience because it's often the case that just when some idiot teenager is out to impress someone, he or she shouldn't depressed, that their conscience will pipe up and they'll do something absolutely moronic that you know, makes them into a fool in front of the people they're trying to impress. And that's exactly what's happening here. You know, and its partly because the person is torn apart inside and can't act with any strength. Okay. So anyways, the cricket end, this lamp put character have it out and Pinocchio decides that he's going to go with Lamp Wick and so Pinocchio storms or the cricket storms out

Speaker 2:          02:09:05       and then he's going home. He's come on, come on and watch your neigh. Okay, Yo go vegan ice.

Speaker 5:          02:09:50       Okay. So basically what you see is that the pathway that's been laid out so far including this neurotic induced antisocial trip to pleasure island basically culminates in a form of slavery. But there's more to it than that because it's voiceless slavery. Right. These kids, they're now jack houses. They're not fit to be slaves until they can't speak properly anymore. All they can do is break. So they've severed their connection with their capacity for genuine speech to such a degree that everything that is associated with a logo. So let's say with the ability to think things through and communicate, that's all gone. You're empty and brain and that's at that point, they're fit for slaves. Yeah. Well, it's not only that he can't speak is, is fit when you can no longer safe zone. Right, right, right. Absolutely. That's right. So that means that all of these individual identity is gone as well. There's nothing individual left at all. There's just brute animal existence and that's fit for slavery.

Speaker 2:          02:10:50       Oh, mine, next door. Maybe Allen and Paul. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:11:13       Okay. So last notes are good

Speaker 2:          02:11:20       conch. Okay. You'd think something was done or as you get to be a real board, what do you think?

Speaker 5:          02:11:56       Okay,

Speaker 2:          02:11:56       sure.

Speaker 5:          02:12:01       Hey,

Speaker 2:          02:12:05       allow me Brian. Okay,

Speaker 5:          02:12:55       so the mirror, of course, that's the destruction of painful self consciousness. Oh, Yay. So the cricket knows what's going on and he goes to Rescue Pinocchio. And then the only way out from this place is to dive into chaos. So that's what happens. They jump off the cliff, very dangerous to get from somewhere terrible to somewhere, absolutely unknown. And so they do that and they go home, they wash up at home. And so that's where we are now. Well, you can't go home again. Okay, so dad's not home. It's too late. And so now they have no idea what to do.

Speaker 2:          02:13:56       Going

Speaker 5:          02:14:00       now you'll see a weird intermingling of, I would say pagan and Christian Christian symbolism. So the star now sends a dove and the dove is a symbol of the holy ghost. Right? And hypothetically, the Holy Ghost, there's three members of the Christian Trinity, the father, the son, and the Holy Ghost. And that's what the hell is a holy ghost. You know, that's quite the weird idea. But what it is, what it is, is it's a representation of the idea that you have an image of the divine within you and that it's something that can, it's something capable of communicating. And so it's a natural force in part, which is also why it's associated with the blue fairy and this and this star. It's, well that's the best I can do at the moment with that. So anyways, it gives the cricket a message from beyond so to speak.

Speaker 2:          02:14:57       Hey, it's a message pop up. It says here, he um, he went looking for you and uh, uh, he was one of them.

Speaker 5:          02:15:13       Okay. So you noticed that, you know, Pinocchio without Japan it was lost, but you pedo without Pinocchio gets degenerates into chaos and it's swallowed by a whale. So the two are necessary for one another anyways. People swallow this part of the plot without any problem. And so the cricket now tells the puppet that in order to become real, he has to go to the bottom of the ocean and rescue his father from a whale. And so another part that makes absolutely no sense. So anyways, that's what they proceed to do back into the, the cricket warns him about how dangerous this is, but decides to go along anyways. So down they plunge into the ocean and they have some kind of cute adventures and they get the fish to tell them where they're going. But the Fisher so scared that they just run away when they hear monster name. And so notice that you know, he's in the depths already and he has to go to the darkest place in the depths in order to find where his father is. Okay. Now Japan goes in there and he's starving to death in the belly of a whale. There's not enough food, there's not enough nourishment for him to survive. And he can't see any way that on his own he can get out. In fact, he's actually given up.

Speaker 5:          02:16:52       Okay. And he's fishing because he thinks, well, you know, we might as well have some beat. The whale wakes up and it catches a bunch of fish, but it also catches what you might describe as king of the fish. Now see that's Pinocchio.

Speaker 3:          02:17:11       So let's,

Speaker 5:          02:17:13       so this is where the movie gets varied. I really have very difficult time understanding how this symbolism got in there. But this whole part of the movie is packed with fish symbolism. And although you may know or you may not, but the fish was a symbol for it, early Christianity and Christ is assimilated to the fish. There's all sorts of fish symbolism in the new testament and there's all sorts of reasons for that, a number of which are truly incomprehensible. Some of the raster logical, because I won't even go into that. So imagine this way, you're somewhere starving

Speaker 5:          02:17:51       and you've got, you've got two choices. You can either figure out how to live so that you're not going to be starving anymore or you can catch some fish. Okay. So you can, you can feed yourself momentarily or you can feed yourself for the long run. And so, and people are making that choice all the time. And so you might say, well, if you're a good fisherman, you catch a fish. But if you're a really good fit from fishermen, you catch something from the depths that feeds you all the time. Okay. So that's what's happening here. Yup. Oh he thought there was any relationship with the Fisher and the Fisher king cause you know yes, definitely. Yes, absolutely. Yes, definitely. So, okay, so now Japan, I was fishing like mad and he's happy because he's catching fish now. It's very cool what happens here because Japan, oh, couches, a bunch of fish.

Speaker 5:          02:18:39       Hypothetically he's looking for Pinocchio. But he says the unbusy catching fish that when he catches Pinocchio he doesn't even notice. And then he kind of wakes up to the fact that he's caught Pinocchio, which is really what he's trying to catch. And when he turns around to hug him, he grabs a fish and he kisses the fish and then notices that it's not Pinocchio. So the filmmakers are very careful to insist upon the fact that you peddle becomes, he's blinded by short term considerations and cannot see when he's caught the thing that's the most valuable. And we see why Pinocchio is the most valuable. So this is actually the redemption of Japan. Oh, to some degree, he needs Pinocchio's youth and vision to rescue himself from sterile, sterile, and static existence. And that would be associated say with the, the, the construction of us, a sterile totalitarian, like North Korea, where I think I told you last week, the wise leader has told all the Koreans that they better get used to sucking routes like they did 20 years ago because there ain't gonna be any food. And not only that, they get to donate to pounds of rice a month each to the state warehouses, which in principle are supposed to be the places that distribute the food. So the idea that a static enough state can become sterile and baron is exactly right. So,

Speaker 3:          02:19:53       all right,

Speaker 5:          02:20:11       here's a mythological motif there and many hero stories when the hero heroes out to find the worst thing. But when he finally finds it, it's like he's out of there. But by that time it's generally too late. You know? So what it means to some degrees that no matter how awful the thing that you're looking for, no matter how awful you think the thing that you're looking for is, it's more awful than you think. Even prepared. So Pinocchio, he's out of their conscience too. They're both gone.

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:22:28       Okay. So Japan will basically tells Pinocchio that there's no damn way they're getting out of this whale. And so Pinocchio has a bit of a brainstorm. Oh yeah. Do you pay to also finds out that he's half turned into a donkey, which isn't all that pleasant. He gets forgiven,

Speaker 2:          02:22:43       right?

Speaker 5:          02:22:45       Japan. Oh, says he's built a raft that they can get out with, but everything comes in and nothing goes out in Pinocchio. Decides that he could make the whale sneeze and he does that. So we'll start here. He's got this brainstorm of an idea.

Speaker 2:          02:22:58       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:22:58       Master of fire idea.

Speaker 2:          02:23:00       No, not all offices working comes. Oh, it's all British prenup. Nice. We cooked some of the fish.

Speaker 5:          02:23:17       Okay. So that's a paradigm shift for Japan. Oh, the fire is there to cook the fish for Pinocchio. It's there to escape from the damn whale. Now, the other thing that happens here is Pinocchio sacrifices. A bunch of things that you pedal thinks are useful. Japan will thinks he's going to be in the whale. I know. Okay. So now Pinocchio breaks up all the furniture and builds a fire out of it. And so he's, you know, when part of that is, uh, an explicit, remind her that part of the reason that the way people got out of the whale, you know, the terrible chaotic force of nature was to master fire. It's a technological, it's a technological solution.

Speaker 2:          02:23:50       These are not the chair. Oh, okay.

Speaker 5:          02:24:21       No. So there's an idea there too that the human use of technology is likely to make the environment, you know, react terribly. And we're all, we're guilty about that all the time. It's part of what underlies our environmental guilt. You know, we're using technology against nature and you know, we always feel that there's going to be a kickback, we'd done something wrong, there's going to be a kickback. You know, it's, it's not like it's completely unfounded. Okay. So now the way home, there's something bursty very surprising, which is that it transforms into a fire breathing dragon.

Speaker 2:          02:25:04       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:25:08       Okay. So then there's a great band demand. The whale just won't quit. Need breaks their boat. Altarpieces Pinocchio rescues his father there and then the is all smashed to pieces. We'll pick up, right?

Speaker 3:          02:25:26       Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:25:34       Japan. Oh says save yourself right now. He's out of the damn whale. Why bother with the old mat? That's a good question. You know, and because part of that question is, well, what's the relationship between the individual and the culture? What responsibility do you have to the culture? It's drowning. It's not much use. It's old. It's, it's, it produced you. It's worn out. It's dangerous to rescue it. Why bother? Well, Pinocchio decides to rescue his father. So Pinocchio is basically peer destroyed by the clash between no hell they should chaos and insufficient culture. And so as far as we know, Japan, it was alive.

Speaker 3:          02:27:24       Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:27:31       So you know, he sacrificed himself to save his culture. But you have, you have to remember what he sacrificed. He's a jackass, puppet. And maybe that is what's supposed to be sacrificed. If you're going to save your culture, you know, you get rid of the jackass. Puppet is the really adopt the part of the, we want to have live anyways. People identify with that. They think, oh, that's me. That's what I think. That's who I am. It's like, well, if you find yourself breaking, you might presuppose that that's not exactly the case.

Speaker 3:          02:28:32       Unselfish Aye.

Speaker 5:          02:29:29       Harmony is restored. You can see that father and son Canal dance together.

Speaker 3:          02:29:45       Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:29:58       And the car insurance is like finally transformed at this point.

Speaker 3:          02:30:07       She was nice. Hmm.

Speaker 5:          02:30:15       And now it's like a gold flower. It's called Mandela. It's the sun. It's all those things. And you see you can communicate with this star.

Speaker 3:          02:30:30       No.

Speaker 5:          02:31:09       So all of that wrapped up in the Little Kid's movie, you know, you can think about it. There's the work of the collective imagination. And I mean that literally in some sense

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       because a huge number of people who are creative worked on this, you know? And so it's constant compromises as to plot and as to, you know, the images that are going to be used. And like there's a tremendous amount of attention and same amount of attention focused on every single sale. Right? These things were hand painted. So the amount of work that goes into each frame is it's hours and hours and hours of work and do each frame 60 frames a second cause Disney did it at 60 frames a second, you know, so, and it's completely, you know, it's hard to remember when you watch something like this that every single bit of it was created, you know? And, and by people who had to agree by genius level people who had to agree on what they were doing and so they'd feel their way, what seems right, you know, and the group would agree, look, that's the right thing. Or someone would insist upon having had done this particular way and the narrative would emerge from that. And someone had an intuition, probably Disney, that, you know, the Pinocchio Story had enough. It's quite a bit transposed from the colone story, the original story. But then it had enough depth, you know, to hang a story on it and to be worthy of that much attention.

Speaker 2:          02:32:30       So,

Speaker 1:          02:32:33       and I think I like the developmental path that it traces. It's, it's as accurately summarized in that movie as I'd ever seen it summarized. I mean, the movie is not without its flaws. I would say it kind of slips into moralizing from, you know, from time to time. Although, you know, I don't know if it's been done better.

Speaker 2:          02:32:57       So

Speaker 1:          02:32:58       you don't want to complain about it too much.

Speaker 2:          02:33:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:33:03       So, well one of the questions that we posed at the beginning of the course was, you know, why do people do terrible things? Why does societies degenerate? In answer to that, as far as I can tell, is because people don't, they people decide to not attend to their knowledge of their own errors

Speaker 1:          02:33:25       or errors in the situation they find themselves. I think maybe it's, they don't attend to their knowledge of holes in being that might be a more reasonable way of putting it. And because they refuse to attend, they allow the structure to get rotten and they allow themselves to get weak. And the more rotten the structure and the weaker the people that compose it, the more rapidly it degenerates, the further rottenness and uh, quickly or everything descends into something that's absolutely horrified. Hell for all intensive purposes. And so the alternative to that out as far as I can tell, isn't so much specifically political as it is psychological. Although I think at this level of analysis, those two things merge, you know, you work on correcting the errors that are accessible to you in your own life, that you can correct and that you know how to correct and simultaneously you have the best chance of raw find your culture and keeping, you know, the horrors of tyranny and an unbridled nature at bay. You know, and I would also say that's the fundamental human story. We've been working on that story for our entire evolutionary history. And so maybe it's wrong, but that's the one we've based our survival law. And you know, there's always the possibility that it's not wrong.

Speaker 1:          02:34:45       That's it guys. Nice talking to you.
