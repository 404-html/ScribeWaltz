Speaker 1:          00:00:35       Okay. Well, since we haven't been at this for awhile, I'm going to briefly review what we've come up to him and then where are we going?

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       I guess the basic idea,

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       well, maybe I'll start with something instead. I guess we probably reviewed enough. I'm going to read you something from Tolstoy, which you probably read or theoretically read. One of the things we're going to discuss today please, the manner in which anomalous information, because that's itself, the different manners in which anomalous information can present itself and how that, how anomalous information as a category is represented. Basically. No, we know already. Anomalous inflammation tends to adopt symbolism associated with the feminine feminine with chaos because it's a normal information, which is information you don't expect. Of course, that produces emotional chaos because it disrupts your versions of the emotional significance of the present and the future and conceivably how to get from one to the other.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       Our whole discussion so far has been based on the idea that you can look at the world from two different perspectives and when you're thinking about the constituent elements of things, you can take the straight materialistic perspective, which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. And talk about how things are constructed scientifically as if they're independent object and we've got a long way it's doing that. But there's another way that you can look at the world and that's as a place that exists as experience and as a place that exists as a stage for action basically. And it is the case, I think it's, it's well known and not frequently disputed that the world as a place to act is not derived bubble as from the world as it exists, which is to say that you can accumulate all the facts you want about a given situation or a thing. And that doesn't tell you how you, how you should conduct your behavior in that situation or around that thing. And the reason for that basically is because you have to choose, you'd have to make decisions about what constitutes the optimal solution to your particular emotional problems.

Speaker 2:          00:03:29       Yes,

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       and I, I said before and I've been thinking about this a lot lately, I think one of the reasons that

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       average before,

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       oh, the nonacademic community has contempt for the academic community is because we have been laboring under the presumption that knowing facts is, is what intelligence is for and that's not right. Intelligence is to tell you how to regulate your emotions. That's what it's for. Can you do that by figuring out how to behave?

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       If you've explored something thoroughly from this perspective, that means that you know how to act when you're there. It doesn't mean you know everything about the situation from the factual perspective, and that's obvious because you'll never find yourself in a situation where you know everything from the factual perspective. And that brings up another interesting point, which is how is it that you can stop asking questions since you're always surrounded by an infinite number of mysteries and answer to that is as far as I can tell it, you stop asking the questions about a situation when what you know is good enough to get you where you want to be in that situation. And that constitutes grounds for presuming that your exploratory behavior in that situation has gone far enough. So if I want something from you, despite the fact that I don't know everything about you or even anywhere near anything and everything about you, I know you sufficiently when my interactions with you produce the results that I did, I did, I desire. And so that gives us some insight into how it is that your knowledge can both be limited but sufficient. And that's a useful, that's a useful piece of information to have.

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       You're to explored territory when what you do produces what you want. And the, from the mythological perspective, explored territory is one of the constituent elements of the universe, right? That's the no, that's the patriarchal system. How unexplored territory, whenever something you do produce as a consequence, you don't expect. And that's, that's an interesting notion because we tend to think of territory as the place that you're at. But this is in a sense a way of making a leaf up into the idea of a spiritual territory. Because psychologically speaking, you can be in the psychologically speaking, despite the fact that you're in the same place. You can be in two different places. If, sorry, let me get this straight.

Speaker 1:          00:06:25       Even though even if I don't shift position, I can be in two different places. If I'm talking to you and what I want to happen happens, that's one place. And if I'm talking to you and something or don't expect happens, that's another place. Even though I haven't moved, the emotional significance of those two places is entirely different. So those are psychological places and as far as myth, mythology is concerned, it's psychological places that are real. That's at least with regards to their significance for behavior, which is what myth is concerned with. Genomic was concerned with morality. That's, that's normal. That's not names.

Speaker 2:          00:07:03       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       so there's the place that you're familiar with and that's the place that you've explored sufficiently so that what you want to happen is happening and there's a place that you're unfamiliar with and that's the place that emerges when you make a mistake. And then there's the process that turns one into the other, which is to say that if you make a mistake and you continue to explore, you might be able to modify your behavior so that the consequences of your mistake vanish, which basically means that you can figure out how you should have behaved in that circumstance and that you rectify your behavior in the future or that you can smooth things over so that the consequences of your mistake go away now. So that's the capacity to turn chaos in doored. It's also the case that you can turn order into chaos by continuing to explore in territory that other people have already defined as sufficiently explored. And that means that the process of creative exploration can bring order and it can also bring chaos. These are forms of the normally here.

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       They're written down in the, in the manuscript. The revolutionary hero as a bringer of a normally is someone who continues to explore. When everyone else says we're getting where we want to be at the present time, which is just to say they're saying you should leave

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       well enough alone. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:08:37       One of the things that we've been trying to do, we looked at mythological representations of the unknown and they tend to take two forms. Basically, they tend to manifest themselves in feminine shape and there's a lot of reasons for that, but the basic reason is because it's the unknown that everything comes from. So when you explore something unknown, you generate new information. So it's reasonable to conceive of the unknown as a matrix. And the idea of the Matrix is contaminated cognitively speaking with quick notions of creation and notions of the source. And it's reasonable to think of the unknown as the source of all things. It's reasonable as a consequence, I think of it hasn't in the same category as feminine things. And the unknown takes the unknown as a feminine thing takes on two sets of characteristics and one is the creative characteristics and the other is the destructive characteristics because the unknown can disrupt things and destroy them and it, but it also serves as the ground for everything.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       So it has it affectively ambivalent status that's permanent. So that's a constituent element of experienced on don't always have to structure. It frightens you and it makes you hopeful and it does both of those simultaneously and that puts you into a state of interest. I get conflict, so which, which has really nothing to do with your, your psychological state as an individual. It basically means that no matter who you are, if you encounter something I'm known those two sets of emotions are going to be generated. And then the other thing we tried to do was to think about how the gnome itself is structured and that brought us to this idea which which is in its sort of elaborated form, which is that if you know where you're at and what you're doing, it means that you have a stable view of who you are.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       And also where you're going and and also how to get there and that's all one thing. That's one story, but you're cooperating with someone and you're doing something. Then your story shared, you've hammered out your differences and you have to find a territory that's founded basically where almost nothing unpredictable it can happen. One of the things we tried to do was to figure out how while the simple one was the, yeah, been a theory about where you want to go and the theory about where you are and you have a series of plans to get from one to the other. But we also have discussed the fact that the plans themselves are actually theories of the same sword. So that diagram presents what are basically nested stories. It's like you're a small ambitions are nested in your bigger ambitions. You take, do you come to a class to graduate from the class to graduate from the class in order to get your degree in order to pursue your career, your career as part of your duties as a citizen, so on and so forth. So the stories and to become nested in one another and this nesting also has the form of a dominance hierarchy because

Speaker 3:          00:11:56       if we're engaged in a dominance dispute, what that basically means is that we're arguing about whose stories could occupy a superordinate position. That's one way of looking at it. We might also both the arguing in order to construct the third story that we can both agree to, but that doesn't happen very often if it's sort of a brute force dominant, struggled at it. Just whoever has the most effective argument, the tools at hand, which could also involve physical force. When I was writing my story takes precedence or at least in this situation, oh, that's a dominance hierarchy and the known which is explored territory. It's also equivalent to culture is constructed of the Internet of sequences of internets. That stories that have been arranged in terms of the relative importance over spans thousands and thousands of years. And one of the things we've been trying to do is to figure out, well if you're, if you're in the same culture as someone else, that means that you share at least a certain set of stories with that person.

Speaker 3:          00:13:03       And we've been trying to figure out is one of those stories consist of and also what might be the most superordinate story. Write the story that governs all other stories, which you might think of as the king of all stories. And that's part of the reason why I told you about the mess of the table and creation myth in the Mesopotamian creation at the Martech voluntarily confronts time map who's the agent of chaos and considered thesis and it makes the world and for the Mesopotamians that was the rule of the king who came as long as the king. He acted out Marta, then the culture progress properly. And so the Mesopotamians sad, except they didn't say it, they acted it out, they act it out. The idea that the most super story should be respect for the process that generates all stories. Right, and that's, wow, that's sort of a paradox. I guess we represented that

Speaker 4:          00:14:09       this way.

Speaker 3:          00:14:15       Do you have a story when you're a child and it's basically an authoritarian story, which isn't it someone else's is God usually your parents at least if you're lucky, that doesn't work forever because it soon becomes evident not because your parents failed, but because you change that your parents aren't Gordon, that there's problems that they can solve, which is to say that there are unknown or anomalous phenomena that emerge that your parents can attribute the term meaning to. And usually what that means is that you have to adopt the, what it means is that you come to adopt the beliefs of the then initiation rituals, which usually involve, well Elliot, he says all initiation rituals involved the regression to the beginnings. In fact, Iliana was convinced that all archaic people's, whenever they attempted to create something, a new, whenever it was, they always construed the creation of something new.

Speaker 3:          00:15:14       In terms of reference to the cosmo going with myth, which is chaos gives birth to the original set of parents who in turn give birth to a divine son who in turn separates them from the archaic people. Every act of creation replaced the cause with money. Yet we know a little bit about why that is now too because it does seem that whenever you rearrange any aspects of your story at any level of analysis, you do go through a routine like that says your presumptions are wrong, which basically means that the meaning that you attribute to things is not stable and you have to readjust those and during that period of readjustment your emotions are dysregulated and the mythological way of referring to that in a sense, at least in part, you return to the state preceding the division of order and chaos. Every act of creation is

Speaker 4:          00:16:09       has the mythological structure of the construction of the world. Anyways,

Speaker 3:          00:16:16       the group tells you how to be and it provides a good answer when you're an adolescent to the problems that poses that are posed to you as a consequence of your development that you're, Karen's cannot answer. The problem is is that a group provides a determined a dancer, which is a list of rules. Essentially it says that good is such and such and that bad or evil, it's such in session, which is perfectly fine under most conditions, but it does upon location ochre that the fact of the group presents a problem or the group's notion of how to adapt to the environment is wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:16:54       That happens, for example, when if you have a group belief that's very strong and I have one that's very strong, we engage in a dispute that results in our mutual the minds and for me that indicates that there's a problem. I mean, it's a strange situation because it isn't the case that under many conditions people will risk their own extinction in order to maintain the structure of their roots. So there you can take the position that you know the best thing to do is to die for the fatherland, which basically means that even the problem as extreme as the fact that your group identification might kill you isn't sufficient problem to indicate that there's something wrong with its structure. I have some extreme authoritarian position, but we're going to take the position that the fact that group in our caused conflict is an indication that there's something wrong with the idea that the group is the final solution to all of your problems. It's a choice

Speaker 3:          00:18:02       if you can. We know that you have to have group identification in order to make sense of your emotional experience because you need a way of limiting the meaning the things offered to you to some comprehensive aligned acceptable domain. What we also know that group identification has its own set of problems, so what we need is a solution that has all of the advantages of group identification without any of the disadvantages. Positive parents are the positive alternative three to this chart as the capacity not to identify with the group but to move to a state where giving due respect to the group you identify with the process that brings it into being, which makes you the agent that it, no, which makes you determine that the process that constructs the group is actually more important than the group itself and that gives you, that gives you a way to be, which basically means a structure that regulates your emotions and also something that attributes to determine the meaning to all of them.

Speaker 4:          00:19:16       All of these experiences first and adolescence. That's identification with her. And then the second one, the identification, the group hero.

Speaker 3:          00:19:40       Okay. In the first case it's not identification with the parents, it's reliance on their word dependence. Yeah, I was on the crew. Yeah. And that would be identification with the parents are actually in the second stage because that's basically, if you think of the group as sort of an abstract, that parent, which is a perfectly reasonable way of looking at, in fact usually what your parents are when you're a child. He's not so much of your parents as those representatives of the group that you have to come into contact with. Right. That's part of the reason I think why it's often difficult because this comes up frequently with people who have the dependent type of neurotic personality, so they can't disassociate themselves from their parents because they don't know that their parents know that what they see in their parents isn't the group and not the parents. This is especially true. I think that the father, your father is more than an individual in a sense. He's also the intermediary that you first encountered who embodies all of culture and as a consequence he's a fit a finger. In a sense that's much more powerful than P is when construed simply as an individual. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       Where is the identification and we kind of stuff. If the, the goal of the journey is a dedication here, there's a particular, like you said, your event and it's on the parents, which is also a culture. Where is it? Right? It depended on the, on the cell.

Speaker 3:          00:21:13       Well, what do you mean by the cell? I think in terms of their guys in a different form of neurotic. Yeah. Oh you mean selfishness? Yeah. Oh, I see. I see what you mean.

Speaker 4:          00:21:26       We're being being filled by themself like self dependence, so,

Speaker 3:          00:21:31       oh yeah. That's why I was reading something about that just before we came down. There's a newspaper article about when the free ball moisture's new papers for my sister has been making the claim recently. The aggressive behaviors associated with inflated self esteem. Now he puts that, it's an interesting paper because he puts that in the following context. You know, in elementary schools and junior high schools across the United States, the self esteem movement has been making great inroads and the self esteem movement basically proposes that as long as you feel good about yourself, nothing else matters. And the problem with that is that it uses indiscriminate positive reinforcement, which I regard actually as a form of abuse. So it makes the world unpredictable or reward you regardless of what you do. What I'm telling you essentially is that what you do has zero meaning, right? Because it's not informative. You change your behavior, nothing happens. That means you had, that means you're powerless basically. Anyways. Yeah. I just saw an article in the globe about that they were saying come studies done where they had the head, uh, ask a group of Japanese students of American students who had both taken. Right. Right. And that's the same article taking math tests, how they felt about themselves in the Japanese and scored a considerable amount of higher and they feel so good about themselves or the American kids at that point I felt great. Yeah. Right, right, right. Exactly.

Speaker 4:          00:22:57       Yeah. Um, but that's another point that if the whole point of behaviors to regulate your emotions and you're able to regulate your emotion that way, why bother with,

Speaker 3:          00:23:11       well, because they'd only, no, that's a good, that's a perfectly good question. That that ties into some other social psychological research on self deception. You actually feeling good about yourself despite the actual environment only worked with for a very short period of time. That's the problem. It's a good short term solution. You know, if you can, if you fail an exam, you can say, well, that's okay. I'm still, all right, well that's, that's fine. Except that failing the exam might actually mean that you don't get through graduate school for example, like sooner or later these, let's say these, these, uh, these things that you're not going to pay attention to it, that you've decided not to pay attention to, are going to accumulate and, and beat you up. So that's the problem. We know neurotic solutions work. That's why people use them, right. We know that it's true. It's like the problem is they don't work in the long term. That's why, let me read you some, I still have answer answered your question. I just sort of zipped around. Um, it's a complicated question and that's why I'm sort of hitting it from different perspectives. And I know you addressed this issue before.

Speaker 3:          00:24:26       The thing that you're talking about has more to do with presuming that you're right, despite all evidence to the contrary. And that's, that's, that's worship of the self in the sense that you mean and I'm not going to talk about that anymore because the starting next week, everything that we discussed for the rest of the course is directly related to that. Look. We've given this diagram here. We've talked a little bit about the structure of chaos, the chaos that exists prior to the division of things into order in chaos. So that's represented by the drag. Okay. We've talked about the unknown and it's caused of aspect and it's negative aspect. We've talked about the known in its beneficial and secure aspect and as tyranny, but we've only talked about the individual in terms of the positive aspect, which is the process that separates the sky and the earth or that distinguishes between order and chaos. We've never talked about the negative aspect of the individual and I think that's probably why this question keeps popping up in your mind. In the census we only have five sixths of the story and there's a big hole where the other sixth should be and that's what we're going to start to talk about next week. So part of the part of the question is like, why is it, why is it that?

Speaker 3:          00:25:46       Why would you ever say, put yourself in a situation where you tell yourself a story that you know not to be true? It's a very peculiar idea because animals don't do that. I mean, chimpanzees will use a little bit of deception on other chimpanzees, but that's about as developed as deception seems to be in the animal came. I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever that animal's actually ever fooled themselves, but we do that all the time now. That's part of the path it's defined in mythology is a very dangerous one. Part of what we want to figure out is why would people be motivated to do that? It's like part of it. Part of the problem is is that you know, you're cruising along your track and a piece of information emerges and you think that piece of information is so terrible that I can't deal with it.

Speaker 3:          00:26:40       So it's just shunted aside and you're in a box, which is your story that you know to be insufficient, but you're also not sufficiently convinced of your own adaptive potential to risk stepping outside of the box. But then you're in in the little trap that gets smaller and smaller all the time. There's a story in this manuscript about a north African tribe called the mayor boats, and they do this interesting little ritual to Scorpion. I don't know if this is a true story or not. It might just be a matter that doesn't matter. You take a scarf and they put it in the sand and they draw a big circle around it. And the Scorpion, who's sort of upset about being surrounded by these larger creatures attempts to escape. And as soon as it comes up to the, the groove in the sand, it just runs around the circle and we'll cross the border. So then the mayor both takes the circle and divides it in half and the skirt and zips around inside the half, sir. And then the mirror divides the circle into quarters and the Scorpion is getting more and more frantic all the time, confined to the smaller and smaller space. Finally, they bisect the area so drastically that the Scorpion can't move and then it stings itself. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:28:03       That's a good story of what happens to you if you constantly believe that you're in a position, it's actually better than the one that you're in. I do. I'm telling you that story again because I do think it's related directly to the question that you're at, that you're asking. Yeah, yeah. Well, have you started reading paradise lost? Well, that's a story about what happens when you think that what you know is all that needs to be. No, that's right. That's, that's the adoption of the position of false on students and the consequences of that are that you ended up in a situation that's very much analogous to that of the skirting.

Speaker 2:          00:28:42       So

Speaker 3:          00:29:01       I don't know whether to, I don't really know whether to close who was in this discussion and start the new section when you finish it. Cause we haven't talked about these different forms of the normalist information yet. Well we should just go to the next section. Let's take a look into this. I guess what we'll do, I'll be

Speaker 2:          00:29:30       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:29:40       One of the things that we discussed just before the class broke was how and why is it the stories came to be constructive and it's part of the reason that we were interested in you because it's obvious that some of the stories that you tell yourself, you don't actually know. For example, if you would have read Mark Mesopotamian creation myth three years ago, my guess is that it would obstruct you as bizarre tale of not as something that had any meaning that was relevant to the present time. It's not that easy to figure out what it might mean for sort of go on to be elected as the highest of all the gods and then go out and kind of have to drag it from the purely a literal perspective. That doesn't seem to be a story that has very much meaning. Um, but it's a very old story.

Speaker 3:          00:30:34       And if you track its development historically, you can see how the idea is that we're embedded in that story conditioned all sorts of behaviors that we actually engaging in as far as this is of course open to to any about historical interpretation. But it seems to me that you can make a reasonable case that the Mesopotamian, the idea that there's something divine about the capacity of conquer the unknown and to construct things as a consequence developed into the Egyptian idea that the optimal pharaoh with someone who's similar, Paisley embodied the state and updated the state. And it's not much of a leap from that to the Judeo Christian perspective, which says that there's something eternal, immortal, and divine about each person. Now, if you accept that line of logic, then you have to also accept the idea that you can act out stories by yourself and with others in huge groups without understanding what the stories mean.

Speaker 3:          00:31:40       And the next step of logic after that is that if you don't understand what the stories mean, what form did they make? How is it that they're coded? But how is it that they exist? They're not part of the objective world so to speak. They're not something that you can talk about unless you tell stories. They're not something you know. At least you don't know them well enough to say what they mean, but nonetheless they conditioned all of your behaviors. So the question then is what form did that take? That's what this diagram was adapting.

Speaker 3:          00:32:12       Illustrate every level of analysis. The story you tell yourself is informed by a variety of sources of information ranging from the purely behavioral to the entirely abstract, which is to say how your question is how is it that I should have and the answer is well you should act and here's a list of rules that are explicit or you should act like person a acts, which means that you should imitate them, which is what you'll do naturally anyways or all act out some hypothetical sequences and you can, you can coffee them and that would be the whole drama. Or I can tell you a story and you can absorb whatever information you can from that. Use that to govern your behavior instead of the stories you tell yourself are constructed as a consequence of your encounter with information at all sorts of different levels of analysis and different stories are coded at different levels of analysis.

Speaker 3:          00:33:09       And it strikes me that the farther out you go, as I said before, the farther out you know, which is the more superordinate the story is the less explicit the story becomes, which is to say it's more coated in procedural knowledge and also the older it gets, which is I do think it's reasonable to think that as you move up the hierarchy he moved back in time. That's a good way of looking at it so that the stories that you act out at the most superordinate level of analysis are unconscious. And what does that mean? It means that everyone just act them out and could hardly even describe them or we have some stories about them and that's the best we've been able to do. And no one actually says, well this is what that story means. We just act as if the story's true and we act as if it's true because, well that's a, that's a tough question at least because it works.

Speaker 3:          00:34:07       And the funny thing is is that the same story keeps emerging in culture after culture. So it kind of leads you to the conclusion that there is actually one story that works only who knows if that's true. So anyways, we, we tried to tie that, this idea to the idea that there are different memory systems. Does that make sense? I mean did the under d the understand how it is that you can figure out how to behave without being able to come up with a description of how it is that you behave? Is that, that seems reasonably clear to everyone. I mean, we are conditioning each other's behavior all the time. That's the basic idea. It's right. Whenever we're engaged in any sort of interaction, we're modifying our own behavior and the behavior of others. And we do that to everyone we encounter and everyone does it. Everyone does it over a huge expanse of time. And as a consequence, a pattern emerges that we more or less all, etc. And when we don't accept that there's a big fight and someone wins and someone loses and whoever wins their behavior continues in the future. So we gathered patterns of behavior over time and integrate them into a statement that's more or less coherent. And what we're trying to do is to figure out what's the essence of that coherent and long lasting statement.

Speaker 5:          00:35:22       I agree with what you're saying that um, people can't come up with a conscious representation of how they act, you know, or a lot of things. But I think they do know, um, of ways of acquiring, even if they can't consciously say, well, somebody else is doing and then they want to give it those behaviors

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       themselves. They know that they should imitate other people. Absolutely. And I, that seems to me that's a very peculiar thing and it's the thing that I think provides the strongest evidence for the existence of something like humans archetype. Because one of the things you could say is, well, why do you admire someone? Well you might say it's because they can get something that you want. Well that's a pretty mechanistic explanation and you don't really have to pause at any underlying predisposition. It's just that you have to want something and you have to be able to observe that someone else gets it. And maybe that's sufficient. But it strikes me that the capacity do admire someone is more deeply rooted than that. And it's not purely driven by observations that someone else gets what you want more effectively. And it seems to me that that's actually one of the things that bootstrap to children's development can.

Speaker 3:          00:36:28       I can remember when I was very young, well not all that, you know, you'll get some great one. How much I admired the boy across the street who was in grade three and for me that was a huge gap at that time. And he was someone I want it to be like. And I don't really think it was perhaps it was at least in part because he could do things I couldn't, but it seemed to be something that was more global than that. It wasn't, it wasn't built up. I think from repeated observations that uh, you know, he could ride a bike faster than me or, but you know, maybe that's maybe, maybe that was, do you think it's just that same sort of idea but didn't buy it in a more general way? Like he knows what to do. I mean there's just, yeah, I'm comfortable in doing that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:07       Well true enough, true enough. But like that you sense that his story is better than you are. Okay, fine. Fair enough. But it is also the case that children start to imitate at such an early age that it's hard to believe that the reason they're doing it is because they drawn an inference. You know what I mean? Because like kids, kids, there is some evidence that newborns can imitate. You may want to take facial gestures. It's debatable, but it doesn't take very long after that to find, it isn't much after birth that children do imitate. And you can say that's because they are driven by these sorts of mechanistic inferences. But it looks to me like it's something more, more profound. I want to just tell you one other piece of evidence that's something equivalent to this. People will have to Rett Syndrome, types of disinhibition, disinhibition of procedural memory habits is what it looks like.

Speaker 3:          00:38:06       Uh, if you feed them little bits of antipsychotic medication alone, often damp and out there motor ticks, but they're called techs and the people take them a ticket, something like that. You know that ticks can be very complex. Like people who are, have tourette's syndrome can do very complex things. I saw a film once of a sculptor who had two rats and he was a realistic sculpture and he was very, very good at it. He had two nets unbelievably badly and his motor behaviors completely dysregulated and basically he'd sit down and kind of motor tic would get them and so he'd get up and walk over and then he could sort of control it. So we adjust the stereo and that was it. Like it was all involuntary behavior until they go up near the Stereo and then you can control it enough to to just add his twist to the behavior and then he'd come back and sit down and he was like bouncing up and down like this all the time and that's how we do with sculpture.

Speaker 3:          00:38:53       Like you'd be sitting and he'd have a tick and he'd get up and he move and then has gone from being over there. He pick up his knife and make it two rats. The reason I'm telling you this story is because people with Tourette's syndrome are very, very, very imitative. Like there's a story actually where I used to live in northern Alberta a little bit farther north. There's a group of how to rights. I think they were a hunter rights. They might've been mennonites. Anyways, the problem with these isolated religious populations as they tend to get someone in bread, and one of the consequences of this in this northern colony was very high rates of Tourette Syndrome.

Speaker 6:          00:39:30       One of the, one of the stories I remember about that was all of these,

Speaker 3:          00:39:34       I think you were mennonites sitting in a church together. A bird flew into the church and they all flat, large proportion of population involuntary flap their hands because they were imitating the bird and two rights. One of the things the two reds also does to people is give them an uncanny ability to mimic and caricatures or other people by copying their motor habits. Yeah. Anyways, the reason I'm telling you this is because it looks like the capacity to mimic is something that's underneath the capacity to form abstract representations. It's more, it's more primordial. Oh, so this is, this is just to say that it's biological. It's hard wiring. That's right. That's what I'm saying now. That's why I was talking about the why. I think there's some support for the union notion of an architect with regards to the mutation is you can come up with a good explanation for why people imitated by saying, I see that what you do is more efficient than what I do, and I think that does drive invitation to some degree, but there's also another level of invitation and it's, it's more

Speaker 6:          00:40:36       how do you, how do you select what? What's the, what's the selection process? Why the boy that you focused on?

Speaker 3:          00:40:42       Well, that's a good, that's a good question. I mean, yeah, I guess I don't know what level of analysis you're asking that question. Do you mean in general, why do people do it?

Speaker 6:          00:40:52       You're the way you're describing mutation without the inferential part. I mean, it's not as a result then what's the process?

Speaker 3:          00:41:00       That's a good, now that's it. That's a very good question. I guess I would,

Speaker 6:          00:41:07       hm.

Speaker 3:          00:41:10       I don't know the answer to that. I guess I would. I would surmise, did I ever show you that picture, that eastern picture of the recurrent artists sat? Fuck you remember that? Yeah. The image of basically the image of the savior that's constantly recurring throughout time. I think that, I think that the notion that we have an innate sense of what's appropriate globally is true. So I would say that, but it's, it's, it's, it's like with gray leg geese I guess is a great like goose will attach itself to something. So it has the capacity to develop an exceptional attachment, but it also has to see something in its environment for that capacity to manifest itself. Right? That same printing, and I suspect that's what our general proclivity is like. It's like say it's analogous to the notion of the possibility for developing condition fears more easily to some phenomenal than others.

Speaker 3:          00:42:09       So like if I want to make you afraid of something, say I take you into the lab and I show you some pictures of an electric outlet and I give you an electric shock. Every time you see one or I show you a picture of a snake and I give you an electric shock, every time you see it, you'll develop conditioned fear to the picture of the snake faster than to the picture of the electric outlet. So it's not exactly as if you're innately afraid of the snake is just that in the presence of a snake you're, it's easier for you to develop fear and my guess is, but we kind of have the same or similar sort of mechanism operating with regards to heroic behavior. It's it's, we have the capacity this to no one when we see it and it's at the level of a global pattern recognition. So that's a speculation

Speaker 4:          00:43:00       isn't everything that we know how to do. Irritation or their child learns how to speak by imitating.

Speaker 3:          00:43:07       Well that's a good, that's another good example of the same sort of things the child does not exactly learn to speak by imitating. Child has to have the capacity to speak. It's like if you take a chimpanzee, no matter what you do, the chimpanzee, it's not going to learn to be a concert pianist. It's because the chimpanzee doesn't have the capacity to imitate that sort of behavior. It's also the case that no matter what you do with chimpanzee, let's start going to learn to talk because the chimpanzee doesn't have the capacity to imitate speech. Now, some people say that's because of the structure of this, the morphology of its speech unit, but they're not very good at manipulating symbols either. You know, they can get a little ways, but not very far. A child will pick up language very, very rapidly.

Speaker 3:          00:43:52       What's that never hears? Well then no, and there also seems to be a certain critical period, like if a child isn't exposed to language within a certain span of time, say at least by the age of 13 and there's not gonna be any language development. It's not, and it's not just imitation. You see, because the grammatical children make standard types of grammatical errors that they didn't hear their parents make. So it isn't straight invitation. That's what skinner thought. Part of the way it's not true because children don't hear what Bait, the grammatical errors that children make. Parents don't make.

Speaker 4:          00:44:33       So they know. They act as if they learned moles. Yeah. Right. But that's different, right? It's different. Yeah. That language is, the language is not invitation. Like I have a problem with them is very much a and hardwired right. Capacity Children's say words or coach, they have syntax ability that they've never heard from them. Right. They can put him down and work together and create sentences that spontaneously they know that they've never heard before in your life. Therefore I don't think it's really comparable, you know, just that. Um, I think that both language and the myths that we understand that we about layout or don't understand fully tap into the unconscious because you know, like these men, we understand them have symbols just like the snake now and that tax more into our unconscious. Then you know, the electric,

Speaker 3:          00:45:32       I think it's reasonable. Noam Chomsky, whose name you're undoubtedly familiar with is very famous nyt. He's positive, the existence of a language acquisition device, which is not really all that informative at the top concept because it doesn't really say what it is, but he says, well, you need the capacity to develop language as well as exposure to the appropriate environmental stimuli nights. I would, I really do thing. But something similar operates at the mythological level. It's like we're hardwired to appreciate the structure of a narrative we now otherwise you don't see, I mean, how else do you explain the capacity of children to be interested in stories? It's not like you teach them that it's the, if they weren't bloody well interested in stories, you couldn't teach them anything. It's like that's the precondition what you can grab that and then use it to final information into them.

Speaker 3:          00:46:24       But you don't teach that it's their first. And I think that's, um, well I think that's a form of grammar and really what we're looking at in, in large part because the grammar of mythologies. So like your recognition of your Roy boy was like a pattern. I mean, it's not like a process of inference from just discrete behaviors right. Boy does this and I know. Yeah, right. I mean that may contribute to it, but it's around it's recognition of a pattern of behavior. That's right. He matches. That's exactly right cause he matches a pattern that's late in the ideas or could it be a pattern you learn as a child with your parents? Well it could be. I mean, yeah you can't. You can make a plausible case for the mechanistic, for the mechanistic acquisition of some of this sort of thing except for the fact that imitative behavior seems in some ways pre abstract and also that I don't think children learn to be interested in stories.

Speaker 3:          00:47:28       I really don't. I think they have that first. Do you have anything useful comes to us in the form of a story or a pattern of some sorts and it makes sense evolutionarily that there's going to be huge selective pressure to be interested in patterns and stories. Well, if that's how they, that's how you learned to behave. I mean, yes, it isn't the case that, well, here's an example. This is a good example. I went into Montreal last week and talk, I'm working on an experimental project. They're dealing with children who fight in school. So we have a population of kids that were tracked from kindergarten right till they graduated basically. And in six of the first 10 years of their schooling they were rated by teachers for fighting. So we can identify kids who are stable fighters over the long term travel. It's interesting about these kids, you know, you hear the standard routine about antisocial personalities.

Speaker 3:          00:48:20       They don't feel any anxiety, for example. But these kids are extraordinarily anxious and I just had an honors student write me a thesis about men who abused their wives enough to be brought to the attention of courts and convicted. Um, they tend to be criminal as you'd suspect, have lower Iqs, but they're very, very, very anxious and depressed, which again doesn't fit very well with the classic picture that he, social personality, it looks more like an antisocial personality, feels anxious, but can't use that anxiety to regulate their behavior. Those two phenomena being separable, just to say you could be very, very anxious, but unless you know what to do with the information, that's not very useful and there's a lot of reasons for believing. That's true. Um, anyways, I still want to stay focused on your question. Okay. So you have these kids. I've tried to figure out what are these kids like?

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       Well, they're aggressive because they fight and teachers rate them is fighting. That's the one thing we really know about them, but they're very anxious and they're very depressed. I think the gentleman I'm working with there has been studying antisocial behavior in children for a long time. Uh, he's, I've told you before, the children's aggressive behavior peaks at two and then goes down hill. From there. You're more aggressive at two, then you are at any other time in your life. It gets socialized somewhere around between two and three. You learn these behavioral patterns. What happens if you don't learn? That's the question. That's what's relevant to your topic. Well, trump Nye said he's the character who rented this study said, you know, when you're an adult and you don't fit into your peer group, like you really don't fit in, you get put in prison said these kids in kindergarten, they're already in prison.

Speaker 3:          00:50:03       There's just no walls around them. But just to say that because they haven't learned the proper behavioral rituals, they're ostracized by their peer groups so they don't fit into the standard hierarchy outside that hierarchy. They build their own hierarchy and it's based on force, the toughest kid. So all the kids who get thrown out cluster and the toughest kid wins. And that's the genesis. I'm going only the anti social personality, but that whole anti social lifestyle, it's the same in prisons. The dominant tire can prison is the meanest son of a bitch rules. Well, that's because outside of the proper dominance hierarchy, the property development, it's hard to be normal socialized behavior. That's the default strategy for the erection of dominance. Higher at the most mackerel, uh, moral system. That's what needs are as well. It's the most, it's the most natural. If you're, if you're very impaired, that's the sort of freeze the motion.

Speaker 3:          00:51:01       That's right. It's, it's the most primitive then, I mean, in a sense it's, well, it's what you'll come to if you're not given anything else. Right, right. That's right. It's what you'll come to if you're not given anything else. That's a good way of putting it. So when you say, well, it's very important to pick up on the appropriate sorts of behaviors as well. Just an a story about why it's so important. And if you don't learn to be properly prosocial, like these kids, they don't, if someone else has heard, they won't go over to comfort them. They don't know how to, even if you're highly aggressive and you find a load and you're quite anxious and depressed, if you're helpful and you know how to share, that's enough to get you into the group. It's, it's, if you're lacking even the most rudimentary forms of, of nonaggressive social behavior, then you were an outcast.

Speaker 3:          00:51:46       And that's the consequence of not picking up these initial for whatever reason. So yeah, the consequences are very severe. So these kids, by the way, I think they're the ones that are indiscriminate, reinforced because that's how you ruined a child. It's like you make sure that the rewards and punishments they received are completely uncorrelated with their behavior because that makes them powerless completely and makes the world very frustrating place. I remember I had a friend in adolescence, he drove a white truck and that truck was dented on. Every quarter panel was a pickup truck including insight quarter panels where various parts of people's bodies had come into contact with, with the dash or the roof or whatever before he was 16 he racked four or five vehicles. The most dramatic example of which was one day I went and a job and on the main street of our small town in the middle of winter, I looked up the street about three blocks in. There was a small convenience store there with a truck parked halfway inside of it covered with the tarp and it was a white truck and I thought that's very likely my friend. Anyways, he was indiscriminately reinforced because every time he wrecked the truck, he just gotten underway. You know what ever said stop.

Speaker 3:          00:53:10       Anyways. Okay, so back now, were there other, are there other questions? Okay, let's have a question. Yeah. Okay. So it's the difference between someone like, I don't know much about would happen, maybe Jesus

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       or something. Cool. Could you say that a lot of the behaviors that they learned came from their parents and then they added to that in their, in their lifetime. So is the difference between that and a and a and a child who doesn't, who's antisocial, whatever it is that they are there, they are not given the opportunity to learn, um, those adaptive behaviors or social behaviors, whatever the cause of the peer group ostracized.

Speaker 3:          00:53:51       Yeah. Well, I guess, I guess if you, if you thought about it in this terms,

Speaker 3:          00:53:59       well those kids are even followed up at this point. It's hard to say. It's hard to say because they don't ever have anyone reliably that they can depend on. Even in Charlotte. So like this success here is a precondition for success here. It's right. These kids are identifiable at kindergarten. It's like they didn't even get to the point where they're acceptable to a peer group, so the question is what happens to you if you don't even make it here? I guess what happens is that you're thrown out into chaos where you organize yourself according to the principal we just discussed, which is what can you do when you can't do anything else? The answer being hurt, right? It doesn't really, and that that, of course it's pretty much just dependent on your on how mean you are and your size I guess.

Speaker 2:          00:54:50       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:54:57       Okay. I'm going to read you something from tolstoy in this will help us discuss the different sorts of different manners in which and the homeless inflammation can present itself. This is in toasters convention confessions. I remember that when I was 11 years old at high school boy named Devola Dinka now long since dead, visited us one Sunday with an announcement of the latest discovery made at school. If discovery was that there is no god and the things they were teaching us, we're nothing but fairy tales. This was in 1838 I remember how this news captured the interest of my older brothers even let me in on their discussions. I remember that we were all very excited that we took this news to be both engaging in entirely possible,

Speaker 2:          00:55:47       okay

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       tolstoy's confession or basically a description of the consequences of having been exposed to that piece of information on his entire life and it is the case or it was the case for him that at least by his own interpretation, the dramatic consequences of that discovery didn't manifest themselves fully in his consciousness until he was middle aged and well, well established. As a successful author say, well, he hit a piece of, he hit a piece of anomalous information while he was pursuing some relatively trivial task and was unable to determine the proper magnitude of that anomalous information for perhaps 40 years. It kept moving up the hierarchy of stories destroying them as it went

Speaker 3:          00:56:39       because his, as Nietzsche pointed out, Judeo Christian morality which characterized the behavior of the Russians in 1838 is predicated on the idea that there is a god. If that's the most fundamental presupposition, and if you blow that presupposition, then you blow the morality. Now, you may not know that it's gone, but the fact just the fact that you don't know that it's gone doesn't necessarily mean that it will. It'll disappear whether you know it's gone or not. Neat. You said at one point that if you kill the roots of a tree, eventually the branches will die. You might take a long period of time. Anyways, tolstoy said since ancient times when the life of which I do know something began people who knew the arguments concerning the vanity of life, the arguments that reveal to me its meaninglessness live nonetheless bringing to life a meaning of their own.

Speaker 3:          00:57:42       Since the time when people somehow began to live, this meaning of life is being with them and they have led this life up to my own time. Everything that is in me and around me is the fruit of their knowledge of life. The very tools of thought by which I judge life and condemn it were created not by me, but by them. I was born educated and have grown up thanks to them. They dug the iron, taught us how to cut the timber, tamed the cattle and the horses showed us how to sow crops and live together. They brought order to our lives as the mythological ancestors. They taught me how to think and how to speak. I had their offspring nurse by them reared by the talk, by them I think according to their thoughts, their words and their, I have proved to them that it is all meaningless. I mean have them with me as it happens with everyone who contracts that fatal internal disease. At first there were the insignificant symptoms of an ailment which the patient ignores.

Speaker 3:          00:58:43       Then these symptoms recur more and more frequently until they merge into one continuous duration of suffering. The suffering increases and before he can turn around the patient discovers what he already knew. The thing he had taken for a mere in disposition is in fact the most important thing on earth to him is in fact, and that's the story of the information moving up. Thy are historics I think. I guess this is conference there. You could draw an analogy to, to discovering that you have a fatal illness. I mean, let's say you wake up one morning and he says, and he makes them, he uses the metaphor, you have a stitch in your side, anything. Well that's going to make it much more difficult to get to work. So you construe the anomalous event with regards to to a particular story. You say, well, this, this thing which I am now in calibrating has the status of a minor inconvenience, right?

Speaker 3:          00:59:42       When you say it's only going to interfere with a story that's nested way down, but it doesn't go away and perhaps it gets worse and you start to wonder, well, perhaps it's more serious than I thought, which means there's more to this bit of enormous information that first met the eye. It sort enough the next day so that you have to stay in bed. So then you start thinking, well, what's the proper level of analysis to consider this anomalous information with respect to, and you don't know, well they need to go to the doctor and the doctor says, well you need some more tests. While this information is starting to think of it, this is the best way to think of it. It's only metaphor that it's only metaphor. Wherever something anomalous occurs, there's a hole in the way that you look at the world. And that whole can widen or narrow depending on your interpretation and what you see through the whole is the unknown. And your job in a sense is to keep all the holes covered. Now here's something the unknown is peaking its head through and you don't know how big the thing that's keeping his head through is it's just the tail of a dragon or just the nose of a drag as about whether you're trying to do is to figure it out. So I guess interject came out maybe because the way and find out what someone's dominance hierarchy is. Go ahead. How do you mean? Well,

Speaker 5:          01:00:57       use the example of a good example of an athlete. Um, let's say that you get the stitch and you get some stitching your side at first you think to yourself, well, you know this, this make it difficult for me to get through my day and you keep going and um, it gets worse and worse and you see what level of analysis they take it to next, do they next day, well I need to, this will because this will interfere with my schoolwork. Do I need to, um, my off my sports? Or is it the other way around that,

Speaker 3:          01:01:28       that me with the status of the various nested goals and stuff, right? Are you going to see that by forcing someone into the novel or, I see what you're saying. So if I put a limitation on your behavior or if one emerges, you're going to determine what's worth tossing and that'll give you what's worth throwing away. Basically. If you can only do 90% of the things that you're doing right now, what falls into the category of the 10% that can be eliminated? Sort of, I think more along the lines of what are the order in which you would consider. Yes, yes. Fair enough. Fair enough. So yeah. Well that's, yeah. Well I think that's perhaps part of the reason why, uh, you know, people who have recovered from a very serious illness or sometimes people who aren't even going to be covers say, well, at least this has taught me what was important. So that's, that's a perfectly reasonable observation. So anyways, you go to the doctor and what your attempt is, when you ask the doctor what is going on, what you're basically saying is like, what subsection of my nested stories is this event going to destroy? Right. That's what you want to determine. I read this is quite interesting. You see and that's a terrible situation to be. And so you're at the doctor and you were faced with something that's unknown so that then you're very anxious, high red,

Speaker 3:          01:02:48       all the educational attempts so far to convince homosexual men to use condoms have resulted in failure globally. Um, when AIDS first manifested itself, there was a decrease in the kind of behavior that spreads aged and an increase in use of condoms for, for a substantial period of time. But you know, the days is sort of running the mail, so to speak. The behaviors have basically returned to baseline level. And there is some studies that demonstrate that men who engage in extremely high risk sexual behavior are more anxious and depressed before they are diagnosed with aids. And then after. And the reason for that I think is that any possibility has been, that's right. That's right. Any defined actuality is better than the know. And that's, that's a good story for illustrating how that's the case. Like it's better to know than not to know. No matter what it is that you know there's definitely the breath is worst than yes.

Speaker 3:          01:03:48       That's what it means. That's what it means. That's why. That's why in psychotherapy people will always will continue to do things that they know will hurt them rather than risk change cause threat. That's right. That's what people do like hope it's better than reward and punishment is better than threat. Right, so our primary reinforcers are less salient then our secondary reinforcers. It is peculiar. It is peculiar, but I think that is the case because it is drugs that for a while it is drugs that activate are the systems that mediate hope that we find most enthralling and it is the key. I do believe that like the devil you know is the better one. You don't that it's the oldest though that that's one of the reasons why this sort of theoretical approach is so useful is because it gives you insight into why people won't change, but why won't they change? Well, in order to change, you have to stop believing in it. Stopped doing what you're doing. Well, what does that mean? Well, it means for an intermediary period of time, all things are novel and all normal things produce anxiety. And if you're terrified of anxiety and you don't believe that you can cope with it,

Speaker 4:          01:05:01       you can't do it.

Speaker 3:          01:05:03       So what are the jobs you have as a psychotherapist is not to minimize the anxiety that you're a patient feels, but to endeavor to demonstrate to them that they can tolerate more of it than they think. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       that's catalog. That's your attempt to capitalize identification with the hero. It's just the fact of anxiety isn't so bad. It's the fact that you think that you can deal with it. That's what's so bad. Cause you're never going to convince anybody that the world is not a threatening place. So okay. Anyway. So one of the things that you're doing when you engage in exploratory behavior is trying to figure out at what level of analysis that particular normals piece of information actually where it's actually most appropriately conceived them, which is to say what does it mean that you're trying to fit it into a framework? While it store basically says that his, this piece of information that he accidentally encountered at school, which is pretty much inevitable. No, the Russians in 1838 we're still pretty backwards society compared to the rest of Europe in Europe had gone through.

Speaker 3:          01:06:10       It's, it's great contact with the idea that God was dead as early as, as the, as the times when Galileo came into conflict with, with the Catholic church, I mean this would be going on in Europe for a long time, for 400 years before the news washed in from western Europe over Russia. Russia was a feudal society that was tottering on very on, on shaky legs, just read, just waiting in a sense for something to push it over. The news from western Europe pushed it over. It took to a story 30 years to figure out or for the information to have its full impact on total store and I would say that I think it's reasonable to say that what that information did to Tolstoy, he did to the whole culture 50 years later. That's why I want you to read those Dsq is the devils, because Dostoevsky's writing about a Russia that had held on to feudalism 200 300 years longer than it actually should have the last year, a peon country to undergo a modern revolution. When we know the consequences of the revolution, it's Orthodox. Christianity was pushed over, left a huge void in the Russian psyche that was filled by Marxism. Anyways, tolstoy was a genius and one of the consequences of being a genius is that those things that eventually happened to everyone have to you first.

Speaker 2:          01:07:32       So

Speaker 3:          01:07:37       that's, that's an interesting thing. You know, it seems to me that we did, we do. This is, this is a strange, strange thing to think. I guess we tend to think that the future happens everywhere at the same time. It's like we all come into contact with the future at the same time, but that's not really true. You know, the people that we think of as geniuses, our people in whom the future happens first and then usually isolates them. That's why they look like profits. I said, I think in a sense it's almost as if the future pours through them first, then out into the culture.

Speaker 2:          01:08:12       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       I mean it depends on what, it depends on what you think of thinking. If you think I'm thinking of something you do, then that whole line of argument is nonsensical. But if you think of thoughts as something you encounter,

Speaker 2:          01:08:29       okay,

Speaker 3:          01:08:30       then it starts to make it a little bit more sense.

Speaker 2:          01:08:36       Anyways,

Speaker 3:          01:08:37       the thing that had taken for a myriad disposition is in fact the most important is in fact, this is exactly what happened to me. I realized that this was northern, it's definitely element, but something very serious ended. If the same question should continue to recur, I would have to answer them and I tried to answer the questions seem to be such foolish, simple, childish westerns. But as soon as I laid my hands on and try and resolve them, I was immediately convinced, first of all, but they were not childish and foolish, but the most vital and profound questions in life. And so I couldn't believe that no matter how much I bought them, there was no way I could resolve. So tolstoy had not only thought here he was the paradigmatic example of having gone there. Right? He was as successful as you could possibly be within the confines of a group and even perhaps have made some movements towards the next stage of development, given that he was undoubtedly a very creative individual. So he says it, he says himself,

Speaker 3:          01:09:44       I should have been considered a completely happy man. This was when I was not yet 50 years old. I had a good loving and beloved wife find children and largest state that was growing and expanding without any effort on my card or the never before. I was respected by friends and acquaintances, praised by strangers and could claim a certain renown without really diluting myself were over. I was not physically and mentally unhealthy on the contrary, and I enjoyed the physical and mental vigor such as I have rarely encountered among others my age physically I could keep up with the peasants working in the fields. Mentally I could work eight and 10 hours at a stretch that's suffering any after effects from the strain. And in such a state of affairs, I came to a point where I could not live. And even though I fear death, I had to employ ruses against myself to keep from committing suicide.

Speaker 3:          01:10:31       Perfect example of an entirely well adaptive matt, he encountered with a piece of anomalous information that blew his ability to believe in all of the determinant meanings that his group identification have provided for him. And as a consequence, he descended in voluntarily into chaos and just about died as a consequence. He said, and details this to some degree in his confessions made tolstoy literally was suicidal for a long period of time. So it was three, one of the tragic consequences of abstraction. I mean, this is, it's coming from the top down there and there's no right. You should be unhappy from a practical point of view. Right. Well that's, that's one of the things that I wanted to sort of deal with today is, I mean, this story, this story, is this,

Speaker 7:          01:11:22       right?

Speaker 3:          01:11:24       I mean, what toss do I encountered was a stranger idea. I'm the problem with an idea. This is why the pen is mightier than the sword. The problem with an idea is that once it's up here, you can just say it like you can make your point in, in a paragraph or two. Say if the point is uh, it's absurd to believe in religious presuppositions and you buttress that with page of or to have documentation of the reasons why it's absolutely obvious that it's absurd. Then you're, you're providing information who's ease of communication belies its danger and also obscures how difficult it was for the information to have being generated. That's the thing about abstraction is that for me to make a statement like that mapped over a long span of time that any number of people may have had to die in order to make that information in order to generate that information.

Speaker 3:          01:12:29       And I think that's part of the reason why we're so constantly interested in the story of Galileo. He was someone who produced a piece of anomalous information and was branded the heretic by the Catholic Church. And he was like, here's a person who opened the doorway for the, for the scientific overthrew religious ideas. But the fact that we can commonly discuss issues like that now is a consequence of the fact that centuries of battles about ideas like this, if taking me, have taken place in the past, sometimes purely intellectually, sometimes as the consequence of actual wars all compacted up into a few abstracted phrases that can easily be delivered, also delivered across cultures. And that's so will you can see the actions of strangers can become abstracted up into words and then transmitted well, that's the thing that's so funny is that once it's abstract, you can be a very ineffectual personality and nonetheless have the capability to have a huge impact on things because you can serve as the carrier of information that you could not possibly have generated yourself. And that's part of the reason why our technological power makes us so increasingly dangerous. I think because we have access to all the power that people have developed in the past, regardless of whether or not we have the kind of personalities that are capable of using that power wisely. So there's politics in a nutshell, right? Not just politics though. It's the case with every field of endeavor.

Speaker 3:          01:14:13       It doesn't matter where you look, it's the case. And as, as we develop our technological power more and more, that's increasingly the case. That's why someone like, I don't remember his name, a character in the, in Southeast Asia who brought down Barings Bank. That's a good example of the power of abstraction. That's right. He's playing with nothing and devastated the whole community because he's just playing with abstractions and they were just numbers. They're bits even.

Speaker 6:          01:14:42       But because things hadn't been abstracted upsell so tremendously, his casual movements had huge impact. What makes it an homeless idea of threatened and not just a ridiculous, I mean why go go? It was so positions would threatened. Why were they perceived of as, I mean not as substitute. That'll be the speculations are just theory. It was considered.

Speaker 3:          01:15:05       That's good. That's a really good question. I suspect. Look, that's a really good question because it also ties in with other peculiarities. Like you pointed out for example that well and everyone knows this to be the case. You know sometimes you're a prophet crying in the wilderness, which basically means that you have a message that no one listened to and the reason for that is, well it might be because you're, you know, you're, you're fundamentally deranged and what you have to say has no relevance, but it also may be that you're so far ahead of your time so to speak, that no one that you talked to can understand what you're saying, which is very much related to the question that you're asking. I guess I would say that there must be an op then this, this, this ties into the last chapter that we'll discuss, which has to do the ability to use your interest as a motive regulating your progress. The gods ski said there's a zone of proximal development. This is a complicated thing to try and understand and I really haven't gotten it completely straightened out. All of this diagram helps a bit.

Speaker 3:          01:16:15       You're saying if you're faced with an anomalous piece of information, what makes it meaningful instead of incomprehensible? And it must be that there must be, like if the idea is here, maybe it's pretty easy to move it to here, but maybe it's pretty difficult to move it to here if it's here. So I would say like the reason that the reason that the Russians, tolstoy for example, was so overwhelmed by the idea from Europe is because at other levels of analysis, they already knew the idea. So it was like dropping us a seed crystal into a supersaturated solution. It was the ground was already prepared. And I also think that's why people sometimes experience things as revelations is they already know. You already know. Sorry, I tell you a piece of information. This is very much relevant to mythological teaching because again, what we're discussing in this class, everyone knows at least up to about here already. So when you say move it to here, well I can always make reference to what you already know here

Speaker 6:          01:17:25       also. That's

Speaker 3:          01:17:30       so I, I sit with my children and I watched bugs bunny cartoons or any movie for that matter. They're the oldest one is four and I see by watching my daughter how much of what's portrayed in the movie is opaque information and that's because she doesn't understand any of the references. Like yesterday we were watching Casper, she doesn't know. What it goes to is now you can really explain to anyone when it goes to is, you know, because while you think about it, that's complicated. I mean it's really complicated. You have to, there are a lot of presuppositions involved in understanding what it goes. Yes. For her that's just opaque information. It's cause she doesn't share like the movie, all the movie presumes a certain shared frame of reference. Right. A shared background knowledge

Speaker 6:          01:18:19       and that's that. That's is it. Is it related to the way of knowing and not just the idea? I mean the church had a way of knowing God all day or in a different way of knowing. Right. It wasn't just the idea that was new. It was a way of knowing.

Speaker 3:          01:18:40       Yes. But that was certainly true in his case. That's right. Well that's because the, the church I think was most concerned, although it didn't know that explicit and being with the knowing as knowing how to behave. Whereas Galileo was on the track of knowing as knowing facts and well we know what the consequences of that of being, we haven't been able to distinguish them very well. But you know, if you, I noticed wandering through various art museums in Europe, I mean I don't understand many of the renaissance paintings. They don't mean to me, they don't even look to me like they look to the people who painted them because I don't know the mythological reference. Even the Christian ones for that matter, a lot of the paintings lost on me and that's because if we share a community that means our unconscious presuppositions are identical and so we can communicate at a level where having those shared presuppositions as implicitly accepted, we can toss information back and forth that like at the level of abstraction where we don't yet agree.

Speaker 3:          01:19:44       I guess that must be the story. Well, if you and I are talking, there's a whole bunch of things we're not talking about that we already agree about and so we don't have to talk about them. What we talk about are those things that add a level of analysis where there's still some dispute. And I guess that as things become increasingly beyond dispute, they all go also get encoded farther back down the hierarchy. So in this class for example, we're not at each other's throats, amber, because, and we don't ever argue about the propriety of that. It's, it's so much accepted that it's not even an issue. There's no aggressive behavior.

Speaker 3:          01:20:27       It seems to me that part of this year of, uh, of anomaly must come from a recognition or an unconscious recognition perhaps of human nature, which is that, uh, exploration is intrinsically rewarding. I mean, would you agree that that is true? It seems that exploration for explorations sake seems to be something that motivates people. I mean, and I noticed one of the things that Tulsa, I said was that Venus and his brothers, they brought the strain chai idea of home from school. One of the first things he says is that we were more than, we're more than happy to entertain this idea. Right. Why? But simply because it's, it's new. Anything that's new is interesting. Right? Right.

Speaker 3:          01:21:12       Yeah. Well, they were definitely interested in the information. Partly I think because it told them something they already suspected. So to some, you know, it was a receptivity. Right? Right. The ground was busy that it's almost as if it was an unarticulated experience. Right? Absolutely. It provides a way of articulating and that's the crystal hits the water. Right? But it doesn't put the experience there. It articulates great. Great. As long. Okay. There's, there's, and you'll see this later in the manuscript too, um, when Moses gets the rules, the 10 commandments from God, he's on the top of a mountain, which is a standard place of enlightenment when he comes to, or illumination, when he comes down the mountain, his face is glowing so brightly that no one can look at it. Now what Moses did like he's, let's assume for the present time that if he is not a mythological figure, he's at least a myth of sized historical figure.

Speaker 3:          01:22:14       I mean the notion of the law giver is fairly prevalent in archaic communities. I mean the same role is played by Hammer Hammer, Rab die, for example, someone who codifies the law. While the notion there is again, like what Moses did basically could be construed as having observed how everyone behaved in essence anyways, he codafide it, right? So he took information that existed at the level of creative behavior, imitation, play, ritual, drought, a myth, religion and maybe even literature. And he said, well look, this is what we're doing. I can, and the consequences that that appeared as a revelation. And I think part of the reason I'd be, I'd be trying to figure, because you do this in therapy too. You say to someone, look here, here's a pattern of behavior. First of all, that in itself could be revelation. You say the person says, you know, I've noticed myself doing that.

Speaker 3:          01:23:08       They're quite interested in that piece of information. I think the asset that's generated as a consequence of encountering that sort of information is partly due to apprehension of all the possibilities that are then revealed. Like the more as you move information up the hierarchy of abstraction, the information becomes more and more powerful, which basically means that you can do more with it with less work, right? That's why money is more powerful than barter. It's more abstract. So that, so it's more flexible and I think when you move information up a level of abstraction, it produces a release of an effect because you get an intimation of the possibilities that are released as a consequence of the increase in abstraction. I also think it's the case that if I can tell you, well look, your story is such and such, but you act this way and this is your theory.

Speaker 3:          01:24:03       Well then you have the possibility of moving those three levels of analysis into an isomorphic arrangement so that your north three people anymore, one who act some way, what do you have? A badge is another way. And one of the plans, a third way. You're one person who all of whose efforts are devoted towards attaining, we'll say, man, I also think that that's, well, that's, that's the, the utility of the integration. And I think when one of the things that we admire in people naturally, I think is the consequence of the unification of the operation of those three systems, which is to say, who do you admire? Well, someone who doesn't say anything more than is necessary, so to speak, and who acts out what they tell you.

Speaker 5:          01:24:53       Um, I was about to say that I think at times you're talking about positive ethic and I think that how's it of apic works in this direction if you're talking about procedural as the outside and that attraction towards the middle, Andy, because I think that, um, I think when you present, once you have a level of abstraction, the best way to present to somebody else is not by, by telling them, but about presenting it in as procedural. They need as big a, a circle as possible, which is probably is, which is probably more difficult to do. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:25:26       well this sort of the okay information that's behavioral anyways. Yeah, well that's Freud thought that merely becoming conscious of something was sufficient to bring about a cure or at least at the early stages of his career, but by the end he realized that unless it had to be transformed from pure conscious awareness back down to the level of behavior did it, you didn't know it. Knowing it means that it's embodied. I think that's the point that you're making. What Tulsa was doing is that he was moving from abstraction maybe into procedural and that produce negative effect. Yeah, but it wouldn't be. Yeah, and this I would say, I would say that your interpretation is accurate but that it wouldn't necessarily have to produce negative effect. The problem is is the tolstoy encounter that information and voluntarily was sort of accidental in a sense. He was walking along as it's a hell of a piece of information for a 12 year old school boy.

Speaker 3:          01:26:20       You know, it's like it's a piece of information that you can say in one sentence, go on his dad. That took like literally thousands of years of concentrated effort and any number of wars to produce and then you can hand it to someone on a plate. This is also part of the reason why are this this, this is kind of a leap, but it makes it, it's exactly the same sort of thing. It's why a lot of foreign aid projects don't work is because there's a lot more information embedded in the things that we distributed. Then we think that there's a good example, um, in the, in the South Pacific islands, the introduction of steel axis to the stone age population devastated their whole culture. And part of it was missionary work. But the thing is these colleges had progressed to the point where if you are at the top of the dominance hierarchy, you had access to a stone ax and we think about a stone ax, you know, who cares basically.

Speaker 3:          01:27:14       But when there aren't that many of them, and when that's the thing that's the hot, the most technologically advanced product you have still an ax is a symbol of ultimate value as well as the stone Max. And when you distribute steel axes, which the missionaries did relatively indiscriminately, it was very hard on the story that the Pacific Islanders told cause you think, what does that mean? It's like, okay, it's a steel ax. What's a steel ax for? Well it's for cutting down trees and you can do a better job with the steel ax then you can with a stone ax. But the thing is, it's like Elvis Presley's guitar, right? Elvis Presley's guitar is just, it's not just a thing to make music with. It's also Elvis Presley's guitar and it steel ax is not just a thing to cut down trees with its a cultural artifact that has sort of embedded in it a whole bunch of implicit messages, partly about the relative power of two cultures.

Speaker 3:          01:28:06       And in large part that it's like if you have to work your whole life to get a stone ax and then your four year old child walks down the street and brings home the steel ax, this is going to be somewhat hard on your, on your, uh, on your frame of references. Hey Dad, the people down the street or getting away machines that create money. So anyways, so when we introduce our artifacts into alternative cultures, we are putting a lot more into the culture than we actually think because the artifact, it's like Marshall Mcluhan said the medium is the message. Artifact is something other than just have to, it has a story that's embedded in it. So now you're tolstoy's case, it's almost the artifact was rather a story. I mean it was, yeah, it was an idea crystallized that experience that was already there. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:28:57       Right. Well, yeah, it was something, it something abstract it up anyways, so, okay. So anyways, well normally seen information can come in the form of a strange idea. I guess what I was trying to do with this with, this is something I didn't really recognize until this morning when I was working on this stuff. Again, anomalous information can, can enter your purview at every, at any level of abstraction. I guess that sort of leads is that someone can, if someone acts differently than you act, say, well, why does that bother you so much? The beer. Let's take the Germans for example, prior to the Second World War. Okay. Their culture is a little unstable as kind of dance, very high rates and London, terrible inflation and immense threat of communism from the east and a nontrivial threat. I mean the communists took over Russia after all.

Speaker 3:          01:29:54       So you know, there's enough novelty, enough normally floating around in the air, so to speak, to make everyone perfectly well uncomfortable. Um, under those circumstances, anybody who acted differently with a additional anomaly that I think it appeared as pretty much as something pretty much intolerable. So under normal circumstances, it's possible that the alternative behaviors of someone who's different than you aren't doing the pose that much of a problem to you, but all you have to do is perturb the system to some degree to make that sort of anomalous information, that much more intolerable state. If someone's from a culture that's different than you, even if you don't talk to them and even if they don't come into contact with you that much, the mere fact that there are around is definitive evidence that a story that isn't your story can be as success can make someone as successful as you are or perhaps even more successful. Sometimes you can tolerate that and sometimes you can't. So anomalous information can come in the form of pure procedure that's acted out by someone else.

Speaker 3:          01:31:04       Sometimes that's not a problem but sometimes it is the final. This is even less abstract. I guess I wanted to read you something cause I can't, I can't make the argument is well is that a road page one 68 the question here is what can disrupt you I guess and the things that can disrupt the, we can come in the form of direct challenges, indirect challenges to your cultural structure and these are all things that are other cultures basically agree or sorry. These two things are other cultures, the stranger and the stranger. This is schismatic movement within your own culture and this is the unknown. Doing its thing more or less all by itself. So cultures come to a halt. Well, let's say you're a culture. This is a good example, I suppose. You raise goats.

Speaker 3:          01:32:22       So you have an agrarian culture. The prime with goats is theirs that they produce. They produce environmental transformations. Goats like to live in deserts. And the thing about guns is that if you put them out somewhere soon, what you have is a desert. And the problem with deserts is that they don't support that many goats. So the point is, is that if you have an adaptive structure of one source, the consequences of that adaptive structure can be the transformation of the environment in such a way so that the adapter structure no longer no longer works.

Speaker 2:          01:32:52       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:32:54       Now this took me a long time to work out because mythological representations of the emergence of the negative unknown are always contaminated with mythological representations of the tyranny of the known. And it's almost as if from the mythological perspective of it, there's no difference between the over dominance of this.

Speaker 2:          01:33:20       Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:33:22       And the emergence.

Speaker 2:          01:33:29       Oh.

Speaker 3:          01:33:31       And I thought, how the hell could that be? Why would that be? Let me just read you something here. The insufficiency of cultural adaptation cannot easily distinguished from natural catastrophe. This society light on its feet, so to speak, is constantly in a position to adapt to the unexpected, even to the rapid and catastrophic kind of expected, even to transform such change into something positively beneficial. Likewise, this means that that affect and cognition earns more than with that. I think it's a funny, think about it this way.

Speaker 3:          01:34:15       Germany and Japan lost the Second World War in England. One, you'd never know it now, and that's partly because, well, it's part of it because the Americans in a fit of historical anomaly, it gave their enemies money instead of killing the ball and their last historically as lose to lose the war. The United States, the only country that ever really, one of them were against us as Vietnam and look where they are now. Right? Whereas you're looking at Japan and Germany. Well, we made it. It's the same. It's a good example of of the Integra relationship between this and this because the Germans, the Japanese underwent a catastrophe, a sociological catastrophe. Who's consequence was something very beneficial in the final analysis. Okay. The point is is that it's, you can't necessarily distinguish the valence of unexpected phenomenon from the pattern of behavior that's manifested in its presence, which is to say that it's very difficult to specify a particular situation that is in and of itself negative without any relationship to how you act in the face of that thing.

Speaker 3:          01:35:42       So let me, let me read you the, you have to think about this from, from the perspective of image, myth and literature constantly represent the parch kingdom. This society victim on its most frequently by drought, which is the absence of water concretely in the water of life or spirit. Symbolically, it scorched as a consequence of the over prolonged the dominance of the ruling idea, this idea in the narrative and frequently in there as well. And he is the king, the ancestral spirit representative of his people made tyrannical by age or pride, unbearable disappointment or we're doing under the influence of some malevolent and advising force development of such circumstances. Call, of course, for the entrance of the hero who's the lost son of the true king, raised in secrecy by alternative parrots, the rightful ruler of the kingdom, whose authority was undermine during vulnerable youth or who had been journeying in far off lands.

Speaker 3:          01:36:37       It was presumed yet here overturns the tire and regains his proper place. The gods please by the reestablishment of the proper order, a lot of the rain once more to fall and the story of this type, the creative aspect of the unknown or nature is locked away metaphorically by the totalitarian. No opinion of the current culture such a state of affairs might be represented. For example, by the sleeping princess in the kingdom brought to a standstill. What by some alternative variant of the existence of the treasure, hard to attain paralyzed by patriarchal despotism or frequently by fear of the terrible mother kingdom remained stagnant while the princess nature and your benevolent guys waits for the kiss of the hero two week her awakened and revitalize beauty. Subsequently we animate, sir.

Speaker 2:          01:37:26       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:37:31       See these stories basically say that if the unknown, if the environment is turn, if the environment has turned against you,

Speaker 2:          01:37:50       kill the king. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:37:52       Because whether you know it or know him, he's a tyrant. And so from the mythological perspective, there's no such thing as the negative aspect of the unknown as such. It's always only maybe it in relationship to a ruling idea. And the mythological idea is that if it's negative, there's something wrong with it. We wouldn't idea. That's the basic notion. It's a strange idea. And let's be honest, obviously the circling the wagons, sorry. Do you have to elaborate on like, like, like, uh, becoming more rigidly holding onto you, right. When facebook, it's not precisely the, it's not precisely the officer because, okay. And then I'll, I'll get, I'll get back to this.

Speaker 3:          01:38:42       If the, if the environment has become, has turned against you, then that's a sign that it's time to sacrifice the cake because this, the unknown is only negative in relationship to an idea. We already know that. Right? I mean, that's what we've been talking about with regards to the structure of these stories. All lawns that you construe the motivation valence of something with respect to your current story. So the mythological story basically says if negative things are happening all around you, it's not the environment as an objective thing. There's something wrong with the way you're living. That's why well say in an archaic exists in an archaic society. It's actually frequently happen is if things aren't working out, like there's a foot long drought, it's time to kill the king. When you think about a stupid idea that is, you know, they quit, the Kale is the king has to do with the drug.

Speaker 3:          01:39:40       But the point is, the point of the story is that the environment in large part is the consequence of your adaptive response. It's a presence, at least in terms of its valence. So it's a very intelligent to kill the cane when things aren't going well because after all, the king is the pattern of behavior that constitutes the kingdom. And if the kingdom isn't going very well, which means that the negative space of the great mother is constantly a very well. And who do you sacrifice when you sacrifice them to the grapevine? Right. In hopes that her causative facebook reappeared. And the funny thing is it works. This is another, this isn't, again, that's like you, you people are going to have to evaluate these ideas over a longer time, I suspect. But I'll tell you, I've never read anything anywhere that explains why people engaged in sacrificial rituals. It's nothing that ever made any sense to me, although people did it all. So this makes sense. It's ridiculous. The thing that people participate in activities like that in so many places over such long periods of time for no reason whatsoever. Well this is not ideally interact. You know, cause like if what you're doing isn't working, kill it, do something else. Good thinking.

Speaker 3:          01:40:57       So I don't understand why you'd have the why in that diagram, you know, where are the opposite each other? Well, it's the positive aspect of our culture that protects you from the negative aspect of it. But it was like snacks. Yes, that's right. They're stacked discs.

Speaker 4:          01:41:14       That's right. It would be better if you had to do four more faces so that they are, the positive aspects of the Cape couldn't line up with the positive aspect. And so

Speaker 3:          01:41:29       because in that case you'll have to shoot him if he'll sketch that or appreciate because I know the right, there's something like there's something missing, just a receipt where the

Speaker 4:          01:41:39       indicating king where the negative sinus. Yeah. We'll just make it a go here where the no weekend and also, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:42:25       Well I don't know either. Thinking about the idea that since there are stack this, the uh, the known blocks you from the, yeah, but that's still works, right, because this is still inscribed inside the circle. So then this, right? Yes. No. Well, but then you have them, you don't have the positive, I mean, if it's, if it's not something that works by blocking, then you have the positive aspect of the known you. Oh, right, right. Positive aspect of the unknown, which is what, and the other way to help them there. But yeah, right. The negative because the negative of the negative of the, but that's true. They're more blacks. The positive. This is true too though because they say that good is the enemy of the better, which is to say that you know, well you don't want a divorce, you had keyboard is, well a divorce you might keep the keyboard on, a computer is laid out so that you can type slowly.

Speaker 3:          01:43:19       And the reason for that is because it was designed on a for a manual type partner and really fast typists with jam and the keys. So some bright character figured out how to separate the most commonly used keys. So that really fast type is good and Jim and manual type Rick horshack keyboard where the key is that use most are laid out very close to each other and you hardly have to move your fingers at all. Now I would like to, I'd like to learn to use it, divorce, Shaq keyboard, but I already know how to use the qwerty keyboard. So I don't, and that means that what I know stops me from learning something because what I know is good enough, it stops me from learning something better. So I'm off to say, I mean I see your objection. It makes sense. It's sometimes it's hard to make the jump. Not saying that it's wrong, I'm just saying that there's sort of mixing the metaphor of blocking with the metaphor of, of revealing. Right, right, right. Well yeah, I'll have to keep this in mind and see if there's a way of balancing both. So then we're, the reaction to threat in the environment is to clean. You are rigidly to the kid as opposed to kill the kid. Right now it would be the negative, negative,

Speaker 3:          01:44:32       I don't know. Yes, that's right. I see what you mean. Yeah, that's exactly what happens. Good short term solution. But no walk in the long term cause damage to your father. You know, all you're doing is accumulating is knew what you're doing is like here's a whole bunch of disasters. You can have them one at a time, over a long span of time or you can shove them all into a clump out there in the future and go along merrily until you fall into them and have them all at once. Right. So, and that's basically the, that's the authoritarian answer to the problem, right? That may certainly the way that's right. Yes, yes, yes. But one of the things I want to make more clear in the second half of this manuscript, which isn't very well laid out right now, it's that there are three patterns of response to a normal.

Speaker 3:          01:45:18       One is face it and do something about it, which is basically admitted there, number one, and then engage in whatever modification of your story is necessary to produce something positive from your encounter with it. The second one is circle the wagons, which is to say some anomaly is facing me from outside. I'm afraid of the known because I've sacrificed my relationship with the hero. That's what an authoritarian does. I'm not creative like the emperor's creative for me, I just do what he says. When you circle the wagons, you also restrict the amount of novelty that exists within your constricted environment and dampen down your aspect, act as a consequence, right? Because you make everyone the same, which is what authoritarians too. So that's one way of going about it. Wrong. The other way of going about it wrong is it supposed to be the king is dead long live the king.

Speaker 3:          01:46:20       The wrong way of going about it is the king is dead period, period and people are motivated to do that. That's the thing. It's like you'd say, why the hell would someone do that? Because we already know that you need the king around or you're flooded with anxiety, so why kill him? While the thing is people do that, you know that's that artistic or rebellious sort of sort of style of adaptation. But the problem with having a king is that you have to do what he says and that's the price you pay for your security. You might be willing to get rid them if you can't stand any responsibility. And that's the, that's the alternative, improper mode that a patient, I think that's where you get this right in Chinese medicine there order and chaos and if you're ill it's because you have too much yin and Yang or you have too much Yang. You note about the end and the job that the Chinese doctor is to analyze you, so to speak, to ensure that the balance between the two phenomena is optimal, which means that you're here instead of over here in the authoritarian zone of the world are over here in the chaotic zone.

Speaker 3:          01:47:36       Okay, so next week we start talking about this. The final part of the story, which is this, which is I'm interested in you see, as we know, we know that you have a very good reason for protecting your culture, which is that it regulates your emotions. What I'm interested in is given that it's necessary for you to maintain your culture, even in the face of threats from other cultures, are there patterns of personal behavior that amplify it's are there patterns of personal behavior and amplified the danger of culture and patterns of behavior that reduce it? So is there something about your relationship to your culture that can either exacerbate intrinsic problems of group identification or reduce them? And that's what we're going to try to find out in the last part of the course. It's like culture's necessary. The problem with the necessity of culture is that it virtually ensures the existence of conflict. Given that, is there a way to act to make it worse or to make it better, and that's what we're going to talk so.
