Speaker 1:          00:00:05       She said that she found out he almost had a higher tolerance baseline and they had the same increase in production and sensitivity and then they had lower, it was lower. What's critical is to find out how heart rate split, which is also important. It's not as important because there's a response and some of the more frequent, more common complex negative emotions like resentment and guilt and hatred and cruelty and the argument basically and stuff. You know, when animals are afraid of the unknown, but for human beings, that fear is, is increased by the fact that we also abstractly understanding is since what the unknown means. Well, the mere fact that we can abstract out, I know she liked the unknown as such, certainly isn't indicative of the fact that our cognitive processes are somewhat different than the, from those of animals and I, I tried to show using examples drawn from both genesis and the story of the, the fall of the Buddhists, so to speak, that mythology or some myths anyway, present us with a story that says that the development of self consciousness is tantamount to the contamination of existence with death. I think the logic behind that basically is that the defining feature of self consciousness is knowledge of borders, so to speak, of our own personal borders and the most tangible and horrifying of those borders is our own knowledge of our mortality. So in a sense, it's the fact that we can see into the future and know what that future means. And so you could say in a sentence if you want to get mechanical about it, that for human beings, every aspect of existence serves as a cue for punishment.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       Now, someone commented last week that if you put an animal into an experimental situation where it's subjected constantly to unavoidable punishment, that develops learned helplessness, which is not alone, that depression can also produce aggression as a consequence of the administration of such punishment. So we know already that the purpose of group identification is to provide stability in an ocean of instability. But what we've now added to this, I think with this additional line of argumentation is more clear understanding of how, just how terrible the ocean of instability is for human beings in particular.

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       Because,

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       yeah, as I said before, I'm, I'm not just interested in figuring out why animals defend their territory, human beings and animals, at least in terms of that idea. I'm interested in why we go that final extra date of distance, which means that not only do we will we kill to protect our territory, but we'll engage in all sorts of murderous torture along the way, which seems gratuitous in a sense, is that you like it's one thing to one, eliminate your enemy and we understand some of the motivations for doing it. I mean, someone who's foreign disrupts your predictability. Predictability is the essence of security. It's another thing to

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       Choo Choo.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       Well, as I said, to make you, I guess to make it an aesthetic of his cruelty tend to pursue the opportunity to inflict suffering on someone else justified by your express patriotism expressly, but obviously motivated by something that's more twisted and perverse. So, and that's the core question that this course is trying to address this and what is it that makes people like that? No, just patriotic but totalitarian, patriotic, and not just willing to defend borders, but also motivated to enjoy that construction of cruelty for its own sake. I want to read you a quote from Solzhenitsyn to just start this off. So this is his description of the degradation of the state, the real version as opposed to the mythological version.

Speaker 1:          00:05:23       Soldier, Solzhenitsyn quotes and Arthur who says, I was told how executions were carried out at a doc who was the camp on the mature river. They would take the opposition members with their things out of the camp compound on a prisoner transport at night and outside the compound stood the small house of the third section. The condemned men were taken into a room one at a time and were the camp guards sprang on. Their mouths were stuffed with something soft and their arms were bound with the courts behind their backs. They were led out into the where harnessed carts were waiting. The bound prisoners were piled on the cards from five to seven at a time and driven off to the Gorkha, which was the camp cemetery on arrival. They were tipped into big pits that had already been prepared and buried alive. No one out of brutality. No, it had been ascertained rationally. Then when dragging and lifting them, it was much easier to cope with living people. Then with corpses, the work land on for many nights at a deck and social and it's and says that is how the moral political unity of our party was achieved.

Speaker 1:          00:06:39       Helipad, he's described the degradation of the state from the mythological perspective. He says as well be known since the compilation is made by our Andre h use ner and Jg Fraser, the delusion is almost universally disseminated and is documented in all of the continents of a rarely in Africa and on various cultural levels. A certain number of variants seemed to be the result of dissemination, first from Mesopotamia and then from India. It is equally possible that one or more one or several actual dilulio catastrophes gave rise to fabulous narratives, but it would be risky to explain. So widespread myth by phenomena of which know geologic and traces have been found. The majority of the flood myth Siemens sends to form part of the cosmic rhythm. The old world people by a fallen humanity is submerged under the waters and sometimes later a new world emerges from the aquatic chaos. While you're all familiar with that general model, you've seen that over, over and over again and the diagrams that I've presented to, it's just basically this notion

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       people have fallen humanity down by the water who then reemerge. That's the story of Noah for example, but then he goes on to say, this is very interesting. It's really worth thinking about because, well, I think it's worth thinking about. I guess this past and struck me because it echoed long after I thought up what I'm going to tell you today what I had in fact thought up, which was that you can't say that a state gets rotten and corrupt all on its own, although that happens merely as a consequence of the passing of time, which is to say that, all right, let's take the analogy of the individual. We all have childhood at one point, and those personalities, theoretically or healthy, given our status as children, but as time passed, which basically meant as changed, continued to happen, we transformed from children and adolescents.

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       And that meant that the childhood personality considered as something static would have turned pathological by its own devices as we transformed into adolescence because the attitude of a child over were appropriate for a child is not appropriate for an adolescent. One of the things that added points out says, well, that's an idea of the, the, the, the aging and senility of the cake. Is that an idea that's good at one point in your life may become pathological at a later point. So there's sort of, it's just a consequence of entropy in a sense. Things always change and as a consequence you have to run to keep up with them. But then really had, he takes the argument a bit farther and he says in a large number of variants, the flood is a result of the sins or ritual faults of human beings. Sometimes it results simply from the wish of a divine being to putting in to mankind will know his story is very much like that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:09       Anyways, the chief causes seem to lie at once in the sins of men and the decrepitude of the world. So Elliot, he says, well, it's not just a matter of the fact that things age and become decayed by themselves, but there's an additional twist on it, which is that there's some contribution according to the mythological mode, thinking of the misbehavior of human beings, but makes the guard so upset they can't stand the noise so to speak anymore. They decided to do away with everything that's being created. So there's an, there's a sin of commission as well as an act of omission that leads to the decrepitude of things. In the end, he says, by the mere fact that it exists, that is that it lives in, produces the cosmos gradually deteriorates and ends by falling into decay. This is why it has to be recreated, recreated.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       In other words, the flood realizes on the macrocosmic scale. What is symbolic effected during the New Year Festival? The end of the world and the end of the sinful humanity in order to make a new creation possible. Finally, you might think about the myth that we discussed a long time ago, the Egyptian myth that underlies the The Sun God status of the Pharaoh. That's the myth of Ocirus horrocks. Remember ocirus ends up being sent to the underworld because of the treachery of his brother Seth, who the Egyptian myth states. Clearly he didn't understand. So the Egyptian myth states was that first there was something fishy about seth. And second of all that he had such great impact on our stairs because well serious didn't understand what seth was and that meant basically is trying to point out, so to speak to people that if you don't understand what evil is, that will defeat you.

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       And so what we're trying to do from at least in this lecture and more or less for the last three lectures, is to come to some understanding of just what evil consists of so that we can decrease the likelihood that it will in fact defeat us. I was showing this manuscript to a friend of mine on the weekend and he found parts of the argument that I was making. I should, I'm outline I gave you last week, kind of unsettling in a sense because I use a lot of terminology that's being classically associated with the religious thought I can, can I, you know this, this disturbs me as well. It's certainly, at least it did. As I was putting the manuscript together, because I had never was inclined. I thought of my own accord to gravitate towards religious language and he asked me why I insisted upon using words like evil when they have this historical context that at least places that partially into the domain of religious thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       Well, you know, it would certainly make, if I changed the terminology and deemphasize the mythological language, I could certainly make the sorts of theories that I'm trying to present more palatable. But the fact is, as far as I'm concerned, that the mere fact that we know anything at all about evil is because of religious constructions of precisely what evil is. And it would be a mistake as a consequence to abandon the historical roots of the development of the idea, just to make discussion of it more palatable. One thing that occurred to me when I was reading is that you seem to have changed their meanings somewhat from the traditional religious sense and goes, where's your actually discuss concretely in there? But the good and good general, they refer us to a specific moral code and evil to opposition to the Colu. Yeah, right, and not as is when for instance needs to finish his book beyond good and evil refers to propose to them in that sense.

Speaker 1:          00:14:24       In other words that you're beyond that, that split, but then what Derryn Brian curb as good and evil is sort of beyond the traditional grid enable these. That's right. It's description of good and evil as processes rather than as as things are estates. Yeah. I was reading a little bit about the French Revolution this morning because I referred to it in this manuscript somewhere or said that the French during the French revolution erected a statue to the goddess of Notradame Cathedral, which I was thought was already telling historical then that's wrong by the way. They actually a, they actually dressed up an opera singer at to represent the goddess of liberty and created her around inside the notradame cathedral, which they had renamed the temple the temple of reason. So I had my remembrance of the historical factors a little bit off, but the basic notion is still remains absolutely solid.

Speaker 1:          00:15:16       I mean the people who ran the French revolution were in fact, at least in the initial stages of the revolution were out to to replace Christianity, Catholicism with, with rational atheism and to enshrine reason. And it was interesting to read some of the things that they have done because it's certainly the case, for example, that our notion of natural rights formally derives in large part from the work that was done by certain people around the time of the French revolution. And what was really interesting about those authors is that having constructed their explicit description of natural rights, they immediately made the presumption that they had invented the concepts. There was no historical basis for the idea in a sense that there was no lengthy process of religious development that led up to the possibility of positing something like a natural. Right. So once having discovered it, so to speak, which is to say having made it explicit, they were willing to dispense entirely with all of the historical prerequisites for the development of that idea.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       I mean that was the idea here is right. Say you come up with a rational explication of the notion of a natural, right. Well that's based on on an immensely long and complex history of the movement of the sorts of behavior patterns that are encoded in the idea of national rights up this hierarchy of abstraction. So anyways, the point is is that as soon as the French thinkers, we're able to make the notion of the national right explicit. They were willing to dispense with the historical precursors. And the reason I'm using that argument is because I'm trying to make the notion of evil explicit and I'm, but I'm not willing to dispense with the historical precursors. Cause it's absolutely obvious to me that the only reason that I can say anything at all about evil is because all of the ideas that I'm describing how are already played out at all these more implicit levels of analysis.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       And what I'm trying to do, you see, the thing is about mythological modes of thinking. These natural categories is that they do have really, really fuzzy boundaries. And so when you consider this structure, you know, every one of these levels of analysis has a negative and a positive valence. And it's very easy for us to, it's very easy for us to make the presupposition that given that the devil, so to speak, is something negative. That all of the things that we regard as negatively vaillant emotionally belong in the category of the devil. It's a very easy mistake to make. So that's, so it's easy for us to say, well, the foreigner like good is, uh, adherence to a particular creed. Therefore, and foreigners obviously presented a threat to the integrity of that creed that threatens negatively valence. It's reasonable to lump everything natively valence into the same category.

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       The category that we lumped, everything that's active and negatively valence into is equivalent to the devil, so you get a perfectly reasonable logical train that leads to the demonization of enemies. Now, Elaine Paige Mills who just wrote a book on the on the Devil said that the actual, she actually I think reversed the motivational change. She said the reason that what Christianity has come up with what I think is the most well elaborated story of the devil and what, although there are other religions that have done the same sort of thing and certainly the notion, the nature of evil is a preoccupation of all sorts of moral systems, but in terms of elaborating up a dramatic figure, Christianity has done a very good job of that page will says the underground motivation for the construction of such a figure, which is the personification of evil, was to aid Christians in labeling their enemies as demonic and justifying their their annihilation.

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       Now, I think, you know, this is a, first of all, it's plausible argument. Second of all, it's a potent argument. Um, and it, it also seems fairly obvious that people do use mythological figures that represent evil to and apply them to their enemies to justify their, you're not alation. So then you might think, well, maybe the whole idea of evil is just a rationalization that we use to pursue am's that we want to pursue. But I would say, well, that's not exactly right. Despite the fact that it's like Freud's comments about religion. You can use religion as a, as a neurotic defense against your anxiety. You've death. Absolutely. What that means is that you identify with a given creed in a dogmatic manner and that protects you from your neurotic stairs. Don't want from Freud's mistake as far as I was concerned, was to take a perfectly reasonable observation and turn it into universal statement.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       The statement being, that's the only possible purpose of religion. The fact that you could miss you something does not necessarily mean that the misuse of the thing is the only use of it. While I'm the same applies to the ideas of evil. The fact that having a figure at your disposal like the devil so to speak, makes it easier for you in some ways to, to represent your, your enemies as reprehensible does not necessarily mean that. That's the only reason that such a figure developed and when I'm trying to do in this manuscript and this lecture today is to clarify, is to bring some clarity to these fuzzy, mythological categories so that we can draw a clear distinction between, well what I would say our idols of evil, which are necessarily false and the process of evil itself, which I think is actually clearly identifiable and stable across cultures. Just like all these other things that we've discussed. Okay. Anyone? Yes? How could you talk about evil?

Speaker 1:          00:21:15       Well, Oh, you, you can talk about it by all sorts of other names I guess like in humanity might be one or uh, well, we, we do it in psychology all the time. We talk about antisocial behavior where we talked about psychopathy, psychopathy being the thing that's most closely related in the clinical literature to classical notions of evil. But, and then we say like standard theories of antisocial behavior. For example, and I know I know this literature relatively well, they're usually motive. They're based on, uh, on inference is drawn from analysis of lower level of motivations. Like you might say that the typical antisocial person is someone who's very high in sensitivity to incentive reward and very low in sensitivity to threat. That's a standard theory for anti social motivation. So that means that they're all goal, all curiosity, all novelty seeking and very little stock.

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       You can't make the managers so they don't have inhibitory control over the behavior. But, but that, that's a pretty mechanistic notion of, of, of what underlies criminal behavior in a lot of research has been being devoted towards that. And you know, the idea of being the standard antisocial personality, someone who just doesn't feel anxiety very clearly, who can't use cues of punishment to regulate their own behavior. Now there the problem, I don't think there's any wrong with that line of theorizing. I think there are probably underlying motivation reasons that might propel someone who's neurotically inclined, so to speak, towards criminality rather than towards agoraphobic or eating disorders or all the other things that can complicate up your life. But what that's missing is any appreciation for the fact that a lot of the activities that we regard as criminal deeply criminal have this aspect of almost an aesthetic aspect in a sense, which is obvious desire to wreak havoc and harm on someone else, not merely for whatever gain might be caused by that, but very often despite the fact that no gain whatsoever will be cost by just for participating in the act itself.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       Now, there's some exceptions to this, like Dan always who studies bullying in Scandinavian countries the most particularly, he's always been interested in. One of the things that motivated his lifetime's work on, on bullying is understanding of the authoritarian personality because he's, he makes the presupposition that bullies in their henchmen or the juvenile versions of fascists, fascists, and their louts, which is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis as far as I'm concerned. He's documented instances. For example, he has a video tape, which I haven't seen him. I just read this description of it that shows, you know, it's being taken in a public school in Norway showing a group of bullies, tormenting a whipping boy basically by tying a string around his neck and leading them through the hallways. And the thing about that sort of thing is that it's fun and it's that aspect of, of the attractiveness of engaging in that sort of behavior that we really haven't been able to get our finger on very clearly in psychology.

Speaker 1:          00:24:16       And I think as a rule we tend to, we tend to sidestep it. And it's also because we don't like to deal with issues like equal, so to speak, that have these sorts of religious overtones. But when you're talking about the sorts of things that happened in concentration camps in the Soviet Union in Germany, which are the sorts of things I'm really interested in, you have to use the strongest work you have at your disposal to describe those patterns of activity. And it's also the case that, well, as I mentioned last week, I think a lot of the prior order surviving Nazis were prosecuted after the Second World War for crimes against humanity, which is, uh, which is a category of moral violation, which we recognize at a sort of super cultural level, which is that we say, well, yes, morality is culture bound, which is to say that different cultures have different rules.

Speaker 1:          00:25:06       If you follow those rules, you're, you're responsible within the confines of those cultures. But despite that relativistic morality, there are certain activities that you can't engage in no matter what your excuses and basically what that, that's, that's the thesis of the Nuremberg trials basically in that thesis is predicated on implicit recognition at least that there's a form of morality that supersedes cultural identification and also one that a form of morality and a form of immorality that transcends cultural identification. And if you don't believe that, then it's difficult to justify any belief that you might have. That what happened in Germany, for example, did constitute a crime against humanity. Then you have to regard the Nuremberg trials as an act of revenge by the victors, which is an arguable position

Speaker 3:          00:25:54       question. I'm just wondering, I'm trying to understand the context of mental health. Um, I'm wondering, um, first of all, like mental health itself can be defined like the idea of mental health and need find this like survival or cooperation in society or whether it's like, you know, we can itself like can have disturbed person achieves to a high level of success. I just, Hitler did and still be considered.

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       Well that's, that's the, that's the question. I mean, I said one of the questions that I've been trying to answer all along here, this neat, she's in Peru, which is, are there pathologies of health, which is, can you be the exemplar of a given society, which means by the definition of that society normally average, but in fact and still be considered corrupt at a higher level of analysis whose existence can actually be justified in some manner. And that is the issue. And that's what we're trying to, that's what we're trying to find out. Okay. So I read you the little story that [inaudible] told about the elimination of anomalous information in the form of other people, which is not social instance argument. The social and political unity of the Communist Party says, how was it a tank you just eliminate, you eliminate all anomalous information that's actually still embodied in, right, so an idea log doesn't like contrary rational arguments because they present information that violates the of the logs, precept positions, but it's also the case that the mere existence of certain types of people, regardless of whether they're making their arguments in any abstract form, those people indicate by their behavior, their objection to our existence in spite of your particular precept.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       So they're mere fact. The mere fact of their existence is individuals and sufficient threat to justify their, their repression and annihilation. I would say, well totalitarians are doing to people exactly what abstract authoritarians due to ideas that don't agree with them. If you present me with information that doesn't fit my frame of reference, I'll just

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       eliminated

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       you. Eliade talks about the notion of the flood and this University of disseminated myth that says states of being are annihilated by the gods periodically, not only because they are decrepit as a constant, just as a consequence of their manner of being, but also because people add unnecessary decrepitude to them by their, by their sins, so to speak. That's a mythological idea and we don't know what it means. Now, I'm going to read you a little section that describes the authoritarianism of an individual who I think came to realize that many of his so called moral precepts, the things that he held as as ideological ideals were in fact leading him down in extraordinarily totalitarian path.

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:28:57       today is Christmas Day and I have just come home from Julie's while I was there. It struck me as I sat on the couch between two girls, just how foolish and idiotic I have been in this smile and we life. I hope you want to have patients while I own burden myself on you because I need desperately to confess my sins to someone. And I know that if I were sitting in a little cubicle talking to an unseen clergymen, I wouldn't do a proper job of it. You fit the definition of a religious man as someone who gives careful consideration to the demonic and irrational and humanity. So I think you will find my confession. Interesting. Imagine if you can a grown man who harbors in his heart the most vicious resentment for his fellow man, his neighbor who is actually

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       guilty of nothing, more than embodying a superior consciousness of what it means to be a man. When I think of all the black scathing thoughts I have directed at those who I could not look in the eye, it is almost unbearable. All of my lofty disdain for the common man who so I thought it was guilty of the sin of, of unconsciousness was I now realize founded on nothing more than jealousy in spite I hated unload anyone who had wrestled with their fear of leaving the maternal confines of a childish mentality and won their battle only because I had not done so. I equated independence and success with ego, tism and selfishness, and it was my fondest hope, my highest ambition to witness and participate in the destruction of everything that's successful, independent people had built for themselves. This, I consider it a duty fact. There was a decidedly fanatical element in my urge to cleanse the world of what I perceived to be selfishness.

Speaker 2:          00:30:43       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:30:43       I think of what would have happened if I had been in a position to realize my fine feelings. The memory makes me fear that any moment the earth, we'll crack open and swallow me up because if there was any justice, it would I who have not the faintest inkling of a capacity for moral judgment traipsing around passing judgment on anyone who Derek Cross my path. It makes me wonder that I have even one friend in this world, but of course I had friends before, anyone with enough self contempt that they could forgive me. Mine. It is fortunate for humanity that there are a few saviors of the caliber of myself. If you know that I use to identify with Christ, I considered myself entirely immaculately free of aggression in every other form of antisocial feeling, but what about the hatred I have just now confessed you ask.

Speaker 4:          00:31:36       That didn't count. Those feelings were based on sound common sense, uc. After all, there are sons of bitches in the world and one needs to be ready for them. Do I smell ozone? They say you get a tingling sensation just before the lightning bolt strikes. That is a very apt phrase, son of a bitch. There's a passage in young's phenomenology of the self which runs often. A mother appears beside him who apparently shows not the slightest concern that her little son should become a man, but who was tireless in self emulating effort, neglect, nothing that might hinder him from growing up in marrying you. Now, behold the secret conspiracy between mother and son and how each helps the other to be trade life.

Speaker 4:          00:32:23       This insight would be useful for me as an excuse being a perfectly accurate description of my situation. We're not for the fact that I'm almost daily presented with a residual bit of undeleted evil and myself. For example, when I am faced with a frustrating situation, I do not ask myself what I am going to do about it. I asked myself who's responsible for it and I'm always ready to conclude that if the other person were to ag property, then the problem will not exist. What is evil, the boat that you ask? Well, obviously if I am determined to overlook my own part in the failure to resolve my own frustrations, I, if I'm determined to find a scapegoat for my problems, then I'm just a stone's throw away from the mentality that was responsible for Hitler's final solution or for the Spanish inquisition or for Lennon's cultural cleansing.

Speaker 2:          00:33:15       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:16       What was it you told me when I complained about the flaws in capitalism about the fact that so many people take advantage of the capitalist system, something like the fact that people go on consolidating their financial position ad nauseum is another problem, but it is no reason to conclude that there anything virtuous in even refusing to try to cut consolidates one's position in the first place, but it is much easier to crown ones, cowardice and laziness with the accolade of virtue. Just ask Lens Henchman. He swaggered around the countryside, robbing every farmer who had managed any success whatsoever and called themselves friends of the common people and patted each other on the back for their moral uprightness. I wonder if I've actually changed so much that I would not join them if I was put to the test. The idea that morality stems from a lack of personal interest is thoroughly ingrained in my mind. Good people are those who don't want anything for themselves is the way I think, but I never asked myself why is such a person shouldn't put any effort into disciplining himself or take any pains to keep his motives clear in his own mind because there's nothing of value to him in this world,

Speaker 4:          00:34:32       in his essay relations between the ego and the unconscious, he don't says that in an unconscious state, the individual's torn by the conflict of opposites and that achieving consciousness involves resolving that conflict on a higher level. Right. I understand that this particular statement, Cha a Dalton consciousness is different from the original state of childlike and consciousness in which there is no long term conflict. Just last week I was stuck in that dead end again. I was sitting and thinking about what course my life should be taking and had every imagined scenario of a fulfilling or meaningful activity. I was met by a counterpoint coming from somewhere in my head showing me how this or that aspect of my scenario was wrong because it wouldn't result in this or that problem.

Speaker 2:          00:35:15       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:15       To the point where it was unacceptable. Consider any career at all because just by being alive, I would contribute to the destruction of the planet and as badly as I want it to refute this echo of wrong to my every emotion, right as an irrational Kymera. The fact is, so I told myself that we see daily in the newspapers how the activities of humanity, which are also the activities of men and women are causing and Calkin will farm.

Speaker 4:          00:35:42       It is of course, due to my being influenced by yourself that I do not remain stuck in that particular blog too long these days. If our industrialism was causing problems, I know Lawrence for myself than I should hope that there are people out there working to solve those problems, or perhaps I should try to do something about them myself, but sitting idly by, I do know what it's all the thing. Of course, what is most daunting and also most sniffily about being stuck in that Bhag is the fact that the rational wide wants to be absolutely sure about the successful outcome of its life plan. I know, obviously there's another part of the mind that knows that such certainties, impossible when has been faced with the need to accept on faith that things will turn out for the better and with some luck and perseverance.

Speaker 2:          00:36:24       Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:36:24       and being a fine, upstanding modern mouse with an enlightened rational mind. I have no use for faith and other such religious Santa clap trap and nonsense or faith is obviously your rational and all not have any here rationality influencing my behavior previously. My solution to this problem was to allow a chance to make my career choices for me, letting my own interests influenced my decisions as little as possible. And then I believe that I had somehow avoided personal responsibility for the state of the modern world because I was not really responsible for the state of my life and that eight escape from the possibility that my plans wouldn't work out because I had no plans. It was on this rock solid foundation that I looked out at the world and saw all around me, people who were stupid enough to add their own selves into the equation, put this kind of faith in oneself to believe that there exists inside of one a motive force, call it an interest which will respond to life and carry one through uncertainty and adversity is an irrational attitude without equal, and it is with this irrational approach to life that the conflict of opposites is resolved, it seems to me,

Speaker 4:          00:37:31       but the problem now is this. In order to have this faith in one's irrational nature, one needs proof that personal interests and passions are capable of sustaining one through the uncertainties and adversities of life with the rational mind foresee so clearly, and the only way to get that proof is to risk one self and just see the result.

Speaker 2:          00:37:48       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:37:48       It is a very exceptional person you can take such under taking on their own. Most of us need guidance and support from others, from believers, so to speak. Strange, isn't it? That religious terms should become useful for this discussion. As I wrote that last paragraph, I was suddenly reminded of your idea that the devil has, he has represented Milton's paradise lost is a metaphor for the rational intellect just being placed in the position of the highest psychic authority.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:38:15       Better to rule and how then to serve in heaven. Hell, Dan is a condition in which the rational mind with its acute consciousness of the many perils of life hold sway over the individual and the fact of Lee prevents him from engaging in life, which results in the morally degenerate state of weakness that I described in the first pages of his letter.

Speaker 2:          00:38:34       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       And Heaven, I presume, would be a condition in which the rational mind subordinates itself to faith in God. What is God? You have a chapter in the manuscript of your book towel titled The Divinity Interest. Your ideas are starting to make sense to me now at least I think they are. Faith in God means faith in that which Kendall's one's interest and leads one away from the parental sphere out into the world. To deny those interests is to deny God fall from having it land squarely in hell where one's passions burn eternally and frustration was it God said when he cast out amount of Eden, so I'm thinking about working in the dust at the end of his days with the specter of death always looming in the future. I can certainly relate to that. One of the most vivid impressions I get from recalling all those years I spent moving from one job to the next is the pointlessness of my daily life back then and the glaring knowledge that the end was drawing near, but when I'm doing something that has meaning for me, something that interests me as I am right now, death seems far away and work seems quite agreeable, even joy us.

Speaker 1:          00:39:44       Well, there's two things or more about that. I guess the first is that the writer of this letter points out that the only thing that stopped him from, from being Hitler or Stalin for that matter, or perhaps on where you want to, Hitler or stale intention was lack of opportunity. It's not lack of will and that it's easy for us to make the presupposition that there's a qualitative difference between someone like Hitler and it's our Ed of men or stolen and someone like ourselves. Partly because we're never in the position to do any of the sorts of things that those bands did and as a consequence it's, we can use our difference in position to support our notion that there's a qualitative difference, but he points out, I think this is interesting also in terms of more current news about the unabomber because the unabomber was a person who had this sort of attitude that's described in this letter, which is that he made the presupposition that industrial society, him excluded was evil and the appropriate thing to do was to disassociate oneself entirely from all contact with that society and having done so presume and begin to fix it from an outside all on his own.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       And I know in terms of psychological profiles, I mean I know what the unabomber is like is on the outside. He would appear as someone who was absolutely could we essence who would do anything you told him to do. They would never cause any trouble whatsoever. Who would appear as someone who was actually composed almost entirely of low self esteem and doubt, but who deep inside believed that he was far superior to anyone that he'd ever encountered on the earth. That's how I mean it's from a position like that that you can then move rapidly towards justification of doing things like blowing up in innocent people who theoretically partake in what you consider inappropriate from a distance having severed for moral reasons. All possible contact with with a real members of humanity supported in his endeavors theoretically from pity and care by both his mother and his brother who sent him money to sustain is completely abnormal, exist as long beyond the point that it would have been sustainable on its own.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       I also wanted to read you another section from social [inaudible] and on the authoritarianism of the individual. This is the ideological, logical version. So we have the first story that describes the consequences of a totalitarian ideology, put it to action, which is the necessary pursuit and destruction of people who don't share the ideological view. And then we have the mythological notion that things go from bad to worse on their own, but people tend to help that process along. But as a consequence now and man, God decides to obliterate the world. And then we have an individual story in which one person who confesses that given his presuppositions about the state of the world, had he been in any position of authority whatsoever, he would've been a very terrible person. And in fact that he was a very terrible person, but he was also powerless. So he didn't look terrible because he couldn't put any of his fantasies into action. And this is, I do thing, this is what separates most of us from the position that someone like Hitler found himself. Because I do actually believe that that Hitler was not a particularly pathological individual.

Speaker 2:          00:43:28       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:43:30       He had a decent first world war record, his sort of aimless wandering throughout Europe. At the close of world war one or that much different from the aimless wandering of any number of hundreds of thousands of men who'd be unbelievably brutalized in trench warfare during World War One.

Speaker 2:          00:43:50       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:43:51       See, the thing is, it's not to say that a man in that position was without faults because he certainly had as many faults as the next person did. But the problem is is that no, if you, if you put yourself into a position of power, what you forego is the sort of social feedback that keeps most people in line. So you can say, well, you know, if the average individual is composed of a certain amount, positive qualities and a certain amount of negative qualities, but being relatively powerless, the average person has always kept in mind by the social pressure of his or her peers. So for any of us, theoretically, if we start to move too far in our naturally pathological direction, we receive instant. We receive instant feedback from our surrounding environment suggesting that it might be better if we want a fire behavior, which is to say that people have enough courage to be irritated by us and let us know that, or people have enough courage or aren't sufficiently terrified of us, which is the same thing in a sense to tell us when we've gone too far out of wine by gesture and look and interaction and all sorts of things.

Speaker 1:          00:44:54       So you know, we all, we all, that's part of the security that the social group provides. You know, a social group makes everyone else predictable, but it also keeps us predictable to ourself to by ensuring that we told the line the problem with accruing power in the manner of someone like Hitler is that you forego all that social corrective feedback. And then because you surround yourself by people and it's a process that feeds back onto itself, you surround yourself by people who are essentially cowardly, who want to hide behind your charisma, so to speak, so that they don't have to face the world and they're willing because you protect them from the things they don't want to look at to exceed to your every wish. Now in some ways that can be perfectly positive. I read a good biography of Hitler, I thought that claimed that had he quit or being killed or died in the mid thirties that the judgment of the German people and perhaps of history overall would he'd be in the pain of being a very effective leader.

Speaker 1:          00:45:51       You know, you might debate, perhaps it's debatable. I haven't read every biography of Hitler that's out there, but the problem was that as things continue to, as his power continued to grow, his pathology had a wider and wider, wider, wider latitude for expression. And then, you know, the question really becomes, so you can say, because it's comforting that there's a qualitative difference between someone like Hitler and the person who's sitting next to you. But then you also have to think when the whole country of people think that you're the answer to all their problems, what sort of character and what it take to, to tell yourself that all those people are wrong given especially in say inhibitors case. The exceptional odds against him have ever him having ever gone to the position that he got to. He was a pretty, he was trivial person from a, from a socioeconomic and military perspective.

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       He didn't come from a powerful family. He had no influential friends to speak of. And he climbed up the ranks of the hierarchy unit, remarkable manner and you know, gain the gain, the democratic acceptance of the vast majority of the German population. And he also viewed himself as someone who was, Germany's only hope, partly as a bolt. Like he viewed himself as a bulwark from the encroachment of communism from the East, which was a real threat. And also someone who could conceivably restored Germany to some of the power that had been stripped from, from the country by diverse side trading, which I think is reading. It's reasonable to comment on that training that it was blatantly vengeful. So you'll have to ask yourself, well, under those conditions, given, given that much admiration carried out over such a lengthy period of time, how many people wouldn't fall prey to their own pathologies?

Speaker 5:          00:47:41       That's one of the things. Blending very interesting. Sort of enjoyed as much personal powers anymore. You have to seem to have a discipline to survive. Right? Right. Some degree. I mean it makes it because the hip or pattern is much more common. Right. Then the wake on these, I'm just curious when you think about that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       Well, I mean it's, I don't know exactly what to think about it. I mean, perhaps here it's just surprisingly lacking anthropologist. Well that's one possibility. I mean he was also, he was also explicitly religious. He had engaged in also, I've always thought personal incentives. Yeah. Yeah. I think that, I think that was part of it. I mean he was willing voluntarily to four gold, many of the, the rewards that he might've otherwise, I guess basically what he did was to, to try to discipline himself so that he as a matter of habit would reject any temptation that was offered to him. I mean, he did some strange things, you know, like, or things that seem strange, I think like I remember that Gandhi used to sleep with young women in order to, to attempt to suppress his sexual desire grow. Right, exactly. And you think, well that's kind of a strange thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       And then you think, well, you know, this guy, here's someone who is like absolutely surrounded by temptations of every sort, you know, in any direction that he would have chosen to pursue whatever he wanted, he would have been granted it. And perhaps the only way he could keep himself vaguely on course was to forego all of the, all the temporal attractions of his power as powerful position. I also think again, the perhaps had prepared himself for the sorts of things that he might encounter, um, beforehand. And he engaged in a lengthy letter writing correspondence with tolstoy before he started his, his nonviolent movement in India. I also suspect that maybe as his power grew, his character grew too because he was making the right decisions all the way along. So you know, when, when he was offered a small temptation so to speak, perhaps he was able to say no.

Speaker 1:          00:49:51       And then the next time when the temptation, the slight be bigger, he, you know, it got easier. That's right. It was something that was practice. Maybe it's a good question. We may be confusing situations here. I think you can apply the same analysis that you used for Hitler in terms of Gandhi. His, the reason why he was powerful is because you enable to resist these temptations. So as you accumulated power and accumulated power as a saint, not as a political leader in a sense, is there a lot of political leaders in Indian? So you're suggesting too that there was social pressure on him to keep him on the positive? In the positive direction as well. I said, yeah, well I think that's right. I mean, if everyone expects you to act like a saint as well then and you're going to have to have a moral, right?

Speaker 1:          00:50:33       Absolutely. Well, yeah, I mean certainly these sorts of feedback processes exist. I mean, that's why I said there's this statement in the new testament run something like to those who have everything more shall be given to those who have nothing. Everything will be taken away. What do I think that is? His description of this sort of feedback process is that one good decision heightens the likelihood of the next good decision and so on and so forth. So invent, as you make your decisions, events conspire, so to speak, to reinforce them. You can see this with paranoids like Stella. I mean, if you're paranoid, you think everyone's out to get you well as, which means that you're very hostile and suspicious towards people, which means that you see their dark side. It also makes them very afraid and suspicious of you so you can see you very [inaudible]. So, you know, that sort of thing could spiral out of control very, very rapidly. I dealt with that.

Speaker 5:          00:51:22       Well, just one of the really intriguing things about God as well as the same, which is sort of an unusual combination. And there are many who, uh, as far as his sainthood, we turn out not to be, I mean witness Ben tollerene evangelists and all that specific claim to authority is being holier than the rest of us who then ultimately turn out to be that. So there's still something very extraordinary about this personal discipline or whatever it was what,

Speaker 6:          00:51:58       yeah, you had sex with young women, you're not calling that?

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       No, no. He just slept beside that. Beside that. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Um, and then to heighten his ability to resist, that was his theory. I mean, who knows.

Speaker 6:          00:52:12       Um, what do you think of the difference between like, the sort of second process of denying the temptation versus like sort of denying other people's idea of like in both the same sort of, similar in like you're saying, um, I'm acknowledging some part of me and they, I mean, they're both thing. Um, not acknowledging some, pardon me, like

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       no, there's a difference between refusing to acknowledge something and technology, but picking a particular course of action, like I may say say we're in involved in a heated discussion and you make me angry. I mean the appropriate response on my part is to recognize the fact that I am in, that I am angry and north to pretend that I'm knowing because good people don't get angry. But then once having recognized the fact, choose that pattern of behavior that I feel is appropriate under those circumstances, which might be to say, you know, we'd better stop having this discussion because I am in fact getting angry or, or you might say something like, um, for reasons I don't understand entirely what you're saying is really irritating me. I don't know necessarily where the ducks up an appropriate reaction or not, but it's really the one that I have. That's the sort of thing it was actually put to some therapeutic can

Speaker 5:          00:53:22       you just fight people like Carl Rogers cause he used to do that sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       So it's not a matter of like, it's not the pretense that the uncomfortable fact doesn't exist. It's choosing to deal with it in some conscious man, which means planned manner once it's actually manifest.

Speaker 6:          00:53:41       One other thing that you mentioned before we hit like most of the leaders seem to charismatic because they seem like they were unified in that like different president personality all sort of fit together well.

Speaker 1:          00:53:53       Sure. I would say now that you've been about someone like Hitler.

Speaker 6:          00:53:56       Yeah. I mean if somebody's in that way to differently, depending on whether you follow all your temptations and death, like all your names of set as satisfied or

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       he just said when nature discuss morality, he said that most morality was cowardice, which basically meant that it wasn't that people were good, it was just that they were far too afraid to act on those motivations but actually propelled them. But at the motivations were there and that given the opportunity with no with no chance of

Speaker 2:          00:54:24       Oh

Speaker 1:          00:54:25       punishment, people would act them out. And you see this sort of behavior in riots, for instance, where the likelihood of being caught for committing a criminal act decreases to basically zero and you know, anti anti social behavior, so to speak, spreads through the population like a play.

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:54:45       I think the reason that people like hibbler are attractive from a charismatic perspective. And this also goes from gangster figures, for example, in American movies. So there's an absolute plethora is that people do tend to admire.

Speaker 2:          00:55:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:02       People do tend to admire those individuals who may see as courageous enough so to speak, to act on their darker impulses. And I think the positive and the negative reason for that is pure desire to imitate. But the positive aspect of that is that we know what some mythological level, so to speak, that the movement from conventional cowardice driven morality to a higher order morality involves necessarily taking into account a whole plethora of motivational states that are normally regarded as unacceptable, like regression and the potential for cruelty. And, uh, I'm, I'm inhibited sexual desire and so on and so forth. And anyways, that's part of the reason why I think we're attracted to people like gangster fingers. Do you think it's also because we're witnessing someone with an effective strategy for accomplishing their goals? I mean regardless of what the content of that strategy is, that's an overall construction. It is. Well they get, sure you could do that. And I would say that that's, I would say that's more the negative end of the aberration. I mean the point is, is that, did you ever see the movie goodfellas? Yeah, I hated that movie anyways cause I actually thought it glorified the mom's terms under the guise of

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       showing how despicable they weren't. But that's okay. It's a debatable, debatable proposition. Certainly the goodfellas believe themselves to be certainly superior beings because they got what everyone else wanted without letting fear stop them. And there's a certain element of truth to that because one of the things that does is stop many people from getting what they want. It's fear. Now you can conclude from that, that you should remove all fear and then do whatever it takes to get exactly what you want. But you can conclude from that. That fear is not necessarily sufficient justification for not trying to pursue the things that

Speaker 3:          00:57:03       you want. So coded interview data, one of these firms, it is them. One of the questions that people had responded to was to name someone they admired and why, and this was seven years ago in a disproportionate number of people said that they admired Ross Perot. Amazing they admired him is because essentially he seemed immune to social influence seem to uh, people said things like, I admire someone who stands up for what he believes in whether or not other people agree with them. Someone who that doesn't change his mind. Okay. Even when he's wrong, even when he might be wrong, someone who sticks with somebody about these gangsters seems to resonate with that sense that they seem immune to,

Speaker 4:          00:57:56       well sure there's a certain, there's a certain aspect of individualism to that, to that whole, like in the gangster Motif, it's criminal individualism, but it's still indicative of the capacity to stand up, up against group morality. And the thing is, there is an aspect to heroic behavior, so to speak, that requires the incorporation of the sorts of aggressive and defiant attitudes that, that in and of themselves characterize gangster behavior. Now though I would say that from the perspective of archetipal individual behavior on the positive side, incorporation of those aggressive aspects is necessary. But Darwin nation by the MS is counter productive. But that still doesn't mean, you know, if you're a little boy and you'd get beat up on the playground, you might say, well it's better to respond nonviolent. But really that's a mask for the fact that you had to swallow the defeat and couldn't respond violently if you wanted to. Now the appropriate response to that might be to develop the capacity to respond violently and effectively, but not to use it, which is, which is to say the absence of the capacity to respond harshly is no evidence for morality, which is, uh, which is

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       a point you tried to make over and over and over again. So if you can't be cruel, not being cruel is not moral, it's just, it's just your rationalization for an inability. And I think that argument's very powerful. So I know, I also think that's part of the reason why we're so drawn towards people who act out their darkest fantasies because they're doing something we would like to, but won't. That doesn't mean the thinker thinks should stop there. But say that Jesus' parable, parable of the gnostic gospels that you're talking about, the person acts, right? Right. That's exactly what it's referring to hold. There's this story that Christ is walking down the road on the sabbath and he sees a farmer in the ditch and he farmer sheep is falling into a hole and he's pulling the sheep out. Christ says to him, if you know what you're doing, do, you were blessed, but if you don't, you're transgressor of the law in your curves. Anyone just walking down the street is the same idea.

Speaker 3:          01:00:24       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:00:25       So the guy who was pulling out the sheep, if he's conscious, has come to terms with his capacity to violate social rules and this, using that to pass being then to pursue a higher order level of morality. That's one way of interpreting the other way of interpreting it, that he's just careless and acting and callous self interest in it. So it's the thing that's interesting about that as the same act. It's just intense differ.

Speaker 3:          01:00:51       How's that?

Speaker 1:          01:00:54       Yeah. You're not supposed to. No supposed to work on the Sabbath. Oh, sorry. Right, right. That's the, that's the, that's the law.

Speaker 3:          01:01:01       The moral law. Right. Flip it over and say, if you were completely ignorant of the law, then he wasn't coming and we're cleaning meditative act against the law.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       Well, the, the notion of being ignorant about the already doesn't enter into that particular parable. To me, if you're completely ignorant of the law and you break a rule, then you're in the situation of a child. And really just like children bring social norms all the time. People don't make any presumptions about their evil. And as a Jennifer rule, because they don't know the rule. So the assumption that he knew it was the sabbath, right? That's the assumption. The assumption is he knew it was the sound. Exactly. That he wasn't just acting like, I'm like remarkable ignorance. Okay. So let's, I'm gonna read another story and this is from soldier Knutsen and this has to do with the ideological version of authoritarianism. So Solzhenitsyn is lying with his friend Hannon railway car that's being set up to transport prisoners from one concentration camp to another or to a concentration camp to begin with. There's my friend Patton and I are lying on the middle shelf of a stolen and department and setting yourselves up comfortably. Tarp salt hearing in our pockets so that we don't need water and can go to sleep.

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       But at some station or other, they shoved into our compartment of Marxist scholar. We can tell this from his goatee and spectacles. He doesn't hide the fact. He's a former professor of the communist academy. We hang head down in the square cutout and from his very first words, we see that he is impenetrable. But we have been serving time for a very long time and we have a long time left to serve and we melt value. Uh, Mary joke, we must climb down to have a bit of fun. There's ample space left in the compartment and so we exchange places with someone in crowd in. Hello? Hello? You're not too crowded. No, it's all right. Have you been in the jug a long time? Long enough? Are you past the halfway mark? Just look over there. How poverty's tricking our villages, our straw thatch, crooked hats.

Speaker 4:          01:03:10       It's an inheritance from the czarist regime. Well, but we've already had 30 Soviet years. That's an insignificant period. Historically, it's terrible that the collective farmers are starving, but have you looked in all their ovens? Just ask any collective farmer NARC compartment. Well, everyone in jail is embittered in prejudiced, but I've seen collective farms myself. That means they were uncharacteristic. The goatee had never been in any of them that way. It was simpler. Just ask the old folks under the czar, they were well fed, well closed, and they used to have many holidays. I'm not even going to ask. It's a subjective trade of human memory to praise everything. In the past, the cow, the died is the one that gave twice the milk. Sometimes even cited proverbs and our people don't like holidays. They'd like to work. Why is there a shortage of brand in many cities when right before the war, for example, not true before the war, in fact, everything had been worked out, falling into precisely at the same trap he just described.

Speaker 4:          01:04:14       Listen, at that time in all the cities on the vogue of the recuse of thousands of people, well that was a local failure and supply, more likely your memory's failing you, but there's a shortage now, old wives tales, we have from seven to 8 billion bushels of grain. The grain is rotten, not so we have been successful in developing new varieties of grain and so forth. He's imperturbable. He speaks in the language which requires no effort of the mind and arguing with him is like walking through a desert, which is the emergence of some mythological imagery. By the way, it's about people like that that they say he made the rounds of all the blacksmiths and came home on shot and when they write in their obituaries perished tragically during the period of the stellar count. It should be corrected to read perished karmically. But if his faith had worked out differently, we would have never learned what a dry, insignificant little man he was who would respectfully read his name in the newspaper.

Speaker 4:          01:05:12       He would've become people's commissar or even venture to represent all Russia abroad. To argue with him was useless. It was much more interesting to play with him. Not a chess but at the game of comrades. There really is such a game. It's a very simple game. His play up, Tim a couple of times or so, use some of his pet words and phrases here like it for his. He has grown accustomed to find that all around them are enemies. He's become weary of snarling and doesn't like to tell his stories because all of them will be twisted around and thrown right back in his face. But if he takes you for one of his own, he will quite humanly disclosed to you what he is seen at the station. People are passing by, laughs, laughing, talking life goes on parties providing leadership. People are being moved from job to job, that's for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:05:59       Yet you and are languishing here in prison. There are only a handful of us and we must write and write petitions, begging a review of our cases, begging for a pardon or else he will tell you something interesting. In the Communist Academy, they decided to devour one comrade. They decided he wasn't quite genuine, not one of our own, but somehow they couldn't manage it. There were no errors in his essays and his biography was clean. Then all of a sudden going through the archives, what a fine. They ran across an old low brochure written by this comrade in which Vladimir Ilyich Lenin himself had held in his hands and in the margin of which he had written in his own handwriting. The notation as an economist, he is shit. Well now you understand. Our companion smelled confidentially, but after that it was no trouble at all to make short work of that model had an imposter. He was expelled from the academy and deprived of his scholarly rank. The railroad cars go clicking along. Everyone has already asleep. Some line down, some sitting up. Sometimes a convoy guard passes along the corridor yawning and one more unrecorded episode from Lennon's biography is lost from view.

Speaker 4:          01:07:14       I read, I read you that story because it is, it provides an interesting relationship between the adoption of a totalitarian position and the necessary consequence of that adoption, which is instantly the desire to torment and persecute anyone who doesn't belong to that particular tall attarian position. I would say, well, it's not just a matter of, um, the desire to protect the integrity of the totalitarian position. That's part of it. It's also the fact that adoption of the totalitarian position allows those who have adopted it to rationalize and justify their admitted desires to take revenge on the world. And I would say, well, why do they want to take revenge on the world and the revenge on the world in the form of other people? Why would you want to take revenge on the world? It's because from your perspective, the world has tortured you unjustly and unfairly. And under those circumstances,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       the only logical thing to do is to, in fact attempt to extract your revenge. Or we know already from looking at the myth of genesis and the kind of the story of the fall of the Buddha, that there's ample reason in the average human life. You don't have to have a pathological background to have had enough experiences to make it appear to you with, with, with, with a substantial amount of justification that the fundamental conditions of life are sufficiently unfair. So that the logical thing to do well being alive is to work for the destruction of life.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       When we're, I said that we were going to spend a fair amount of time trying to build up some representation of the personality that is being used in mythology to represent the evil. And it's kind of complicated because it isn't some, it isn't something that you can just list asset as a set of fixed attributes. You have to get an idea of the dynamic nature of the process. And, uh, while I'm trying to do that by telling you some different stories that hopefully fit into a pattern, but I also want to outline some of the things that seem

Speaker 6:          01:09:20       what you said earlier in the lecture is that, um, and you said this last section that human, that humans see more danger in the unknown that they, because of their cognition, but what it seems to me, what you just said right now is that their cognition isn't necessarily made the end on a more potent, but that it attributes no tomorrow kinds of things and the danger to more kinds of things. And so this, this guy or people in that veteran a to talk to [inaudible] um, uh, regime, whatever it can see the unknown and more kinds of things, the abstract it to other things rather than necessarily things be more potent or I would say that it's also the case

Speaker 1:          01:09:58       does it, you can see it we're animals wouldn't see merely by party because you can switch frames of reference and something that's known and one in one frame of reference is unknown in another. And you can also imagine there's ways where things that seem comfortable at the moment might indicate some potential danger in the future, which is what you do when you worry. And when you worry, basically you're somewhere safe. I mean, as a general rule, it's not always the case. I mean, if you're somewhere unsafe, then you're afraid of that and that's what we're worried you usually you're in a, you know, in your living room chair, whatever. And you were attributing emergence's of the unknown to all sorts of potentialities and perhaps trying to problem solve at the same time.

Speaker 6:          01:10:36       What is, what is unfair and unjust?

Speaker 1:          01:10:40       Well, I would say a unpredictable, that would be one aspect of it because you can't learn to avoid something that's unpredictable. And also, um, like I think we tend to regard a punishment as just if it's only sufficient to eradicate the behavior that preceded it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:58       So for example, I mean we just, we strive towards that in the criminal justice system, right? That's what it means. That the punishment should fit the crime. Well, first of all, I think is that there should be a crime. And often we seem to be punished. And despite the fact that there's no evidence of crime, and it also should be that the, the punishment is the right match for the crime. And that's, it's hard to understand what that might mean. But if you look at how you treat, we'll say a dog or that you're trying to train him to not do something, if it pees on your rug for example, there might be a punishment that you would consider sufficiently matched to that act so that it might be regarded by the dog is just so, um, like a swat on the behind with the newspaper rather than, you know, being beat half to death with a stick, for example. So the source of the sense of appropriateness. Well, wow, that's a good question. I don't, I don't exactly know how that's worked out. I think a lot of it's trial and error.

Speaker 1:          01:12:01       I can't really say much more about data at the moment. I mean it's partly looked like if say you're dealing, I see this with my children. The question is how do you, how do you, cause you, you, you have to use, I think you have to use a negative feedback as well as positive feedback to set borders around children. And then the question is, well where does the notion of what constitute just punishment come from and not sort of interaction? Well, you have to experiment with people in a sense to determine the nature of their temperament. Because for some people, for my daughter, for example, if I point my finger at her and say no, she's doing something that she shouldn't do, she'll stop. Whereas if I do that with my son, well that's just irrelevant. I mean that that level of punishment is completely negligible.

Speaker 1:          01:12:50       So for him, what constitutes a just punishment? As far as I can tell, it's something that's like higher up in intensity than it is for my daughter. And that's probably a matter of temperament. So, well that's possible. He's also younger than her, you know, but yeah, that is more sensitive to punishment and they sell in the younger one. Yeah, we have like my family here, I would be the oldest and I was like people being mad at me. That was an, yeah. Yeah. Next Sibling, Dallas Wild One. You know here, here's another example. In English common law, you have the, you have the right to use reasonable force to protect yourself against violation of your rights by an intruder, which basically means that if someone breaks into your house and you have a 45 revolver, you can't shoot them without saying stop. I mean it's a little more complex than that, but the point is is that you have to, you have to use the minimum amount of force that's necessary to stop the thing that shouldn't be happening. And I think that's a, like that's a critical aspect of justice along with the notion of predictability. I think those are the two. Those are the two poles of justice as far as I'm concerned. Okay. So anyways, what we're trying to do is to figure out what his personality is characterized by. It's complex because there's a feedback problem though. I would say like why is it, see if I can get the argument down. Pat Say

Speaker 1:          01:14:24       the personality of evil is characterized by a tendency to deny error, so a totalitarian personality is someone who can admit to being wrong and I would say, well that's equivalent to not being able to deny the existence of this information. Because when you say I wasn't wrong, what you're saying is that the information that I've received, which indicates that there's a flaw in my argument actually doesn't exist. There is no such flop, but she, he might reinterpret the information or you might readjust your fear, totality gelateria and idea to some degree to shut the ideo or effectively or whatever. But it's, I guess what I'm saying is that refusal to admit to error is exactly the same thing as a denial of anomalous information and I think that's why where why one of the hallmark attributes of the devil in classical mythology is pride because that's what pride is.

Speaker 1:          01:15:20       Pride is the statement on it's more than that. It's normally the state that I never make a mistake, which is the, for me, there's no anomalous information. That's also the statement for me. There is no anomalous information, isn't the statement for me. There's no one that's Florida territory and the statement that for me, there's no unexplored territory. It's exactly equivalent to the presumption of personal omniscience. It's the same thing. If there's no unknown, I know everything. Well, Milton story, that's, that's the, that's the story of Satan's fall as the description, mythological description of a pattern of behavior just characterized by implicit adoption, loss, explicit, and that story explicit. A dog should have a missed him. So we're saying, well, what does that mean? Well, it, it, it instantly involves these other things. Pride,

Speaker 3:          01:16:08       arrogance, totalitarianism. Now you might say that

Speaker 1:          01:16:18       follower of a creed rather than the origin nater of a creed isn't someone who's presuming personal omniscience. What I would say, well, they're even more corrupt than the actual leader because they say, well, he's the boss. He's gone. I'll do everything he tells me. So they're actually, they're actually eliminating there. At least the person who establishes the dog dogma, like Hitler for example, is taking a personal part in the construction of the theory. Someone who follows Hitler has completely abrogated any personal responsibility for making any moral judgements whatsoever to the leader. So I think actually the followers are more pathological than the leader. But that's, that's, I think that's true. So these are, these things all make a complex, which is one of these natural categories as far as I can tell. And the question, well, what are they lead to? Well, I would say that the reason that there's a negative here and a negative here is because these two processes feedback onto one another, which is to say, remember, all you have said that we had a set, it wasn't on a lonely age that made systems decrepit.

Speaker 1:          01:17:23       It was the sins of men. So then the question is, well, what does it mean? It was the sense of men. You have to ask, what does sin mean? Basically from the mythological perspective. And that gets you into a discussion of the question of evil. And I would say, well the thing that underlies evil most fundamentally is the process of the denial of anomalous information, which is to say that you have a theory kind, a piece of evidence pops up, which according to your own criteria for truth, because you set that as well, indicates that your theory is actually wrong. It's not. It doesn't have to be objective back of any sort. It's by your own criteria. Some things popped up that indicates that you're wrong and you say, well no, that thing doesn't exist and you can say that lots of ways. You can just see Freud thought you had to actively repress information, anomalous or traumatic information, but that's not right.

Speaker 1:          01:18:16       You don't have to actively repress it because it's a sin of omission and not a sin of commission. Because if a piece of novel information comes up and you do nothing about it, then you haven't processed it. Right. It's to, to take into account a piece of global information means that you have to explore the thing that's normal, draw the necessary behavioral conclusions and update your scheme of representation. So it isn't as if when something novel pops up and you admit to its existence automatically the way you think is made proper, it's that to actually process something normal, you have to go through a tremendous amount of work. Some of the work which actually involved one of these sense and resurrection, so to speak, that we talked about. So if you're

Speaker 3:          01:19:02       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:19:04       finish the argument here in a sec. Uh, so we have, we have a sin as to the Nile of anomaly, but we have original sin already is curiosity,

Speaker 3:          01:19:12       which is precisely the opposite. Hmm. Okay. Let me see if it's more than of curiosity. It's the desire to be on a status. It's also dial. I guess

Speaker 1:          01:19:35       we expressed it as curiosity here last week. Yeah. You also mentioned last week if there was it. There was a paradoxical aspect to that because the gnostics for example regarding the serpent tempted, Adam and Eve has a higher order day than the god that had created things to begin with. And that was a heretical position from the perspective of the sec that developed into the standard Christian Church. But it's also the case that even in Catholicism in the mini and medieval era, original sin was regarded as a fortunate sin because it was a precondition the for the drama of the passion. So you could say, well original sin was regarded as a precursor of evil because it was curiosity that knocked Adam and eve out of paradise. And also the took the boot outside of the walled city that his father had set up. So from that perspective it's very negative, which is to say that it's curiosity and that brings a nominalist information to into an otherwise stable system.

Speaker 1:          01:20:31       But from another perspective, which is broader, I think you might regard it as a fortunate proclivity. So I think it depends on your, on your temporal frame of reference. And I don't think, I think that's a kind of a standard. I think that's a reasonable interpretation. It's something we'll return to actually in the last lecture of this course because there's a myth that young pulled out from England that actually addresses that point directly. It's just a paragraph long, but it describes, well it tries to put original sin into the context of the whole, the whole story of redemption, which isn't just Christian, it's just the story, you know, a stable preexistence state deterioration into a state of chaos and then a regeneration on a more integrated playing original sin. Original sin is a portrait and necessarily a problem. Sure. I mean if you look at it from the perspective of being in chaos, so we say you're in chaos.

Speaker 1:          01:21:22       You say, well, what got me here? Well, if I were to just shut up and not bothered going down that path, that my curiosity drove me down, then I'd still be, you know, sitting comfortably ensconced at home. I wouldn't be in this horrible stew of emotional wretchedness that I'm in, which is, and I think you know, if you think about that story read large, the notion is, you know, if we wouldn't have developed this cortical cap that allows us the ability to manipulate abstract bits of information had never become self conscious at all. We would have been in a, in a paradise light position like the animals who are in a sense beyond good and evil. Now, Voltaire said, well not, I included Voltaire's little commentary on that line of logic and he said, well, what's the, I know more succinctly putting this, I don't remember who said this, it's better to be an unhappy philosopher than a happy paying that sort of nest. You can also think of that as a form of pride anyways. Of course the ultimate attainment is to be an unhappy pain anyways. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:22:32       Have you not considered modifying your vocabulary since the meeting of your vocabulary in this climate is it takes on the meaning of that which would have been taught the representative of the church where it's where the devil will be used to. Describe the stranger and evil will be used to describe things that go against the car and moral code?

Speaker 1:          01:22:55       Well, I don't have, I not considered one to five my terminology because because of that likelihood, I mean

Speaker 3:          01:23:03       are you not concerned? It causes so

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       much confusion to use, to use the, to use a word that has been used both as the, uh, denial of anomalous information and also the generation of new information depending on the perspective of the person who sets you apart, like are taking a very sophisticated use of the word devil. Yes. Well, hopefully your readers haven't, don't have, you're a sophisticated use of the word devil. The devil is the devil because in your shoulder and mercy from God whispers bad things in the area, which is what you know, and it tells you, it tells you that you should break away from the long curved.

Speaker 1:          01:23:45       Right. But that's all. But that's also the case, like for example, in this parallel, but you brought up again, I mean depending on the, okay, so there's a guy in the ditch, he's taking a sheep out of the whole, well, the reason that he's doing it determines the morality of the action, not the fact of the action. So the problem is is that it is the case upon occasion that the thing that tempts you away from group identification is not the positive exploratory spirit. Like, okay. I would say there are two consequences. There are two political consequences to the refusal to admit to anomalous information. And one is the construction of a totalitarian state, either as something that defines your personality or as something that defines your whole culture, depending on how pervasive that particular pattern of action is. And that's the one I'm kind of most interested in because it's being totalitarian and fascist states that, at least in the 20th century appeared and I've done the most damage.

Speaker 1:          01:24:42       But there's also another form of political disintegration that that might be more clearly classified as decadence and decadence, is the refusal to adhere to a, to a traditional morality to begin with, justified by arguments such as well that's all archaic and useless information to anyhow and free spirits such as myself, which means I'm disciplined and useless creatures in their totality or actually the kind of heroes who are going to transform the world. So I would say that for people who are following the roof to decadence, so to speak, when the devil talks, he says, uh, cultural rules are all tyrannical and nonsense. So the problem is, is it the, the interpretation of the process is entirely context dependent and you can't, you can't make it simple for that fact because the same act in two different consequences can have two completely different moral advances. Nisha said at one point, you know, if you're, if you're out in the front of your group, the first thing you should make sure of is that you're not running away.

Speaker 1:          01:25:47       Like you're thinking, Hey, I'm going out here in front. I am leading. But the truth of the matter is you might no be meeting at all. You might just be running away as fast as you can and using the idea of your leadership to justify the fact that you just can't cut it. And like a lot of what passes for counter cultural creativity and revolutionary thinking is not at all that heroic Willem wave from the confines of group identification, but pure lack of disciplined, a pure lack of discipline masquerading as heroin. And it's just as dangerous as fascist I think. And it's also a precursor to fascism because if you get a society that sufficiently disordered, what that will produce is a tremendous desire for the establishment of a rigid, rigid structure. So anyways, is that, does that, uh, well I think that was just saying perhaps the devil bagels is writing about, it's not the same.

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       Definitely the cheer writing. Well you the, yeah, I think that's true, but the, the only way I can think of it is the same in a way. The question, and I think it is, or the issue is to develop a sufficiently delineated notion of what constitutes evil. So that we can see the difference between the things that are just normally classified into that domain in the things that should be classified into the dome. So, so symbol, it operates on many levels to make sure you're talking about which level you're referring to it on theirs. It's hard to say. It's hard to say. We also, you could have been referred to it since the whole, since what you're doing is this is the whole mythology of the devil. Well, you know, saw you run into a problem like this, we know familiar and is portable. Them see you're reading your demo is from paradise lost, which is a different depth.

Speaker 1:          01:27:39       I never read paradise. I grew up with the devil, which isn't the same devil once your done reading very different. Right, right. You're a devil is like, um, is like the Godfather, you know? But well, I would say, I would say it is the, it is the case that what Milton do did was attempt to codify what he saw as the fundamental traditions of the devil and Christian and True Christian mythology that had be, and it'd be gathered up to that point. It's like, here's an example. Look, we know familiarity, that it's a natural tendency, so to speak, to assimilate the forerunner to the dragon of chaos, right? Is that it's not even an assimilation. It's a natural tendency of people to be unable to distinguish the 400 from the dragon of chaos. Well, we know that dragon imagery plays a large part in our mythology of evil.

Speaker 1:          01:28:29       So it's very, it's very easy for us to contaminate up our notion of, you know, the serpentine aspect of evil with the foreigner. What I'm trying to do is to say, well, look there, there are some things that we tend naturally to regard as evil because they're negatively valence, that that are only tangentially in situationally associated with evil. But there is one thing at the core which is a process that that is actually right at the basis of the evil. Oh and I'm, I'm trying to build up a map of what that, of what that her a personality characterized by that process with me. Sorry. I said, well the first thing is, is that the totalitarian personality rejects any notion of the possibility of personal layer. Now people sometimes hide from themselves when they're doing by saying, well, it isn't that I'm personally omnicell and it's that I'm an adherence say of Communist ideology and it's Communist ideology.

Speaker 1:          01:29:24       That's absolutely right. And I just happened to believe it. But I think that's just rationalization is you get all of the advantages of being on this yet without any of the, without any of the disadvantages. So it's really, it's really, really powerful. So you can see how arrogance is relating to that without any problem. But there's also the notion of this act is there's an underlying notion there of the sacrifice of the hero, which is also implicit in the whole notion of the rejection of the anomalous information. Cause we said already that the positive aspect of the individual is the aspect that voluntarily admits to the presence of anomalous information and then modifies worldview, either his coworkers or the whole society as a consequence of that contact with no. So there's recognition of the uncomfortable fact, then exploration of the fact then generation of an adaptive structure to deal with the fact and then communication of that adaptive structure out into this social community.

Speaker 1:          01:30:20       And that's the hero of pattern. Well if you don't do that, if you do the opposite, then that's tantamount to rejecting that whole process. So I would say that someone who refuses to admit to the possibility of personal error also sacrifices their identity with the heroic aspect of the individual. That's also a necessary consequence. And then you say, well what are the consequences of that? Well, the consequences, they're simple. First of all, there's only two ways of protecting yourself against the unknown. One is by directing group identification. And the other is by identifying with the process that makes sense of the unknown. And most people do both. And that's perfectly reasonable costs, right? We had doctor, our group identifications, and then we try to make sense of those things that are anomalous that happened to us personally. So that's a nice balance. So you can either identify with the hero, so to speak, or you can identify with the group.

Speaker 1:          01:31:14       If you forsake your identification with the hero voluntarily, which is to say that you say there is no such thing as anomalous information, then the only thing that you've got left to protect yourself with his identification with the group, and that makes the likelihood that you'll identify rigidly with the group much, much higher because you don't have an alternative anymore. So like if you know that you can cope, then if someone comes along, well, let's take a look at this in terms of personal relationships. Like let's say you, because I have a personal relationship, can adopt to totalitarian, uh, can adopt the totalitarian mode with no problem. Let's say you're extremely dependent on the person that you're associating with and, uh, someone threatened stuff person. Well, you're going to get extraordinarily upset about this because you've sacrificed your own ability to deal with that known through your dependency.

Speaker 1:          01:32:11       So you're much more likely to need the person that you're with than would otherwise be the case. In fact, you're going to be so dependent on them that you're going to use all sorts of vicious underground tricks to ensure that they don't abandon you. But anyways, the point is is that if you eliminate this as a possibility, basically the, the theory runs like this, you draw the conclusion that the negative aspect of the unknown is so terrible that there's no possible way it can be dealt with. Which is to say you're making the presupposition that life is too terrible to bear. As a consequence, you eliminate your identification with the positive aspect of that, of the individual. That makes you much more likely to adopt tie, ironical identification with the patriarchal structure. Cause you've, you don't have a process that you can actually engage in contacting.

Speaker 5:          01:32:59       Yeah, I know. So

Speaker 1:          01:33:02       it's also the case that is, Yep. Yep.

Speaker 5:          01:33:07       Is the opposite of work. What goes to the negatives there was if you rejected them, occasional group and only would be your role.

Speaker 1:          01:33:16       The opposite of, oh well I would say, hmm. No, I would say [inaudible] is a consequence of viewing the tyrannical ass of viewing society is only tyrannical and seeing that as even more of a danger than the negative aspect of the unknown because it has a positive aspect too. So I say in both cases, decadence or fascism, there's, it's still characterized by, by the elimination of identification with the hero. The hero is the opposite. True possible, which is elimination of identification with a group. Oh yes. Oh yes. I see. On that level. That would be decadence. Yeah. Then that would be bad. Yeah. If it's motivated, if it's actually motivated by the inability to put up with any discipline because the problem with like group identification has a cost. I mean you have to follow the rules and that's hard. Now for some people, the threat of following the rules is more to be feared than the threat of the unknown.

Speaker 1:          01:34:16       Especially given like if you're a decadent, so to speak, you get to revel in all the positive aspects of chaos as well. So you get to, you know, maybe you have an ex exceptionally promiscuous lifestyle and you use all the mood altering drugs you can get your hands on and, and you live for the pleasurable moment. So I mean there's lots of positive aspects to chaos, right? And that are hidden from you by the necessity of identifying with the group. So it doesn't, the thing that deck the decadence takes place in a, in a highly developed societies so that you can sort of take for granted all the politics society has given you. And that's why you're getting the positive out of the unknown because you're just sort of thing you're denying it. You have to follow the rules, but at the same time, wrestling on all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:35:01       Absolutely. It's a short, of course that's exactly the cakes is that you're protected by the thing you despise despite the fact that you despise it. It's so powerful that it can bear you along while you're doing everything you can to undermine it. Sure. That happens all the time. You know, Nisha said at one point, I mean this is the kind of statement that can be easily interpreted as fascist and you know, need, she gets interpreted that way now. And then he said the strength of a society can be measured by the number of parasites that it can bear. But he, what he hit the point he was making was that the point you're making.

Speaker 2:          01:35:35       So although, you know, you can see how taking out the context that that statement perhaps well can be viewed as support for an exceptionally powerful right wing position.

Speaker 1:          01:35:47       Okay. So, but you know, I'm not getting at it yet exactly what I want to get at. So we have a personality. It's characterized by all these necessary consequences. There's no anomaly that's equivalent to saying, I know everything, uh, identity identification with the group is also equivalent to rejection of the heroic. But the other thing is, is that right?

Speaker 2:          01:36:16       That's the motive that I really want to get at.

Speaker 1:          01:36:25       The idea I guess is that the development of self consciousness, which means knowledge of mortality, um, heightens the negative valence of the unknown to such a degree where it's easy to draw the logical conclusion that life is such an unfair process than it should be brought to an end. And I wanted to read you a quote from, from Girtha mean characterizes Mephistopheles,

Speaker 2:          01:36:52       uh,

Speaker 1:          01:36:57       Mephistopheles central thesis. So mephistopheles means Prince of lies and alive. So that's another attribute of the classical devil. And of course the lie is that anomalous information that upsets your particular system of belief doesn't exist. That's what characterizes and lie. Anyways, Mephistopheles has an express credo and it goes something like this. The spirit I that endlessly denies and rightly too, for all that comes to birth is fit for overthrow as nothing worth wherefore the world. We're better sterilized. That's all that's here is evil recognized his gain to me and downfall runes sin, the very element type prosper in. And guess that repeats that philosophy in part two of files. T says this is memphis softly speaking again, gone to share, nothing passed with no made one. What manages our creative, endless toil. When Adis snatch oblivion ends the coil. That's the question that's posed in genesis.

Speaker 1:          01:37:59       It is by gone. How shall this riddle run? As good as if things never had begun yet circleback existence to possess. I'd rather have eternal emptiness. So mephistopheles credo is basically that the evidence implies that the conditions of existence are sufficiently unfair in and of themselves, such that it would be better if nothing existed at all. And I would say that's that conclusion is, well, first of all, it to conclusion that people draw from time to time on the basis of the evidence that exists. But I would also say that if you abandon your identification with the process that makes order out of chaos, that's the conclusion that you necessarily have to draw as a consequence of the nature of your experience. Because if you eliminate from your life all those things that are positive, which occur as a consequence of your voluntary tendency to move out into the world, all that you'll be left with necessarily is constantly evidence of the existence of unwarranted pain and suffering.

Speaker 1:          01:39:01       And under those conditions, the only logical conclusion to draw is that any state of existence that is characterized by constant in one unwarranted pain and suffering obviously deserves to be youth and angst eradicated. And I think that's the motive that underlies the acts of genocide that accompany totalitarian thinking. But here's an example. There's recent biography of Stellan published. I've only read a review of it. Two books actually I want to pick up that have been written very recently. They are very relevant to this course and that's one of them based on archive material. Well, the biographer reveals that still in this sort of person that we've been describing. I mean he was an extraordinary and cruel person, rigid totalitarian, paranoid. Well, what was his plan? This biography thinks there's a good possibility that he was murdered, which is a good thing by all appearances. Um, it looks like what stolen was doing pr prior to his demise was, well, he like his, his acts of evil had escalated in magnitude over the course of the years that he was in power.

Speaker 1:          01:40:04       And as he got more and more powerful, that domain of visibility to put his evil fantasies into action increased this burger for claims that Stellan near in the years that led up to his death was in facts planning to start a nuclear war with the West. And that all of the systematic acts of genocide that he had committed in the Soviet Union might be regarded as trial runs, which I would think of as practice. You know, the first person is hard to kill, but once you kill one person, one of the second person isn't so hard to kill him. And once you get to, well it's not so hard to wipe out 20 and maybe once you're pretty good at that, a thousand doesn't bother you anymore and then you can practice on a few million. And if that really doesn't distress you too much, well then there's always the possibility of blowing up the whole world.

Speaker 1:          01:40:47       And that's what motivated Stella. And I think, and I would also say that those of us who, who tend to think of people like Stellan and Hitler as entirely foreign entities haven't come to term with the sock terms, with the fact that there's a big chunk of our personality whose credo is precisely that have Mephistopheles, which is that the world and its conditions are so unfair in reality that the best thing we could possibly happen would be for all this to come to an end as rapidly as possible. And I would say that under normal conditions, we work out of this part of our personality and this part of our personality too. And generally it's a tossup which part gets the upper hand. So to the degree that this part gets the upper hand, which is pretty constant, the likelihood of a tear radical state increases in in magnitude.

Speaker 1:          01:41:35       And you might say, well, you know, that's a ridiculous argument because the actions of one individual don't have any relationship to the consequences at the level of any political maneuvering. But I would say we don't have the foggiest clue what causes things like the Holocaust. We don't know why the Cold War started. We certainly have no idea why it ended. And as far as I'm concerned, it's premature to conclude on the basis of hard evidence, ignorance and our inability to stop things like the Holocaust from occurring that we have no idea how the actions of the individual might be related to the development of genocide states. So I'm suggesting that they might be alive much more closely than people have been inclined to believe. And I'm also suggesting that part of the reason that people have been inclined to believe that they're not very closely aligned is well because well, partly because of the individual responsibility, the magnitude that individual responsibility that seems to imply

Speaker 2:          01:42:39       processes all the flies.

Speaker 1:          01:42:44       Absolutely. I mean I think you can even make a physiological argument to buttress that point, which is that

Speaker 1:          01:42:53       to the degree that you're engaged in a constant in the constant voluntary processing of anomalous information, your life is interesting and meaningful by definition. In fact, the circuitry that you activate when you're engaged in voluntary exploration, which is a consequence of admission of anomaly is in fact what we call meaning. And to the degree that you're engaged in a meaningful activity, you can put up with all the nasty preconditions of existence that make that sort of exploration possible. Which nature said if you have a, uh, why you can bear any how and basically what he meant by that visit. Despite the fact that life perhaps necessarily has terrible preconditions for it to exist at all, it might be rendered bearable and even positive if you would only participate in those things that you know to be correct. Well, it's a reasonable hypothesis. It's also what everyone, if

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       you could discover what it is that everyone would want, if they could really figure out what they wanted, that would be it. Because the story says if you pursue those things that you personally find most meaningful without deceiving yourself as to their content, what will happen is that you'll develop a mode of being that enables you to look on life as if it was a beneficial process. And that is what people want when they say something like, well, what is like given this terrible thing that's just happened to me? What could possibly be the meaning of my existence. Say Well, okay, I have your, I have almost all of your papers aren't. It was two of them that aren't mark and I'll have them ready on Friday.
