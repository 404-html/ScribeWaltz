Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This title I didn't really realize I'd be speaking to an audience that actually included witches and wizards. So yeah. Well probably I'll probably meet them in question period. That'd be my guess. So can you all hear me? One of you can hear me. How's that? That's better. Okay. Alright, good. Alright. So as you can plainly see, the title of this talk is dragon's divined parents, heroes in adversaries are complete cosmology of being sounds, dreadfully new age to me, but it's not,

Speaker 2:          00:00:46       um,

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       new age. People are very creative but they can't think critically, but I can think critically. So this is a creative theoretical enterprise, conjoined with the capacity to tell the difference between bad ideas and good ideas. And hopefully what I'm going to talk to you about are the greatest ideas that humanity has ever produced. There are also ideas that we're, we don't understand well and who's highest level of formal development. We risk forgetting because we're criticizing things that we, we invented as a species, but that we cannot understand rationally and we're predisposed to believe that ideas that we can't understand rationally have to be wrong. And sometimes that's true, but sometimes we're just not smart enough to understand them. So

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       I can give you an example of something that we're not really smart enough to understand. We're not really smart enough to understand why people would line up for four nights for 10 blocks to watch star wars, you know, I mean, they won't do that for a lecture and they wouldn't pay money. And so you know, the star wars for example, is naturally, it's naturally interesting and people just take that for granted. But the fact that people will line up to engage voluntary voluntarily in a ritual activity of that sort is a manifestation of something that's very deep in the human psyche that we do not comprehend. Well. So I'm going to talk to you about what I like to think of as the grammar of belief.

Speaker 2:          00:02:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:49       I got interested in this. Back in the mid eighties was driven mostly by an interest in global that was ideologically

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       motivated and also atrocity warfare was not so difficult to understand in some sense because you can map it onto animal territoriality. But atrocity in the service of videology is a whole different thing there. It's certainly clear that, for example, in World War II, when the Nazis had to make a choice perhaps between winning the war and accelerating the rate at which they were killing Jews, they chose the latter and it's very difficult to understand that using a model based on animal territory quality.

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       I started reading about belief systems widely

Speaker 2:          00:03:42       in

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       in political writings and economic writings and religious writings. The psychological writings, anywhere I could find a thread that I thought was promising. I read a lot of young. I read a lot of Freud, almost all of the great clinical psychologists, a lot of soldier units and a lot of George Orwell, they're all people, lot of Dostoevsky and niche. If they're all people who, as far as I can tell, have something very original to say

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       and out of that

Speaker 1:          00:04:18       are you learned to understand why people need belief, why it's actually inevitable. Why faith and faith is inevitable. Faith is inevitable in part because your knowledge is finite and so you have to take some things for granted or you fall into an infinite regress and what maybe constituted the difference between pathological belief and non pathological belief. And those are terms by the way, which I think can be defined technically, which is a statement that runs contrary to the presuppositions, say of moral relativism. I'm definitely not a moral relativist. Um, I think it constitutes A. I think the motivation for moral relativism fundamentally is the desire to abdicate responsibility even though you can make very strong intellectual cases for, for why moral relativism is correct. The intellectual case and the actual motivation have nothing to do with one another. However, I've also found out something else which is quite interesting and I don't know how much I can touch on it tonight, but I don't think that Newton and Darwin are commensurate.

Speaker 1:          00:05:27       I think that most modern people are newtonians not Darwinians. And I think that you can understand the grammar of belief, which is religious in nature using Darwinian principles, but it means that you have to give up your Newtonian presuppositions. And so I think I can make that argument implicitly with what I'm doing as I progressed tonight. So the first thing I'm going to tell you is that it's necessary for you to look at the world through a limited frame of on. The reason for that is you're not very smart. Your consciousness can only handle about four bits of information per second. It's not very much given that the number of bits of information coming at you from next year and world are for all practical purposes, infinite. You're like eldest Huxley suggested your brain seemed to be primarily a reducing agent. Your body's a reducing agent as well because there are lots of things that you just can't detect and then the room that you're sitting in is a reducing agent because it's keeping all sorts of things out that you would otherwise have to deal with. And the stability of this city as a reducing agent. Because we're not going to be stampeded by barbarians with any luck at every moment or any moment. We. We deal with the complexity of the world in part by inhabiting a sequence of reducing structures until the world is reduced enough so that we can actually deal with the minute elements of it that we can comprehend at any one moment and those elements we comprehend

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       are not the familiar objects of objective reality. In fact, animals and people included are much interested in objective reality. We're interested in pragmatic reality and pragmatic reality is the reality that you act on, not that you perceive and because we're embedded in bodies and because we are biological organisms and because we're concerned with survival and reproduction among other things, how to act is a much more important, much more important question for us then what is the world constituted of how to act in some senses? Also the Prime Darwinian question, right? Because if you act wrongly from a Darwinian perspective, you end up dead before you can reproduce. So darwinism is a pragmatic theory. In fact, the has eat the American pragmatists on the North American east coast recognize that very short period of time after Darwin studies were published. They recognize the connection between pragmatism as a theory and Darwinian theory instantaneously, so the world that we inhabit, given that we're alive and given what's selected, selected us to act is actually a pragmatic world, and the objects of pragmatic worlds aren't objects. There are tools and obstacles and they have valence, a priority there. They have value, a priority from the Newtonian perspective. You look at the world

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       and then you think about the world that you see the objects of the world that you see and then you evaluate them and then you act, and that is not how your brain, it's just wrong. You might see the value of things before you see the object itself. I mean there are people, for example, who are blind. They have blind sight. They can recognize emotions on faces without knowing. They can see, so that's partly because their retinas are attached to the Amygdala. Your retina is attached to a lot of your body, not just your visual cortex. It's attached to your spinal cord. It's attached to your nervous system at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously and so you can use your eyes to detect things that you don't know you're seeing so and what is in some sense, what you often detect under those circumstances is valence value, so you're very good. For example, at detecting teeth and predatory eyes and the reasons for that are self evident. Fundamentally,

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       this is the smallest unit of meaning that makes up a referential frame. I think it has three elements, one of which links the mind to the body. Actually the mind body problem isn't that difficult to solve if once you take a pragmatic, once you look at how the brain works from a pragmatic perspective because then your consciousness is fundamentally something that's grounded in action and you can understand the transition between consciousness and action as a sequence of of analysis that are increasingly action oriented. I'll talk to you about that a little bit later, but the basic framework is something like this and you're always looking at the world through this framework and the framework has as one pole, where are you are and what you're doing, where you are now, so that's quite a. you're always trying to get from point a to point b because you're a linear creature and your embodied so you're moving and so fundamentally what you're looking at the world through is a sequence of maps and maps tell you how to get to where you want to go and so the map specifies where you are because obviously you can't get anywhere if you don't know where you are.

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       And many people of course are confused about where they are so they don't get anywhere and you also have to know where you're going and that's point a and point b and every time you look at the world, you're looking through a framework that has those two valued points. Implicit in your cognitive structure and generally what you think is where you're going is better than where you are. Because otherwise, why would you go there? Now, some people do choose to go to places that are worse than where they are, but they're a special case. You probably live with some of them.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       Now when you're going from point a to point B, fundamentally you have to move. Now, movement is not abstract. Movement is what you do with your body, and so once your abstract representation transforms itself into action, you're no longer in the realm of abstraction. So in order to get from one place to another, you have to know where you are and you have to know where you're going and then you have walk, fly, run role. You have to perform some sort of embodied action to get there and of course you have conscious control over your voluntary muscular system, but underneath that you don't really have anything at all right? You can move your arm, you have no idea what muscles you're moving. So your conscious representation of your body grounds out basically at voluntary movement of the larger muscle systems. So now you might ask, well, what does specify where you're going?

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       And the answer to that in large part is biology, but biology in a complex manner, and this is where higher order morality starts to become a concern. You share with other animals all the way down the phylogenetic chain, various forms of of implicit motivation. And you know you can kind of lump those. It's arbitrary. I lumped them into self maintenance motivations and self propagation motivations. You know, you can cut that in different ways. Like I said, it's more conceptual than than based on say know anatomy. But it'll do self maintenance. Well, you don't want to get too hot. You don't want to get too cold. Your hypothalamus deals with that very old part of the brain. It's way more important than your cortex. You can take the whole cortex off a female cat and as long as you keep it in a cage and it has its hypothalamus, it can pretty much behave like a cat except that it's hyper exploratory, which is the last thing you'd expect from an animal with no brain.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       You can't be too hard, you can't be too cold. You got to regulate your water intake. You have to eat, you have to deal with the consequences of eating, you have to be with other people. There's a place circuit, a specialized place circuit. There's a specialized erotic circuit, there's a specialized circuit for exploration, which is about half of what the hypothalamus does by the way. Um, and those, those systems, they've often been conceptualized as drives, but they're not really that. They're more like isolated one I'd personalities. They're like cyclops. They want one thing now they're not stupid, but they're not very amenable to argument. So when you're hungry and you're hungry and you know, another motivational system might object to that, but, and that happens frequently, which is partly why people are often confused and also why you need a cortex because you know, you need a cortex to allow the competing motivational systems to array themselves properly and harmoniously across time so that they all get their due instead of fighting like two year olds in a room because two year olds are basically hypothalamic, you know, and so there are lots of fun, but they're not organized and they're not social at all.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       So what happens with the motivational systems, very deep in your brain is they, they specify the value of where you are so that one of the values might be, um, I'm thirsty, and then they tune your perception so that things that are associated with the quenching of thirst are much more likely to be picked up by your system and they bias your perceptual processing and your evaluation towards the, towards improvement of that motivation, lack. And, and so you can't really think of them as drives because they're way more complicated than that. They specify where you are. So there's an element of self consciousness that's associated with that. I'm thirsty and they specify a target. Usually using fantasy. You know, you get thirsty, you think, well, what would I like to drink? And you get little fantasy about maybe a glass of juice or a bit of water or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       And then your nervous system is tuned in and you walk into the kitchen and you ignore everything that's irrelevant to the search for liquid. And you focus in on everything that's relevant to the search for liquid. And that means you're so blind, you cannot believe it. I mean, there's been many experiments now that have shown that you can do things like, I'm sure some of you have seen this, you can introduce, have gorilla into a basketball game and 60 or 70 percent of the people watching, as long as they're paying attention to the ball, they won't see the gorilla. And it's not like a little tiny gorilla that somewhere off in the corner, it's like main center, six feet high beating its chest. And even when you know that if something else changes in the background, you won't see that either. So as far as you guys know, that carpet could be changing colors 15, 20 times a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       You wouldn't even notice it unless you had some weird obsession with carpets. So, okay, so that's the beginning. And in some sense of a universal system of values. Right? And I can tell you how universal this is. I always have to tell this story because it's so damn funny. I just can't believe it. So one of the things that your brain is very concerned with his relative status. That's why you're doing, by the way, which is partly why relative poverty is often such a social problem. People hate me and low in status, especially men, old male status hierarchies a bit different than women and women are pretty sensitive to status too, but they use different markers anyways. Part what happens when your status goes up as your brain, serotonin levels go up and when your brain, serotonin levels go up, your last irritable and you and you experience less negative emotion per unit of uncertainty or threat, and so when you know when you demean someone and you interfere with and you lowered the presumed status as far as their very primordial circuit is concerned, you alter the system that regulates their emotions and they hate that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       People hate that more than anything and it's an unbelievably archaic circuit. You can kind of tell this because depressed people basically act like they're low status and depressed. People are depressed about everything now. It's not easy to be depressed about everything. Right? And so the fact that that's the case means that what's ever gone astray has to be very primordial because it affects everything anyways. People often use antidepressants to cure depression, hence their name. I'm and antidepressants decrease the rate at which Serotonin is taken back up by the neurons that produce it. Well, 300 million years ago, crustaceans emerged and crustaceans live in dominance hierarchies even though they're not particularly social. And if one lobster fights with another and gets defeated, then he won't fight with another lobster. Even when he beat for 20 minutes less, you give them antidepressants, in which case he'll fight again right away. The reason I'm telling you this is because the status structure that underlies your being not just your brain, but your being is is so old. You share it with crustaceans, so you mess with it at your peril. It's not learned by no means.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       So anyways, you wander around inside one of these little frames going from point a to point b all the time. And one of the annoying things about life, and this is sort of this is a story, is that as soon as you climb from point a to point b and you get there, then there's another point and another point b. and that's pretty interesting too, because one of the things that suggest is that getting somewhere isn't really what people want because as soon as you get somewhere, then you're done going there and then you have to get somewhere else. So in some sense it seems it's an accomplishment, another sense. It's just the next rock up the mountain. Now you all know this because you know, you graduated from university and that was a good day, but the next day you weren't a university student, you were some unemployed, loser, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       And so, and that's uh, you know, that sets up a whole new set of problems, right? I mean, that's how the frame shifts and when the frame shifts like that, then the value of everything shifts around it. So it turns out that people are actually more interested in getting from point a to point b, then they are in actually being at point b and almost all of the positive emotion that you feel, which is related to dopaminergic circuitry by the way you experienced in relationship to the pursuit of a value goal rather than to the attainment of the goal. The attainment of the goal actually satisfies you, or more specifically, it satisfies that motivational circuit, but then the damn thing just shuts off and another one starts yelling at you, so it's like a perverse form of victory. So one answer to that. That's universal in some senses that you should establish a relationship with a transcendent value because it never runs out of motivational power.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       You can see an example of that popular example in Popular Culture in the Pinocchio Movie, which are. How many of you have seen that? Yeah. Is anybody not seen it? Hm. That's amazing. Anyways, in the Pinocchio Movie, one of the things that happens is when Japan wishes that his son becomes a full developed individual instead of a damn puppet, this is a good thing for a parent to wish by the way he wishes upon a star and the star something of transcendent value. And so the meaning of that fundamentally is that if you want to raise your child to be an independent being, that you better set your sights on something transcended or it won't happen, and believe me, there's lots of times it doesn't happen. So part of the utility of a transcendent value is that never loses it's motivational effectiveness. Now you might say, well, that's no proof that there are transcendent values.

Speaker 1:          00:21:10       It's like, yeah, that's true. But there's more to the story. Okay, so when you're in one of these little stories, which is basically what they are, they're the simplest story. I was one place I went by this means to another place. That's the simplest story. It's not that exciting. Much more exciting story is I was going from point a to b and something weird happened and then I didn't know where I was and then I was like in chaos for, you know, two years. And then I figured out how to climb out of it. Everybody likes that story, right? That's a death and rebirth story by the way, or a fall from paradise story with a regaining of paradise at the end, you know, it's an archetypal story because everyone lives it. And so anyways, when you're in one of these little stories, frames of reference, what you see in front of you are really things that one of the best scientists, whoever studied visual perception, called the book's called ecological approach to visual perception.

Speaker 1:          00:22:12       He called them affordances. Affordance is something that affords you something and affordances can be positive or negative. I like to think about them as tools or obstacles. So for example, if I need to make a beeline for that door, you guys are all instantly obstacles. And the way I would respond to that implicitly is that you'd all be negative. So imagine we just said fire. Well you were people the minute before that, but the second after that, your obstacles and your emotional reactions to the people that are in front of you are going to reflect that. Now you all know that because you drive, you know, and once you're encapsulated in your little insectoid shell and don't have to deal with the immediate responses of other people, you're going to treat them like obstacles and like demonic obstacles at the drop of a hat. And you know, that's pretty much automatic behavior.

Speaker 1:          00:23:03       So tools are things that get you to where you want to go. And you remember, you know, human beings are tool using animals par exsalonce, right? We're so tool using that. That's what we see. It's built right into us. We're always scanning the world for tools. When you look at gravel, for example, what you actually see are throwing sized rocks. That's why they manifest themselves as that kind of object in the environment. You know you're built at a certain level of resolution and the way your nervous system parts parses up the world is into things that are useful for you and things that aren't. And those are not objects. The whole idea of object is a very, very modern derivative of that much more primordial system. And it's by no means clear at all that our notion of object is more real than the notion of affordance.

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       In fact, as far as your brain is concerned, objects, no one cares about objects. What your brain cares about is affordances and what your brain is adapted to is the world as a set of affordances, as obstacles. And if you're a Darwinian, it's very difficult to escape the conclusion that what selected you is reality, and so if the reality that selected you shaped you so that what you see are affordances and obstacles or you die, then it's perfectly real proposition, perfectly reasonable proposition to state that what reality is in fact is a set of affordances, tools and obstacles. And that is how your brain works. By the way, when you look at, say I look at that projector, maybe I'm thinking about picking it up. What happens is my eyes activate the part of my motor cortex that would adjust my hand to grip it like that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       And so part of what I understand as the projector is grippable object and that's not a secondary derivation. I don't see the object and then think this is how I would grip it. It's like that would take forever. You know, you'd never catch a baseball if that's what you were doing. It's like, oh, a round object is punk. You know? It's like, that's just not gonna work. You're really, your, your nervous system is nowhere fast enough to do that consciously. You're using reptile circuitry to catch baseball's the mammalian stuff is too damn slow. So you catch the ball often. Especially if someone pitches it fast before you could even see it. You just think you saw it. You see it after you caught it. The case with tennis players too, they went, they seem to do is judge where the ball's going to go by the angle of the racket because if they wait until the ball is off the racket, they can't move fast enough to hit it back.

Speaker 1:          00:25:36       They don't have the reflexes for it. So they can't move the neural messages fast enough to do it. Okay. So basically the world lays itself out as tools and obstacles and you know, obstacles make you feel bad. But like let's say I'm looking at this room and I'm thinking of you guys as obstacles. You might say, well how bad does that make me feel? And the answer to that is, well, not very bad because all I have to do is, you know, make a circuitous route and I can get to the door. So then the fact that your obstacles is a very minor impediment to the execution of my plant, and as a consequence, it will produce a correspondingly low level of negative emotion. So you can think of those of known unknowns in Rumsfeld's terms. No one unknowns aren't that big a problem because you can plan for them and you might have a plan that's an alternative plant that you can put in place in case they show up.

Speaker 1:          00:26:28       What people really don't like. Our unknown unknowns and unknown unknowns. You don't walk around those man, they blow your whole map and your maps quite complicated. It's actually hierarchical in structure. And I'll get to that because you know, you go from point a to point B so that you can go to a bigger point, a to point b, you know, you crossed the road to get to the library, to study for an exam, to pass the exam, to get your degree, to get a job, to be a person, to be a citizen, to be a, to have a good life. So then if someone gets in your way while you're crossing the road, then to some degree they're interfering with you getting a good life. Now, not very much, but sometimes you'll react like that. That certainly happens when you're dealing with an intimate partner, you know, because they'll make some little mistake and you'll say you always do that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       You're always, you've always done that. You always do it and you're always going to do it, which is really not a good way to conduct an argument. So unknown unknowns. Well, unknown, unknown unknowns, leap at you from places that you wouldn't expect because otherwise you would have planned for the damn things. So there are the things that are always poking their beak off at you when you least expect it. They're just like, say serpents in the garden of Eden. That might be one way of thinking about it. You can't keep the damn snakes out of the garden and that's because you can't make a bounded area and keep the complexity out of it. The complexity always sneaks back in. Try protecting your children from the Internet. For example. You can't make a bounded circumstance and get rid of all the complexity. It always comes sneaking back in. So what would be an unknown? Unknown. This is a good one. Here. You have an intimate relationship. You've had it for 10 years. You Trust your partner, so what does that mean? You know where you are, you know who you are and you have a pretty good idea of who of where you're going and then one day you find out that your partner has been cheating on you. Not with one person but with three people and for the whole 10 years. Well hypothetically, that comes as a shock. Although you may have ignored many intimations that such might be the case irrelevant. Let's say it comes as a shock. Well, what happens to you?

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       Well, you don't know where you are. You don't know where you've been. That's interesting gay because you think you know where you've been because you've already been there, but all of a sudden something can happen so that you are so flipped over that you don't even know where you were. So that means in some sense, the past is dependent on the present, a very peculiar thing. You also have no idea where you're going

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       in terms of not knowing where you are. That's Deep Bay because you might think, well, I thought it was in a marriage that turns out to be wrong. I thought I knew who my wife or husband was that turns out to be wrong. I concluded on the basis that I knew my wife, that I knew something about women that turned out to be wrong. I thought I was in a relationship with someone I could trust that is wrong. I don't know enough about trust. I'm obviously too gullible. And so what that does is throw virtually everything that's ever happened to me in severe doubt. Right? That's the emergence of chaos. And that's

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       yes, sometimes you're going from point a to point b and something you don't expect manifests itself in the middle of your plan. But it's not such a catastrophe because you can just work around it. And then sometimes something pops up and like you just do not have a plan anymore. And so then you might ask yourself just exactly where you are, you when you don't know where you are, and I would say that's a place and it's actually a place that's well documented in plastic, religious and mythological stories. That's chaos. The Dallas, for example, they believe that the world is made out of chaos and order order. That's where you are. When what you do gets you what you want, chaos. That's where you are. When you have no idea what's going on and you might ask, well, is there a way that you should act when you're in chaos?

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       And the answer to that is there better be because it's a place you're going to visit several times during your life and everyone visits that. That's why it's an archetypal story. That's the dissent to the underground. Underground is that horrible place that lurks underneath all of our presuppositions. It's the frigid lake underneath the thin ice that everybody's skating on and it's something that can manifest itself at any moment. That's partly why in the Dallas Assemble, the Black Paisley is chaos by the way, and the White Paisley is ordered in the order Paisley. There's a little black dot. Well, that's because order can turn into chaos and does at any moment, and the reverse is also true chaos. Paternity to order at any moment and insight will do that for you. You know, alcoholics report that when they hit bottom, it's like there's a capella system. They look at the world in a different way.

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       You know now there are a new person, they're back from the underground. They've risen from the dead, so to speak. You know, and it's partly because what looks like your right hemisphere is pretty good at inferring patterns in, in, in novel and chaotic places. It's kind of keeping track of things that happened to you that are anomalous and it makes alternative maps of the world that are there for you to rely on, at least to some degree if that ever becomes necessary. Or you might ask yourself, how upset should you be when something that you don't expect happens? Now? It turns out that that is really a difficult question to answer because what the problem is is that when something you don't expect happens, you don't know what it is, and so then he might say, well, how upset should you get an answer to that is you don't know, and so what happens is, first of all, you're. You've got some built in approximators. One would be your

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       genetically determined level of neuroticism, which is basically sensitivity to negative emotion. If you're more sensitive to negative emotion, you're going to manifest more psychophysiological preparation per unit of threat or uncertainty, which is to say some people get more upset about the same thing. Then other people do. Now who's right? Well who knows? You wake up in the morning and there's a little ache in your side. It's like, well, what is that is sore muscle or cancer? You don't know, and if you're hypochondriacal well, it's going to be cancer and sometimes the hypochondriac is right, and so he's the one that lives when he goes to the emergency room and finds out exactly what's going on. So it's an unanswerable question. Now, the other way that your brain determines how upset you should be is by calculating your position in the dominance hierarchy because the higher you are in the dominance hierarchy, the more resources you have at your disposal, and so the less upset you have to get with anything horrible happen, so if you're bad, you're barely clinging to the bottom of the social structure.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       You can be sure that your brain is going to estimate any anomalous occurrence as a catastrophe, which is why people don't like being at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy and it's also why people who were there die a lot sooner and they do. They die a lot sooner regardless of their absolute level of wealth. It's relative deprivation that counts. Okay, so here's a bit of a clue about how else your brain might calculate how upset you should be. Here's a little map of me when I'm doing something that I frequently do, which is to write a manuscript. So you might say, well, what are you doing when you're writing a manuscript? And that turns out to be a very complicated question. It's like, what are you doing when you read it? Read a book.

Speaker 2:          00:34:04       Well,

Speaker 1:          00:34:06       you're writing letters or typing them. You're typing words and phrases. You typing sentences, you're typing paragraphs, you're typing the structure that the paragraphs fit into. That would be the essay. Okay. Then you're me. Anyways, I'm practicing science because I usually write scientific manuscripts and that's part of embodying my pref professorial role and then that's part of hypothetically being a productive citizen, although some of you might differ with that, given that I'm a professor and then perhaps on outside of that or this is what I think is on outside of that is I'm confronting the unknown and you might say, well,

Speaker 1:          00:34:48       what are you really doing when you're writing a sentence and the answer to that is you're doing all of these things better or worse and if you're doing a really good job of writing a sentence, you're doing all of them at once and that would be one of the things that would make the sentence particularly meaningful. Now, if something anomalous occurs, well, let's say the tee on my typewriter gets stuck, well that's gonna irritate me because then I can't type a sentence now, it's not going to irritate me too much because you know, it doesn't really interfere with my ability to be a productive citizen. So I'm going to estimate the magnitude of how upset I should be when something unknown occurs by estimating where in the hierarchy of action that normally is disruptive. Okay, so let, let me run you through this again. So let's say what's a good person and you might think of that from an objective perspective, but that would be a mistake because our quality like good is a pragmatic quality and it's based on action not on object. So here's how you decompose being a good person. So

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       a good person is a good parent. More than that, that's a subcomponent right? And good parent is someone who has a job and takes care of their family and then the person who takes care of their family is like, they can play with the baby or they can complete a meal. These are abstract concepts. You can't tell a four year old make a meal and the reason you can't, just because they don't know the subordinate components of making a meal, you can say, see that fork. Hopefully they know what a fork is. See that fork? Yes, pick up that work and bring that forth to the table and put it there. They can do that because their nervous system is organized enough to operate at that level of abstraction, but they can't do something like make a meal, which is, you know, if you've got a three year old, you can't put them in their room and you say clean up your room.

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       He'll just look at you and then when they come back, when you come back in half an hour, they'll look at you again. You can say, hey kid, see that teddy bear? Yeah, pick up the teddy bear and put it on that space in the wall and then once you teach the three year old how to do 100 of those things and they got it, they've got a little motor routines. You can say, clean the room. You can encapsulate that entire set of motor routines within the higher order concept, so if you're being a good person, part of that is, well, maybe you're making a meal and part of that would be while you're cutting up the vegetables, but then things get interesting because when you're cutting up the vegetables, what you're actually doing is gripping something and moving and then that's no longer abstract, right? That's where your conceptual philosophical presuppositions like be a good person hit the roof, hit the hit the level of embodied material reality. That's the disillusion of the mind into the body. Now if someone says to you, you should cut those vegetables more thinly, that might irritate you, but if they say you're a bad parent, maybe observing the same phenomena, then you're going to get into a fight with them and so, and the reason for that is obviously if it's just a matter of cutting the vegetables thinner, oh, you have to do is make a minor modification in the hierarchy that constitutes yourself

Speaker 1:          00:38:04       representation or really yourself. It's not just a representation, but if you're not a good parent, it's like if that's true, you've got a lot of. You got a lot of repair work to do, a lot of your world is fallen apart and as soon as things fall apart, which they always do, you're in chaos and as soon as you're in chaos, then your body defaults to emergency preparation and you're stressed and if you're stressed long enough then you die, and so you don't like that stress. Say when your body gets stressed, what happens is because it doesn't really know what's going on, it prepares for everything. That's the generalized stress response. Cortisol production does that. Cortisol production is good. It wakes you up in the morning, but if it's chronic, you get old like it's so general and it's negative actions that the best way to conceptualize it's detrimental longterm effect is that it accelerates aging, so it makes you more likely to have heart disease and cancer and depression and Alzheimer's and diabetes and obesity. That'll do. It's enough. Any of those that are enough to kill you. All right, so there's a hierarchy. That's a hierarchy of values. The higher the value, the more the less you want to have it disrupted. Now

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       was it a psychologist named piaget? Some of you might know about him.

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       Piaget was very interested in what happens to value structures and their hierarchical organization once they have to apply outside of the confines of a body. So. So here's a way of thinking about it. Two year olds basically hypothalamic. That's why there's so much fun. First they're happy, they're sad, then they're hungry, then they're tired, you know, they just zipped from one pretty straightforward and rather are inspiring motivational state to another and but at two they can't play. They can play with by themselves, but they can't play with other children. They can't get that until they're three and they need to get it by the time they're three because if they don't get it by the time they're four, they will never get it. And then you have an antisocial kid who's going to be an outsider for his entire life and there isn't anything you can do about it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:21       So that has to happen between two and four. So what happens at about age three is that the kid learns how to play a game with another person and what that game is, it's fundamentally the development of the ability to share a frame of reference, which is what you're doing when you play monopoly. It's like it's stupid to play monopoly. Obviously, who cares if you have a whole pile of counterfeit paper, right? But doesn't matter because the way your constituted is that your brain will treat anything you act like constitutes a valuable goal as if it's a valid framework of reference. And if it couldn't do that, a you couldn't abstract and B, you could not get along with other people. So you can sit around the table and you can say, let's pretend that monopoly is a reasonable facsimile of reality, which you wouldn't say, but it's what you mean.

Speaker 1:          00:41:11       And everybody says yes, that would be a music. And so then you set your goal, which is to get all the little hotels and all the money and play with your emotions. Go along for the ride. And what's so interesting about that is you can get everybody into the game and so one of the things that's really interesting about people is that we can establish a shared fictional frame of reference and it organizes all our emotions. So they're predictable. That's also why we can watch movies. You go to a movie, you identify the hero, you figure out what the hero wants, truth, you're the hero. And the way that works is you don't look at the hero and think about what he's doing and evaluated emotionally and then feel it. What you do is you specify the hero's goal and then you map them onto your body and you read off the emotional responses of your own body.

Speaker 1:          00:41:59       And that's how you understand the hero. So it's an embodied, you're, you're using your, your embodiment as a computational device that can run simulations of other consciousnesses. And it does that with the body. And we like doing that. You can go to a movie and you know you're Brad Pitt for an hour and a half. You know, when you're Brad Pitt doing remarkable things. And that's also how we understand other people were very good at that. So anyways, we have these shared frames of reference like when we were playing monopoly, okay. So children at three learn how to play games and that means they learn how to organize their own internal motivational states into a hierarchy that includes the motivational states of other people. And that means they can play. And that's what you guys do when you're out in the world. Like we're playing a game right now.

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       We all know the rules. That's why we can all sit in this room and play the game without fighting with each other. You know, in the room is set up like a theater and we all know the theater game and so. And the chairs are always facing this way at the moment. And so that's a hint that you should look forward and this is raised so you know, the room is basically telling you what to do because it's a stage like all rooms. And because you're smart and socially conscious, you can walk into a stage, grew and your body knows what to do and if you're civilized in social, you just do it. Then all the other primates can predict what you're up to and they won't kill you.

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       Yeah, well that's what it means to be part of the same tribe. You know when people are very peculiar creatures and God only knows what they're up to, but as long as they're playing the same game you are. You don't have to know what they're up to because you can predict what they're going to do and you understand their motivational states and so part of the building and constructing of higher order motive, higher order moral goals, is the establishment of joint frames of reference that allow multiple people to pursue the goals that they're interested in simultaneously. And then what you have to think about with regards to that is that not all shared frames of reference can manage that. There's a small subset of them that are optimized so that not only can multiple people play them, but multiple people can play them and enjoy them. And do it repeatedly across a long period of time, so it's integratability that partly defines the utility of a higher order moral structure and that is not arbitrary.

Speaker 1:          00:44:23       It's an emergent property of biological interactions and you might say, well, it's kind of arbitrary because people can do what they want, but it's not arbitrary at all because a lot of what's constraining your games is your motivational substructure and those ancient circuits that are status oriented and they operate within virtually every animal has a status. Counter creatures organize themselves into dominance hierarchies. The reason they do that is because that works. It's a solution. It's a solution to the Darwinian problem of existence. It's not just an empathy phenomena. It's the real thing. So you, your environment, fundamentally a huge chunk of your environment is dominance hierarchy plus God only knows where you are and that's order and chaos. And part of the reason that people fight to preserve their dominance hierarchies is because it's better to be a slave. Who knows what the hell is going on than someone who's thrown screaming and naked into the jungle at night. And that's the difference between order and chaos, and we like order better than chaos and it's no wonder now we'll invite a little chaos in for entertainment now and then. But it has to be done voluntarily. And generally you don't want the kind of chaos that upsets your entire conceptual structure. You know, you're willing to fool around on the fringes a little bit, but you know when the going gets serious, you're pretty much likely to bail out and no wonder.

Speaker 1:          00:45:47       Now I wanted to tell you a little bit about this chaotic domain. I can tell you a couple of things about it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:55       It's the underworld of mythology. One of the things that's kind of interesting about the underworld is that it has a suburb and one of the suburbs of the underworld is hell and hell is the place where you end up when everything that you know falls apart and you get resentful and bitter about it. And that's very, like I. One of the things I've noticed in my work as a clinical psychologist, that there's two things that really do people in three lying. That's not good. Apart from that resentment and arrogance, if you get resentful enough, you end up like Elliot Rogers and all those other people who go on random shooting sprees because they have a disagreement about the structure of the exist of existence and the fact that they ended up hypothetically at the bottom of the heap, so those are real places and people get stuck in them and they are not places that you would voluntarily choose to go if you had any sense at all, and I'll tell you, if you read the accounts of the people who do random mass murder, they'll tell you exactly where they are and they'll tell you exactly what they're motivated to do and what they're motivated to do is take as much revenge on existence as they possibly could.

Speaker 1:          00:47:04       Imagine in the most unfair possible way, as fast as they can possibly manage it, and that's their conscious aim and he says, not a form of insanity. They know exactly what they're doing. They have a. They have a precise idea of what they're in the APP and it's a deep archetypal possession, for lack of a better word.

Speaker 2:          00:47:27       Now

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       I want to show you how some of these things are mapped symbolically. They're not really symbols in my estimation because assemble implies that something is being represented. You know that there's a reality behind the representation that's broader than the representation and assemble is just a shadow of it. These aren't symbols. Their representations that are as accurate as they can possibly be. I'll start with something that's rather easy to understand. Let's try. Yes. What happens when you look at her Medusa?

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       You turned to stone. What happens when your rabbit sees a wolf? That's right. It turns to stone. That's right. The Medusa is a symbol. It's a representation of all those things that make you turn to stone. When you look at them. Now, look, animals can deal with threat, right? They have instincts to deal with threat, but zebras, maybe there's a bunch of zebras and they're out there and heard and there's a bunch of lines and they're right there, and the zebras, what are they doing? They're grazing and you think, wow, those zebras aren't very bright because there's a bunch of lions, like, why aren't they, you know, in the forest building a Fort Pete Lyons out, but they, the reason they're not doing that is because although they can react to threat, they cannot conceive to the of the class of threatening objects. Now human beings can conceive of the class of threatening objects and so what civilization is in large part is an attempt to find a remedy for the class of threatening objects.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       Now there are representations of those sorts of things. The Medusa is one of them. The reason it's feminine is very difficult to explain and I don't think I have the time unfortunately, but you'll have to take my word for it. You see the little cartoon of Robert Crumb off to the left there and he's got a big eatable problem, old rob chrome. And the problem with him fundamentally as his mother was something like a giant spider and did everything she possibly could to crush the life out of him hands, his remaining relationship with women. And so that's part of the reason why the femininity can be a something that turns you to stone. It's an experience that many men are familiar with by the way, because the average man is rejected far more often than he's accepted. And since women are the gateway to reproduction, they constitute nature itself. And Nature itself tells most men you should go home and stay under your bed. There's lots of experiments done about this. So for example, psychologists have an undergraduate woman go out into the concourse and see how long it takes. Someone heard to find someone who agrees to sleep with her. Now it takes like, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       two seconds after she asks the first man and then, and then they flip it, you know, and they get your random undergraduate guy to do the same thing. It's well, you could imagine the consequences of that since many of you men have lived through it, mother nature with a woman wears the face of Mother Nature and the face his generally rejecting, especially to men who are low in the dominance hierarchy by the way, which is one of the things that irritates guys like Elliot Rogers and one of the things that motivates their desire to take revenge. That's a universal phenomenon, so that's part of the reason that the feminine is nature and why nature. By the way, his mother nature is like, it's diagnosis of your status is not good enough and no wonder what seems to have happened fundamentally is that these domains that I talked to you about, which can be represented as chaos and order, say an r from the that was perspective can also be represented as masculine and feminine. And I think the reason for that is that

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       human beings are fundamentally social primates, right? We're very, very social and we know that one of the correlates of brain size in primates, the social group size, and we also know that most primates say chimps who were quite closely related to they don't like go out and investigate leaves and you know period things through microscopes. They spend all their time interacting with other chimpanzees. Although they're chewing all the time. They do it because they have a ridiculously ineffective, you know, digestive and an eating system. Their brain is adapted to the social circumstances as the primary reality. So you could say, well, tribe is the primary reality and then there's a secondary reality which is all that which is outside tribe and that corresponds to chaos and order.

Speaker 1:          00:52:26       Order in contradiction to chaos is symbolized by masculine symbols. And that's for example why etiologies like radical feminism presume the existence of a patriarchy. It fits into the symbolic structure of our minds. That idea, and it's true in some sense because just like in chimpanzee troops, the primary or Metta hierarchy that makes up human civilization is fundamentally masculine in its origin and structure and so masculine is fundamentally the dominance hierarchy. And Feminine is some fundamentally all the things that are outside or that challenged the dominance hierarchy and so it's, and it's a perfectly reasonable, it's weird a because our brain is organized to fundamentally apprehend the world in terms of personalities and that's partly because you know, as we've emerged over the course of evolution, it's been relatively constant that there were males around and that there were females around and that the males were fathers and that the females were mothers and you know, that they were both mates as well.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       It's a constant of the evolutionary landscape and that's what our brains evolved to process. And then what happened when we developed the capacity to abstract is we use this underlying social cognitive abstraction structure to start to represent the structure of being itself. So we could say, well, there's a dominance hierarchy in that society and that's masculine and there's all the things that challenge the dominance hierarchy and they're outside in their feminine. The weirdest thing about that, however, is that it actually works. You know, we've got away with that for some reason. It seems to be perfectly reasonable to map the world in that manner. It keeps us going. All right, I'm going to try to explain this. This is nail chemical symbol at the bottom of the symbol. There's this round thing with wings. Do you ever see Harry Potter? Yeah. You know the game quidditch. You remember what they chase chase a gold one of those. All right, so they call that the snitch, I believe, and there's little fragment of soil and it's very interesting idea because for the alchemists, the primary element of reality, whatever that was could be conceptualized as this thing is round chaos and what it was conceptualized have in part was

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       it was a container from which matter and spirit could emerge and what you might ask, well, what does that mean? This is what it means. When a child experiences something, it can't predict. It does the thing that led to that uncertain outcome over and over and over and over until it can map it, and then you think, well, what did the child do? What the child did was take the domain of that which it did not understand and it transformed it into matter, which is the predictable world of entities and spirit, which is the internal psychological structure that's adapted to that, and so what the alchemists basically conceptualized was that what exists outside of your conceptual framework is something like unrealized potential, and when you interact with that unrealized potential, you actualize it and you actualize it into two component elements, one being the material world and the other being your own psychological structure. That's why they conceptualized matter and spirit, container of matter and spirit as the ultimate reality, and out of that emerged something that was quite primordial, which is the dragon. Now, one of the things we know you remember in the genesis story,

Speaker 1:          00:56:20       it's the snake that gives people vision. Do you remember? It gives him wisdom and it also produces selfconsciousness. There's a woman named Lynn Isabelle, who's an anthropologist in La and she was very interested in human being site because we can really see, we can see better than any other creature except predatory birds. We can see way better than most primates.

Speaker 1:          00:56:44       Isabelle knew that our tree dwelling ancestors, some 60 million years ago, emerged at about the same time as snakes. They're younger than lizards by the way, and that we were preyed on quite intensely by snakes for tens of millions of years, and she also knew that we were good at detecting snakes in the bottom of our visual field, and then we were particularly good at protecting the camouflage patterns of snakes and the bottom of our visual field. So she did a series of field experiments showing that primate visual acuity was correlated strongly with the presence of predatory snakes in the immediate environment. So the idea that snakes gave us vision is right now, why is that relevant to this?

Speaker 1:          00:57:27       We were preyed upon for a very long period of time and we developed a neural circuit to deal with predators and that's the neural circuit that's activated and children when they're terrified about monsters at night. So the Predator entity, which is this dragon, it's like a. it's like an amalgam of predatory forces is one of the manifestations of the things that exist outside of the dominance hierarchy. So it's a. it's a form of primordial reality. It's not abstract anymore like the matter and spirit container. It's like the first practical manifestation of what's terrifying and threatening concretely outside that, and so remember, animals can respond to threat, but they can't conceptualize threat as a category. That's the conceptualization of threat as a category. It emerges from the absolute unknown. It manifests itself as threat. So for example, if you hear a loud noise behind you or a grow when you're in the forest, the first thing that happens is you don't know what's going on and that's the initial state of contact with potential and then if you turn around and you look, that potential manifests itself into something that's predatory and you have a circuit for that and that's the same circuit that we now use to assess anything unexpected that it occurs to us and I think that circuit had become from somewhere.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       And so our capacity to respond to surprising entities is an elaboration elaboration up into abstraction of our capacity to identify predators. So that's the next level of reality. And out of that chaotic circumstance comes something that's more human and that that is the emergence of masculinity and femininity out out of that more primordial element.

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       Let me show you two things. This is a map of pragmatic territory as far as I can tell. It's the territory that people actually inhabit at the first level. It's the square I called that the dragon of chaos. That's the unknown as such, and it's the thing that you fall into when you're conceptual schemes fall apart. What manifests itself out of that is femininity and femininity comes in two forms. One is benevolent femininity. Example would be

Speaker 2:          01:00:09       this.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       You see Mary on the left there. She's in a structure called a man door lock, which is from a Freudian perspective, has obvious sexual connotations. You see, if you look carefully that she's standing on a reptile and holding her child away from it. That's a common medieval Christian image. You can think of it as divine because women's spent an awful lot of time doing that with their children over the course of our millions of years of evolution. And it's something that's sacred because our species dependent on that for its for its survival, this one's even better. This is a medieval image. I love this image. So there's Mary with the Christ child and she standing again on a reptile predatory rep top, but in the background you see all those weird little shapes. Those are musical instruments and that they feel space and the medieval artists who drew this picture had this intimation that behind the manifestation that something as primary as the protective maternity of Mary was something like the music of the spheres or are a collection of harmonious patterns and that this figure was constantly emerging out of that background of harmonious patterns across the infinite stretches of time itself.

Speaker 1:          01:01:30       That's the sacred image because it represents something that human society cannot live without. Like any society that doesn't regard the Virgin and the Child Who protects the child from the predatory serpent as a prime element of sacred reality is going to make itself estate. You know, I could say for example, that that's what's happening to the indigenous populations of eastern Europe at the moment where their birth rate is far below replacement. I'm going to show you another image. This is called a village or open virgin and it was a common representation in medieval Europe and it's a weird representation from a Christian perspective because it kind of reverses the normal hierarchy of power. What you have here is Mary,

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       she's holding the Christ child when the statute was closed and then you open her out. Why don't you see inside Mary is God the father and God the father is holding Christ in his hands. Now

Speaker 1:          01:02:34       Mary constitutes the superordinate benevolent feminine. Inside her is the structure of culture, so you can think inside nature is the structure of culture and that's represented in this image by God because he's the ultimate father obviously and Christian thinking, and then the God figure is holding what? Crucified individual. What does that mean? Now all the people around their kings, Queens, commenters are all gazing at that central figure, which of course is fundamentally what everyone in western civilization has been doing for 2000 years. Not knowing why

Speaker 1:          01:03:13       nature gives rise to culture. Culture gives rise to the suffering individual. Well, that's true enough. It's true for everyone. It's true for life at every point in time, but there's more to the image of the crucifixion because crucifixion also represents voluntary acceptance of suffering and voluntary acceptance of death, and it also points to something else that's of paramount importance, which is that there's an element of the human psyche that can die and come back and die and come back. And that's what happens to you. When you encounter a catastrophe and you make order of it and you climb back out of the underworld and your. Your voice through life is punctuated by trips to the underworld. And so you're somewhere and then you go outside that and then you go somewhere else and then you go outside that. And so what happens to people is they generally identify with where they are order, but order dissolves and collapses, and then it reconstitutes itself. So then you might say, if you are trying to adapt to the structure of reality itself, instead of identifying with order, you would identify with a process that allowed you to transform yourself across repeated bouts of order and chaos. And that's what these sorts of images or trying to represent. So

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       let me show you one final idea. Here's a taoist idea that's like this. So the Dallas symbol, you know the dallas symbol, I already talked to you about it and you've all seen it. Chaos and order, man, masculine and feminine, constantly in interplay. That's Dow from the Taoist perspective. And Dow is the source of meaning. So the idea there is that it's the constant interplay between chaos and order that produces the sense of meaning and human beings. And that's true.

Speaker 1:          01:05:19       That is what produces the sense of meaning. You know that because when you're engaged in a compelling operation, you're partly ordered and secure and you have one foot out into the unknown and the balance is proper and as a consequence you're engaged in what you're doing and then as a consequence of that, you lose your self consciousness and if you stay engaged in that sort of situation on a continual basis, then that you find that your life is meaningful and rich and that's the best antidote to the fact that life is bounded and full of suffering. Now, Tao means meaning. It also means journey and the center of the Tao is the place you're supposed to be one foot in chaos and one foot in order and that's the best place to be in the actual environment itself. Because the actual environment is better construed as the constant interplay between chaos and order than it is construed as a collection of material objects.

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       And if you adopt the pragmatic view that points out that there are metta realities above the mirror objects that we perceive. You can also apprehend that our brains are actually adapted to the Metta realities and not. The reality is because our brains are like $300, million years old and what we've done is extracted out those things that are constant, that cross spends of times, fans of kinds that are hundreds of millions of years in length and those aren't chairs and tables are automobiles. There they're metal structures that are much more sophisticated than that and we ignore that at our peril because modern people don't believe that meaning exists. They think it's EPA. Phenomenal. There's nothing subjective about our worldview when in fact our nervous systems are tuned so that life is manifesting itself in the most meaningful possible way. When you happen to be occupying the precise position between chaos and order that maximizes your security and the development of that security across time, and that's not. That's the most real thing there is, and to stay in that position is also to accept voluntarily the necessity for a certain degree of suffering. Because as you extend your capacities by exposing yourself to the optimal level of the unknown, you're constantly taking yourself apart and rebuilding yourself, and that's what allows you to thrive not only in the presence of stability, but also in a state that consists of the transformation of that stability.

Speaker 1:          01:07:57       Here's a representation for maintenance Egypt. These are representations of Horace. There's a lot of evidence that many of the ideas we have about Christ or derivatives of Egyptian ideas, most people who point that out pointed out in a manner same debt, devaluing

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       the ideas that were derived from ego because they have an a priori motive, which is a destructive motive.

Speaker 1:          01:08:25       As mythology progresses across the centuries, it transforms itself and attempts to continually encapsulate Rayanne capsulate. The primary idea is that the human race has managed to produce about the structure of reality itself. There's constant sees across these cultural manifestations because the reality too, which they route to which they refer, is actually reality. Horace, this is a good lesson and I'll leave you with this horse, is the eye.

Speaker 1:          01:08:55       The eye is not the intellect. The intellect is the thing that forces everything into a preexisting structure and it crunches reality. To do that at warp it and twists it and it makes people ideological and rigid. The eye is something completely different. The I is the thing that pays attention and your attention is automatically directed to those elements of your experiential field where the most information is manifesting itself. That's why, for example, if you're talking to someone in a bar and there's a TV flickering, you can't help but look at the TV that change, that transformation is what your nervous system is attuned to and the theory is that if you're a follower of horace, who is the I and the Vulcan because Falcons can see and they fly above everything else. If you're a follower of horace, you pay attention. When you pay attention, you absorb information.

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       When you absorb information, you continually transform yourself and that keeps you on top of it ever. Shifting reality. Doing that is meaningful and that's what stops you from becoming bitter and cruel because you know life is suffering. You know, and if you don't have an antidote to that suffering that's real, then you become resentful about the structure of experience and then you'll do everything you can to take revenge on it. And we saw what happened when people did that in the 20th century and it would be a good thing if people woke up and stop doing it and as far as I can tell after fig trying to figure this out for like 30 years. The way that you do that is by paying attention and transforming yourself when it's necessary and stopping the process of identifying with what you already believe. Who the hell cares what you believe you should be attending to the things you don't know, which is a much larger space than the things you know and then you should be construing yourself. Not as the inhabitant of a sterile and static and already completed structure, but as the thing that lives on the edge of that. That's constantly building and rebuilding it and then if something happens to your structure, it's not so relevant because that's not what you are. You're the thing that can engage in transformations of structure by paying attention,

Speaker 1:          01:11:16       and that's what these representations mean. These are renaissance pictures. You know they've elevated the entity that voluntarily accepts the necessity of suffering and death, so that's represented by Christ to the highest position in the heavenly hierarchy. What that idea means is that what should constitute the transcendent value that sits above all other values is your capacity to voluntarily accept they're restricted and painful conditions of your life. To face them and as a consequence of facing them immediately transcend them. Now, one of the things we know from clinical psychology is that if you have someone who's afraid

Speaker 1:          01:12:14       they avoid, so what do you do about that? You break down the thing they're afraid of til you find a small unit that take an approach. When they approach it, they learned that they can approach it and that they're more than they thought they were, and then they can approach the next thing and then the next thing, and so you take a woman who's got agora phobia who can't get into an elevator and a week later she can and then she goes home and has the fight with her husband that she should have had 20 years ago, and the reason for that is that when she's exposed to the things that she's afraid of, instead of running from them, she learns that she's the thing that can be exposed to things she's afraid of. She doesn't learn that things aren't frightening and learning the thing. She's the thing that can be exposed to things that are frightening made sir more than the frightening things. And it's certainly possible that we're more than the things that frightened us. If we weren't, we wouldn't be here. We shouldn't throw these things away before we understand them and we're in danger of doing that now.

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       So part of what I've been trying to do in my lectures and my work is to point out what our forefathers new to try to help modern people understand it and to make the case that these things that we think of as non real representations are more real than anything that we currently comprehend as real.

Speaker 2:          01:14:03       That

Speaker 1:          01:14:03       consequences of not comprehending them and living by them as far as I can tell is that things deteriorate and they can deteriorate to a point where everything is intolerable for everyone. And that seems to be a sub optimal destination.

Speaker 2:          01:14:26       So

Speaker 1:          01:14:28       thanks for the invitation.

Speaker 2:          01:14:32       Thank you.
