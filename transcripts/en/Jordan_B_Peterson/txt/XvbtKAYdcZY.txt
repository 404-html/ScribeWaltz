Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Ralston College and the Cambridge Center for the study of platonism, it's an immense honor to introduce two of the foremost intellectuals of our age. These thinkers, wonder, philosopher, the other psychologist. A spiritual writers is addressing the malaise of the soul in our culture. John Stuart Mill in his magnificent test say on Coleridge roots of Benton. Jeremy Benton, who above all others, men that have been led to ask themselves in regards to any ancient or received opinion. Is it true and by Coleridge, what is the meaning with Coleridge in contrast to the utility of Benton, the very fact that any doctrine had been believed by thoughtful men I'd received by whole nations and generations of mankind was part of the problem to be solved was one of the phenomena to be accounted for. This I think is true of both Roger Scruton and Jordan Peterson, and I'd like to mention just a couple of points of convergence.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       Warmed is an insistence on the importance of imagination as conversion to truth in opposition to a mere fantasy and the opposition to idolatry ideology as well as idolatry, especially the idolatrous ideology of the Post Modern for call derived consensus and the urgent return to questions about truth, beauty and goodness, and of course part of this is linked to what both perceive as the perilous position of the modern university. They both argue with that continuity of esteem needs to be regained in the humanities and the dominant strands of the humanities are leading to an impoverishment of the souls of students. Narratives both argue are not just stories of power, but these narratives persist because of that truth, so the importance for both Ralston college and indeed for the Cambridge Center, for the study of platonism, of both of these thinkers is their insistence upon the relationship between mythos and logos, between story and reason, the insistence upon a hierarchy of values and their vision of education as conversion to truth. This conversation will be moderated by the president of Rolston College, Steven Blackwood.

Speaker 2:          00:04:09       Thank you Douglas Fir those inspiring and grounding word starting us off, right in relation to the past that we wished to recover. That'd be a start, I think with a very straightforward but perhaps difficult question. We're, we're, we're gathered around the theme apprehending the transcendent loosely to gather this conversation. I'd like to begin by asking each of you, what is the transcendent? What does it mean for something to be transcendent?

Speaker 3:          00:04:49       Well, let me start that. I, I take a position which I attributed also to can't, that, um, that we have a very clear negative understanding of it. We were advanced to the edge of our thinking in so many areas knowing that although there's nothing further that we can say that somehow the truth has never nevertheless not run out of that negative view, I think needs to be combined with a more positive view, which tells us that there are other ways, not just, not maybe not thinking, but some other way of, of crossing that boundary and does it, were landing in the realm of the transcendent and knowing it from inside. I think that this is something that we understand very quickly when personal relations in that when I, when I address you, I know that I'm addressing something which addresses me too, but from a place where I could never be, I couldn't at myself from those eyes, um, and I can't capture the thing that is looking at me from those eyes, but nevertheless there are leaps of the imagination which can put me in your point of view and from that point who I can come to understand exactly what I am but in a completely different way from simply the ordinary empirical knowledge that I have with myself.

Speaker 3:          00:06:20       And I think that that sort of interpersonal understanding, I would say we can adapt to all the other aspects of our world, which is mysterious to us. A music for instance. With that, that's a beginning of. And I want to return to music a bit, a bit later, Jordan.

Speaker 4:          00:06:39       Well, I think it's useful as an adjunct to that. So, so, so roger mentioned that the transcendent is what we bump up against when we realize our ignorance. And so it's that which transcends our ignorance. And that in itself makes it an implacable fact, unless you believe that you have no ignorance, in which case there's no point in furthering a discussion with you, um, so the transcendent is the fact in so far as it's that which transcends our ignorance, but you can also think about it technically so and, and, and I think we know enough about how the brain works now so that not that we know much so that useful things can be said about that you tend to represent the world in the simplest manner that you possibly can, that works for what you're doing. And so you don't actually see the world you see sufficiently useful, low represent low resolution representations of the world.

Speaker 4:          00:07:43       And if they work then that's fine. There's no need to adjust them and they're relatively easy to remember and to manipulate. But now and then you have a misapprehension about someone let's say, and you have a conversation with them and the conversation goes sideways. And what that means is that the thing that you thought you were conversing with is not the thing that you're conversing with. And that manifests itself in error, right? So error is the place where the transcendent reveals itself and what is actually revealing itself is the reality that's outside and underneath your perceptions and so what you see in the world in some sense is a set of animated cartoons and a lot of that is actually a consequence of you seeing nothing but your memory because your brain is organized so that instead of going through all of the difficulty of having to look at the thing and that in itself, you look at what you assumed to be there and if you can get away with that so much the better, but the thing in itself is always much richer, richer than your apprehension of it, which is partly why you make mistakes, but also partly why you can continue to garner wisdom in the world.

Speaker 4:          00:08:51       There's always more there than meets the eye and God only knows how much more there is there than meets the eye. And you can show this even in the religious sense to some degree, because you could say that there's an element to the transcendent that instills people with a sense of religious significance. You can do that by immediately, scientifically, by feeding people chemicals, for example, that disrupt the inhibition of perception by memory. And then that puts them in a place where the transcendent tends to reveal itself sometimes an overwhelming force. So this is not some fiction that this exists. It's the, what's transcendent is more real than the reality that you perceive. Well, let's pick up.

Speaker 2:          00:09:33       Let's pick up on that because the, the, the ancients and medievals had a clear sense that it wasn't the world that was changing. It was we ourselves, as we make an ascent towards deeper truths, higher forms of the beautiful, uh, as we ourselves become more self conscious. So it's not the world that's changing. Uh, but, but us, I'm wondering if you could say how you understand the nature of that ascent, that, that, that, that, that movement and what brings it about.

Speaker 3:          00:10:04       Uh, I would be a bit wary of the metaphor of ascent, you know, uh, I, I think in Plato is quite clear what he meant. He wanted us to actually to transcend our earthly perceptions in the way of seeing things and look on the world from a, from a God's eye perspective. Um, and this could be done if we enter the world of the pure forms, uh, and so on, leave empirical reality behind. I think actually insofar as the experience of the transcendent that I, as I understand it, is available to us modern people. It's not that way that we get it perhaps about some Jordan might be right. That, that, that there are these drug induced experiences where things open up to us because old barriers of suddenly swept away. But in my own case, it is the concentration on the empirical reality, which at a certain point flips from mere sensory understanding, took to a vision in that of it's communicating something to me, and I think this is what the literature and art and music to, at their best they read, described reality so that it is actually communicating something to you.

Speaker 3:          00:11:26       It's not just there as an inert object before you, uh, and that sense of the transcendence is like discovering yourself in the mirror I'm seeing in the world as a whole, that thing in you that you could never identify in words, you know, the subject which is looking at it. I'm a, and it's not a mystery mystery, but it's something that you can then explain the difference. A good writer and a bad writer, of course, it's such a good writer will describe something in such a way that the thing described has the soul of the reader in it.

Speaker 4:          00:12:03       Um, so, so that might be a distinction in part between the thing and the meaningful thing. Right? And that's a, that's a very mysterious phenomenon. In fact, in some sense that the essence of phenomenon, because that means to shine forth is we're surrounded by empirical facts. They're everywhere. There's more of them than we can possibly count, but some of them do emerge and manifest themselves as that, as that conjunction between the factual and the meaningful, and then that's what's gripping and if you're fortunate. I mean, to me that's also partly what what leads us onward. Maybe in something approximating the asset that you described is that the set of facts manifests itself as implicitly meaningful and that means in some sense that there is a call to you that he hasn't from within you. I mean, I don't know how else to put it exactly because you walk into a bookstore and a book will will, will reveal itself to you. You know, or or you have a conversation and part of the conversation will trigger something in you or you're reading a scientific paper and much of it's dull and then all of a sudden there's something that sparks outward that's like a port that's a portal into the transcendent. And that is a place where the fact and the meaning converge, and that's a phenomenon we don't understand very well. It has something to do with its convergence, with the narrative that drives us, whatever that happens to be.

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       Yeah. That's so good way of putting into actually it connects with the general problem of what the humanities are in the university. But I've, I've always assumed that in some way or another, if you're teaching literature or musicology or, or history of art or anything, you are opening young people to those moments when the world ceases to be a mirror accumulation of facts and as it were, addresses you and um, that requires literary criticism. It requires opening yourself to experience in a way that, um, it requires serious education of a, of a special kind. And I think that if we thought that the humanities as directed towards that, we can see why they might be one way to fill the moral void that, that grows so easily in people's lives.

Speaker 4:          00:14:19       So young had this idea, which I really love. It's a very sophisticated idea. Um, it's, it's, it's this idea of how the self, first of all, so the self for young, this Christ was a symbol of the self. So the logos was a symbol of the self. So that's sort of what would you say? It's the divine essence of humanity and the image of that is a symbol of the self and for young the self was the totality of the individual across time and space. So it's whatever you are as, as a transcendent object. That's a good way of thinking about it. And then can imagine that that transcended object also has to interact with you and the world moment by moment. And his belief was that those times when that space of meaning opened up, so there is that convergence between the fact and the gripping of the fact was the manifestation of the self which is this transcendent object in this specific moment of time and space.

Speaker 4:          00:15:17       And therefore our call forward to move towards revealing that totality as much as it can be revealed. And so it would be partly and that would be partly revealed by then following a meaningful pathway. And it would be the case that if you're engaged in the teaching of humanities and literature, that you are trying to engage exactly that part of the person. It's to pull them into the story and to, and have that open up to them. And then that's a portal. It's not, it's not words on paper, it's a, it's a portal to their, to their further development towards this, this, the manifestation of this higher and more transcendent motive being

Speaker 2:          00:15:56       the Hindu idea for the transition from the to Brahman, isn't it, that you've suddenly pass through a, uh, a barrier that can't actually be described because you can only know it when you're on the other side of it. But when you're on the other side of it, you looking back at the thing that you've left and seeing it in as it were for the first time. And knowing what it means. I guess that's a little connects a little bit with what Douglas was saying about, about courage. That courage was an advocate of a form of education, a form of knowledge which shows the meaning of things as opposed to the mere facts accumulated by Bentham and people like that. Both of you have done quite deep dives into 20th century totalitarian ideologies at both of you have been a very trenchant critics of the etiology, the various forms of nihilism in, uh, in our own culture.

Speaker 2:          00:16:59       Um, but I think all of us tire of, of, uh, I kind of negativity that has come to be very prevalent in our culture, not simply the nihilism, but then we can criticize the nihilism. We ought to criticize it. Both of you have been, had been brilliant critics of it. Um, but I, what I take to be at work in both of your, uh, in, in the work that both of you do is, is not fundamentally criticism but a turn towards something positive, a recovery of a sense of the transcendent. I'd like to have a, have a turn for a moment to what does that recovery look like? Where do we start? Well, if we're thinking intellectually world of scholarship and education

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       that we both belonged to, has turned, as you say, in this negative direction, always preferring debunking explanations of everything, show reducing them to the lowest motive, uh, that, that it's not truth, but par that we pursue in all that food codian nonsense. And I think the only response to that is to come up with bunking explanations of so to speak. Try to put back into the subject matter of one's own inherent belief in it, and to recognize that, uh, you know, we're not around on this earth for very long and we do have an obligation to find the things that we love and not the things that, that we reject a under those things that we love the view, the best way towards them is to look at the things that other people have loved. That's what a culture is. It's the residue of all the things that people thought were worthwhile to preserve and teaching that will will again reconnect us to what matters.

Speaker 4:          00:18:51       Well. And there's, there's also ways of, of, of providing a pathway forward by making the food. Kalia and arguments, let's say about power, more high resolution and one of the things that I do in my lectures, public lectures that I think is rather comical is to take and poke fun in some sense about the idea of power as the fundamental foundation for the hierarchal structures of the West. I think, well you can think of the West as one large scale, low resolution, totalitarian tyranny, the tyranny of the patriarchy. Or you can decompose that and which in some senses to transcend the concept. And I think, well, I, I asked my audiences what they think about the tyranny of plumbers or the tyranny of massage therapists. Well, because it, it, it's, it's dead relevant. It's like, let's say you need a plumber and you do need a plumber.

Speaker 4:          00:19:49       Everyone agrees that you need a plumber and because there's hell to pay otherwise. And so, and then the question is, well, how is it that you go about selecting a plumber? And the answer isn't that there are roving bands of tyrannical plumbers that go door to door telling housewives that if they don't use their services, the surface of the most tyrannical plumber, that they'll be mafia like consequences. What happens instead is that you look for the plumber who is most able in your estimation and in the, in the, uh, in his reputation as distributed through the community for being able to fix pipes and run a business and engage in an honest transaction with you. And that's competence. That's not power. You see, what I see as most corrosive about the postmodern types, especially those who've derived themselves from let's say, is that the idea that every hierarchy or the hierarchy as such is predicated on power, is actually an assault on the idea of competence itself.

Speaker 4:          00:20:53       And that in turn is an assault on the idea that there are real problems that can actually be solved. Well then if you dispense with all that and it's only power, there is no real problems to be solved. And there's no noble ways of solving them even even as in even in as concrete, a manner as a good plumber would solve that which is a not, not a trivial thing. And so then you deprive people of you deprive people of that have that sense of purpose in their life. Even even at the high resolution levels. You know, and I've insisted in my lectures that you know, if you're the sort of person who runs a small diner, that it's incumbent on you to run the highest quality small diner that you possibly can because what you're doing there is not merely providing people with basic nutrition.

Speaker 4:          00:21:41       There's way more to the space than meets the eye and your noble. What would you say? Acceptance of your limited responsibility is also simultaneously a way to transcend that. And that can be a place where the neighborhood meets. That can be a place where tired people revivify themselves before they go off to do their difficult work. That can be a place where you can mentor your employees and help them develop their life. Like it's a rich. It's an unbelievably rich microcosm. And to take on the, the care and tending of that microcosm as a responsibility is also a great pathway to meaning and unnecessary and meaning is something that's, well not EPA, phenomenal and not dispensable, but absolutely central to human thriving. And in the psychological and practical sense.

Speaker 3:          00:22:32       Yeah. But we do have to try and understand why it is that there is such a charm in the food codian position. Why is it that people want to believe that all the best things. What we think of the best things in human relations simply disguised forms of manipulation. You know, that uh, the, the whole feminist view of the relationship between men and women, for instance, switcher is founded on this deep myth that men are exercising exercise power as a agenda to use the fashionable world, the word over over women. And that all study of this is just a way of revealing the power and the, uh, and the competitor is through which it flows. You know, I think there's a, a will to believe this and why is, is one of the big questions that I think we try, we have to try to understand is it that when people lose some kind of transcendental religious faith that they are automatically fall into this pit of, of resentment as a of the Nietzschean unkind to try and find a, the, the oppressor in every relationship or is there a, are there truths and exploring as well?

Speaker 3:          00:23:49       Is there other forms of power or forms of human relation that looked like power from one aspect but perhaps also looked like tenderness and dependence from another aspect and that they've just are emphasizing one half of it or something like that. I think there are real questions as to how it is our culture has got into this position.

Speaker 4:          00:24:10       Yeah. Yeah. Well that's the question below the claim of power. And so I mean, I've, I've thought about that to some degree and here's three possibilities. I mean, one is the accusation that all there is, is power is the justification for use of power of cool. That's, that's handy. If that's what you want to use, so then then there's another problem and that goes along with the failure, the willful failure to distinguish competence from tyranny and power, let's say, because we might think of power as unearned authority, something like that because we need a definition of power and I think that there's a resentment at work there that's very, very deep. I think it's, it's deep in the biblical sense which is that there is a proclivity for those who do not manifest what they could manifest in the world and thereby fail to watch the success of those who do manifest what they could manifest in the world and succeed and become embittered by that tremendously embittered and then to label that as power and then to attempt to destroy it because it's simpler to do that than to do the radical internal retooling that would be required to set things straight internally.

Speaker 4:          00:25:22       I'm sure that

Speaker 3:          00:25:23       that's right. Uh, that, that, that's one explanation of why people are always tempted by the zero sum vision of relations. He's benefit is my cost sort of thing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:33       Oh, I wanted to pick up on that the, the, the, the very widespread view that things are zero sum, which is of course the, the, the language of power. What's the antidote to that? What is the, how does one overturn the, uh, the ideology of power? How does one transcend that with a non zero sum a truth or approach to life? I

Speaker 3:          00:25:59       personally would say that the first thing to recognize is that there are positive sum games. You know, that's what the real theory of the market tells us, that there are whole realms of human transactions where both parties gain, uh, from, from the shed, uh, engagement. Uh, and um, though that doesn't work, drive away, the real source of this is difficulty. Um, it has something to do with what Jordan was referring to and you know, that people's, people's resentment at the success of others when they cannot match it or cannot easily match it will or will not match it, which is either. Yes, yes, exactly. Uh, and of the Labor of, of re reconceived and your own position in such that you actually have to do something about it. You know, that it's, there is some, something lazy about the zero sum ambition, uh, but uh, it's not, uh, you know, it's not a vision that successful people have, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:27:04       and that they have at any level of reality and you can actually combat that to some degree by make it high resolution again by, by making examples. It's like because very few people actually believe once they observe that all the relationships they've had with other people have been zero sum. Now you might get some very disadvantaged people and these people do exist who've been taken advantage by virtually everyone they've ever encountered in their whole life like that does happen. But most of the time all you have to do is remind people. It's like, well, think of someone that you loved. Even briefly think of a friend that you've had. It's like, well, you, you successfully negotiated with that friend to do things together because otherwise it's not a friendship and it has to be successful negotiation, which means your friend has to be happy with what you were doing and you have to be happy.

Speaker 4:          00:27:58       And so, and then wasn't it the case that you were both happier doing that than either of you would have been doing something else alone and, and isn't that evidence in your own action and your life for the existence of non zero sum games and they're dependent on successful negotiation is we can both have more than we would otherwise have if we can come to a consensus about what will both pursue and it's very few people when you make it personal like that. And, and high resolution. Again, it's very few people who are willing to pursue their ideology of zero sum of a zero sum reality so far down that they'll actually use that to characterize their most intimate relationships. Now I would say that someone who does that by temperament is literally psychopathic because the psychopathic view of the world is absolutely that. It's a zero sum game.

Speaker 3:          00:28:46       Yes, I think that's right. But of course we have a whole body of literature, um, about sexuality, which is trying to establish that the sexuality is the exercise of power of one person over another. You get it already in south was being and nothingness where he almost is almost by logic that, that a serious sexual desire for him ends up as sadomasochism because you cannot extract from the other that gift of his freedom, uh, which, which is what you're looking for because his freedom, his, his, uh, not to be obtained by you and therefore you can only do this by who sort of tearing that his flesh and getting him to confess in the extremes of agony, but he can't do it. You know, this kind of thing. I know that's a very good vision of what sexual relations are, but you get a that image used

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       by Simone de Beauvoir and all kinds of feminists to essentially to de legitimize the idea that there is such a thing as love for the other sex. Well, there's, there's a, I think it also masks and more fundamental problem that's really a biological problem. Like it's a misapprehension of a genuine problem. But part of what sex does is temporarily subordinate the individual to nature and the species. And so there is a domination there, you know? And, and if, if a, if a woman decides to have a child, then she is going to undergo a series of extraordinarily radical transformations and she's also going to end up in this situation where in all likelihood something else becomes fundamentally more important than her and there. So there is a, there is a sub, it might be voluntary, subjugation, subjugation to nature, and, and that's built into the fabric of existence.

Speaker 4:          00:30:33       And I think it's very easy not to want to grapple with that because it's such a profound problem. And then to make that a secondary consequence of something like unbalanced power, relationships between the genders, but of course a traditional religion offers you selves for this, the rites of passage in which, which joins men to women, the right of passage which makes birth unexperienced with the whole community and death. Likewise, uh, and um, you know, the sense also in these great events, one is occupying a position in the, in a moral space that has been occupied by generations before one. And so on. This normalizing of these huge transitions I think is something that that we have is depended upon religion to provide this a sacred and having taken that away well or ignored it or trying to live without a exactly, without the idea of a sacrament and we're actually at a loss when these great transitions occur.

Speaker 4:          00:31:40       Just because it is the case. In fact that to to engage in the integration of sexuality with your individual life is a series of sacrifices. So for example, if you get married, that's a sacrifice because it's a sacrifice of all other people and so it's a sacrifice of that possibility and then to have a child is the sacrifice of all the things that you could have done otherwise. Then having that child and two but two, two, as you pointed out, to make that part of a broader tradition to say that, well that is a sacrifice and there is a loss that goes along with that. But what you gain as a consequences of if immeasurables significance in contrast to the loss. And one of the things that's really struck me in this lecture to her that I've been doing, so I've been in about 100 cities and one of the things that I've been talking to people about is his meaning and I suppose it's meaning in relationship to the transcendent and the necessity of meaning as an antidote to suffering and malevolence.

Speaker 4:          00:32:38       And the hypothesis is something like, well meaning is to be found in responsibility. And this is a, it's a revelation to people because they haven't conceptualized it that way before. It's like meaning isn't, um, it isn't happiness and it isn't self esteem. And it isn't momentary pleasure, isn't any of that. It's, it's the, it's the bearing of a sacrificial burden. And that that actually works to enrich and ennoble your life in ways that make the tragic element of it tolerable and had to keep you from bitterness. And so these things that are put forward as subjugation, like the subjugation of women to the, to the catastrophe of birth, let's say, or even the, the indignity of, of Patriarchal Union is all of a sudden something that you can take on as an aspirational goal rather than something that's a mere imposition on your, on your moment to moment freedom as a relief to people to hear that and to know it.

Speaker 3:          00:33:31       Of course. No, I agree with that. But there is also the sense that in the world in which we live, where obviously people have been detached to a greater extent from the, uh, any continuous religious tradition, there still is a sense of loss. A people, uh, they don't. They know that they're missing something but don't know quite how to identify it. And that's one reason for thinking, for them, thinking that it's been taken away. Something's been stolen from them and they look around at the people who are at ease in the world, unsuccessful and seem to be a, I'm on good terms with themselves and think of them as the ones who done the stealing. Uh, and that is a dangerous attitude and I think it's, well, it surely that is part of what he rubs in all these strange academic disciplines like gender studies, which simply have as their goal, the undermining of the existing order without anything positive to put in its place. And I don't know what those, those academic studies recruit people all the time from this fund of, uh, of a, of isolation as the sense your sense of, of loss without an ability to identify the thing that's

Speaker 4:          00:34:47       last as the cold lake element of them because they do, I would say to some degree, degree prey on people whose interpersonal relationships have been irreparably damaged. I have a hypothesis about, about the feminist end of the postmodern radical leftist movement. So, and this is something I've talked about much in public but, but. Well, but here goes, this should get me in lots of trouble. So, so, and, and there's a variety of things that are tangled together here. So we don't know how female biology would manifest itself politically. Male biology does. Female biology is going to. And that's because female political activity on the largest possible scale is a relatively new phenomenon. So, so, and it isn't obviously the case that men and women's views of the world are going to. Precisely. So here's a hypothesis. You're telling me what you think about this. So one thing that a woman really wants to know about a man, or perhaps you might say one thing that femininity wants to know about masculinity is that it's not a predatory tyrant.

Speaker 4:          00:35:56       Okay? So, and here's why. I mean, first of all, there's fragility and feminine sexuality to a greater degree than there is an male sexuality because women bear a higher price for sexual misadventure, let's say, and are perhaps more prone to exploitation by force. But more than that, part of being a woman is having the possibility of bringing something extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable and valuable into the world. And the first concern might be, are you a predator? Fundamentally, are you a predator? And so what I see happening in the, in the feminist disciplines like gender studies, is the politicization of that accusation. And the accusation is prove to me that you're not a Predator like in in your fund, in the fundamental element of your masculinity, not only historically but now, because the cost of you being a Predator is, is too high. Now I feel that that's an inappropriate.

Speaker 4:          00:36:57       I think that's what's driving the demolition of the idea of presumption of innocence. For example, we'll start with presumption of guilt and prove to you will be proved to me that you're innocent. And I think the problem with that isn't that there are no predatory men because there are plenty of predatory men. The problem is is that the courageous way to deal with the problem of the Predator is to offer a hand in courageous trust and to invite forward a partner from the monster that's the. That's that mythological manner in which this is supposed to be undertaken. The courageous, a courageous part of the woman's journey, let's say, is to face the monstrosity of a man and to invite out of that something more noble to emerge. And there's courage in that ingenuine risk. And I think that that's for gone in the accusation process.

Speaker 4:          00:37:48       And then the, the other element of that seems to me to be that, well, if you are a Predator and irredeemable in your predatory nature, then the best thing to do is to render you harmless. And if we're going to obscure the relationship between competence and power and assume that all of your striving upward is merely a manifestation of power, then what we'll do is we can do as much as possible so that harmlessness can replace virtue. And I see all of that driving these resentful disciplines in there. And their aim is the ems escalation with the men. Yeah, that's the evil queen. Yeah. Because we have the evil king, right? That's the tyrannical patriarchy. Well, the evil queen is lurking somewhere. Yes. So the program is it. A lot

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       of this is true, but I'm a society does not seem to have the capacity to put that to one side and set up rates the normal. The fact that most men and most women are not like that and that there is, there is a, a natural desire and need of the sexist to love each other, to be united and to create children and so on, and that, that, that the old stability that that was built upon this has gone. So I mean that, uh, nobody wants. Nobody in the intellectual world wants to celebrate that. So, so I, I just, I had this interview a few a month

Speaker 4:          00:39:15       ago or so with a woman from Gq and she was fully onboard the, the predatory male train, let's say. And you know, when people like that interview me, they start talking about the patriarchy and I say, well, I don't believe in the patriarchy. I don't buy that conceptual structure. What's so interesting, and this has happened more and more over the years as they've developed this, first of all, the person that I would be talking to had some idea that it was hypothetically possible to reject the idea of the patriarchy. But now when I say I don't believe in it, it's, it's that idea is meant with stunned disbelief. It's like, well, what do you mean you don't believe in the tyrannical Patriot that everyone knows? That's true. And and I think, well, so here's your hypothesis. So this is the hypothesis is that throughout history, the fundamental relationship between man and woman is one of parasitism and exploitation.

Speaker 4:          00:40:11       That's it. And so, and that's the case, I guess until 1960 and the publication of the feminine Mystique or something like that, but that's the entire course of human history that when the, when it seems to me that the appropriate story is that men and women labored mightily under their terrible constraints for, for uncounted centuries cooperating together by and large to, to build some modicum of security and freedom and stability so that they could raise children and have a somewhat harmonious and productive life and all of a sudden it's become not only questionable to put forth that as a proposition, but somehow tyrannical in, in, in essence just for positing it as a reality, but the spot it because isn't it because of this peculiar view that the underlying all of this

Speaker 3:          00:41:00       as a kind of social structure that this is being created. The distinction between men and women doesn't have it spaces in nature, it's a basis is in the institutions that we have created and since we created them, we can change them. That there is, there's been a sort of a kind of almost hysterical invasion of everything by the idea of human choice. If, if there is, if there is a structure to the relationship between men and women, then we ought to be able to change it. And of course, chain it might mean that I have to change my sex in order to conform to the way things are. But that also has become a choice.

Speaker 2:          00:41:38       Well, and is, is, is, is not the very, uh, very a constant focus on division, whether between man and woman or between left and right to orbitz or between this race and that race or any other way in which we might, we might divide people according to groups. Isn't that very polarized, fractured, uh, fractured polarization. A, a sign of a loss of a common human culture of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of a, of a universal plane in which we all we all are as, as human beings. And, and so if, if, if, if that's, if that's, if that is. So I suppose what I take to be so very urgent in our time, uh, and, and I wonder, it might be difficult to find anyone who at least when you go down to a high enough level of resolution as you say, Jordan would not think this is true, that we must recover that sense of our selves as entities that participate in a universal and transcendent plane. That we have a common culture that I see myself in the other, as you were saying earlier at Roger, and I'd like to have both of your thoughts on what strategies were means for that recovery. Uh, and perhaps we can focus particularly on the, the, uh, the, the, the questions that we started with, with, uh, Art Music you've written extensively in architecture, of course, are our Roger. And you've thought long and hard about the humanities. Jordan, what does, what does, what is the character of recovery? How do we bring that about?

Speaker 3:          00:43:24       Well, I'm, I'm, maybe again, I think that there are reversed what you have to identify those aspects of the human condition that move of their own accord towards reconciliation, you know, uh, rather than a conflict and a and division of the sort that you're referring to and we are very familiar with them. It's not just that just love, which of course is something which is a very complex thing and can't be, can't be just conjured from the skies, but there are other aspects of our condition that we can educate through a first, first of all, through studying examples and then through imitation and then through a self discipline. Obviously forgiveness is one of these things. Um, and the habit of putting yourself in another person's perspective, looking at yourself from outside, uh, and wondering whether you know, you are as so seen acceptable to yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:44:27       All those, uh, you know, of course, again, religion, the Christian religion at least was, um, built upon. That's kind of intellectual discipline. The discipline of seeing your neighbor as yourself and seeing yourself therefore as Amir neighbor, and um, I, I, I, I suspect that you have, we have to revive those basic moral discipline's not for, for the use of people who don't have the overarching faith, the belief in the transcendental judgment to which we will we all called, but who nevertheless have to be shown that we do live our lives as an object of judgment. Nevertheless, and here are some guides just read Anna Karenina for, for example. Um, I know it takes a long time for facebook addicted youth to read Anna Anna Karenina, but there's still hope, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:45:28       and, and they're likely to listen to it if it becomes an audio book. So, so, um, well, because maybe more people can listen then can read. I mean, so, so let's, let's think about literature for, for, for a bit. And so now if you read something like a dusty see novel or Anna Karenina, you're not really reading the account of a single person's life. What you're reading is it like the author has taken a variety of lives and amalgamated them in unified them into something that's like a. it's like a compilation of lives, so it's life. It's like life writ large, so that's what fiction is. It's more true than than reality because just like a mathematical abstraction can be more real than the thing that it represents. In some sense. The fiction is. It's like a. it's like a portrait. If you sit for a portrait, you'll sit and the artist will paint you and then you'll sit again and then you'll say it again and then you'll say it again, and so the portrait is actually a composite of you, and so it's got a richness sometimes that a photograph can't match, and a fictional character is actually a composite of many people, and so the opportunity to read a great work of fiction is the opportunity to place yourself in the perspective not of merely another person like you do in normal discourse in a mundane setting, but to place yourself in the perspective of a compiled character.

Speaker 4:          00:46:56       So you, I've experienced that extraordinarily powerfully with dusty eskies crime and punishment to put myself in the position of this student who was nihilistic and who had every reason to commit murder. And it's an unbelievably intense novel because everybody in the novel is hyper real and we think of fiction as falsity or, or, or, or as, as untruth. And it's not, it's, it's, it's abstraction. An abstraction isn't untruth. It's, it's more than truth often. And so the humanities help us walk through the souls of others and because we can imitate and it's one of our primary remarkable, miraculous abilities. We can imitate the compiled characters that we encounter in literature and mythology and religion. And that does help flush us out and ennoble us. And we can, we can. I just wrote the Foreword to Solzhenitsyn's Fiftieth Anniversary version of, of the Gulag archipelago, the abridged version.

Speaker 4:          00:47:58       And I ran across his wish that people could learn from what he communicated all the horror and suffering to put themselves in the position of both the perpetrator and the and the accused simultaneously. And to decide that that's not the road to walk down. And so the advantage of placing yourself in the position of other people is that if they're good people, then you can be like them, and if they're not good people, then you can avoid that pathway. And then you don't have to learn that through, through the agony of direct personal experience in the short span of your life. There's nothing more, there's nothing greater than you can do for people then to introduce them into those patterns, stories so that they can gain from the catastrophes of the past.

Speaker 3:          00:48:45       No, I agree with that. But of course, uh, in fiction ones also concerned to identify if you're writing fiction, identify with the character in order to understand that character because it's not as though you can, you can't actually grasp a character from the outside that you have to be able to see through his eyes what it, what the world is in which he is. And that is, I think, an exercise of the imagination, which I value greatly. Uh, and um, you don't necessarily come to the conclusion that therefore I don't want to be like that. It might be just enough to say, now I see that, that, that that's a possible human being, um, and you knowledge of the possibilities is amplified and your sense and your ability to position yourself in those possibilities also, I think.

Speaker 4:          00:49:41       Right? So that's a matter of differentiation as well as direct. Yes. I think sometimes in my more dire moments that this opposition to cultural appropriation, right? So the idea that I'm not allowed anymore to imagine myself say fictionally as a woman or as, or as a character from another ethnicity or even to play the role that role as a, as an actor, I think that it's, it's part of the assault on the idea of the individual and the non zero sum game because it precludes the possibility that I can take on the role of another and, and understanding manner and actually facilitated dialogue. And that undermines the claim. I would say that everything is only a secondary consequence of power because if I can actually bridge that gap, well then I'm not isolated in my group or my ethnicity or whatever it is I can.

Speaker 4:          00:50:31       I can become partly you and we can communicate and I would say because of that literature and art is a great threat to ideology, especially of the group identity kind. And of course they're perfectly aware of that, which is why the radicals on that side of the equation are doing everything they can to, to a reporter from the New York Times who wrote a rather scurrilous piece about me. She had done the literature degree at, at Columbia, a bright woman, and she told me in all honesty and an apparent transparency that she had no idea this is how deep this is. This has become saturated into our culture. She had no idea until she, until she had graduated from Columbia that there was any other way of reading a work of literature except through the postmodern Lens. And the postmodern Lens is well, who are the groups that are being represented and what power games are at play and who benefits. And, and I mean, I don't know if because she turned out to be quite a strange person. Um, but, so I have no idea if that, if that was a ploy on her part or whether that was like a, like a, a naive, what would you call confession, but it's increasingly the case that, that is how literature is taught in my home province of Ontario. The Elementary Teachers, Federation of Ontario wants to start teaching literature from a postmodern critical perspective in elementary school to demolish it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       Well, there we, uh, I mean I'm in favor of cultural, cultural appropriation. I mean, I'm a product of it. I, I appropriated the idea of the English gentleman and, you know, and I'm trying to make myself be it a, I know it's a Paideia that's part of doing it well, but I've understood the world from the inside and another way. But in a, I just wrote a book of stories which was reviewed, but, uh, somebody who says, you know, this, these stories make cultural appropriation into a virtue. So I felt good about that. They, they begin with a, an inside view of the psyche, of a, uh, of, um, a terrorist, have an, uh, an Arab terrorists who, who's, who has a legacy of vengeance and, um, who is a failure and who's lost. I tried to make real in the, in the feelings of the reader as he, as he reads it. And um, uh, and then the subsequent stories show the same kind of loss in completely different people. So

Speaker 2:          00:53:03       I wanted to bring up that a book of stories, actually a souls in twilight by Sir Roger Scruton, a series of five short stories of five, I think is it five short stories each which are our portraits of a character at a certain moment in time. I think it's safe to say Roger, that they're all tragic stories in a sense. What I found, so moving about those stories is that these are individuals in states of dislocation, anchor lists, seeking depth, meaning truth, stability, uh, and yet in their confusion, in their darkness, willing against that very thing that they seek, or you might say violating. We're transgressing that sacred thing that they're longing for. That's not what's beautiful about the book. Um, uh, what's beautiful is that in the reading the reader, her or himself comes to a sense of what that longing is for positively a sense of the, the stability of love or out of home or have relationship.

Speaker 2:          00:54:17       And, and, and I suppose what I want to ask following up on this is that that seems to be a profoundly redemptive vision that you have in that, in those beautiful stories, Roger, at that, that it's showing the persistence of the beautiful and have the good even in its absence, that I can read that story and have a perception of what positively I am I am looking for and just try to refer to something that you say in, in one of your books, Jordan, that, that even through an experience of, of evil one can develop an apprehension of what the good is. And wondering if you could each say something about the, that you know, either either there is our reality to these transcendent things where there is not the condition did either just a construct, goodness or beauty and truth or they have a transcendent. And, and sovereign, persistent re reality. And I'm wondering if you can each say something about the, the persistence or sovereignty of these things even amidst our darkness and a suffering.

Speaker 3:          00:55:24       Well, I, I would say that in tragedy when tragedy Israeli effective, uh, there is a redemption offered in this through suffering the, the, the, the, the, the we, we encounter the possibility in tragedy that a human being can through the most noble motives also bringing on down upon himself destruction. And uh, this destruction is no different from the destruction that's going to affect all of us in the end anyway. But here is somebody who, who has faced. It's down in some way that his Nova, who's ability of nature and his ability to go out towards others in a condition of, of love and reconciliation has not been taken away from him. And the spectacle of that is all the more intense because nevertheless,

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       the death intervenes and takes him away as it will take you and me away. But without having had the chance to reveal a nobility or even to acquire it, you know. So I, I think that for that reason, it's very important that in literature, a noble characters are seen in a condition of loss sometimes that, uh, and their, their redemption comes because even though they've lost what we all must in the end lose, there is that in which is struggling towards reconciliation with their own condition and with others, it's the sense that they are living as another and not as a self. You know, that's, that's, I think it's a crucial thing that see the Gulag archipelago is often viewed as an endless documentation of the horrors of the Soviet enterprise. But it was an investigation. It was an experiment in literary investigation and that isn't what the book is about.

Speaker 4:          00:57:26       The book is about Solzhenitsyn's observations of people in those terrible situations who did not contribute to the terror and who transcended it and the unbelievably power, powerful impact observing that had on him and the personal transformation he underwent as a consequence of observing those people and the decision he made because of seeing them in their ultimately tragic circumstances transcend that to to to transform his life from the bottom up and to write this great book and to reveal the utter catastrophe of that entire ideological movement and so you deal see the light most clearly when it's super imposed against the darkest possible background and so and great literature which polls people way down into the depths and in in this, in this, in this compiled, fictional manner. Then it also does at the same time highlight what's what's. What's the opposite of that? So I it by reading of

Speaker 2:          00:58:29       of your, your, your, your work, both of you. There's an implicitly theological character here and we can't speak about the transcendent in a certain sense without being theological at it. Why is it that we can't just delights, just can't be completely shut out. I mean, if, if, if, if, if evil and darkness, we're the sovereign principles as a human, as it might say, metaphysically, well, they could, it could just be all delights, could just be completely blackened and yet that's not what we see. And I'm wondering if you would each comment on the, what you take to be the, I think what, what might, what might be a theological articulation of the facts on the ground? If the facts are that you can't shut the lights right out, that there is still there. What, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       what's going on there? I totally agree with what Jordan said about the Gulag archipelago. Um, and that goes back to just ask is, uh, from the house with the dead. You know, his accountant of being in Osiris, much milder, we've kind of imprisonment, but nevertheless it was almost a vacation home in comparison. No, I agree. But nevertheless, he described these characters who for whom, that everything has been taken away. But he also notes that in each of them I can find the spark of God. Something which Janacek repeated when he made this into the, into that wonderful Libretto for his opera and, and Yana check tractor show in music. How these derelict characters will suddenly shine with that, with that light from another source that doesn't come just from what they are in those circumstances, but from something higher. And I think, um, you know, I would say one is always obliged to use metaphors when we get to this point, but it is true that, that you can find in someone even in the most deprived and desolate circumstances, that home which you can blow to co two, caused a spark once again to, to light up inside him.

Speaker 3:          01:00:47       And that is as far as we get to meeting God. But, um, there is no reason to think that we need to get any further in my view. Um, that's what everybody saw in Maximilian Colby when he offered himself in, in the, in Auschwitz for, you know, to sacrifice why he was, um, a canonized. Suddenly you see that there is something else in all of us in which in the circumstances, however severe and deprived will will shine from with a different light and make those circumstances worthwhile because they produced that light. It couldn't be, in some sense the mercy of God that keeps him hidden from us because if you imagine that your sacred duty is to blow on those embers that you described, even among people who are in desolate straights. Then every time you fail to take that opportunity, then you tell things badly towards what they shouldn't be tilted towards.

Speaker 3:          01:01:54       And it could be that the revelation of your inadequacy in the face of that moral duty, which would be in some sense equivalent to an encounter with God would be enough to tear you into pieces. And so maybe you get glimpses of that now and then because that's, that's all you in your current depraved moral state could stand of seeing of the face of God. And I think there's something to that that's similar and says things to that effect. I think. Yeah. And um, yeah. So I often heard in the old communist days when I used to travel around Eastern Europe and, and meet people who are in really dire straits, safe, said similar things, you know, that, that, um, that God would reveal himself. But, uh, in these circumstances, the revelation will be something too strong. What I could bear.

Speaker 4:          01:02:48       That's a beautiful image you've given us, Roger, of blowing on the embers within blowing on the embers of transcendence. Um, I'd ask you both about the forms of culture and institutional life that produce that blowing on the embers in the individual. It seems to me both of you have a very deep sense of the dignity of the human individual, of the individual's connection to the transcendent, the grounding fact of our existence. What would be the forms of culture that we would say to be necessary or most, uh, most inclined to foster in the individual that blowing of the flame? I think the most accessible form for, for most people is music and music to me is the most representational form of art. Because I think that the world is made out of patterns and we perceive some patterns as objects, but fundamentally it's patterns and what you want is all the patterns of the world to interact harmoniously in, in something where every element is related, intelligibly to every other element.

Speaker 4:          01:04:03       And I think that when your life is in harmony, that you can feel that. And when you're dancing to beautiful music, you're acting that out. It's the music is, is the, is the music of the spheres, and you're participating in the powdering of your being in accordance with that structure. And that gives you an intimation of, of transcendence. And, and it's not criticizable. That's the thing that's so lovely about it, is even as our society has become more cynical and more self destructive and more deconstructionist, the power of music has in fact grown because it speaks to that eternal harmony and the reality of that eternal harmony in a way that mere intellect cannot deny. And I mean, I've was always amused. I went to this show, uh, the ramones, a punk band from New York. It was the loudest concert I'd ever heard by by a good factor of 10 in my ears rang for like three days afterwards and there were all these like nihilistic punk rockers all crammed into this theater and below me.

Speaker 4:          01:05:02       There was a mosh pit and it was like ants on a frying pan. They were just smashing into each other and throwing people around up above them and it was quite rough and they're all having this beautifully transcendent musical experience which belied all of nihilism and it was and they absolutely thrived on it. It was like, and even the lyrics were harsh and nihilistic, but it didn't matter because the music, even if it's rough, even if it's in its rough form, was something that united them in the sense of this like pattern beauty and brought them together and so exposure to music that's people die without music. It's like music is everything. I mean it's not everything but I beg. It's everything about the beauty of this particular experience

Speaker 3:          01:05:50       I think actually don't see it as an extremely important phenomenon. It partly because traditionally dancing was dancing with someone. The width has been taken out of dancing and uh, the head bashing and so on that goes on with heavy metal and the right is dancing against someone, you know, the, the wideness of the dancers. I think there's something really. We see it in Scottish reels and things like that where the whole community is dancing in an orderly way, recognizing that their need for law and order and taking pleasure in it. And I thought, I find that a very near to a transcendent experience. Um, I, I feel a kind of narcissism has crept into the dance with, through recent forms of dance music, but I mean, that's my old geezer

Speaker 2:          01:06:42       or, or, or, or, or his or his. Um, or is it simply to say that there, that, that the principle itself is sovereign. It everyone thinks about the logic, for example, of, of, of Dante's inferno, um, uh, which has ever more degraded forms of knowing and loving, um, that, uh, that the, the mechanism of the nature of you might say the nature of the soul is the same at the top of paradise as it is at the, at the bottom of inferno, but it has all these infinite gradations of wholeness. And so I don't think we have to say that, that, that the, the mosh pit is, uh, is, is, is, is, is, is equivalent as a work of art to, to Beethoven or, or Palestrina or Janacek, but rather than perhaps what's going on in, in, in that is nonetheless a longing for the pattern and the recognition of the other that you, you say

Speaker 3:          01:07:47       yes, but your original question was how do we, how do we, a coax people back into the, into a life which is based on the recognition of the other rather than the gratification of the self. Because that's essentially what we're talking about with the today at least. And I, I would say teaching people how to help others. Uh, the role of the teacher, is it very dignified one, he's only so if the teacher actually thinks that he is helping the pupil to a body of knowledge that he has access to and that sense of helping other people is a very rare thing and it's, it's made more rare by the, the welfare state and the ready availability of subsidies for a subsidized life without leaning on any particular person, you know, uh, and I think, um, relations of dependence are actually very positive if they're accepted on both sides, you know, and I think, um, something that we don't teach the boys scouts movement and all that they used to teach a young people these things teach people how to go out and help those who needed them and how to make those little day to day sacrifices.

Speaker 3:          01:09:10       Um, and eventually through the process of imitation and imagination, a character grows based on that. I feel that there isn't any obstacle to this. It's a very simple form of education. All of us can do it. And all of us who have children do it. I'm sure Jordan does it with his children the same as I with mine. Of course, you know, you're always disappointed. They always go away into the corner with the, with their wretched little iphones and so on. But nevertheless, um, it, some of it rubs off and you know, that in the long run they will be capable not just of finding love, but also of offering forgiveness and working for rick reconciliation. I don't think in a sort of narcissistic culture which is propagated by the media and by the universities, uh, that, um, that they're being pointed in that direction. That is true. But then it's up to us to point them in another direction.

Speaker 4:          01:10:15       I think as an academic, we talked already about that place where the meaning and the fact are conjoined and that's the proper place to lecture from because people who lecture constantly make the presumption that they're there to deliver a set of facts. But there's an infinite set of facts. And so at the very least, you have to select the facts and there's a mechanism that selects the facts and what, what you want to do as an academic is, is tell your students through, through direct discourse and also through action about something that you've encountered that you've fallen in love with and to, and to communicate the love that you have for that, the love for literature and, and not to say, well, you should read this book, but to say, well, here's this book and here's what it can open up for you and this is how it does it.

Speaker 4:          01:11:05       And, and this is what you'll gain from it. It's an inestimable gain and there's some struggle in it. But, but there's a, there's something it that's of, of, of unbelievable utility. And you have to believe that in order to communicate it. And then that's. So that opens one of those doors, you know, and maybe some students will step through that and think, well maybe that sounds like something I need. I'm in this dire situation and I need something. I need a life raft. I need to. It needs something to boy me upward and it's gonna. Take some effort obviously because nothing worthwhile comes without effort to communicate that commitment you have to these two, these two, these phenomena, the phenomena that we already talked about to beauty and truth and to literature and entered the classics in the humanities. It isn't enough to to say what they are and to transmit them.

Speaker 4:          01:11:52       It's to. It's to manifest yourself as a living part of that tradition and to end to show yourself thereby as a model for living out as much as you can, what that tradition represents, and to show that that's so much better than like a short term pleasure seeking nihilism, that they're not even in the same conceptual universe and people are far more open to that. They know already. People know, especially when they're hurt. They know that happiness is fleeting and that suffering requires a sustaining meaning. Everyone who's lived knows that and so to say, well, here's some bomb for the suffering and it's profound and deep and and here's what it's meant to me and here's how you can incorporate it into your life. It's like people are absolutely starving for that or dying of thirst for them.

Speaker 3:          01:12:42       This connects with what you earlier said about the curriculum, the, that the old way of teaching the humanities was in that manner. Uh, as objects of love. This is what I have loved what previous generations have loved to and handed onto me. Hey, try it out and you will love it too. Whereas the postmodern curriculum is a curriculum of hatred. It's, it's a, uh, directed against a cultural inheritance. One after another. The work separated before us, stripped naked and thrashed, you know, uh, um, uh, by what, by revealing whatever ideology will power structure is being concealed within them. And that's, of course there's not why they were written and it's not how they should be understood.

Speaker 4:          01:13:29       It's not why they survived. Exactly either. But like this is the best that the best of us could produce and it's nothing. Why should you bother? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:13:38       yeah, exactly. And it means that students who go through that curriculum come out with a sentence of the hopelessness of everything and thus are successfully educated by postmodernist standards. Yeah, yeah. I suppose that's right. But, um, you know, there's no reason why one should, one should accept this one. Oh, all good things begin, uh, in the, in small areas because, because two or three people, uh, you know, well, it's Christ said two or three are gathered my name there am I with you, but at the same as it is an old couch, right activities, it's perhaps a friendship will, will, uh, will be gay. It will start up a reading group and after that reading group, there'll be others come in gradually if it's founded on love of the thing that's being studied and offered, he will always try and fit in the long run over this negativity. The problem is the negativity is subsidized. It's subsidized by universities who are paid for by governments who are paid for by tax payers and so on. Uh, and the, the answer is to take away those subsidies and, uh, and deprived of education completely of money. And it will be back with us again.

Speaker 4:          01:14:57       I suppose I suggested something like that in public in Canada not so long ago, to cut the budgets of the universities across the board by 25 percent and let them sort themselves out because, but the, the no subsidy idea at least forces those who provide education to do it purely on its merits and the fact that these counterproductive disciplines, let's say have been subsidized for so long, has given them a power that's far, far outstrips their, their credibility and their attractiveness. Right

Speaker 2:          01:15:29       now. I wanted to, to point out a, it will this, this, this chat may be seen by a few people online at some point and draw attention to the vet that we're all wearing poppies to, of course, is a, is a, is a, is a symbol of respect and memory for an inheritance of our own past, uh, for the, the suffering that has given us or at least protected and given us so much that we hold dear. I'd like to ask you both about memory and the inheritance of the past and, and what it means to have a pedagogy of what it means to have a pedagogy of the transcendent, uh, in relation to our past. How do you open open those, those, those doorways, and perhaps, uh, if, if the spirit moves you to a speak about works that you love, that you've been able to open up to others.

Speaker 3:          01:16:35       One of the reasons for remembering in the way that we remember the armistice in the first world war, one of the reasons is, is gratitude and gratitude is in short supply in our societies today. And, um, it's the, it's the greatest gift that we can offer in fact, sorts of people who are dead because, uh, what else can we do, uh, except to acknowledge what their sacrifice. So, um, I think that gratitude is a fundamental part of memory. Um, there are, of course, accumulations of guilts and so on. Uh, and those are being emphasized all the time in the postmodern and curriculum, all the, all the ways in which we are not entitled to our inheritance. But I think in the face at that, we have to insist on the ways that we are entitled to that inheritance. If people have died for it, for, for our sake, know that isn't a fantastic title that we enjoy and we should feel grateful to them for that.

Speaker 3:          01:17:38       I mean, when it comes to actual works of art or whatever, which have opened the sense of the depth of one's own inheritance. That I think is a very interesting question. There's so many of them, but, but just to mention only one, I'm the Bach B minor mass. To me, that's a door into the, into the, the whole, uh, the whole European inheritance going back to the crucifixion. There it is. There, it all is encapsulated in music, music of celebrating the universal claims or the Roman Catholic church, but written by a Protestant, you know, that it's, um, and offered as a gift to mankind, narratives and those such things. So transcend any, any minor historical details, uh, that to unrecognized is that, that is what the past really is for one, that great depth of, uh, of inheritance that can't be enumerated, but just enjoy it.

Speaker 2:          01:18:47       Just to follow up before we turn to Jordan. Roger, at the beginning you talked about how great literature, great writing is writing in which the reader finds himself, finds herself. I'm taking box mass in b minor. Um, you've, you've spoken about the unfolding of the self that is found in these great works are the reflection of the self, I know, or at least I think you've written about the unfolding of the theme, uh, in, in, in, in of that mass in particular, but certainly in other, other of your writings, the unfolding of the theme and music. Could you say something about the. I know that's a huge question, but the way in which the unfolding of the theme in music is an unfolding of the self.

Speaker 3:          01:19:41       So really, um, provocative way of putting it. It is true that when you listen to a theme, uh, in music, you are not listening to a sequence of notes. Something begins in that first note and injures to the final node and it goes on all the way through, even though there are spells of silence, it's still going on in the silence so that our ability to hear something as a theme is already a contribution that we make. It comes out of us. So we've identified with that movement. That movement is, it's there in the world because it's there in us, but, but in so many ways, all our inner life is interrupted and unfulfilled and it's full of things that start up. And then Peter around, uh, and I think that is one of the fundamental experiences of human beings, that there's an inner disorder that things never actually come to a conclusion. But here uniquely movements begin and come to a conclusion. This is a. and that conclusion is, is complete, is that satisfaction of, of, uh, of the, uh, um, unsaturated nature of the movement of the first beginning, the, uh, and it's an, an experience. What, why do we value that? I think we value, I value it in the same way as you battle your tragedy because it gives completion. And closure to things that otherwise wouldn't ever have them

Speaker 4:          01:21:16       and things that are transient as well because it does have a beginning and an end and the end doesn't invalidate the utility of the, of the entity. That's right. So in the gratitude, I mean that was the, that was exactly the theme that sprung to mind for me as soon as you asked that question. I mean, one of the things that I find profoundly disquieting about the modern radical. Oh, uh, what would you call it? An ideology that is so. No, so unfortunately dominant on campuses among young people is that it's unbelievably ungrateful. And when I, when I walk outside and there's not a riot and death in the streets, I'm having a good day. That's my sense of history. It's like I'm constantly staggered by the fact that so much works all the time. It's absolutely. I met this guy a while back and he'd been in a motorcycle accident.

Speaker 4:          01:22:12       He really got hurt, man. He was, he was pretty much half destroyed and he worked as a telephone lineman. He worked with this guy who had Parkinson's disease who had was equally destroyed in a slightly different way and the two of them together could climb up a telephone pole and continue their job, and I thought this unbelievable infrastructure we have that is just an absolute bloody ongoing ongoing miracle is sustained by people exactly like that. You know, they're having very difficult lives and a country like Canada. They go out in the middle of the bloody winter where you die, it's frigid and something breaks and they fix it and the lights are on. The lights are on all the time and I come to somewhere like Europe and to me it's an absolutely overwhelming experience to see king's chapel today, to wander around the city. I'm just staggered that people produce this and so amazed that we could do it and so grateful that it exists.

Speaker 4:          01:23:10       We're talking about king's chapel. The people who started didn't live to see its completion. They were. They were driven by this nobility of transcendent vision and they produce these enduring forms and out of the bloody misery of history. We've erected all this spectacular infrastructure that we're so fortunate to be part of and there none of that gratitude is taught and it's partly not taught because people have no sense of the absolute catastrophe of history. I mean for me the hobbs. It's like nasty, brutish and short that the simplest and most likely social circumstances, catastrophe punctuated by hell and to see that not happening in a sustained manner constantly and to see things improving around us and and to be reliable in that manner and then not to be grateful for that. It's like it's an unbelievable combination of ignorance and willful ignorance in gratitude and willful blindness and it does no one soul any good. It's so good to walk down the streets of a beautiful town like this and to be open mouth in northern Iran, amazement at what's here and so and to not instill that sense and young people, for them to understand that they are standing on the bones of generations of people who suffered to make this possible despite all their errors and have brought this forward. It's like,

Speaker 3:          01:24:36       yeah, Whoa, whoa. This is a very a salutary lesson. Actually, because he did look into the abyss and stepped back from it and reported on it and as did shows, it's in and um, we postwar baby boomers to haven't had that experience. I had a little glimpse of it in the old communist days, but we only saw the edge of it then, you know, um, but, uh, still the sense, the sense that it is, they're always beneath your feet and the, and the crust is thin as it can be in certain places. That I think is something that young people do need to be taught without making them get gloomy about it, but to recognize that they're lucky. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:25:26       Last question before we open up for a few questions here. It seems to me that the backward looking that we've talked about, or you had a wonderful phrase, a wide eyed open mouthed at non-ironic in amazement, I think you said walking around this transcendently beautiful town of Cambridge, which houses this August and ancient and beautiful institution. I'm with. You mentioned Jordan. We're seeing the king's chapel earlier today, that those who started the work knew they wouldn't be those who would finish. And those who finished knew they had inherited to work, they had not themselves begun. And so I suppose I want to ask, um, we've talked about the, the, the, the necessity to turn back with gratitude to the past, to our inherited a past. I want to talk also about the possibility of, of building and a creation. Uh, these chapels and buildings were built at some time.

Speaker 2:          01:26:25       You, yourself are a composer. Both of you are authors of books that many, many people have, uh, found depth and truth in. So I want to, uh, to ask about, uh, the possibilities for, for, for renaissance, for rebuilding or building a new and new buildings and new forms of community, new forms of art. Perhaps new buildings have old forms of architecture, new colleges and universities, a new, more healthy and beautiful forms of, of courtship, new forms of a flourishing arts and music. Uh, it seems to me so important that, that we not lose sight of the fact that precisely the abiding truth of the transcendent in us, it gives us hope to, to answer that call.

Speaker 3:          01:27:21       Yeah. It must be the case that when, when describing our cultural inheritance, we're not just describing something that's gone, we must be describing something of which we are still a part a and which, which has to changed as we are changing to accommodate us. And all this was said by Elliot in tradition and the individual talent, you know, that, um, that the artist must be constantly trying to say that new thing that he came into the world to say, but he can only say it if he adapts his style to the, the inheritance of the tradition, thereby transforming the tradition and transforming himself. And we all were there and there is no formula for doing this because the formula is precisely what destroys the creative act. But we have to assume that new things will come and they will come through, uh, as, as they always did in the past through fasting and prayer and the occasional glass of wine.

Speaker 2:          01:28:28       My kids,

Speaker 4:          01:28:32       Jordan. Well, we could concentrate, I suppose, on building the future instead of criticizing the past. I mean, it's necessary to decompose to reconstruct those. Those acts can't be separated, but the decomposition is the prerequisite for the reconstruction and you know what I've been recommending to people is that they start on whatever scale they can start on with whatever's in front of them because they have more in front of them. Then they think these, these, these, these circumscribed areas that these small places that people can call their own, even if it's only their room, you can start to do something creative and beautiful there. I mean, I've suggested to people that they start by putting the room in order and that that implies a purpose. It's like, well, your room is somewhere that you exist. It's, it's, it's a place that surrounds you, that tells you how to be is put it in order so at least it isn't screaming chaos at you in a soul destroying manner.

Speaker 4:          01:29:31       Make it pristine and, and, and, and orderly and in a fashion that suits what you're aiming at. So have an aim and then this is perhaps a chapter in my next book. Well, maybe you start by putting your room in order and then you make it beautiful and then you learn how to make something beautiful and to make something beautiful is to make it worthwhile and to participate in that transcendent, in that transcendence. Maybe you need one certainly and for your future self, which is also others. You know, this idea that people are fat even of, of, of, of self gratification. Let's say as an antidote to nihilism will take your pleasure in the moment. It doesn't even work for you because you're stuck with you tomorrow and you next week and so even to treat yourself properly is to treat yourself as part of an ongoing community.

Speaker 4:          01:30:18       But I would say start by you start in the world. If you have some wisdom and some humility by taking the potential that lies dormant in front of you and interacting with it in the logos like manner with truth and with love, and by transforming that potential into whatever you can create out of it, that's good and and even if it's, it won't be small. If you do that, you can transform your whole household by transforming your room. You can transform your whole neighborhood by transforming your house like these things spread very, very rapidly and that is right there in front of you. You know, and people think they're impoverished now that they don't have any opportunity and that opportunity is hidden from them by their, by their, by their unwillingness to take the steps that are necessary to put what they could put in front of them in order and, and, and to, and to produce the beauty instead of the ugliness where they could do that.

Speaker 4:          01:31:17       And I don't think there is anything more powerful than that that works. I've had thousands of people tell me that it works. You know, personally come and talk to me every day now on the street and say, my life was in terrible disorder. I had no vision. I wasn't abiding by the truth. My relationships were fragmented. I've decided to make something of myself, whatever that might be. I've decided to adopt more responsibility to tell the truth and things are in comparatively better. And so that's, that's there for everyone to take, and regardless of your circumstances, and I know that some people have what appeared to be larger opportunities and more privileged in front of them, but that also makes their commensurate moral responsibility larger. So there's certain balancing

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       that's a natural consequence of that. So now recognizing the nature of the finite, there's a train one of us needs to catch, are going to have to draw this conversation to a close, but not before. We've all had a chance to thank both of you for everything you do to fan the flames of the transcendent for your readers, for your listeners, for all of us. Thank you very much. Both of you.
