Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Anyway, okay, good, good. Let's go for it. So, jared, you're going to bring us up to date.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       Yeah. So, uh, obviously a lot's been happening since, um, since we, we last spoke on this issue and um, to some extent I guess, um, what surprised me was not the amount of lawyers and paralegals and licensees that have not only reached out but apparently written to the law society on this statement of principles issue, but more importantly, the public. I'm getting a lot of, uh, outreach from the general public and I mean, you can look at the, uh, the comments on the youtube video that we put up. The general public is concerned and they are very much watching in terms of the legal, uh, uh, actors, lawyers, paralegals. Um, they, I understand there are a lot that have written, um, to the law society. Uh, the types of people that are reaching out to me, um, are a broad cross section of the industry, a very experienced lawyers, a very, um, well established lawyers.

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       Constitutional scholars are, uh, are doing their thing, but I'm also getting paralegals who a sense that there's a problem and they're also writing. One of the things that I think has been interesting through all of this is that the tone of the comments that I'm, or the feedback I'm getting has migrated in first instance. It was a, uh, an issue with, um, okay. Uh, yes, this compelled speech idea, uh, it sounds objectionable. Those same people and some new people are beginning to reach out and the, and the commentary is changing to some extent. It is now that they're beginning to examine the underlying report itself and they're coming to me with questions about, well, what does it mean that, that the, that there is systemic discrimination and racism within the legal industry. And what's interesting is I've actually got racialized licensees that are big, that are beginning to not only reach out but also publicizing their opinions on these things. And, and they're starting to grapple with that larger question of, well, what does it mean when our industry is systemically a discriminatory? So people are becoming aware. There's an awareness that's coming about. And I think a lot of that has to do with, with the media that's been coming out in tandem with, with what we did on, on Youtube.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       Yeah. So the, well in the problem with the systemic racism charges that while it's vague and that's for sure, and then it targets everyone equally in some sense within the profession and requires systemic adjustment. That's the other thing. And obviously has to be supported with hard data and it isn't self evident that the data to support that claim is valid by, I would say, by any stretch of the scientific imagination. So I've had a great deal of feedback as well from, from both lawyers and the

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       general public and they are of a mind, uh, I think as a jared described about their concerns over the forced speech aspects of this requirement. I think we should make note of the kind of response that has been generated from supporters of this policy in response to the kinds of concerns that have been raised. And a lot of those people who are insisting that this is a legitimate requirement are saying that although it's called a statement, it is not forced speech, it's simply governance conduct. And if I might, I'll just read out a quote attributed to the treasurer on this question that appeared in the La Times. Uh, the treasurer was quoted as saying with respect to the statement of values, this is a conduct obligation to recognize that we have to commit to these values and it's not a speech obligation or a thought obligation. Now, just on the face of it, that statement seems strange to say the least to say that when we have to do is to commit. And yet that's not either a thought proposition or a speech proposition even have to commit in a statement that indicates that you have.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       Right? So it begs the question of what's the definition of commit?

Speaker 3:          00:04:31       Correct? Yes. And the way that they're portraying it is that this is simply a, uh, uh, an articulation of the obligations that lawyers already have in both the rules of professional conduct and, and in the human rights code, which, which is clearly not the case, nowhere in the rules of professional conduct or in the human rights code. Is there any obligation upon anyone to promote anything?

Speaker 1:          00:04:55       Well, and also it's, if, if we, if you already have that obligation and why is it necessary to add this additional layer of, of, let's call it obedience. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:05:07       Well, let's just, let's just note the, the, the two, the two contradictions in the portrayal of this. On the one hand, it is described as not a big deal. Uh, there are no immediate sanctions to follow. You don't have to send the statement in, you just have to write it. You just have to put it in your own file. So we're not worried about it. It's, it's, it's, it's no big thing. Why are you so concerned about it? And on the other hand, they are emphasizing how central this is to the project that they had set out. And, and, and, and there are many people who have suggested essentially that if you are not willing to do this statement and indicate your agreement with a certain set of values, then you should not be allowed to be a lawyer and practice in Ontario.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       Right? Well, that certainly seems to be the end game and my sense has been watching this, that because of the public pressure, they're backing off to some degree in their public statements by moving forward into the future at some indeterminate date, the actual sanctions that will be applied. So that right now from a public relations perspective, it looks like this isn't a direct Konijn a measure and we might as well also remind people that, and they might wonder why I am here. Um, my concern when I first encountered this was that I know I know what that sinking feeling you get when you can predict the future accurately and you don't like your prediction that if the law society prevails with this, that the rest of the professional organizations in Canada will follow in lockstep very, very rapidly and will end up in a situation where every professional in Canada is required to panda statement of Principles that are essentially I'm required by, by their colleges espousing a particular political and not only political but philosophical and worldview philosophy or risk losing their licenses. And I mean, I know in the legal, in the law society already, you have to. There's a requirement that you have to undertake training in relationship to equity, diversity and inclusivity, right? That's part of what they're requiring.

Speaker 3:          00:07:22       Well, let's just read that out. In this roster of recommendations, that complication has passed his recommendation and the third party recommendation nine reads as follows, the law society will require each licensee to complete three hours of an accredited program focused on equality and inclusion with within the first three years following the adoption of the recommendations and one hour per year. They're every year thereafter, which will count towards professionalism hours for that year. So in other words, it is exactly as you've described, Jordan, uh, there, there will be training now so that you have the right attitude about these matters.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       Right? And I can just imagine what that training will be like. So.

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       Well, there was some commentary in the underlying report about unconscious bias training. And, uh, and I know, Jordan, that you've, you've had some discussions about that and some of your, uh, your public works.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       Yeah. Well, there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that unconscious bias training produces the results intended. First of all, the relationship between unconscious bias, say as assessed by the implicit association test, which is a pathological misuse of a psychological instrument. Even the people who designed it have grudgingly admitted that there's a relationship between those implicit prejudice is so to speak, which aren't even recognized universally by psychologist as implicit prejudices. The relationship between them in any case in behavior is very, very small. It accounts for very overt behavior

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       and then the evidence that you can train people out of those unconscious biases is zero. So this is, this is a misuse of science and education at, at every level from a scientific perspective. It's the inappropriate politicization of a very new line of inquiry in social psychology. And if the people who designed the IAT, in my estimation had an ounce of, of, of, uh, what would you say? Intellectual Integrity, they would denounce the misuse of their test because it doesn't fit the requirements that psychologists have laid down for validity or reliability. And that's partly why it's not admissible in court, for example.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       Well, the committees that are selecting our judges currently are being put through unconscious bias training. And so, uh, uh, question, um, whether or not the law society will, will heed the warning that you just put out there. But yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:09:52       it's very unlikely, and so you know, I've already decided that with regards to my clinical license, if I was required to undertake this kind of reeducation program and to pen a statement of principles of that sort, that I just give up my license. So the way I'm doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:10:08       So the public, that's the one thing I wanted to let you know is that you're not alone, Jordan. The, the, the, the groundswell of public feedback that, that I'm seeing and receiving directly into my office has been significant. People recognize exactly what we talked about on the last video that, that the legal industry and lawyers in particular are supposed to be that bull work against this type of overreach. And so they really very much. There's a, there's a large segment of the population that are worried. They see that if the lawyers fall down, then the rest will follow.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       Can we just make a note of one argument that has been made in favor of the statement with kids that lawyers are already subject to a set of ethical obligations and this is just a one more an extension of the same kind of idea, but there is a significant difference between the kind of ethical obligations that exist, which are essentially neutral non political obligations that relate to the way that our adversarial adjudication system is supposed to work. So it just, for example, every lawyer has an ethical obligation to avoid a conflict of interest. You can't represent both sides in a dispute because that would be contrary to the way our adversarial system that is supposed to function. That doesn't. That doesn't make any sense. You can't represent both sides in the dispute, but that ethical obligation doesn't have political content. It doesn't matter whether you are a socialist or a conservative or a classical liberal or anywhere on the political spectrum. The the. If you are functioning in this legal system, it only makes logical sense that you must proceed without in the absence of a conflict of interest, which is substantially different proposition than the proposition that these requirements are based on, which are as, as Jordan that you mentioned earlier, these are politically charged and had substantive political content in them that they'd lost. Society is essentially saying that unless you adhere to a certain ideology that you are not fit to practice law.

Speaker 4:          00:12:17       No. It's also an admission that this is, and this is, I think the more, perhaps even more dangerous element of this is that to undertake reeducation with regards to your political beliefs surrounding or even factual beliefs surrounding equity, diversity and inclusivity is to act out by implication the fact that you need that reeducation because you're part of the problem of systemic racism. And you know, it's very. It's very psychologically significant to act out in admission of your guilt. Because what happens is generally speaking, is that people then retroactively alter their self images and start to wonder about such things. You know, because they're either powereds for, for going along with the um, uh, with the requirements are liars for producing a statement of principle that they don't actually agree in or they start to tilt their beliefs in the direction that's required by the demands. And that's usually what happens. And so, and I'm quite convinced that the people who do this sort of thing who make these requirements know that and that it's a, it's a manipulation on their part to tell political belief overtly. And so it, you can't act these things out without it having psychological consequences and consequences. Moral consequences, let's say. So it's very intrusive.

Speaker 2:          00:13:45       The other thing, bruce, it's important to remember is, I mean the dichotomy between belief, thought and conduct. Currently lawyers in Ontario are subject to the rules of professional conduct. And, and I, uh, right now we have an obligation to act in a certain way and to refrain from acting in other ways. And one of the rules of professional conduct is thou shall not discriminate. And I don't think anybody would argue with that and that thou shall act in accordance with the, with the human rights regime, uh, and, and associated codes across Canada. Nobody could argue with that. But this statement of principles is crossing the line into thought and opinion. And, and one of the recommendations I would note in the, in the report, recommendation number one, they're actually proposing to review and amend where appropriate, the rules of professional conduct, the paralegal rules of conduct and commentaries to reinforce the professional obligations of all licensees to recognize, acknowledge and promote principles of equality, diversity and inclusion. Now I find that fascinating because you're going to, you're going to amend a rule of conduct to, to include of a sudden a,

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       uh, an affirmation of thought while end and to insist upon promotion as well, which is, why do you say very ill defined?

Speaker 3:          00:15:01       Yes. So, let's, let's just go back to the words just to make this point. So again, I'm going back through a, um, a quote attributed to the treasurer and the La Times piece. He says this, uh, the statement of values is an obligation to promote equality, diversity, and inclusion generally, which is nothing more than the obligation lawyers have already, but when you go to the rules of professional conduct, it says a lawyer has a special responsibility to respect the requirements of human rights laws in force in Ontario and to honor the obligation not to discriminate on the grounds of race as a place of origin, color, etc. Etc. That's Exactly as you just said, jared. This describes an obligation to observe the law and this law consists of prohibitions. That is the obligation that lawyers are under no doubt about it, but they must do so, but that does not include an obligation to endorse and it does not include an obligation to promote.

Speaker 4:          00:16:01       RighT, and we should also point out just in case it needs to be sad that none of the three of us disagree with the idea that people shouldn't be discriminated against for reasons that have nothing to do with their competence.

Speaker 3:          00:16:14       Agreed. Agreed. This is about is not what this was about and it might also be useful to talk for a moment. Also about the word equality is equality has two competing legal meanings and and the law society has not defined which one of them they mean explicitly, but it's clear by implication which one they mean, and the two choices are formal equality or substandard quality or quality of results, and the two things are quite different. Formal equality simply means that the same rules of conduct apply to everybody regardless of background of of wealth, of lineage, of heritage, and so on. Same rules apply to everybody in the same way. Equality of result means that everybody ends up in the same place and and note that these two ideas of equality are diametrically opposed and inconsistent with each other because if you have formal equality, applying the same rules to everybody because everybody is different, you're going to have different results for everybody. If you insist upon the same results for everybody. That means you need different rules for everybody for them to end up in the same place, so you cannot have both formally quality and substandard quality together. And traditionally the rule of law has included the notion of formal equality. If you have a properly functioning rule of law, that means you have the same rules applying to everybody without regard to who they are

Speaker 4:          00:17:47       with equality of outcome, which is now often termed equity, is you can group people, each individual in a multitude of different ways and it's impossible to produce equality of outcome across all those different dimensions of the comparison, so it's a never ending struggle to produce equality of outcome. It's technically impossible and and societies that have tried that have had a well, it's been absolutely catastrophic and terribly divisive.

Speaker 3:          00:18:16       It is also contrary to that fundamental legal proposition that justice is blind. Justice is supposed to be blind to all of those personal certain characteristics that one has, whether it's race or color or gender or wealth or background or lineage or or or, or political connection. Whatever it happens to be, a properly functioning judicial system doesn't take account of who you are. It simply takes account of the rules that exist and tries to ensure that the rules, those rules are, are, are enforced equally in the same way with an even hand against everybody.

Speaker 4:          00:18:54       And The so called, well, the data that has been generated is also predicated on the implicit acceptance of inequality of outcome, a doctrine, because the fact that every group isn't equally represented at outcome is the data point that's being used to indicate systemic racism. And so the, uh, so then you also think, well, what if you, what if you're in a situation where as a professional and an informed professional, you don't agree with the, with the conclusions drawn from the data set, that there is indication of systemic racism means is that now a belief that you don't get to have? Because if you are forced to write this statement of principles and alter your conduct, then you're acting out the proposition that you accept the conclusion that the reason there are some differences in representation across groups is because the enterprise is the whole legal enterprise is systemically racist and they're buying. You're also there by admitting your own culpability in relationship to that and the corruption of the entire legal system. It seems to me that you shouldn't be required to admit to that if you don't agree with it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:06       And that's the arc of the commentary, as I mentioned at the outset, is that it started in one place and the feedback I'm getting now is very much in that place that people are beginning to question, okay, what does it mean, uh, the findings of this report for me personally and for my industry? And, and what does the data say? And people are digging down on it. In fact, I just read an article the other day that said that there's actually been a doubling in the representation of racialized licensees within the industry, uh, between 2011 and 2014. Um, you know, that's not something I think a lot of people recognize is that, yes, well, the report may may have touched on something in terms of findings. Um, there's also,

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       uh, some things to celebrate. The other thing too is that you have to specify it in a report like that. If you're going to consider this something approximating a scientific investigation which you and it wasn't conducted in a manner that would meet those requirements, in my estimation, that there's going to be a lag in ethnic representation as the population demographics change because the demographics of the population from immigration are going to change more rapidly than the the than a than a representation of people in the professions just because of the necessity for the new immigrants to take time to be incorporated into the culture and so the real point of data should have been the rate at which new comers are being integrated into the profession rather than the absolute numbers of people who are there already and that's self evident and so the fact that that isn't being considered deeply in the in the data is also indicative in my opinion, of the political slapped of the interpretative framework through which the data was analyzed.

Speaker 3:          00:21:53       We'll make noTe of the irony of the way that the word diversity is being used and the means by which are being used to promote diversity. because in a sense, I'm the objectives of these recommendations is the opposite of diversity, real diversity, genuine deep diversity is diverse, includes diversity of thought, diversity of opinion, diversity of worldview, diversity of ideology, including all the other issues of diversity and diversity is a very, very important thing for a pluralistic society. You don't have diversity in a pluralistic society, then you, you must be living under some kind of tyranny because everybody is different and everybody deserves to be allowed to be different than to think different things and to behave in different ways as long as they don't encroach upon the rights of other people. But, um, but the, the vision that seems to ally underneath these provisions is a very singular one, a vision that everybody will think and, and adopt progressive values that a proper law firm consists of a group of progressively thinking lawyers, uh, that, that looked like a rainbow, um, as opposed to. So there's,

Speaker 4:          00:23:09       there's an appalling proposition underneath that tooth. It's actually factually incorrect. So the fundamental racist proposition is that racial groups differ sufficiently so that you can identify them as separate entities and that they should be treated in that manner, but the data suggests very strongly that even in situations where men and women, different temperament, um, on average, that the overlap between men and women is larger than the differences and the differences within the groups. So the differences between women and the differences between men within their own groups are larger than the differences between and women. So you don't get true diversity by selecting across groups that isn't how it works. In fact, that's actually a fundamentally racist or sexist claim right down to the core. And to predicate to assume that what you get is diversity of opinion by selecting for diversity, let's say, of race is.

Speaker 4:          00:24:05       Well, first of all it's wrong. It's just technically incorrect. And second, I don't see how that's distinguishable from the claims of the jim crow type. So the 19 fifties who said, well, you know, black people and white people are so different that they should remain segregated. It's like they're not that different. so, and, but within the groups, they're very different, but between the groups, they're not that much different. The differences aren't, aren't like the differences between men and women aren't nonexistent, but even then you wouldn't select on the basis of those differences to produce diversity of opinion. So yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:24:41       but it's not the diversity of thought model that, that organizations are including our own governments are pursuing at this point, the philosophy side. He's not alone in that, in assuming that, that people who all think alike but that have different racial or gender backgrounds, um, is in fact diversity. I mean the ontario securities commission has been mandating that type of diversity on, on boards of directors for publicly traded companies. Um, you know, the, the, the federal government in its cabinet appointments is pursuing that, that type of diversity that really is not a diversity of thought, so to speak or opinion. But a diversity of, of, um, well in, in the federal government's case, gendered.

Speaker 4:          00:25:21       Yeah. Well, the other thing that's going to happen is that if we, you know, the people who hold the political views that are pushing these ideas forward are convinced beyond, um, beyond argument that what they're going to do is to what the instantiation of these policies is going to result in is increased racial harmony and let's say harmony between the sexes, but I think you could make a very strong case for exactly the opposite, which is the more that we define people by race and gender, the more that people are going to be defined by race and gender. And I don't see that at all. I Really don't see that as a recipe for social harmony. I don't think it's worked in the United States at all. Quite the contrary. And we actually have a pretty harmonious society already by, by any reasonable standard, any reasonable world standard. And I think that this will inflame tensions between groups unnecessarily.

Speaker 2:          00:26:17       Well, I actually had a, a lawyer reach out to me, a racialized licensee and say exactly that, that their main concern with what they were seeing, not only in the compelled speech component on the statement of values, but also the underlying recommendations of the report is he thought that that was going to inflame tensions or animosity towards people in his group. And, and I, I had never thought of it that way, but he was quite concerned that this was actually to, to generate anamis against those that actually sought to protect. So that's, that's one viewpoint that I hadn't, hadn't expected.

Speaker 3:          00:26:51       So should we are discussed for a moment on the emotion that is being brought to complication. A joe [inaudible] who is a lawyer in an adventure, uh, has, uh, put together a motion to change the nature of the statement of values requirement. And perhaps I'll just read out the key provision of this motion, moved that convocation, approve that no licensee who has a conscientious objection to the adoption of a statement of principles shall be required to comply with recommendations. And they shall be exempted from the requirements of recommendation three, one to adopt and abide by a statement of principles. Now I'm joe is a fellow that has my utmost respect. Uh, he's, uh, he's, he's done a great deal of good inside complication, I think as, as a venture. And I admire his willingness to put forward this motion, which means he's sticking his head up from a crowd that doesn't really want to stick their heads up. Absolutely. But nevertheless, they're there. There are some difficulties with the emotion. Jared, do you want to speak to that first?

Speaker 2:          00:28:05       Well, yeah. So, uh, the motion itself, somebody was talking to me about it and they said the problem is, is that, um, it makes it appear that if one elects not to file the statement of values. So if you, if the motion is passed and they, they then decide I'm not going to file the statement of values on that basis that you would be seen or it would be interpreted as you being a conscientious objector to the values that the law society statement of values is, is asking us to affirm. And, and it rather than an objection to this idea of compelled speech or being forced to disclose or divulge what may be in your head or what your thoughts and opinions may be, and I, and I hadn't thought of it that way, but when you look at the motion, yes, it very much can be interpreted that way.

Speaker 3:          00:28:49       Right? And so in essence, it does not save you from having to, uh, uh, to, to perform the forced speech obligation. Just use you another thing to indicate which essentially requires you to stick your head up and be counted one way or the other. In other words, the law society is still succeeding at dividing people between those people who are willing to do the statement and those people who refuse to do it, but have to say that they refused to do it. So there is still forced speech in here, even if the motion passes.

Speaker 2:          00:29:26       Yeah, I don't think it gets us to where we need to be. Um, you know, and as you said, I think joe's, uh, joe's a tremendous person deserves a lot of respect. He's fighting his own free speech battles before, before the supreme court of Canada in early november. Um, as you may know, he, he was, uh, accused of crossing some imaginary line about the conduct of his defense. I'm a of an individual before the courts and, and that is a very novel idea. Uh, and so, uh, the industry is watching with some interest to see what the supreme court of Canada says about whether or not there is a line in the sand as to the type of advocacy can pursue. So he is, uh, uh, joe is somebody to watch and someone respected. But I think the emotion comes up slightly short of where it needs to be. I don't think it gets us to the plAce that I think we need to be, which is that the law society should not be mad meddling or even asking what the, uh, what the thoughts in and conscience is of its members.

Speaker 3:          00:30:22       Right? So As of right now, there is nothing on the table that as far as we are, we're concerned that vex offers the possibility of, of eliminating the objectionable aspect of this forced speech obligation on flooding.

Speaker 2:          00:30:41       Know iT's interesting. Go ahead Jordan.

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       Okay. Well, we'd also talked a little bit about the fact that, you know, we had concentrated specifically on the statement of principles as the objectionable element of the recommendations, but the recommendations as a package or also objectionable because they're all fed by the same underlying philosophy of, of well systemic racism, let's say, and, and the promotion of equity, diversity, and, and equality as the highest of, of, of moral values. So do we want to talk a little bit about the rest of the recommendation?

Speaker 3:          00:31:16       Sure. Yeah. Let's. Well, let's, let's, uh, I'll, I'll read out the first one. Perhaps the first one, uh, gives a flavor for the whole, the whole host of them. So the first one goes like this. The law society will review and amend where appropriate the rules of professional conduct and the paralegal rules of conduct and commentaries to reinforce the professional obligations of all licensees to recognize, acknowledge, and promote principles of equality, diversity and inclusion, consistent with the requirements under human rights legislation and this special responsibilities of licensees in the legal imperiled legal profession. Now, um, the, there are those words, again,

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       we talked on. You also mean if you abide by that, that you have to accept the definition of diversity as essentially predicated both on race and sex.

Speaker 3:          00:32:07       Uh, yeah. Well, yeah. Well, of course they haven't defined diversity, but consistent with the rest of the regime. Yes. That, that, that in the way that we have previously described that that is the meaning of diversity that they're going for. And also the meaning of equality as I suggested earlier. Right. So, um, the, and of course there's their internal contradictions in the statement because they're going to amend the rules of professional conduct. So as to reinforce obligations that don't exist, would they really mean to say is we're going to change them so as to create new obligations. The, um, requirements under human rights legislation that this recommendation refers to act again, do not include the obligation to acknowledge and promote. They are, they are conduct laws that everybody is subject to, but they prohibit certain things. So, um, so like the statement, uh, this first recommendation that gives the flavor of all the rest of them, uh, suggests that the law society is essentially moving into a new area, an area of regulating competence. And if I can put it this way, instead of being a, a neutral regulator of competence in the political sentence, uh, they have now more or less taken on the mandate of regulating competence in, in the political sense, in the ideological sense. They are essentially saying, here are some values that regulator is going to require you to comply with these values. Essentially our progressive values. So in the digital or not a progressive lawyer, we do not think that you have the right to practice law in this province

Speaker 2:          00:33:50       and as the only values that are going to be the subject of a statement of values. they are elevating those, uh, to a position of prominence. Uh, and I would suggest beyond all others,

Speaker 3:          00:34:03       yes, sure. The, these, these, these values because of their, of their listed in a special way. It seemed to be put above other more fundamental values like the rule of law, like formal equality, like competence or like, like, well, competence you would think would be the core mandate of the law society itself. And my competence, I mean skills, knowledge and compliance with ethics, professionalism, professional. This also seems to be to be reflective of a constant push on the part of political ideologues, of the progressive type

Speaker 4:          00:34:43       to mandate that have all the rights that canadians enjoy or perhaps the obligations they have to undertake, that the rights of the rights that are associated with equality, diversity and inclusivity are going to be made paramount in relationship to all of the other rights. And that seems to me to be an utter catastrophe. So.

Speaker 2:          00:35:06       well, the proponents of the, uh, of the statement of values, the people that I've seen writing commentary pieces, none of them seem to disagree that there is a compelled speech component inherent in the statement of values. What they do is they say, okay, but under section one of the charter and an oaks test analysis that infringement on freedom of conscience, freedom of thought, freedom of expression is reasonable to attain the objective of equality, which is also a competing right under the charter. And inevitably, and I think they have a point, a, anytime the supreme court of Canada has engaged in a section one analysis on freedom of speech, uh, that, that butts up against the competing equality, right? They tend to find that save and except for the most egregious infringements that the equality rights shall prevail or be the, the tipping factor. And so it's like I said, it's interesting that the proponents, they don't disagree. Oh yeah, we're putting a compelled speech component on you, but it's a very effective.

Speaker 3:          00:36:09       Also note this though, because the first part of section 15 it, is it really a section about formal equality vii, the equal application of laws to everybody. What does not the, the quality of their talking about. So they, they are, they aren't shifting the ground on what equality means and then staying and that content kind of equality justified the infringement of these, of these other rights under section one, as you say. So do you want to continue bruce? With. So, so let me, let me read another one. Um, let me just find it here. Uh, I want to read the one. Here we go. This is recommendation 10. This is, I want to read this one because it just reinforces the proposition that we spoke about which is at the law society is, is changing the nature of competence to encompass a certain set of political values. So they're doing this explicitly. Recommendation 10 says as follows, the law society will include the topics of cultural competency, equality and inclusion in the professions as competencies to be acquired in the license, the process. So if you are along a young lawyer, a young law school, graduate, and you were applying to be licensed by the law society, these are among the things that you must show to them that you are competent in, that you, you, you believe and agree and follow. These particular values,

Speaker 2:          00:37:35       it'll be on the bar exam. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:37:41       Yeah. Shelly, continue on. There's the uh, there's the same. Uh, I believe I read out already is the requirement for the continuing education matter. Let, let's move to one of the recommendations that are being put in place this year. The statement of values is, is one on the and the other one that is mandatory for work legal workplaces have over a 10 lawyers goes like this. The law society will require a, a licensee representative of each legal workplace of at least 10 licensees in ontario to develop, implement and maintain a human rights diversity policy or their legal workforce addressing at the very least fair recruitment, retention and advancement which will be available to members of the profession and the public upon request.

Speaker 4:          00:38:37       So, so there, there's a measurement issue because measurement, an enforcement issue. So the measurement issue is well what is fair and how is it defined? So is it defined by the racial makeup of the firm over the next 10 years? So if it doesn't shift in the required direction, let's say, or the gender makeup of the firm, it doesn't shift in the required direction. Does that mean you're out of compliance, like the details in this sort of the measurement details and this sort of thing really matter who defines fair and then what's enforced and who's going to like it are, are the firm's going to be subject to an external analysis that examines their, their diversity makeup over some period of time? And is there, is there going to be provisions about how rapidly the, the, uh, the ethnic and sex makeup of the firm has to transform across time? Like the devil's in the details in this sort of thing.

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       They're proposing actually that a, that a member of the workplace conduct, uh, an inclusion self-assessment every, every two years to get at the measuring component.

Speaker 4:          00:39:43       And so what's an inclusion self-assessment mean? Exactly. What do you think that means? Does that mean what do you do? Do you lift list your race mean or do you, do you, do you examine your soul to determine whether you're, you're oriented in the proper inclusive in this direction in relationship to race and gender? Like I don't understand. I don't because I'm a measurement guy. Fundamentally, you know, I don't understand how these things are going to be assessed. They are not easy to assess. And then there's the enforcement problem.

Speaker 3:          00:40:17       I, I really don't know what the word inclusion means. I have ideas about what a quality can mean. I have ideas about what diversity can mean. I don't know what inclusion means. I, I really just don't understand the word. I don't know how you measure it. I don't know what you mean by that.

Speaker 2:          00:40:35       The law society has been collecting data for four years. Uh, I'm on these types of demographics on the basis of a, a voluntary survey basis. Um, and so what they've, they're actually proposing to go further is that within these legal workplaces that these workplaces conduct inclusion surveys now, there was a tremendous amount of conversation at the convocation meeting that adopted these recommendations about compelling people to self identify within some sort of demographic group or the other and that there would be some, there's, there would be some risk resistance, particularly among racialized licensees of doing so, so they're going to make it voluntary, but that then goes to the issue of what's the quality of the data that they're getting, Jordan, if it's a voluntary self reporting exercise and not everybody's reporting because as they said at convocation, some groups may be, uh, disinclined or fearful of, of identifying themselves for whatever reason, what's the quality of the data they're getting, and then how are they going to act on that data?

Speaker 4:          00:41:39       Yeah. Or maybe even unwilling to identify themselves. Well, that's what I told you. I don't see why, why it's free. It should be required of me that I reveal my what, what, which aspects of my identity, what am I going to reveal? So I mean obviously I'm white, whatever the hell that means, so, but there's all sorts of other aspects of my identity that for, for example, I might want to keep private

Speaker 2:          00:42:03       even the existing data on which they founded a, the finding of systemic discrimination. The empirical data was based on voluntary survey data. So we're not even certain that we're getting what I would say is his confidence send census type quality data.

Speaker 3:          00:42:19       So I read you another one of these recommendations, a recommendation 12, two, it says that the law society will revise the rules of professional conduct and the paralegal rules of conduct where appropriate so that the discrimination is clearly identified as a breach of professional conduct requirements.

Speaker 4:          00:42:44       So say that. Say that again.

Speaker 3:          00:42:45       Yes, I, I will. The law society will revise the rules of professional conduct where appropriate so that systemic discrimination is clearly identified as a breach of professional conduct requirements.

Speaker 4:          00:43:02       Okay. So that means that at some point in the future could be assessed for its compliance with equality. However, that's defined perhaps as equality of outcome, but we don't know. Or with regards to rate of transformation of demographic membership, and if you're found not to be in compliance, whatever that means, then that means that you've. You've engaged in proFessional misconduct.

Speaker 3:          00:43:28       Yes, but it's interesting that they used the word systemic discrimination because that meant we're talking, we've used that term in the past to talk about the profession and that's the way they use that term in the report that the profession has a problem of systemic discrimination, so I'm just puzzling over the use of that term in this particular recommendation because it suggests that if you are or your firm is, is guilty of systemic discrimination, then that is a matter of reaching your conduct obligation.

Speaker 4:          00:43:59       What does that. Does that mean that every single lawyer in the firm is guilty of that because that's what systemic would imply. It also begs the question of how many people you need to be systemically racist before you actually have a system?

Speaker 2:          00:44:14       Well, they're going to be doing a benchmarking exercise. I mean, that's part of it is that you're going to have to submit these inclusion assessments to the law society and then they're actually going to review that as against the industry as a whole, uh, in terms of finding out where you're at on your inclusivity. And so my concern would that they find systemic discrimination within an organization because it falls short of, of what the industry writes wide standard is in terms of it's um, well, it's diversity a layup

Speaker 4:          00:44:43       date. Right? And so what that'll mean fundamentally, it's, let's say that you have a firm that has, that it's a small firm, say 10 people and all of the people in it happened to be caucasian just for the sake of argument. So that mean that you'll be mandated to hire by race for the next while.

Speaker 2:          00:45:00       Well, your systemics, you're just, you're systemically discriminatory organization. I think.

Speaker 4:          00:45:06       Let's, do you mandated to do that? How is that legal? How is that possibly illegal to be mandated to hire by race

Speaker 3:          00:45:15       only by virtue of the mandate that the law society has from the government to regulate the, the legal professional. I mean that, that, that what it has to rest on, if, if you read the statutory mandate of the law society, it would seem to fall outside the marching orders and the law society has at least as it is simply worded. The prompts I can read you that this is, this is a, a section 41 of the law society act. Uh, sorry. Let me read first, section four, point one. This is the function of the law society is to ensure that all persons who practiced law in ontario or provide legal services in ontario meet standards of learning professional competence and professional conduct that are appropriate for the legal services they provide. So unless you can fit this into the phrase professional conduct then then under this section there is no mandate to do these kinds of things.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       I was going to read section 41 which lists a the standards of professional competence that the law society supposed to ensure. And section 41 says a licensee fails to meet standards of professional competence for the purpose of this act. If, and there are a number of things listed, but the ones that are relevant here are a, if there are deficiencies in the licensees knowledge, skill or judgment or the licensees attention to the interests of clients, and those are the only two bits of that section that applied to this question and they don't apply. They don't destroy drive the nature of these obligations that are being contemplated.

Speaker 4:          00:46:55       Can you zoom? If I was applying for a job at a law firm that was a compelled by this mandate to diverse itself, diversify itself racially and I was a qualified candidate and I got wind of the fact that that requirement had been put in place, couldn't I go after the firm for discrimination because they made race a, one of the basis of hiring that they were compelled to make race one of the basis of hiring

Speaker 2:          00:47:19       the, uh, the human rights code and the charter of rights and freedoms allow for certain forms of discrimination when it's, uh, when it's for the purposes of an amelia amelia exercise. Um, for instance, if there is systemic discrimination identified, the charter will permit discrimination against a group in order to remedy what it may be perceived as a systemic discrimination issue. This, I mean specifically addresses and exempts, uh, affirmative action type programs as, as being found to be discriminatory and allows them, it permits them. So the answer would be yes, you could raise that, um, but the but the law firm and the law society, if they would have to then bring forward evidence that this is part of a, a, you know, an affirmative action type program that is exempted and I'll let you, you're allowed to discriminate on that basis.

Speaker 3:          00:48:11       We, for a moment just turned to one of the justifications that have been given for this whole slate of recommendations. This whole program which is that your, your membership in the law society is a voluntary thing. You don't have to belong to the law society. This is not the state coming down and requiring all its citizens to do a certain thing. You have chosen to be a member of the law society and therefore you must take these obligations on voluntarily. Which of course is a ridiculous thing to say because the law society takes its mandate from the government. The government has, has given the law society of the job, of being the gatekeeper, um, of, of the, of the rights to practice law. And if you are to practice law in this province, you, you must be a member and you must adhere to the rules of conduct that they, that they require you to suggest that, that your at your, uh, your engagement with the law society is something that you do a voluntarily just because you wish to do so. And that makeS it a voluntary organization. It is in a.

Speaker 4:          00:49:23       Right? So the voluntary aspect is that you can give up your heart one livelihood if you don't want to be subject to these rules. Yes. So I suppose you could make a case that that's voluntary, but I mean it's certainly the case that it stretches. It certainly stretches the definition of what normal people would consider volunteering.

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       Well, it, it, it, it turns, it turns the idea that you would have a, you would have a right to practice in any profession if you have the proper skill and training and competence to do so. That question is, is up for grabs now because they're essentially saying, well actually what you also have to do is go along with our vision the way things are supposed to be and the way you think. And if you don't choose to go along with that way, well then you're free to go off and do something else

Speaker 2:          00:50:19       and what other people's values migrate over time. So it is right now, you know, these, these values that we're looking at in the statement of principles here. But what if they migrate over time, what could they become? You know, and I think it sets a precedent that, that we might want to push back against

Speaker 4:          00:50:33       swelled it, it's worrisome because the values are very ill defined. And so an ill dEfined like a box that could contain anything ends up containing a very strange number of things. And you know, bruce pointed that out very clearly when he talked about his inability to understand what constitutes inclusivity. It's like, okay, so let's say that we could, we could define equality and diversity if we were willing to even using racial and gender categories, which I think is a unbelievably catastrophic error. But okay. Inclusivity. Well if that's definition list, then it's a place to put any other requirements that might come along. I don't know. I really can't say what it. What does inclusivity mean? Is that more like the nonverbal behavior that you might manifest, you know, or, or, or is it, does it refer to more subtle interactions within the firm? That's kinda what it sounds like. So yeah. So at least it might be worthwhile trying to find out what they mean by inclusivity.

Speaker 2:          00:51:40       No. If they really want to be inclusive, they would get rid of the bar admission exams. They would get rid of the loss of law school record underlying requirements. I mean that's essentially makes your organization inclusive, doesn't it? When you get rid of the barriers to entry

Speaker 4:          00:51:54       fish and too is that if you went and analyzed the uh, the success rate at with regards to the bar exam, that you'd find that it produced systemic discrimination as well because the probability that that an objective test produces exactly the same results across all conceivable groups is zero. So, and you know, you see this sort of thing happening in the United States already where competency requirements produce group differences, especially if you analyze enough group differences. and so what happens then is the competency requirements are gerrymandered to eliminate the group differences. So, and that's all part of an assault, I would say on the idea of objective competence. so book are there, are there more, are there more statements that are worth analyzing?

Speaker 5:          00:52:46       Well, let's just have a look here. I mean there's a, there's a whole a whole roster of them, but I think those are the ones that are most pressing. Um, well, well I thought there was, there was

Speaker 2:          00:52:56       an interesting one. It was, it was recommendation 12 sub for they want, they want to create a specialized and trained team to address complaints of discrimination. Now, I mean, I don't argue that, I mean discrimination in any act of discrimination that is a contravention of, of human rights legislation should be stamped out. It should be, it should be identified and dealt with. But my understanding is that we've got the bodies that are responsible for already not only the spirit court, but also the, uh, the human rights tribunals. So I, I wonder what that, I mean I read that and I say that that's a swat team. There's a swat team that's going to swoop in on the noncompliant, systemically discriminatory organizations and sort them out that, that concerns me to some extent, particularly, like I said, because we have this, we have these bodies already in place that are supposed to deal with these types of things. They're doing

Speaker 4:          00:53:50       get bodies. So you have the classic court system plus the ontario human rights tribunals which already have their own problems.

Speaker 3:          00:53:57       So the word in that recommendation, that consciously real concern is the word address. This, this team will address complaints of discrimination. Now that doesn't say whether or not they are the investigator or whether they are the adjudicator or whether or not they're a combination of the two, whether or not they are judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one. I would be much more comfortable if they were procedurally precise to say exactly what the function of this so called team was supposed to be.

Speaker 2:          00:54:26       But what's, I mean, what's it for? We've got a human rights commission that can come into any organization and workplace in ontario without a warrant, uh, and do this, whatever it is these, this, this group wants to do. So I, I questioned creating another layer of bureaucracy. But.

Speaker 3:          00:54:40       Well, I agree, I agree. But what I mean, one of the needs for this might be because of the point that we made earlier, which is that the requirements of the law society is now creating our, are not the same as they are under the human rights code. Right? So the human rights commission and tribunal might not have jurisdiction because that's not what the access. And if, if these do we create extra and additional requirements that are not now, um, uh, the doe now apply to lawyers, then you do need an extra bureaucracy to, to enforce them because nobody else has the jurisdiction to do so.

Speaker 4:          00:55:18       Right? And then you can pursue, I think without any fearing error that the people who would constitute such a team would be the ones who would be most zealously in favor of precisely this kind of progressive, let's call it. You would expect. Oh yes, definitely. That, that's how it works.

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       Well, if they're in favor of compelled speech and think that that's justified, then I would question what other fundamental rights and freedoms they, they might a dean to stamp stamp upon.

Speaker 4:          00:55:50       Alright. So maybe we should move from dance. one of the things we discussed was perhaps asking for more public involvement in our campaign, let's say. Um, and so I believe that we're going to provide contact information for the benchers, is that correct? And asked members of the public to listen very carefully to the discussions that we've had and to indicate to the benchers their concern about this in terms of its relationship to the broader public potential relationship to the broader public sat,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       the law society is, is his mandate is to, is to govern the profession, but within the, I guess the best interest of the public to protect the public. And so the public very much as a stakeholder in what's happening right now within the legal industry and the law society. And so absolutely I would encourage the public to, to make any concerns that they may have known, um, and right to the people that make these decisions and let them know their thoughts because this is, this is something like this was a, a public trust in this industry to some extent. And so the public, very much it hasn't. It should be vested in what's happening.

Speaker 4:          00:56:57       Yeah. Well, it's a fundamental public trust because it, it deals with the, the underlying structure of the legal system. And so it, this is partly why this is so worrisome to me because I know perfectly well that if, if the lawyers fold on this and the law society succeeds in pushing forward these requirements and then, and then enforcing them across time, that every professional organization in Canada is going to follow suit. And after that, well, once the professional organizations follow suit, then there's no, there's no reason to assume that this isn't going to spread more widely.

Speaker 3:          00:57:33       So the, the, the, the, the main justification underlying all of this that the law society is relying on is the public interest. So if, if the public doesn't think this reflects their interest, they had better say so.

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       And the licensees obviously a, anything they can do to reach out, I think is, uh, is some assistance. I think the current motion that's before the law society is to a great extent, a byproduct of that groundswell of support or opposition, I guess you'd say. I'm from lawyers and paralegals. And if they can direct those efforts and continue them, I think it can be of some assistance.

Speaker 6:          00:58:16       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:58:18       Alright. So we broadened the scope of what we regard as worthy of opposition, partly because the attempts, let's say so far to ameliorate the worst elements of the policies that are being promoted are insufficient for the task and even if they were put into place like the motion that you described it would be a victory at 10 percent or something like that. And, and not, not move the underlying, um, pathological principals in my estimation far enough. It's something like that. It wouldn't eradicate the threat that we've been trying to warn people about.

Speaker 3:          00:58:58       correct. That's right there. There is no immediate prospect right now of, of getting rid of the forced speech element of this policy and the other elements are consistent with that, that requirement and are being carried along. And, and although only three of the recommendations are being put in place immediately, the rest will follow into a course and there's no reason to think that they won't be done aggressively. And uh, and was forced.

Speaker 4:          00:59:31       Alright. Well I guess, do you guys have anything else to say? I mean, maybe thank you to the people who've already been paying attention and

Speaker 3:          00:59:42       well, let's, let's just thank the people who have gone ahead already and, and contacted their benchers contact with the law society to, to register their objection to ask questions. A lot of people have done a very good things on and, and our thinking well about this. They, they're thinking intelligently. They're thinking broadly. They the lie. My hat's off to them. There are a great number of people who, who are very clear about this and some are reticent to make too much of a fuss. Some are quite happy to say what they think and I respect both of those positions. Um, but, but I guess the message overall is there are a great many people who think this and the, that the worst outcome would be that nobody acts upon what they think. And this just sort of happens without us noticing.

Speaker 2:          01:00:34       I've been heartened by the but by what I see to be singular acts of courage in the people that have taken action written to the law society and even just reaching out to, to my office and to others. It's not easy to do. And, and I, you know, I support and, and commend those that are doing that

Speaker 3:          01:00:53       and people have written, people have written articles and blog posts. There are some really excellent pieces of work on this topic and perhaps we could even refer, um, uh, provide links to some of those sources. But, but, uh, they're really worth a read a reading. They're very well done, very thoughtful pieces and they have a ring of truth to them

Speaker 2:          01:01:14       from all over to them from outside. I've seen things from outside the jurisdiction. I'll, I think New Zealand, there's a great,

Speaker 3:          01:01:21       great blog by a professor at university of auckland in New Zealand who's written on this. It's, it's, it's well worth the read.

Speaker 4:          01:01:27       Yeah. Well, these things do have international significance because my observation has been that if one major jurisdiction or organization in the west moves forward in this hypothetically progressive direction, the probability that it will spread because of rapid electronic communication and pretty decent organization on the part of the people who do push these things forward, that it, that it emerges everywhere with extraordinary, extraordinary rapidity. So anyone who shares the basIc axioms of our legal system is, is involved in this whether they like it or not.

Speaker 7:          01:02:07       Right.

Speaker 4:          01:02:10       All right, well I guess we'll see what happens and maybe will provide an update again in a couple of weeks.
