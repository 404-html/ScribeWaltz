Speaker 1:          00:00          We focus on the idea of happiness too much in the. The problem with that is is that it takes our focus away from ames that would be more productive. It's much better to aim for meaning then for happiness.

Speaker 2:          00:15          12 rules for life is about how to live properly in the face of vulnerability, tragedy, and malevolence. One of the propositions in 12 rules for life is that life existence is usefully characterized as an interplay of order and chaos or unknown unknown. You're always striving to balance those two. If if, if what you're doing is too familiar your board and if what you're doing is to unfamiliar, then you're anxious and what you want to do is find the, the, the harmonious line between those two, but that's signified by leaning. If you can get those two things right, then you can have your cake and eat it too. I hope people can take away the idea that there is a motive being in the face of the vulnerability and tragedy of life that is noble and powerful and capable of sustaining them through the worst possible times without becoming corrupt and bitter.
