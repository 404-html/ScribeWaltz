Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So here's how to conceptualize yourself in union terms.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       The part of you that you consider you roughly speaking young, considered the ego and you might think about that as the most individual part of your cycle. Physiological being,

Speaker 2:          00:00:28       I mean

Speaker 1:          00:00:30       the difference between individual and collective in that sense is that you share very many attributes with other people. Obviously your physical form is very much like that of other people. And then you share attributes with other living creatures way back down the phylogenetic chain. And so in that regard, there's nothing specifically individual about you.

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       But the part of you that you identify with most completely and that you regard as unique, that's the union ego. Now young sort of conceptualized your psyche as a, as a, I would say as a place I suppose that many spirits could inhabit and you might think about a spirit.

Speaker 2:          00:01:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       From, from the union perspective as

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       a personality that can inhabit the psyche. And so like all of the psychoanalysts young regarded the psyche as a relatively loose collection of partially integrated personalities. And each of those personalities had their own perspective, their own thoughts. Like their own way of looking at the world. That would be the perspective, their own thoughts, their own emotions, their own habits, their own actions. And those are roughly aggregated into some sort of unity. And that was the, that was the ego.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       Now

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       ego has a public face and the public face, you don't call it the persona. Persona means mask and the persona is both that part of you that you showed other people instead of the part that you hide. And then also to some degree it might be the form that your ego takes even to you. So for example, if you're a naive person, you might think that your public face is all there is a view that the rough difference between the ego and the persona might be conceptualize this way that you know there are things that you think that you won't say in public, maybe not even in private.

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       Some of those things you're pretty aware of and those would be thoughts that are relevant to the ego but not the persona. And then some of them you don't even really want to be aware of and young would consider those more associated with the shadow now.

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:16       The Shadow, the existence of the shadow. First of all, you might want to remember that the best way to conceptualize umes archetypical constructions is in some sense as metaphors. So you could say that while you thought that it was useful to separate up the psyche into persona, an ego and then shadow, it isn't that there aren't other ways that it could be broken up, but breaking it up this way is useful for certain purposes. And Yoni regarded this terminology as particularly useful from a psychoanalytic perspective and also from a historical perspective. So perhaps the divisions could have be made, could be made otherwise, and there are many ways of looking at archetypes, but this is sufficiently useful to progress with.

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       Now,

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       people's personas are generally somewhat harmless and somewhat socialized. If you don't know how to act in public, you don't have a well crafted persona. You know, some of you are going to be the kinds of relatively deep thinking intellectuals who think that small talk is nonsense and uh, there is some utility in that thinking because in some sense, from a philosophical sense, obviously it's nonsense. But if you don't know how to make small talk, basically what that means is that you have a poorly developed persona. And what that'll mean is that you're not going to do very well, at least at the beginning of social in social engagements because you need to be able to convince people that you're basically civilized and social before it's even reasonable for them to go beyond pleasantries with you. And the ability to exchange pleasantries in a relatively banal way in a variety of different circumstances is part of having a persona.

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       And you don't want to denigrate the utility of that because you need it. You know, as you progress in your careers, for example, you're going to be thrust into situations where you don't really know anyone. And the purpose of the gathering is to familiarize a large number of people with one another. And there's a skill that's associated with that that's somewhat Glib, social ability. The unions would say, well, you shouldn't, if you don't have a persona, you're just a disaster. But by the same token, you shouldn't be only persona because one of the possibilities is that the ego can identify with persona and then the person thinks that they are what they show the social world. And the problem with that, at least from the union perspective, is that, um, a people are a lot more than the persona. There are a lot more than the ego and be a lot of the things that make them more than mere persona or mere that more than mere ego are not necessarily things that are acceptable in casual public gatherings.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       So for example, because of your psychophysiological makeup, you all have the capacity for aggression. Now, a lot of you, especially the ones that are more agreeable, you could say that even it's either that that capacity for aggression has been underdeveloped because you've identified with a certain mode of social being or you could say perhaps if to the degree that agreeableness is temperamental, that the aggressive tendency isn't as powerful in you as it is and other people that might lead you to make judgements like, and I'm sure some of you, perhaps some, some of you who had an angry parent or particularly an angry father have decided at some point in your life that to be aggressive is wrong, to be angry is wrong, for example, or to be aggressive is wrong. It's morally wrong. One of the things that happens in psychotherapy very frequently though is that people come into psychotherapy for a variety of reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:07:34       Some of them are merely practical. They're having problems in adaptation because their lives have got very, very complicated and they really don't know what to do about it. Sometimes they go into psychotherapy because they have very high levels of negative emotion and that can be associated with the first problem. But very often they come into therapy because they're getting pushed around constantly and they really don't have anything that's a sufficiently well developed personal identity and generally those that happens by the way most more often with women than it does with men. And that's because women are by temperament, more agreeable than men. And perhaps also by socialization. Um, temperament certainly plays a big role often then they, the goal of therapy is assertiveness training and assertiveness training you could think of as the behavioral psychologists equivalent to incorporating the shadow. So, you know, you may think, well it's, it's a necessary part of existence to be nice to other people.

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       And there's some truth in that. Not really. It's a very shallow way of looking at the world because nice is not a very sophisticated work. But even if that's the word that you do use, you should also be nice to yourself. And sometimes what that means is that you have to put forward your own wishes and desires in a manner that causes a certain amount of conflict. And in order to withstand that conflict, you have to have, you have to be able to draw on the sources of aggression that in some sensor are, are, are a deep part of your, your inbuilt set of possibilities. Now the reason that's necessary in part from a biological perspective is that people are often afraid of engaging in conflict because they're afraid because? Because, because conflict can be real trouble and anger inhibits fear. So if you don't have a well developed capacity for while we could say rage, then you can't overcome your fear and then you can't stand up for yourself and then you're going to get run over.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       Now the problem with that is is that if you get run over enough, it'll make you resentful and then that will make you aggressive except it'll make you aggressive and sneaky underground and somewhat unconscious ways that are much less likely to be productive. Then you know, a frank exchange of viewpoints and some conscious negotiation. So one of the things I do in therapy for people who need assertiveness training is I get them to pay attention to their resentment. And resentment is often a good avenue into the shadow because first of all, resentment is a pretty destructive emotion. It's extremely useful emotion, but it can be very destructive cause it gives rise to, well first of all sense of victimization and second then the underground growth of all sorts of ideas of revenge and vengeance and and also a kind of stubborn non cooperativeness because who, who wants to cooperate when they feel taken advantage of.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       And so part of young's idea with regards to the shadow is that obviously the social world wants you to be peaceful and predictable and maybe even easy to get along with. But that doesn't necessarily mean that peaceful, predictable and easy to get along with a are the only virtues because they're certainly not. And one thing we know about virtues is that if they're taken to two, great at an extreme, they become vices. And B, there are certainly not the only virtues. You know, there are what you might call darker virtues, so to speak. There they're more dangerous virtues in some sense because they harness forces that can be very destructive if they're not utilized consciously. And aggression is certainly an example of that. So here's some fundamental rules about the shadow that you might think about as you move forward through your life. So a lot of times you're going to have to negotiate on your own behalf.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       And so what that means from the perspective of agreeableness and aggression is that you should be able to stand up for yourself at least as well as you would stand up for someone that you care for. So the problem with the idea of being nice to other people is that it doesn't take you into account. And that's supposed to be an equation, even though it's, as I said, nice is a pretty weak philosophical term. But the fundamental rule is that you should certainly include yourself in the circle of people who deserve respect and care. And that means that you have to be willing to advocate for yourself. And if you're willing to advocate to yourself for yourself and you want to do it, you have to be able to say no. You have to, because otherwise you have to say yes and then you can't negotiate.

Speaker 1:          00:12:28       And in order to say no, you have to have armed yourself with strategies and plans that enable you to say, no, you can't be dependent. You can't be afraid of potentially searching out new opportunities, et cetera. You have to be willing to stand your ground. And it's very difficult to do that without drawing on some of the deeper sources of psychological energy that are part of our psychophysiological heritage. So young would say, well, there's the persona and the ego and you can identify with your persona and then you're, you're, you're a kind of a shallow puppet of culture. So Pinocchio as the Marionette is a Persona Pinocchio himself as an eagle, but as a Marionette, he's the persona. So anybody who's ideologically possessed, by the way is a persona, although they're also possessed by the shadow, even though they don't know it. And you can tell when someone's ideologically possessed because you can predict whatever they're going to say once you know, a few axioms of their particular radiology.

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       So given ideology probably has four or five explanatory, um, axioms, like everything is caused by economic disparity. That might be one. Um, or success is due to hard work, that might be another, and those are broad enough statements, even though they're in opposition to one another, both of those statements are broad enough so you can virtually explain everything with them. The problem with it is, is that you can predict what the explanation is going to be before you even have to talk to the person. And whenever you're talking to someone and you can predict exactly what they're going to say because they're using some idiot, logically mediated structure, then you know perfectly well that they've identified with the persona. You also know that they're likely to be possessed by a pretty vicious shadow because we know that the shadow of ideological possession is repression and death.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       So one of the things that's always interesting about the psychoanalysts is that whenever they see something good, they're always looking for the dark side of it and vice versa. By the way, whenever they see anything dark, they're looking for the good side of it. And so they're very unlikely to take anything at face value. And so if someone comes up to you and says, I stand for some good thing, the thing that you ask, you're a psychoanalytically minded is, well, what does that mean that you hate? Because there's a reasonable probability that even though you think that you're standing for something, that a lot of what's motivating you is the desire to be against something. And that's particularly the case when you're dealing with, with negative emotions because they're more powerful than positive emotions. So it's one of the things, George Orwell, who was one of the 20th century's great anti Edea logs, published a book in the 1940s Thirties forties called up road to Wigan pier where he went to stay with some coal miners in the north of England.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       And those coal miners, man, they had a hard life. Like some of them had to crawl three quarters of a mile to work in tunnels in the morning in tunnels where they couldn't stand up just to get to work. So and then they do, they're like 10 hour shift in the coal mine digging out call and then they'd have to crawl back three quarters of a mile underground, you know, so they had very, very hard lives. And so you know, Orwell was pretty unimpressed by the conditions in which they were forced to work. So he wrote an essay for the English left book club and they were, that was a socialist publishing house, but he upended another essay to it where he criticized the socialists who are most likely to read that sort of book as much more oriented towards hating the rich. Then then loving the poor as devastating criticism.

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       And the left book club didn't even want to publish his book, but they ended up publishing has become a very famous essay, but it lays out a general principle. It's like if you have identified with a given persona, which is like a, a social machine in a sense, and you think you're all good because of what you think, then you might ask, well where'd all the parts of you that aren't good go? Because unless you think that you're a saint and that everyone who thinks differently than you is Satan himself, then you're missing a chunk of yourself. You're not taking a chunk of yourself into account. And that's the part that is nowhere near as well behaved or as benevolent as you might think or that you actually have any reason to believe, you know? And so one of the things that has struck me as a consequence of analyzing 20th century history and, and often through a union lens, is that there's not much evidence that the sorts of atrocities that characterize the Soviet Union, um, and, and Nazi Germany were the result of a few extremely corrupt people at the top of the hierarchy, forcing everyone down into slavery and then making them do terrible things.

Speaker 1:          00:17:34       I think that's a very weak explanation. In fact, I think it's, I think it's wrong. I think the historical record is quite clear that it's wrong. I mean, in East Germany for example,

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       one third of the people government informers. So that means if you had a family of six, two of your family members were reporting on you to the government. So when you look at human capacity for destructiveness, if you don't regard yourself as one of the agents of that destructiveness, or at least one of the potential agents of that destructiveness, then from the union perspective, at least there's a high probability that you're part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that you should be blamed for it because blame has to come from another person and it isn't obviously clear that like I get to blame you for being potentially violent. That's I think is a complete mistake. But if you, if you familiarize yourself with the realm of human capability and then you regard yourself as human, what that means is that you have to regard yourself as a creature that's capable of what human beings are capable of.

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       And human beings are capable of a lot of things and some of them are absolutely wonderful. I mean, there's nothing more remarkable than a human being on the planet. I mean, people can do amazing things. But the downside of that is that we can do absolutely horrible things. And it's not obvious that it's only the pathological people who do that. In fact, it's, it's that, it's not reasonable to assume that. So the shadow for young was a very big deal, you know, and he believed in some sense, and this is where the idea is get archetipal. He believed that the ideas of, of, uh, the evil twin of the king or the evil twin of God for that matter, so that would be Satan and Christian theology. That was, uh, that was as real a representation of the human and transpersonal human capacity for evil as there was.

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       And he believed that if you look deep enough into your own follow motivations, and if you look far enough down that you'd be looking, so to speak, into hell itself, and you'd find the main controller of hell deep inside your psyche. So it was no journey for the timid. And you'll also believe that, and this is what separates him from a new age thinker because he's often accused of being a new age thinker. New Age thinkers tell you things like follow your bliss and you'll, you know, you'll run into utopia, your own counter utopia. But that isn't what the unions especially young said about his process of individuation at all. He said that if you follow what's meaningful and you do it, honestly, it will take you somewhere. You really do not want to go. And until you go there, you'll never be able to climb up higher on the other side. And so that provides a real impediment for enlightenment because for enlightenment, there's a price to be paid. And if you look at architectural representations of the cost of enlightenment, you often find that the person who becomes enlightened has, is damaged in some profound way before it happens. So for example, in the ancient Egyptian stories of Horace and Oh, Cyrus, horace loses an eye when he has to encounter set who's the ancient Egyptian equivalent of sate. So it's no joke. It's seriously no joke. You know, and it's,

Speaker 1:          00:21:19       you know, one of one of young's propositions essentially was that the human race will continue to be plagued by phenomena like the outbreak of the genocidal Nazi and Soviet ideologies. Until people realize that the Nazis and the Soviets are them, that it isn't someone else's problem. It isn't other people who weren't you, it's you. If you were there, it would've been you. And you might say, well, no, I would have been a hero. It's like,

Speaker 2:          00:21:54       no,

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       probably not. Because they were rare. And I mean, unless you have real reason to think that you could have done it, then it's safer to think that you couldn't have and wouldn't have. And so then there's a responsibility that goes along with that. And the responsibility is to broaden your capacity of who you are so that you have the possibility of controlling the parts of your psyche that are very dark. Now, let me give you some examples of this. So you know, there's a philosopher named Bruce, so, and most of you are resilience without knowing it. And Russo basically made the following propositions. He said that human beings were basically good, but they were corrupted by culture. So human essential human nature was good. And the corrupting influence was was society. Now that's true, but it's only half true. And there's a philosopher named hobbs who said exactly the opposite thing.

Speaker 1:          00:22:51       He said, no human beings are base and violent and uncontrollable. And unless we have society structuring their interactions, he was more like Freud structuring their interactions. They would be constantly at one another's throat. And then if you think, well, who's right, Russo or hobbs, first of all, they're both right. Even though they say the opposite thing. And second while you look around the world and you tell me whether there are more hobbsy and states are resilient states announcer, that's pretty clear. Most countries are disastrous. Authoritarian dictatorships in which people where people live and suffer, and the places where civilization has has become stable enough so that people can live peaceful, relatively peaceful and productive lives are very rare. They're more common than they were in the past and they seem to be getting more common all time. Thank God. But it's a lot easier to be disorganized and brutal that it is to be organized, productive and free.

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       So now you believe that the, the shadow is something that kind of comes apart when you, when you face it. So it's a blurry black mass and in a sense before you start to differentiate it and so you can, you can tell what the shadow is as far as any one of you is concerned because you, you can start to notice how you aren't like you act, especially when you act around, act around people that you're trying to impress or people whose opinions you think are important to you. You have to pay attention to it though. And you, you'll be able to see that there's a distinction between what you say because you're saying something in order to make something turnout the way you want it to turn out and what you actually think and the shadows at work in two ways. There. One way is that it's convincing you that using your speech and actions to manipulate the world in a conscious manner is a good idea and it's not.

Speaker 1:          00:25:00       And the second is that you'll see that there are counter thoughts to what you think. So if you, for example, if you find yourself in the position of being too nice to someone, maybe it's a boss for example, who's bit of a tire it, you know, and you don't feel that you're in a position to say anything, um, in your only defense against his or her bullying tactics. The consequence of that is that you'll think all sorts of dark and dangerous thoughts about that person in your own fantasies when you're not interacting with them. And if you catch a hold of those fantasies and you let them play themselves out consciously, you'll see that they take you to very dark places now,

Speaker 3:          00:25:45       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:46       Or at least to places that you regard is very dark. So

Speaker 3:          00:25:53       w

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       young's notion essentially is that when you start to uncover those elements of yourself that don't fit comfortably within your ideas about yourself is that you discover things about yourself that are also potentially very useful. It says if you threw the baby out with the bath water when you were setting up your personality. So, for example, earlier I talked about people who may have decided very early in their life that they're just not going to get angry. It's like, well, it's not necessarily something that you want to throw away. It might instead be something that you want to bring within the realm of your personality so that it, it can express itself consciously and in an articulated manner. Because without anger, for example, you don't have any power, which basically means that no one needs to be afraid of you. And you might think, well, people shouldn't be afraid of you. And then a union might ask, well, what in the world would ever lead you to believe that

Speaker 2:          00:27:03       mean?

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       The distinction between being respected and being feared is not clear. But I would say that you don't respect anyone whom you couldn't imagine fearing if they decided to make that their priority.

Speaker 2:          00:27:29       So

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       without the capacity for aggression, you're not going to get any respect. That doesn't mean that people have to fear you, but it does mean that you have to incorporate your capacity for aggression enough so that they would fear you if you wanted them to. And if you think about it, that makes a lot more sense for memorial perspective, then the argument that you should be nice to everyone because if you're nice to everyone because you don't have any choice because you're weak and ineffectual and harmless, then that's not a virtue. That's just, you just can't do anything else. You're, you're, you're harmless by default and harmless and virtuous are by no means the same thing. If by contrast you're capable of causing all sorts of terrible trouble and you know it and you know how and then you decide not to do it because you can articulate, carefully, articulate a different route, well then you have the possibility of virtue because without the capacity to sin, so to speak, there's no virtue in not doing it. So if you're a, if you're a young man who feels that sleeping around is wrong but never has the opportunity to do it, then you can hardly attribute that to your virtue. So a good union would say, well, you're just making a virtue out of advice. It's just rationalization. It has nothing to do with, with virtue.

Speaker 2:          00:29:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       Now if you are attractive to people and you decide that that attraction should only manifest itself within certain tight boundaries. And that's a voluntary choice, that's a whole different issue. Now, when you claims, for example, that you throw the baby out with the bath water when you're trying to develop and become a socially personality, that happens in a different way as far as he's concerned for each of the genders. And so one of the prices young would say that we pay, and that this is a very modern idea in some ways for growing up

Speaker 1:          00:29:59       as a distinctly gendered society, is that it's very easy for men to suppress and fail to develop, to develop those elements of their character that might be considered classically feminine. And it's difficult for women to develop and express those aspects of their personality that might be classically considered masculine. And but so young believed that Nastad inside the shadow in some sense where the contra sexual capacities. So for example, for a man, given what we knew about the temperamental difference between men and women, it may be that men could be more, could develop the capacity. For true compassion and care. If they,

Speaker 2:          00:30:49       huh?

Speaker 1:          00:30:51       They could find that ability within what they've thrown out in the shadow and women for example, could find the capacity to be aggressive and assertive because that's part of what they threw out during their stage of their course of development because of, because of it's a priori categorization as inappropriate behavior. Now that doesn't mean that you thought that there was, that people should be raised without any gender identity. That issue never came up for him. He just thought that once you had established a personality that was sufficiently develop to be acceptable socially and functional on the individual level, then you could have the opportunity to expand that personality and to take into yourself elements of, of perception and thought and behavior

Speaker 2:          00:31:44       that

Speaker 1:          00:31:48       you wouldn't have had the sophistication to be able to handle at an earlier stage of development. So young would say perhaps that if you're a male, you have to become masculine before you could become feminine. And if you are a female, the reverse is true. But that if your development only star stops with a narrow and categorical gender identity, then there are elements that of, of, of being that you could draw on that aren't at your disposal and that will make you weak. So the shadow breaks up into the Anima ananymous and the Anima is the female inside the mail, so to speak, in the animus is the male inside the female and you and believe that he could see those partial spirits manifesting themselves in people's behavior. And so he talked about a couple of typical behaviors that he thought were associated either with anema possession. So that would be in the case of a man or animus possession in the case of a woman. And so he would regard, if you ever talk to someone who's female who seems to respond to all of your propositions with nothing but argumentation for the sake of argumentation, human would regard that as a manifestation of possession by the animus. And if you ever talked to a man who is irrationally possessed by

Speaker 2:          00:33:23       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       second rate and few tile emotions, then he would regard that as possession by the anima.

Speaker 2:          00:33:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       So and you can see that if you watch for it and if you believe in such things, um,

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:38       The best thing to do when confronted with someone who's Animus possessed is just shut up because you're not going to make any headway. Because the point of the argument of an Animus, inspired argument is to get you to argue not to win. Because by getting you to argue the animus wins. So and then behind those two things, behind the shadow and the anima and the Animus, there's a final archetype, which is the archetype of the self. And that's young, believed that the self was what you were as a totality. And that's a hard thing to understand but, but you could think about it this way. You could think about the self as the, as the total of what you are now plus the total of all those things that you could still be. So it would be you as a reality. Plus you as potential.

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       And that's a strange idea, right? Because we don't really know how to understand the idea of potential as modern and empirical people because potential virtually by definition is not yet manifest and also not a straight forward thing to either measure or conceptualize. By the same token, everybody acts as if they're, they have potential unrealized potential and so you know, generated up a category to account for that which he felt was expressed in all sorts of symbolic weight. So for example, the wise old man, like like the wizards in the movies that all of you have seen in the last five years, it's always the same wizard. Sometimes it's even the same actor. It's like that's an archetype of the wise old man and for young Christ was an archetype of the self as well. And I told you why that was to some degree and it's partly because the phoenix is also an archetype of the self because the Phoenix is something that can die and be reborn.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       And so the Phoenix stands for the part of your that can let one thing go. One part of you, which is an ally live part, can let that go and burn up so to speak so that something new can be born because you very seldom gain something before you let something else go. That's partly because what you already assume can be the worst impediment that you have to work to learning something new. And it's complicated because sometimes what you know worked in the past, you know, so you can think about that. Maybe you're a perfectly well adapted 11 year old and you're still acting that way when you're 15 it's like, well, it's hard to let that go because it worked and you put a lot of effort into it, but unless you let it go, the new personality isn't going to be able to manifest itself.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       So you have to stop being a child before you can be an adult and there's a sacrifice that goes along with that. It's also a sacrifice that parents have to make, right? Because in order for a parent to encourage you to adopt the responsibilities of an individual, they have to allow you as a child to die. And Freud's observation on that phenomena was that many parents and he believed this was particularly characteristic of mothers because of their tight bond with their children and the dependency that that implies that it was particularly difficult for a mother to let her child die so that an adult could manifest itself in that child's place. And that's fundamentally in many ways the oedipal complex. Okay, so now I'm going to show you some of these things again, because the thing about young is that it's not easy to understand what he has to say and it's not a simple thing to explain it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       And his books are complicated, although I don't think there are any more complicated than they have to be. Like I don't think young is obscure. I think he's just difficult. And then beyond difficult, he's actually frightening. So there's lots of reasons that people don't like you, and the fact that he's difficult and frightening are probably the two foremost objections. I think the other thing that happened to you that maybe slowed his acceptance as an intellectual was that many of his students were women, like his primary students and the people who developed his ideas. Many of the people who identity I, um, continued to develop his ideas after he died were women. And that was perhaps not the most effective way of making headway in the academic world at, at the time that he was alive. So let's look at some things. I'm going to show you some things from the lion king because the lion king shows you archetypes everywhere. So let's do this first.

Speaker 3:          00:39:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       Okay. So the first thing that I would like to point out here is that this takes place at daybreak. And daybreak is when the sun re-emerges. And from an architectural perspective, the sun re-emerges from a terrible Babel that had had with the thing that devours the sun at night and it comes up again triumphant in the morning. And so it's the dawn of consciousness and not that idea that the sun undergoes. This battle is associated with the idea that you descend into unconsciousness when you sleep. And magically you, we reemerge from it in the morning and you do that in accordance with the sun. So for you, darkness is a time of unconsciousness and there's a tight relationship between unconsciousness and darkness. And so young would say, people projected that idea. It was an idea that was in there in their imagination, that unconsciousness and darkness, we're tightly aligned.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       And so they use their imagination to explain the world and conceptualize the sun in those, uh, in those terms of imagination. So that if you analyze the terms of imagination, you can get some understanding into the structure of the imagination. And so that's one of them. Consciousness and light are the same thing, illumination, enlightenment, all of those things. And that's because we're primarily visual creatures and were conscious during the day. And so this is a new beginning, the new day, which is something that everyone also experiences because sleep washes away the carers of the previous day. Um, and it does revitalize you. We know perfectly well that if you deprive people of sleep for any length of time, it's not good for them. It, it, it, it derails them entirely. Deranged ranges them entirely. So there is a reason that this movie opens with the dawn of the day.

Speaker 3:          00:41:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       Okay. So there's another re casting of the same idea, right? Except the also indicated that there was an association between the dawn of self consciousness and the emergence of the light because the lyrics were, when we step the day, we stepped onto the planet and stepped out blinking into the light. There's a, there's a transition from unconsciousness to consciousness metaphor underlying that. And so one of the statements that film is making, or one of the ways that the film is trying to set you up to understand this as a story about the emergence of consciousness into the light. Now you might say, well, did the film makers know all this? The answer to that is a, it depends on what you mean by no, which is really of critical factor in this sort of discussion and b, well, yes, and the re the way they manifested the fact that they knew it is because they knew when things fit together.

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       So you know, when you're writing a story or something like that or reading a story, you know when the story is going well you think, yeah, that makes sense. In fact, you don't even notice it, right? You just assume that everything's fine because it makes sense. It doesn't jar you out of the narrative. And so people are perfectly capable, especially if they concentrated on it for long periods of time of assembling a narrative with images that make sense. Now they may not know why it makes sense. In fact, if they're actually artists, they don't know why it makes sense because they're, they're ix, they're expanding their capacity to comprehend and explain things well. They're producing what they're producing. They have to be moving beyond what they know cause otherwise they're just producing propaganda. You know, when there were elements of many Disney films that sync now and then into propaganda, it's sort of conscious moralizing. But when the films are really working, they're not doing that at all. And when, when, when they are consciously moralizing, they're boring very quickly. Plus they date extremely rapidly.

Speaker 3:          00:43:33       Si.

Speaker 1:          00:44:03       Okay. So that's a brilliant piece of film editing there because the the filmmaker sweep your eye along and then make something appear as a revelation and they do it at exactly the same time that the music swells to a climax. And that's indicating to you that something of tremendous importance is about to be revealed. And so you see two things here. The first thing you see is what's called pride rock, which is a, is a roughly peer middle shape at least to triangular shape that emerges in the middle of the landscape that actually serves symbolically as the center of the kingdom are. You can think about that as an Egyptian pyramid or you could think about it as a dominance hierarchy. It doesn't really matter. It's both of those things. It's also the thing on which the thing that the animals are subjugated to stands right?

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       Cause that's where the king is and the king happens to be a lion and the lion is a solar beast. It's always been a solar beast. It's associated with the sun and it's the king of beasts because it's an apex Predator. It's at the top of the hierarchy and for whatever reason, although obviously the lions in the animated movie are there are not actually lions. It's important to remember that while you're analyzing the film because it's very easy to just think of them as lines even though clearly they're not. Now you also see this little character up in the right hand corner, left hand corner, and that zoo, right and Zazu is the eye of the king and so the king is on top of the pyramid, but the king's eyes free from the king and the kid go where all over the place even where the pyramid can't see and that's the eye on the top of the pyramid. You've seen that symbol everywhere. No doubt. It's the symbol that's on the back of the American dollar bill and there's a reason for it. It's because the eye of the king is not part of the hierarchy. The eye of the king is something that's always free of the hierarchy and can, can fly over all hierarchies and that's, that's equivalent to the thing that could make its way up any hierarchy in some sense. It's also the same as horace though. The God of vision in the ancient Egyptian stories.

Speaker 3:          00:46:12       No.

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       Okay. So there are, we've got the king and we will see that he's on top of the Rock, which is where the king belongs. He's also in full sunlight even though that's not characteristic of any of the other animals. He's got his little bird there that tells them things because the king is someone who pays attention because the king who doesn't pay attention is a tyrant and then the wind is blowing through the king's hair because the wind is spirit. And so the king is also something that's associated with the everlasting spirit. PNEUMA PNEUMA is the breath of air and it's also the, the, the essence of life from an architectural perspective. So to be inspired is like risk. Respiring to be inspired is to take in spirit and the kind of spirit that the king takes in is associated with the image of the wind. Now you got to look at his face. You remember before I was saying, cause the animators do a very good job of this. They gave him a very mature face and a mature phase is something out of which something is coming instead of something into which something is coming. And you'll see that the move Fossa is always looking like this. He's very intent and focused and, and um, intimidating. Whereas his son right up until he becomes

Speaker 3:          00:47:42       mmm

Speaker 1:          00:47:43       initiated is like this always as soon as he becomes initiated. And I'll show you that in the film, his face hardens and it isn't until his face hardens that he can go back and fight scar who's basically a figure of the shadow.

Speaker 1:          00:48:04       Now originally this character we're Fiki was going to be one of those typical sort of Disney kick buffoons that didn't work out so well in the narrative. And he ended up as a symbol of the self and Stan and Rick Fiki is obviously a showman and he's the part of the psyche that guides its transformation. So here's another way of looking at the self is very interesting idea. So you know, as you go through life, there was going to be triumphs and then catastrophes and when there's a catastrophe the psyche falls apart. And then maybe it gathers its resources back together and pulls itself together. It's going like this. Well young would say the self is what's guiding that process. So the ego feels it like this. So that's triumphant catastrophe and triumph and catastrophe or tragedy and comedy. But the self is the thing that's underneath all of it, allowing those transformations to take place. And that's where Fiki and that's why he's associated as well with the sun. So when he's a good king, because he's in touch with the self. So that makes him not something that's either serving his persona or his ego. But you could say that what are you serving is a manner of ruling that allows for the appropriate amount of stability and transformation to take place in the kingdom so that it remains stable, but also adapting to change. And the king has guided, did not buy the little bird who tells him what's going on in those places he can't see.

Speaker 1:          00:49:57       Now that's clearly a Madonna and child. The image.

Speaker 3:          00:50:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:05       And the reason for that is quite simple. I mean, you might think, well, why would the idea of the Madonna and child, which by the way is a far older idea, then the Christian representation of it, there's lots of fingers of Madonna's and Cha, Madonna, Madonna's and children. Yeah. In the ancient Egyptian art, for example, now the Isis with horace. Well, the reason that that's an archetype is any society who doesn't regard the dyad of mother and infant as something sacred, which would mean of highest value is doomed obviously. Because without that being held as a value, the society will cease to propagate. And that will be the end of it. So if the society isn't structured so that, that's that that dyad is up among the highest of values, then the society is become ungovernable. He corrupt.

Speaker 3:          00:51:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       So you see refuke you, they're just anointed the little king with something that was orange. And that was something like the sun. So the idea that the film is expressing is that there's some sunlike substance that's being associated with the, with this new born son of the king, and that that's, uh, a dramatic manifestation of his destiny. And an indication that he asked also be in cultured because what Rafiq he is doing as a cultural act before he's going to be complete.

Speaker 1:          00:52:00       Now the sand is also an indication that he's mortal. Now watch what happens here because this film makers, I think they just nail this part. So they're going to do the sweeping thing again and the music rises to the ultimate climax of the song. And what's happening here is that the self is presenting this the sun. And so it's a, it's a presentation of the savior fundamentally. And that's the thing that has just been born. That's the hero. And when the hero is presented and the sun breaks open wide and shines on immune would call that a synchronous event. And what happens is there's an emotion associated with that which you will feel. And it's at that time that all the animals bow down and they do that spontaneously. And the idea is that there's a hierarchy here and the little boy in the sun is the highest element of the hierarchy. And when that it manifests itself and you can see beyond the facade facade to something that's divine behind it, the consequence of that will be a spontaneous bursting forth of law. And I really think the filmmakers nailed out here.

Speaker 3:          00:53:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:00       Yeah, so they hit that pretty hard there. So there's also a nuclear family thing going on in the background that you might have noticed because of course the little king has a mother and a father. That's partly because that works better, but also partly because the, the archetypical hero is the son of culture had nature. So okay, so here's a, here's a shadow figure. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       Here he's represented here, not so much a symbol as shadow, although he's part of Simba Shadow. He's represented as Mufasa is shouting. And so it's quite a complex idea because what it says is when, when a king like organization grows up, which means any organization, anything that's a hierarchy and that's powerful, there's a shadow element to it that tends towards totalitarianism and tyranny. And that's represented often by the king's evil brother. It was a very common motif in, in mythologically based stories. And the king is generally blind to his brother, so often willfully blind. Although that doesn't really seem to be the case in the lion king, it's, it is clearly the case that move well fossa underestimates the danger posed by his usually older and smarter brother. It's and, and the miss very often make the case that the evil king is the older one and also the one that's more intelligent.

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       And the reason for that is that as far as I can tell, is that intelligence is something that can go very wrong if it goes wrong. And one of its big temptations is that it produces models of the world and then falls in love with the models. And when it falls in love with the models, that makes it totalitarian because it believes that its constructions are good enough so that there doesn't need to be anything else. So it eliminates the necessity of the transcendent. And that's definitely a characteristic of any totalitarian system. It says, this is everything we need, and then you know, if you happen to suffer or if you happen to openly rebel against the system, then you're regarded as an enemy of truth and then it's fine to do with you whatever might be done because everything worth doing is already been done.

Speaker 3:          00:56:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:33       Now he's got an interesting facial expression and it's really worth watching facial expressions in animated cartoons because they're not faces, right? What they are is the consequence of the observations of extremely talented artists about how's people's faces configure themselves over very long periods of time. Because these people are high level artists, they know what they're doing, and so they're able to distill down certain facial expressions to describe a character. Now this guy's obviously, he's whiny, he's got this supercilious and arrogant voice. So He's, he's, he's arrogant beyond belief and he all is also hard done by and resentful and that's a really good, and maybe he has a reason he's got a scar or something happened to them that wasn't good, but he's taken on this attitude as resentful victim who really deserves to rule. If only everyone could see how wonderful he was. And then he has all sorts of reasons why the fact that he isn't powerful has nothing to do with his own shortcomings,

Speaker 3:          00:57:56       passes on his way. He doesn't matter if they're looking at me that way. Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:58:28       well as we can tell the eyes of the king and scarred not friends. And that's because scar doesn't really want to see what's going on. Now here's an interesting little archetype.

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       What,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       okay, so that's quite interesting. There's a variety of statements there that are very, very cool. So one of them is the kingdom is a bounded place and so that's playing off the idea of explored territory versus unexplored territory or the known versus the unknown. And the proposition there is that whatever the dominance hierarchy happens to be, it has a limited domain of

Speaker 1:          00:59:51       a limited domain of competence and the domain of competence is defined by everything that the light touches. Now this is actually something that you can notice in your own life. It's, it's quite interesting. You'll see that if you move into a new place or a new neighborhood, or if you do anything new at all, that nothing that you haven't attended, two is actually yours. It will, it will stay foreign in a sense and unfamiliar to you until you interact with it with a substantial amount of attention. And that's partly because while you're attending to it, which is an act of conscious swill, you're, you're, you're modifying your perceptions and your thoughts and your actions and your emotions to take it into account as a phenomenon. And that means that you're competent there. And it takes conscious effort to be competent because you have to practice being competent at a new domain.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       And until you've practiced being competent in a new domain, it's not yours. And so this clip is showing what's basically an eternal truth, which is that your territory is whatever you've mastered and it's demarcated by everything you haven't mastered. And in this particular representation that's associated with, with death, it's also associated in some bizarre sense with paradise. Because of course, Simba encounters the elephants grave out in no man's land, so to speak. But when he runs away across the desert, he also finds paradise. And so there's a paradoxical idea there that the unknown contains death and everything you need to make your life worthwhile.

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       Here comes the anima. That's okay. So you see that cocky? He's a cocky little rat here. Okay. So he's very confident, but that's egotism and also persona. Well, it's no wonder he's confident. He's the son of the king, you know? And the fact is that he has a position of dominance that he doesn't deserve merely because he was born into it. And that's him. Shallow and arrogant and possessed by a persona. No, this little figure who is basically an anima figure always knocks him down. A peg continually knocks him down a peg. How many of you seen groundhog day? Yeah. Yeah. You remember in Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's character is a real, he's a jackass at the beginning. He's very arrogant and he's very unskilled. And then he gets stuck in the same day, which is pretty funny because that is what happens to you if you're arrogant and unskilled, you end up in the same damn day.

Speaker 1:          01:02:53       That's not fun. And then in that day he becomes attracted to this woman who's an anima figure and for for years as far as the films concern, every time he approaches her in his arrogant and clumsy way, she slaps him. So there's one scene in the movie where I think it lasts for about 30 seconds and it's nothing but clips of her slapping him probably 30 times at that point. You've seen him go through the same day and the continually painful way that he does and she slaps him in those longer clips and after a while the film maker gets tired of that, just shows you nothing but the slaps, you know, eventually he's brought so far down as a consequence of being stuck in the same day and continually being slapped that he falls completely apart. Right? Then he tries to kill himself. And one of the very comical things about that movie is that that doesn't work either.

Speaker 1:          01:03:44       He just wakes up at the same day again. And you know, what that means in some sense is that if you're too damn stubborn to change, you will keep running into the same thing over and over continually. And that's why you're in the same day because you won't let go of it. And that might drive you even to question the value of your own being. But that's also not a very useful adaptive strategy, you know? And it isn't till he starts to take his rejection seriously that he starts to actually build some real character, right? And then he starts paying attention to the day and finds out that there's all sorts of things that he can do during that day to make it rich and meaningful. And as soon as he does that enough and becomes an expert at it, poof, he gets out of the the day, the same horrible day. And they saw that horrible day is also a representation of tier of the tyranny of the state because the state is something that's static. So anyways, now la, she's

Speaker 2:          01:04:45       was,

Speaker 1:          01:04:59       yeah, and well, they're not paying attention. They end up in the shadows, outside the kingdom. So here's, here's that image of scar transforming himself essentially first into Hitler, but because there's a lot of Nazi imagery in this, in this clip, but also into a sate tannic figure at the end, you'll see he's associated with the crescent moon. So we turns into the horn demon of the night essentially.

Speaker 3:          01:05:29       Okay, got you.

Speaker 1:          01:05:40       See, that's all images of hell obviously.

Speaker 3:          01:05:44       Alright, come on board talks back. Slide my words.

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       See, one of the things that happened to people like stolen for example, is Stellan had nothing but contempt for people and he thought all they ever did was lie. Well, what happened to Stellan is that he's, he became surrounded by people

Speaker 1:          01:06:25       with to whom he could demonstrate contempt and who never did anything to them except lie. Cause the reason for that was they were so terrified of them that they would never tell him the truth about anything. And so he got into this spiral, which is kind of the spiral of the, of a paranoid psychopath where I distrust you so badly and set things up so that you'll be punished so hard if you ever deviate from the appropriate line that you'll do nothing but lie to me. And so then I'm fully justified my contempt and sort of, it's like Peter pan in some sense, king of the lost boys. It's like, well who do you want to be king of while the route that scar took, which is the negative archetype. The shadow root means that he's king, but you know he's King of Hell and all he's God are these brainless minions. And so you know he's King of people he wouldn't want to associate with. It's not exactly a, it's not exactly,

Speaker 3:          01:07:59       I'm about to start quizzing me.

Speaker 1:          01:08:44       So you, you, you may remember or you may not remember that or who may not know that Hitler of course set up the war, the biggest meeting arena that the world had ever seen for the Nuremberg Nazi party rallies. And there's, there's something to see. They were filmed quite brilliantly in a film called will to power. I think that's what it's called, Leni Riefenstahl and what Hitler has arrayed in front of him, our blocks of thousands of soldiers everywhere as far as you can see an absolutely perfect

Speaker 1:          01:09:22       uniformity, and that's the idea, because if you're already right, nothing has to be different. Everything can be the same as the perfect thing. The problem with that is you're not right and things have to change. And Hitler, he was a master of the use of fire as well, and also put as displays on at night. And so he took all the Luftwaffe is error craft spotting spotlights, which were huge, massive lights, maybe they must have been 20 feet across, and he had them all lined up behind him on the stage and they would shine miles up into the sky. And so he would address these thousands and thousands of people in this nighttime ritual with a curtain of light behind him that was several miles high. It's an unbelievably powerful pageant. And the people who made this film or drawing on on that to produce these images.

Speaker 1:          01:11:10       Modern people will say things like, well, the idea of hell is just a superstition, but then you watch this and it makes sense and then you think, well hell is where Satan himself rules and nothing happens but the body's burning death and that's exactly what happened during the Holocaust. And so thinking that these sorts of archetipal ideas are superstitious is it's extraordinarily foolish and naive because they represent possibilities of being that continually manifest themselves and everyone knows about them. So you know the, the, the, the implicit idea here is that if you take the path that scar torque, which is one of resentment and deceit as well as arrogance, which are three major motive, major, major shadow motivators, then you'll end up at best ruling over hell. And it's no joke, like it's not a superstition. The stories are trying to tell you something, that, that his mode of being is the pathway to perdition and, and that the things that happen there are so terrible and so deep that the only way you can really express them is using the kind of imagery that we've come to associate with religious and religious imagery in a sense is imagery that cannot be made more powerful.

Speaker 1:          01:12:28       That's what makes it archetipal. It's like a limit. You can't go past it in terms of the representation. And so when you represent the ultimate destiny of evil as eternal hell, where all the bodies burned forever and there's nothing there except demonic chatter, that's about as far as you can go in terms of your capacity to represent something. But it's representing something. So when you can say, well, it's an eternal place, while that's because this possibility's always there, it never goes away. It's always there. And that's also what makes it archetipal. And do you know that because otherwise you wouldn't be able to understand the story and everyone knows it. Otherwise this story wouldn't be, I still believe it's one of the top 10 grossing films of all time. So obviously it makes sense. Okay, well I'd like to show you a lot more, but, but I can't, so we'll see you Thursday. I'm going to post some sample questions on the website very soon tonight, possibly tomorrow morning, possibly somewhere around there. So check it out. Neil gets some sense of what the exam's going to be like.
