Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So today we're going to talk about you and I find that tremendously entertaining. Um, uh, I, I'm not sure I ever, I've ever read anyone is intelligent as you'll accept, maybe need shift.

Speaker 2:          00:00:21       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:00:24       it's funny, he's accused of many things such as starting a new religion by some rather unscrupulous biographers. But what he did was actually far more radical than anything he's ever been accused of it. One other thing I should tell you too is young as often been accused of Anti Semitism, but one of the things that came to light in last year was that he was working as an agent for the American government during World War II and frequently set updates on Hitler psychological condition to the highest levels of the American government. He never told anybody about that. So. So, you know, that's a little hard on all accusations of antisemitism, I think, which I've never thought had held any merit anyways. So young.

Speaker 1:          00:01:10       He was a strange guy in many ways, extraordinarily imaginative. He could get lost in daydreams and was a tremendously powerful visualizer. And a lot of what he discovered was a consequence of engaging in longterm, elaborated and fantasies and in these fantasies he could have conversations with figures of his imagination and communicate with them. I had a client at one point who was a very prolific dreamer and she can talk to her characters in your dreams and ask them what they meant symbolically and they would tell her that was really something. I've only seen one person who who was capable of doing that. She was. I don't know if it helped her that much in the final analysis, but she couldn't do it. And young was very, very interested in the depths of the human imagination. Now his body of work can be viewed as an amalgam of many things, but he. He had deep knowledge of Latin and Greek and he'd studied l chemical manuscripts for many, many years as an older man. So he was very interested in the emergence of the idea of science from what he considered the collective imagination. But in many ways his primary modern intellectual influences. I would say we're Nietzsche and Freud and you'll really set out some somewhat like Piaget too,

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       address the gap between religion and science, but he did it for different reasons than piaget.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       You'll took niches, comments about the death of God very seriously, and one of the things need shape predicted at the end of the 19th century was that there were going to be two major consequences of the collapse of formal religious belief. He believed that that would lead people to a morally relativistic condition that would prove psychologically intolerable. Because if you adopt a morally relativist position and you take it to its final conclusion, then everything is of equal value and there's no gradient between things. There's no better, no worse. And in the final analysis, you might say, well, there's no good and there's no evil. And the problem with that is you can actually orient yourself in a world that has those properties. Because in order to act as we've already talked about with regards to the cybernetic models, you have to be aiming at something that's better than what you have now. Or there's no reason to expend the energy. And so you need the gradient, you need a value differentiation in order to act and niches. Analysis was predicated on the idea that if the value hierarchy collapsed well, not only would people not be motivated to do anything anymore, but they would also be extraordinarily confused and depressed because the value would go out of their life and the consequence of that would be that they would become somewhat nihilistic or maybe absolutely nihilistic or that they would turn to ideological rigid ideological systems as a replacement. Now, what niche him

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       offered as an alternative to that was that human beings could create their own values, and so his idea was that the superman, the overmanned, depending on how you look at it, would be the person who was capable of transcending the value list universe that the decline of religion had left with us and creating their own values as a conscious act. The problem with that is that it isn't obvious that you can create your own values as a conscious act because it's not obvious that values are consciously create it, and I think this is why the psychoanalysts had so much to add to the philosophical debate, at least the philosophical debate that developed to the point of Nietzsche's observations. When Freud entered the scene, the idea of the unconscious was in the air, but Freud formalized it to a much greater degree than anyone else had, and Freud's theory really is deeply biological.

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       You know his, his. It's biological, it's social as well, but his proposition proposition that there is an id is fundamentally the proposition that you're not necessarily your consciousness for sure is not the master in its own house. Now, I think part of the reason that people like to go after Freud, there's a variety of reasons, but one of them is that modern people basically accept radical Freud and presuppositions more or less as givens. Now you know, and so if you're a brilliant thinker and your thought permeates the society to the point where your most radical propositions are accepted by everyone, all of it's really left or your errors, and so it's easy to concentrate on Freud's errors because we've already digested everything he had to say. That was particularly profound. I mean, I don't imagine perhaps I'm wrong, but I don't imagine that there's anyone in this room to whom the news that many of your motivations aren't conscious comes as a surprise.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       I mean, even psychologists have admitted that in the last 20 years, you know, I mean, they talk about the cognitive unconscious with which I think is a real slight of hand maneuver to stop them from having to Credit Freud with his discoveries. And I also think that Freud's notion of the unconscious is far more sophisticated than the cognitive scientists notion because Freud viewed the unconscious as a place that was basically populated by fragmented personalities. Not cognitive schemes of one form or another. Not Processes, but things that were like living beings. And you know, when you think, well, are there living beings in your unconscious and the answer to that is, well, are you alive or not? And you're alive. So you're composed of living subcomponents and they're not machines, or at least not in any way that we understand machines. They're fragmentary, subpersonalities, and each of them have their own worldview and rationalizations and emotional structure and goals. And so that's why when you get hungry, you see the world through the eyes of a hungry person and you think thoughts about food and your emotional reactions depend on whether food is available or whether it isn't, and maybe whether or not the food you want is available and whether it isn't and you know, that that's nature, so to speak, imposing its necessities on you as a living being. And for Freud, that was the end and Freud thought of the Ed really as something that was primordial and primitive and he and, and,

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       and that's one of the things that really separated him from you. And I think young is much more accurate from, uh, from the perspective of evolutionary psychology. In fact, I think he's radically underestimated as a thinker whose thought was unbelievably deeply grounded in biology and like young was a remarkable person because his notion of history and the relationship between history and the human psyche, what covered spans time that we're really, until modern historians and evolutionary psychologist started to talk about deep time and the fact that you know, the entire 4 billion year history of the world is in some sense relevant to us talk to us as beings or at least the 3 billion, three point 5 billion year history that there's been life on the planet. Ancient history for European philosophers was like 500 to 2000 years ago and young thought way past that way back farther than that and started to take into serious account the fact that are the origins of our psyche.

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       The ground of our psyche is deeply biological and that it's an emergent property. So for Freud, Freud's idea of the unconscious is somewhat difficult to understand because there's sort of two elements to it. There's the ID, which is the source of primordial motivation and Freud concentrated mostly on aggression and sexuality. And the reason he concentrated on those two, although we concentrated on what he called the death instinct later in his life, the reason he concentrated on those two primarily wasn't because he regarded them necessarily as the most compelling of motivations, but he regarded those motivations as the ones that were most difficult for most people to integrate successfully into the social world. So he thought that they were most likely to be repressed and therefore under developed and immature. And I think that's. I think that's a reasonable proposition. I think that modern people would have to add eating to that because since the time of Freud we've gone, I would say from a high proportion of sexually related pathologies to a very, very high proportion of eating related pathologies. But that's in some sense beside the point. So that's one part of the Freudian unconscious, sort of an implicit unconscious. Then the other part of the Freudian unconscious is those things that have happened to you that you've repressed because you don't like what they imply.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       And you know, those are very different kinds of unconscious because one of them is dependent on your experience. And the other isn't, and you could think of young actually as a, a, a deep archeologist of the ID and Freud, Freud thought about the and sort of primordial terms. So his, his angry id would be, you know, like a beast that's out of control. But you recognize that the unconscious was far more sophisticated in many ways than the conscious parts of your being and that it guided your adaptation in ways that you didn't understand and that those, the ways in which had guarded your adaptation and structured your understanding, we're universal hands, biological and far more sophisticated than a somewhat primordial notion of biological drive might indicate.

Speaker 2:          00:12:06       So

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       one of the things that you might consider, for example, is that from the union perspective, a lot of the forces that ancient people consider diabetes.

Speaker 2:          00:12:18       We're

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       personified representations of instinctual systems. So, hey, here's a way of thinking about it, and this is the way of thinking about the collective unconscious, which is humans in some sense, young's replacement term for the fraud and ID.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       So Mars, for example, is the god of war, Roman God of war. And you might say, well, what does it mean for there to be a god of war? And the answer or Venus is the god of love actually, of, of, of sexual attraction, more particularly, or have sexual possession, which is even a better way of thinking about it. And you say, well, why would people conceptualize of those phenomena as gods? The Greek set, for example, that human beings were the play things of the gods. No, that's what Shakespeare. I'm sorry, that was Shakespeare who said that?

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       Well, here's one way of thinking about it. What's older you or aggression? Now answer to that is, well, you're 23 and the system that mediates biological aggression in mammals and their progenitors is tens of millions of years old and if you think you control it rather than the other way around, you're diluted about your central nature. Part of it, part of it is that you don't control it at all. What happens is that you never go anywhere where you need to use it. And so one of the things that happens to soldiers in war time, for example, is they go somewhere where they could use it and out it comes and the consequence of its emergencies, so traumatic that they develop posttraumatic stress disorder because they observe themselves doing things that are hyper aggressive that they could have never imagined that someone like them could have manifested. And then you think, well, what about Venus as a goddess? Well, if you fall in love with someone

Speaker 2:          00:14:22       who, who

Speaker 1:          00:14:24       is that a choice? It doesn't look like a choice. If it's a choice, it's often an incredibly self destructive and idiotic choice and it's often one that ruins people's entire lives. It's more like a state of possession and then you might say, well, possession by what? Well, it's a dynamic living system and it's also immortal in some sense, which is another reason why conceptualizing it as a daddy makes sense, mean the phenomena of love, which is the manifestation of our complex biological system, will be alarm long, will be around long after you're gone and was there long before you showed up. And when it manifests itself, so to speak within you, you're possessed by it and you do its bidding and you may do its bidding despite what you most deeply want.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       You know, modern people tend to think that the conscious parts of their brain that say, or let's say the more newly evolved elements of their brain, because we don't actually know what the relationship is between consciousness and the newly developed parts of the brain. The assumption is often made that the reason we're conscious is because we've developed a very spectacular cortical cap, but consciousness appears to be far older than that. So that's an erroneous assumption. But we do tend to believe that the most complex and sophisticated parts of our brain are the cortical cap, the complex cortical cap that's quite enlarged in human beings relative to our body size because it's the most. It's the. It's the newest systems and it's also part of the systems that allow us to do such things as communicate with language and think in abstract symbols. But there's a different way of thinking about this from a biological perspective, and that is what makes you think the newest system is the most sophisticated one. Why don't you assume that the oldest system is the most sophisticated one because it's been around for a while. For example, the mechanism in in your neurological,

Speaker 1:          00:16:37       the mechanism that underlies your conception of your relationship to the dominance hierarchy, for example, is at least 300 million years old and the reason it's lasted 300 million years is because it knows what it's doing as far older than your parts of the brain that make you conscious in the specifically human way and it's so deeply embedded in your brain in some sense that you have almost no voluntary control over it. And that's why, for example, one of the things that happens to people who are depressed is that the system that reports their dominance, dominance status

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       reports that they're low. Now, sometimes that's true because they're not depressed. They just have an awful life and they're actually at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy. And that's not the same as being depressed, but sometimes it malfunctioned, so someone who's competent and well situated in life and who appears to have everything that a person could possibly desire in order to have a decent and meaningful and positive life are still catastrophic, really depressed, and what seems to happen in those circumstances is that the dominance counter for one reason or another, is acting as if they're incredibly low status when they're in fact not. And I think that's a good definition of clinical depression. I also think that part of the reason that there's mixed results with regards to antidepressant trials is because antidepressants don't help you if you're at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       Oh, how good they. You're not depressed. You just have a terrible life that is not the same thing and they need to be carefully distinguished. Because if you're unemployed and you're facing the loss of your home and maybe your partner's going to leave you and your children hate you, an antidepressant is very unlikely to fix that. Now to the degree that misbehavior on your part called caused by impulsivity and increased aggression and decreased mood because of your reaction to that circumstances is making it worse than the antidepressant might help you and maybe the antidepressant will help you regain enough cognitive control so that you can plan your way out of the situation, but as a medication in and of itself, there's no possible way it can lift you out of those often catastrophic, complex and disintegrating circumstances. Whereas if your life is fine but you feel terrible, well, it's much more likely that an antidepressant can help with that because in some sense, what it's going to do is to readjust your dominance, the reporting of your dominance counter, so to speak, to the level that's appropriate for your level of competence, which is really what you want.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       You know, people say you should have high self esteem. I would say idiot say that you should have high self esteem. It's a. it's an unbelievably corrupt construct in many ways because it's actually very, very highly correlated with baseline levels of neuroticism negatively, which is a fundamental personality traits and baseline levels of extroversion, so someone with lower self esteem is generally someone who's introverted and has high levels of negative emotion. It's a trait like phenomena. It isn't clear at all that calling that low self esteem has any utility whatsoever, but then you also might ask yourself, well, how much self esteem should you have? Well, that's a very complex question because you can clearly have way too much. That's what would make you a narcissist. So I would say your self esteem should be roughly equivalent to the esteem in which your held by members of your society.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       You know your family and your society because they're judging you, at least in part on your competence and you shouldn't think that you're more competent than you are and you shouldn't think that you're less competent than you are. You should think that you're as competent as you are and sometimes that means you're not competent at all because you don't know what you're doing and sometimes it means that you're quite competent. Now, I think it's complicated by the fact that you should also regard yourself not only as who you are, but as who you could be. You know, and so if you're of lowly dominant status, which for example in some sense you guys are because you're young and you're starting your lives, the fact that there's a lot of potential that you still are able to manifest should tilt the self assessment balance in your favor to a fair degree. So anyway, so yoga was very interested in the depths of the psyche and hit. For him. The unconscious wasn't a repository of repressed experiences and it wasn't a repository of underdeveloped and irritated biological systems. It was instead the underlying structure of consciousness itself. So you believe that human experience at as it's consciously manifested, was structured by underlying

Speaker 1:          00:21:52       patterns of behavior that were specific and unique to to the, to the human, to human kind. Although shared to some degree with other animals and then on top of that a realm of images stick and symbolic representation, that in part was a consequence of representation of those underlying behaviors. So here's the way of thinking about it. We act in a human way, whatever that means, and we'd been acting in a human way for as long as there's been human beings and we've been acting in a mammalian way for as long as there's been mammals. Now, human beings are quite peculiar creatures because not only do we act, we also watch ourselves act and we represent those actions and you unbelief that as a consequence of us manifesting

Speaker 1:          00:22:51       a specific set of typically human behaviors over hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of years. We also evolved the cognitive apparatus that was capable of representing those patterns of behavior and that cognitive apparatus expressed the representations of those fundamental patterns of behavior in images, stick and symbolic form, and the basic images to can. Symbolic form is something like drama. Now, why would that be? Well, it's. It's obvious in some sense. What is drama? Drama is the representation, the abstract representation of patterns of behavior. That's what you do when you go to a movie, you watch people manifest their characteristic behaviors and then you might know that there's. Well, there's characteristic Kwanzaa, unique of behavior that are portrayed in drama. So for example, there's the bad guy and he wears the black hat, know a cowboy movie, and whenever you go to a movie, it's pretty clear to you right away who the good guys are and the bad guys are, and you accept the distinction between good and bad guys as an a priority acceptable distinction.

Speaker 1:          00:24:05       So you would say, well, that's the action of an archetype. What underlies that is the archetypal story of the hostile brothers and hostile brothers, for example, or Cain and Abel, which is the story of Cain and Abel in Genesis, by the way, is really the second story that that's in that origin myth, and it's the first story about real human beings, right? Because Adam and eve, so to speak, we're created by God. Whereas Cain and Abel were born, the first brothers. Well, what happened? Well, one of them became insanely jealous of the other and murdered him, so that's a pretty harsh story when you think that you know, the, the, the, the monotheistic religions of, of the West, roughly speaking, put as one of their foundational stories. The idea that there is a twin pair of forces operating the human psyche that can be conceptualized as brothers who are murderously opposed to one another. It's like that's part of the reason why that story hasn't disappeared. It's so powerful. It's so shocking. It's so powerful that it can't disappear, and the reason for that is that it's true in a sense. It's true. Like it's true that a reasonable drama, not all of them obviously, but a large proportion of them has a bad guy and a good guy. And then you might say, well, what would the archetypes be? Well, the archetypes would be the ultimate good guy and the ultimate bad guy, and there's representations of the

Speaker 1:          00:25:42       ultimate good guy in the ultimate bad guy. Young was very influenced by Christianity and part of the reason for that is that he grew up in a state that was Protestant, primarily Christian and a number of his immediate ancestors were pastors, so he grew up in an atmosphere that was pretty saturated by religious ideas and so a lot of his thinking was heavily influenced by Christianity. So one of the things he pointed out was that just like Cain and Abel who are archetypes in a sense, they're archetypes of the. They're the Old Testament version of archetypes of the hostile brothers, Christ and Satan. Our archetypes and the reason they're archetypes is because virtually by definition, the satanic symbol, so to speak, is a representation of symbolic representation of everything that's terrible about human beings. It's an archetype. You can't imagine anything worse than that, so it's like a limit case.

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       And then when you go to a movie and you see bad guys, you can think of them as partial approximations of the archetype. Or you can think about them as the archetype. Differentiated in a manner that makes exposure to the archetype fresh and interesting because you just don't want to go and see the same old bad guy over and over and over. You want to explore the entire complex behavioral and representational system of the archetype of the, of evil in every conceivable situation. And in the same way you want to explore the archetype of good and the reason you want to do that in principle, depending on your motivations, is to control the influence of the factors that underlie the negative archetype in your life. And to manifest the factors that underlie the positive archetype. And that's why you hope for the good guy. It's also why generally speaking in a drama, you embody that good guy while you're watching the movie.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       So I can give you an example of this. So one of the things I learned to do with my son when I took them to movies because when he was a little guy, I took him to fairly intense movies and uh, sometimes too intense, but I'm. One of the things I taught him when he was afraid was keep your eye on the hero, not, don't be afraid or it's not real. It's like you could easily make a case that had movie is more real than normal life. Why would you watch it otherwise? What a movie is his normal life stripped of everything that's trivial. So if you strip a representation of everything that's trivial, what makes you think that isn't more real? So is fiction more real than life? Well, is abstraction more real than reality?

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       It certainly is. In many cases. I mean there are people who believe, for example, that mathematical representations are are the most real of phenomena. They certainly, if you're a very powerful mathematician, they certainly become. Or if your society is very powerful mathematically, it certainly gives you a tremendous amount of control over your environment. So the idea that abstractions aren't real is that's a silly idea and the idea that fiction isn't real, it all that indicates is a confusion about what constitutes real movie as a representation of characteristic behavioral patterns extending across time. And it can be a more or less useful, accurate distillation of those representations. And generally what we assume is that the greater the fictional representation because we make a distinction between great fictional representations and you know, second rate fictional representations. So Shakespeare, for example, is a master at exploring the contours, the archetype in a complex, realistic and useful manner.

Speaker 1:          00:29:49       Now you'll also believe so that there were these patterns of behavior and they would constitute the typical behavioral patterns of Human Beings. And then we evolved a system of representations of those patterns and that would, would enable us to understand the patterns in a way that other animals can't because we're self conscious, right? So what does it mean to be self conscious? It doesn't just mean that you know that you exist as a separate entity. It's not just a state of conscious awareness, it's a knowledge condition you have at your fingertips. A very large representational storehouse of abstract knowledge about what human beings are like. And that's developed over tens of thousands of years, right? It's a collective activity. The generation of all these stories we tell about each other. I mean, we have ancient stories. The oldest stories we have, by the way, are Mesopotamian stories far as I know, and the oldest Mesopotamian story, or one of the oldest Mesopotamian stories we have is a hero story where the, the God Marduk fights a great dragon and cuts her into pieces and makes the world and you might think, well,

Speaker 1:          00:31:06       what the Mesopotamians you know, what do you mean the world's created over the pieces of a great dragon? Well, it's, it's a Piagetian idea with a bit of narrative complexity added to it. It's like, well, how do you create the world? Well, you confront the unknown and you transform it into the known or you confront unexplored territory and you transform it into explored territory. And then you might say, well, what exactly is the unknown? Or what exactly is unexplored territory? And as scientists would say, well, you know, if you walk out in the field that you've never been in before, there's soil and material elements and that's what's really there. But that isn't exactly what's really there. It depends on your timeframe. So one of the things I could say about that, for example, is that if you wander outside the boundaries of your knowledge,

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       if you wandered outside the boundaries of your territory when you were an animal or when you were a more archaic human being, the probability that you are going to run into something that was going to tear you apart and eat you was extremely high. And so then I could say, well, the fundamental nature of the unknown is that which tears you apart in each you and you might think, well, is that what sort of reality is that? And I would say, you know, how you hear evolutionary psychologists talk sometimes. The fact that we evolved on the African Veldt and now our nervous systems are sort of adapted for that primordial environment and not really for the modern environment. And so there's a mismatch between us in the modern world. It's like I, I think that's an absolutely reprehensible theory, partly because we didn't just evolve on the velt.

Speaker 1:          00:32:59       We've been evolving for a very long time. We spent a lot more time in trees, for example, than we did on the Veldt and while we were spending time in trees, a lot of us were eaten by snakes, for example, and so that's another reason why the the unknown itself is represented as this terrible predatory reptilian beast, and then the human being is represented as that which or the conscious element of the human being which is represented by the Mesopotamians as a god, the highest God actually in the hierarchy of Gods, which was a brilliant method, Mesopotamian realization because the Mesopotamians basically concluded in their drama, their religious drama, that the highest faculty of the human being was the capacity to consciously attend to the unknown and to make something new out of it. Well, that's a Piagetian idea, right? That's exactly what piaget was talking about when he talked about the necessity of comprehending knowledge as a process rather than as a collection of fact.

Speaker 1:          00:33:58       It's a process. What's the process? Confront what you don't understand. Boldly go where no one has ever gone, right? I mean Star Trek. That's where a systematizing minds get their mythology. You know? It's rife with mythology and it's initial statement is a mythological statement and it's a statement of the eternal explorer and that's an archetypal idea and you know, you might say, well, are you still threatened by those terrible things that threatened your ancestors on the Veldt? And normally people would say, well no, because there are no lions, but that's because they don't get the categories right. Lion is a subcategory of unknown horrible thing and you guys are surrounded by unknown horrible things just like people have always been surrounded by unknown horrible things, so because you're just as prone to disease, not quite as prone, but fundamentally you're a finite being and there's things everywhere that act in a predatory manner, in relationship to you and you will die.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       And so the idea that the material conditions of our environment have changed in a qualitative manner since the time we spent on the belt is an. It's an error of category. The mythological categories of our categories that represent environmental entities, so to speak, some of which are social that have existed for vast stretches of time and which exceed our capacity to detect. With our census, so one representation for example is the great father or the wise old man and the wise old man of the great father is a representation of the dominance hierarchy. Now the problem with the dominance hierarchy is you can't see it, but it's there. It's really there and then figures like the great mother, especially the terror because most of the archetypal figures come in pairs a positive element and a negative element and that's because virtually everything that manifests itself to you in a complex environment, if you're living being takes with one hand and gives with the other, you know, so nature is benevolent and kind and wise and the source of all new knowledge and also cancer and malarial mosquitoes and the tetsy fly and the Guinea worm and all these things that are horrifying and destructive beyond belief and you're stuck with both and then society.

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       We talked about this before. That's the great father. On the one hand here you are benevolently protected by your social surround. On the other hand, social structures tend towards tyranny and authoritarianism and they'll press the individuals within them at the same time that they sustain their development, and so that's a dichotomous archetype and then there's the individual who's on the one hand a remarkable and wonderful creature and on the other hand, someone who's capable of atrocities like those, the characterized the auctions of many millions of people in the 20th century. Those are all archetypes. There are more archetypes than that, like the archetype of the predatory rep tail with something to offer, which is essentially a dragon is the most fundamental archetipal representation. You found that representation in l chemical manuscripts mostly in the form of the Earl burls, which is a snake that eats its own tail and it's a symbol of matter and spirit in union because the snake is sort of matter and the wings on the snake, the dragon make it spirit.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       So it's like the fundamental elements of reality or matter in spirit in some kind of conjoined, um, state. And the fundamental task of the human being is to come to terms with the nature of that unknown thing. Now, think about it this way. Well, why would ancient people represent the unknown as such as a Reptilian self contained reptilian form that was both spiritual and Matt and material? Well, here's the reason. First the unknown is dangerous and you could be at spray so you better have that representation at hand and then you might ask, well, is that really the unknown? And then I would say, well, it depends absolutely on what you mean by really from a Darwinian perspective, that was the best way to conceptualize the unknown. And then you might say, well that doesn't make it real, and then I might say, you're, are you sure about that?

Speaker 1:          00:38:30       Is there anything more real than than representations derived from Darwinian? The darwinists would say, no. Okay, so why does it matter in spirit? Why is it weighing in and on the ground at the same time? Well, this is. You can also understand this from a phd and perspective and so that is because when you encounter the unknown, you separate the material world in the spiritual world and the spiritual wilderness is the psychological world and so what you're doing, when you encounter the unknown, as you parse some of it up into the world and you incorporate other elements of it into yourself and the best way to think about that, I think from a conceptual perspective so it becomes more understandable, is that what you encounter when you encounter the unknown is patterned information and you take some of that pattern and information into yourself. Even by doing something as simple as gripping something you want to pick up because you're imitating the pattern of the thing that you want to pick up.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       And that's how you're transforming it. Structure into an element of your being. And so when you're exploring the unknown, it's constructivist idea. You're simultaneously constructing the world and constructing yourself, and thus the inference is the unknown is made out of that which can be parsed out into psyche and matter. And it's dangerous. So it's a perfectly reasonable representation. And that's why it won't go away. So Young's fundamental contribution, I would say is the is his analysis of hero mythology. And I would say that's the fundamental element of his thinking. Now, the relationship between that and Nisha is fundamentally this Nicha believed that once the religious systems collapsed, we would have to consciously produce our new set of values. But young believed that the psyche was the source of all value and the so that it wasn't a matter of creating new values. It was a matter of discovering the values that were already lying dormant and implicit within us.

Speaker 1:          00:40:31       So, and the next thing I would say about that is, you all know this, you just don't know you know it. And so one of the reasons to be to be educated from a literary and historical perspective is that you can come to understand what you already know because if you don't understand it, then there's an element of your being the element that knows it and acts it out. And there's another element which is sort of you as a personality that are completely at odds with one another, and that makes you weak. It's it makes you something that's divided within itself. Now you're doing everything you can as a general rule to incorporate this information now for a long time. It seems as if as long as we acted it out and represented it symbolically and didn't argue about the assumptions, it was more or less okay, but we're past that now and in order for us to benefit from the same protective structures that our ancestors benefited from, we now have to understand what they mean consciously. And that's really what young was up to. What he was really trying to do was to resurrect deep religious representations from the dead, so to speak, and to make them conscious so people could align themselves with them again. Now I'm going to show you something that's related to that.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       All right, now. So we're going to show you something from Pinocchio. Now, this is an initiation ritual. It's a journey to the depths, so it's journey to the underworld. It's the consequence of a collapse. In previous personality and the disintegration of that previous personality into a chaotic state, prime prior to rebirth now what happens in Pinocchio, which by the way was released at about the same time that World War Two was was brewing and which also contains one of the best representations of of the of the individual motivations for fascism that I've ever seen anywhere. That's the scenes that are associated with pleasure island. Remember all the. The puppet is trying to become a real boy, right? So he's a Marionette to begin with, something else is pulling his strings well for you. That's your habitual state of being. Something else is pulling your strings. Even the idea that you're autonomous is the consequence of something else pulling your strings and for you.

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       What you needed to do was find out exactly who and what is pulling your strings and decide if that's the direction in which you want to go, and that's really what happens to Pinocchio because we're going to watch Pinocchio Part of it in the Pinocchio Story. He starts out as a marionette. Now he's a Marionette, made by a good father because Japan was a good father. He's a good craftsman and so on. So he's a marionette with a benevolent puppeteer. But as soon as he developed some autonomy, then he becomes pray to forces that are elements of the demonic archetype. In fact, the worst bad guy in the entire movie turns into Satan himself at one point in the movie, basically has horns in a bright red face and he manifests himself as so terrifying that the coyote, coyote,

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       [inaudible] Fox and the cap that are trying to corrupt Pinocchio or terrified because they get like they're criminals. They're petty criminals and deceptive and so forth. But when they get a look at who's pulling their strings, it's enough to terrify them. And so Pinocchio goes through a series of temptations of various sorts, including authority and, and the Freudian temptation is to remain weak and sickly instead of becoming a real person. So it's an eternal problem. And another problem that faces Pinocchio is that he's offered false celebrity as a way of solving his life's problems. So he's offered the opportunity to become an actor. And what that means is a deceitful fake who's constructed a persona that makes him appear far more valuable than he really is. So the movie outlines to pathological modes of movement towards maturity, one being a phony and the other taking the easy way out, and the and hyper are valuing all your pathology so that you become dependent. So anyways, and then another mode of pathological development is offered to Pinocchio, which is to do nothing but engage in short term, impulsive and destructive play. And that's on treasure island. But when he pleasure island, but when he goes to pleasure island, he finds that it's actually ruled by demonic forces with faceless entities who are transforming all the pleasure seeking marionettes to braying donkeys who are slaves like.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       So Pinocchio escapes from that end. He does it basically by jumping into the unknown. And that's where we're going to start our exposure to his initiation.

Speaker 1:          00:46:32       Okay, so now you can imagine what's happened is he was on pleasure island and everything went to hell fundamentally. And so he jumped into the water to escape from that. That's equivalent to plunging into chaos. And Chaos was an escape from pathological tyranny and now he's trying to go home. So this is the psyche in it's searched for maturation, runs into an obstacle which is the tyrannical element of the great father that it cannot cope with and it trucks home runs, hope to defeat typical part of a hero's story is the initial defeat of the hero when he encounters usually either the terrible great father or the terrible great mother, so and so. This is a retrogressive you'll would call this retrogressive restoration of the persona, so it's sort of like maybe you're a well adapted adolescent and you live at home and you're happy adolescent and everything's good at home, and then you go out to try to be an adult and you fail, and then when you come back home you try to act like a happy adolescent again, but you're not what you are in fact is an unhappy adult.

Speaker 1:          00:47:36       And if you move back to the happy adolescent mode of being, then it's false and pathological. You can't go home again. Another typical motif in literature. Now the cricket. I can't tell you everything about this story. I can tell you a couple of strange things about it. One is that the cricket is Jimminy Cricket, right? And the initials of Jimminy cricket or RJC and Jimminy cricket was a common Southern American mild form of a cursing. It's the equivalent of Jesus Christ. And so you might think, and of course the cricket is Pinocchio's conscience and well, so then you might ask yourself why in the world would a pejorative, mildly pejorative term for Jesus Christ be applied to a cricket who's guiding a puppet into the water to rescue his father from a whale? Why would any of that happen? And answer to that is, you know why, but you can't say why you can't say why, you know, or what it is that you know, but the mere fact that it makes sense and it does is an indication from union perspective that you're operating in an archetipal level.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       You understand this. And so I could say, here's an example of why the cricket is a bug. Well, things bug you, right? We say that things bug me. Well, you should do something about the things that bug you because that's your conscience calling to you. It's it's destiny in some sense, manifesting itself as an unconscious impulse that really bugs me means if you can, you should do something about it because you think about it, man. There's a lot of things out there that might bug you, but lots of them don't. But as some of them do, well, why do those bug you and not other things? Well, that's a complicated question, but one potential answer to it is that there's part of your psyche that's oriented towards further development. Young would call that the self and that's like the totality of everything that you could be and it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a strange sort of entity in some sense because it's partly potential and it's potential that expands across time. But the way that your potential totality calls to you in the present is by placing things in front of you that are your problem and they announced themselves as your problem and they do that by bothering you.

Speaker 1:          00:50:06       So then if you pick up the task of fixing the things that bothers you, then you find the pathway to further expansion of your personality.

Speaker 1:          00:50:18       So, and that's what's happening with Pinocchio now. One of the things that's really interesting about the Pinocchio movie and that makes it incredibly sophisticated, is that despite the fact that the cricket is a Avatar of Christ, so to speak, the cricket has things to learn just like Pinocchio. And so that's very cool because it's so cool. It's so sophisticated because it means that you do have a conscience that guides you, but until you establish a dialogue with it, both you and the conscience or immature, you have to establish a conscious dialog with it and then interact together in a manner that propels your development across time. And that'll stop you from being a Marionette of forces that would make you a brain donkey who does nothing but slave away in salt mines. So, okay, so Pinocchio goes home and that doesn't work, and that's where we're gonna. Start here.

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       Okay. So what's happened there? Well, many, many things at multiple levels of reality simultaneously. And that's the characteristic of an archetypal story. So on one level, Pinocchio's too old to go home, he can't go home to his father because in some sense he's already transcended his father. So there are things, for example, that your father can't help you with. And the reason for that is that you don't. He doesn't know any more about the situation than you do and he can't. And so that's where his knowledge limits out. So that would be sort of on the personal level. And then on the trends personal level, which would be the deeper, deeper archetipal level. What's happening to Pinocchio is exactly what needs you described at the end of the 19th century, because remember that Japan has his creator and now he's dead. He's gone. And so Pinocchio is bereft of, of

Speaker 1:          00:52:52       placement, so to speak. He's, his soul has been corrupted and he doesn't know what to do about it. And when he returns to his family home or when he returns to his tradition, what he finds is nothing. Okay? So then what happens? Well, this is another thing that you'll swallow with just no problem whatsoever. While this dove comes along that's sort of Goldman glowing and drops a note right in front of him. Now you may remember, and perhaps you don't, but the star from which the dove comes is a representation of the blue fairy and the blue fairy is the positive element of the unknown in Pinocchio Movie. And so what it basically is saying that when you're despairing because your father has died and your tradition has nothing to offer, that the positive element of the unknown may provide you with a message about where to go.

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       If you pay enough attention. That would be an intuition or it would be the automatic attraction of your interest to a new thing by forces that you do not understand. So one of the real ways of coming to grips with the idea of the act of the unconscious is to understand that you cannot control what you're interested in. And so then you might ask, well, if it's not you, what is it? And if you think about that problem long enough, you'll start to understand what you was talking about because that is the way that you can understand in your own life that the things that direct you as a being are not things that you consciously choose. In fact, they're not even things that you can consciously choose. They're directed by other forces. So anyways, the dove drops a message in front of Pinocchio and, and the cricket. Now it's the cricket that reads it. So it's the same idea as what bugs you, so to speak. The cricket is an interpreter.

Speaker 1:          00:55:23       Okay, so now what have we found out? Well, we found out that God, the father and God the father, the Creator are not in fact dad, which is what needs should pronounced but alive in some weird way, and this horrible creature at the bottom of the ocean. And so what is Pinocchio decided to do? He decides to go find them. That's actually what you're doing at university by the way, for all the chaos that you experience when you come to university and all the uncertainty and all the doubt. What you're trying to do is to resurrect your dad, father from the bottom of the ocean, and if you do that, you won't be a Marionette and if you don't, you will be.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       Now, this is very interesting because the conscience here plays a very dichotomous role, so on the one hand, Pinocchio is often ahead of his conscience, so to speak. So he's taking the leading role and the dialogue is kind of choppy and neither of them know exactly what they're doing. But in this situation it's very paradoxical because you can see Pinocchio's been half turned into bring Jack Ass at this point. Something you might well consider when you remember your adolescence. So at this point that that the cricket, his conscience does two things. It warns them how horrible this is going to be and how utterly dangerous it is. And then at the same time it helps them prepare and goes along with them. And so it's quite comical. So watch what happens here. Okay, so I've cut this a little bit, but what happens in the movie is that he goes to the bottom of the ocean and he starts to ask about monster. And as soon as he asked any of the fish down there, the denizens of the sub oceanic world where monster ways they just run away. And so monster, who is he who cannot be named, right? And I'm sure you've encountered that in your reading before, right? That's the, that's the hallmark of

Speaker 1:          00:58:00       in the Harry Potter series, right? See now you've done it. Yeah. So this represents something so terrible that it can't even be talked about. Okay. So what happens is Pinocchio ends up not only at the bottom of the ocean, but he has to go to the deepest part of the bottom of the ocean where the most terrible thing rests. And so we're cutting to the point where he does that. So now you might ask how did Japan will get into the whale? And answer to that is, it's never really made that clear in the movie, but I can tell you some things about that. Is that

Speaker 2:          00:59:10       okay

Speaker 1:          00:59:11       if you conceptualize your historical tradition as a personality, like a body of laws and customs? Say it's not. It's dead, right? Because it's composed of the past and because it's dead, it can't come up with anything new, so if it encounters something new, it it stopped and that's what's happened to Japan is that he's engulfed by this entity that represents the absolute unknown and he cannot figure out how to get out, and the reason for that is none of the things he knows, so none of the things that history has produced as a body of knowledge are sufficient to deal with the fundamental problem. That doesn't mean they're useless. It just means that just like the puppet is lost without the farther, the farther is also lost without the puppet, and that's the relationship between you and history, your history. When you study history, you think while you're studying a record of events in the past and that's not right.

Speaker 1:          01:00:15       What you're studying is the circumstances that gave rise to you as a, as a being, and unless you understand your history in every way you possibly can, then you're an incomplete creature. You don't know enough to move forward in the same way your culture being composed of dead father's, so to speak, can't progress without you because you're its eyes and there's an Egyptian story that features the God Horus, who I've talked to you about before, who actually resurrect his father from the dad by giving him an I so Japan, I can't figure out how to get out of this whale without help. So he's kind of pushing up tombstones there. You might note,

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       all right, now something very sophisticated happens here so and I have to explain it to you at multiple levels at the same time. So now Japan is hungry and when the whale opens its mouth, a lot of fish come in. Now, one of the things I want you to think about, you can just put this in the back of your mind, is that one of the oldest sister, one of the oldest symbolic representations of Christ is a fish and all of his followers were fishermen, and so there's this weird relationship between the messianic figure who's at the base of it, at least at the base of Christian culture and the idea of things that are pulled up from the depths. Now, here's what happens in this part of the movie. It's so amazing. So Japan was looking for fish and the reason for that is he doesn't think he can get out of the whale, and so he might as well have some fish while he's while he's in there, and so he's given up on getting out. Now what happens is that the whale swallows as if he's a fish,

Speaker 1:          01:02:22       so Pinocchio was put into the same category as fish and it happens. It happens to Japan a couple of times. He Mistakes Pinocchio for a fish. You'll see. So what that means in some senses that you pedo can't distinguish between the fish. That will feed you for the day and whatever it is that Pinocchio represents, and so you could think about Pinocchio as a fisherman instead of as a fish, and so you can think about it this way. And here, here's a. here's a, an old saying, if you give a man a fish, you feed him for one day, but if you teach him to fish, you feed him forever. And so the idea is it's better to develop the skill to acquire something than it is to have the thing. Now, what Pinocchio represents is he's like a mega fish. I know this is a strange way of thinking about it. Japan was problem, isn't that he's hungry.

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       His problem is that he can't get out of the whale and so what he's fishing for isn't something to eat. It's something that will help them get out of the whale, but he can't recognize the difference between the approximate solution, which is so that he'll no longer be hungry. So he's got a very short term outlook and a solution to the much broader problems. So what happens is the whale swallows a bunch of fish in Pinocchio's in there and Japan was fishing away and he catches Pinocchio and Pinocchio Announces Himself and Japan says, tells them to be quiet because he's interfering with him fishing. And then when he turns to Hug Pinocchio because he wakes up, he actually hugs a fish and then he discards the fish. So then he figures out the Pinocchios there. Then Japan, oh, decides that. Well, they're going to have to live inside the whale and it's another I idea of his blindness at this point because he's.

Speaker 1:          01:04:00       He's composed of the dead past so to speak. So what Pinocchio does it start to destroy the ship itself, which is what they're floating in and the whale to start a fire and the fire makes the whale mad enough to spit them out. And the whale then transforms itself into a dragon and tries to kill them because it's a fire breathing entity at that point. And so part of the understory is it's better to figure out how to fish than to fish or that more profoundly, it's better to figure out how to do something than to merely benefit from the thing itself. Pinocchio represents that which can do new things. So he's a hero and he's willing to destroy part of the current order that's the ship in order to produce a new strategy that will actually free them from the way out. Now he wants to get his farther out of there too. So that's what happens in the next five minutes, I would say.

Speaker 2:          01:08:34       Come down here.

Speaker 1:          01:08:42       Okay. So now there's a shark here because essentially in some sense the entity that's going to provide the solution to this very complex problem has arrived on the scene, but it's quite damaged. First of all, it's been speaking improperly, right? So that's an adolescent representation. So it braise a lot of nonsense and it's been corrupted in a variety of ways. And so you know, to to some degree, what that means is that as you mature and you're moving away from your mere marionette status, your interaction with society like Russo said, corrupts you in all sorts of ways. I mean you're participating in that corruption, but it still happens. But in the representation in the movie, the truth of the matter is, is doesn't matter if you've been corrupted to some degree, as long as you have an absolutely sacrificed to your capacity for true speech and vision. So you know that's a pretty hopeful message because Pinocchio is by no means a perfect entity, but he might be good enough.

Speaker 1:          01:10:08       See, that's also an indication there of white people are often unwilling to form of representation with a so to speak form a relationship with the archetype of the great father because to some degree the archetype is a figure of perfection. And the individual in relationship to that archetype is always pathologically flawed. And so the embarrassment of that realization, which is exactly what's happening to Pinocchio Right now, is often enough to stop people from doing it. So what, what that would say to say what that means in some sense is that in order for you to mature in the fullest possible manner, you have to understand the manner in which you're deeply flawed in relationship to the, to your, your potential as it might be historically determined. And that's a very bitter thing to do. You know, it's much easier and people do this all the time to engage in half witted formulaic, ideological criticisms of the system as a whole. It's like, you know, the probability that the system is more flawed than you is pretty damn low. So you want to start with, you know, getting rid of your donkey ears in your tail and stopped bringing nonsense before you judge the entire, you know, historical process by which human beings have come into being. So anyways, that's kind of what that means.

Speaker 2:          01:11:48       What do you eat when you eat it? Whole Pinocchio.

Speaker 1:          01:12:18       Okay. So this is very interesting too because. So Pinocchio ends up being a master of fire. While you can think about that as there was a book written awhile back by a primatologist who also wrote demonic males, Richard rang him and he talked about the origin of fire and as far as Wrangham is concerned, we invented fire about 2 million years ago and that enabled us to cook food and that enabled us to swap intestinal length for brain. So if you look at a chimpanzee, chimpanzees are like the ultimate in couch potatoes, right? They're, they're, they're about this high and they're shaped like this. They have this huge barrel body and the reason they have that is because they eat leaves and so they have to spend like eight hours a day eating leaves. They will eat meat if they can get it. They have to spend like eight hours a day eating leaves and just chewing them over and over because like leaves a.

Speaker 1:          01:13:11       They don't want to be eating, so they're pretty tough than inedible and B, they don't have any new tricks. Nutritive quality, just speak up. So the chimpanzee has to spend all of its time chewing, which is rather mindless endeavor. All things considered. Whereas human beings 2 million years ago or thereabouts, invented fire and as a consequence of that, we could cook meat and meat is incredibly energy rich and so and it's easy to digest once it's cooked and so the consequence of the invention of fire was that were the way we are today. We could have a brain instead of a gut. And so the idea that Pinocchio's mastery of fire, and it's as something more than merely a means of cooking. That's how it started out. Right? But you can think of our entire technological capacity as stemming from the mastery of fire. Now the other thing you can think of, and this is very much worth considering, is that Pinocchio Masters Fire and that turns the whale into a dragon.

Speaker 1:          01:14:09       And so the idea there too is that, and this is an old idea, is that our technological prowess is something that makes nature itself angry. And of course you might say, well, do you believe this? And the answer to that is, well, how many of you have environmentalist leanings? And that's exactly the story that you're following you, because you're still wondering about whether not mastery of fire was in somehow against the natural order and then it will end up in all of our depths and you know that's a reasonable thing to worry about, but not mastering it was going to end up pretty badly too. So

Speaker 2:          01:15:02       sense.

Speaker 1:          01:17:31       So here, what happens is that in the midst of this complete chaos, Pinocchio has a choice and the choices you can either save themselves, which is a very, very selfish choice and reduces him to an Aa historical individual because he has no relationship left with his father or he can put himself at great risk and rescue his father. No, finish the process. Stop his father from drowning and complete the story. Okay, so Pinocchio Dies and then his father brings him home. And so because he's rescued is farther, the benevolent spirit of nature appears. Resurrect him and turns them into a real human being. So it's pretty funny as far as I'm concerned that the answer to Nietzsche's Greek question manifested itself in Nineteen, mid 19 thirties in the forms of a Gnat form of an animated child's movie. So you know, and that's an, that's an example. That's an example of a number of things, an example of how archetypes work. It's also an example of how artists are on the edge of discovery all the time and they discover things they don't even understand. So we'll see you next Tuesday.
