Speaker 1:          00:02          Well, I have a question. I guess I'd like to know a little bit more about why you specifically chose the title, the master and the emissary. Yeah. That, that's uh, an attempt to explain what I believe to be the relationship if he needs and habits, fears, um, that like most other things in life, the in equal and asymmetrical and one of the brain hemispheres sees more than the other. That is the one that I've designated the master and it was the right hemisphere. That's a weird inversion because people often think of the left hemisphere is the one that's dominant. They do, they do. Traditionally that's been the case. Uh, but um, as is becoming ever clearer, the right hemisphere, this has been a real steep learning curve for some people, but the, the right hemisphere is in many ways more reliable, sees more, understands more than the left hemisphere, which is like a sort of high functioning bureaucrat.

Speaker 1:          01:03          In a way. The idea of the story was simply that certain matters needed to be delegated not to only because as it were, the master couldn't do everything. He needed an emissary to go abroad and do some of it, but also that he must not get involved with a certain point of view. Otherwise he'd lose what it was if you did see. So that's what I'm really saying there is, there was a good reason why evolution, really speaking, the two brain hemispheres are separate. And when you see it doesn't get involved, what's the advantage of, of that, that detachment from the involvement? Well, it's that, um, Ramonica Hall who you know, is a great histopathologist. Yep. Um, one of his findings was in primates are more inhibitory neurons and then any other animals. And there are more in humans than in any other primate. And um, there are many more being in proportionally, proportionately, and there are more kinds as well.

Speaker 1:          02:04          So we think that about 25% of the entire, um, cortex is, is inhibitory, right? So it's a very strong effect. And the Corpus callosum seems to be very largely in the end inhabiting function in the other hemisphere. And that is, I think, because over time the two hemispheres of had to specialize. There are reasons why actually it can't be, I'm not going to go into now, but I was talking about just a few days ago. That'd be evolutionary sake cacciatore meeting. But there are reasons way the Corpus callosum has had to become more selective and to inhibit quite a lot of what's going on in the other hemisphere because it enables the two to do distinct things. And of course they have to work together. But usually good teamwork doesn't mean everyone trained to do the same row. So differentiation is very important for two elements to work together. And inhibition is one way of doing that. So effectively the two takes on the world if you like, that the hemispheres have, are not easily compatible. Um, and we're not aware of that because at a level below consciousness, there's a metric control center that is bringing them together. So in ordinary experience, we don't feel we're in two different worlds, but effectively we are. And they have different qualities and different goals, different values, different, different takes on what is important in the, in the world. And what meeting,

Speaker 2:          03:37          let me ask you about, I, I've got, I've developed a conceptual scheme for, for thinking about the relationship between the two hemispheres and I'm kind of, I've been curious about what you think about it and how it might map on to or not you're your ideas. So I've been really interested in the orienting reflex and discovered by socal off, I think back in about 1962. Right? He was a student of Laureus and the orienting reflexes manifested when something, at least in their terminology is something unpredictable happened. I've thought much more recently did. It's actually when something undesired happened happens and the laboratory constraints obscured that. And that turned out to actually be important. But, um, so, and I kind of put together the ideas of the orienting reflects with some of the things I learned from young young's observations on the function of art and dreams.

Speaker 2:          04:28          So imagine that you have a conceptual scheme laid out, right? We could say that it's, it's, it's linguistically mediate, it's enforced on the world. And then there are exceptions to that, to that conceptual scheme. And those are anomalies. Those are the numbers that are unexpected and the orienting reflex orients you towards those. And so those are things that aren't fitting property in your conceptual scheme that you have to figure out. So the first thing you do is react defensively essential because it might be dangerous. And then your exploratory systems are activated. So, and the exploratory systems, first of all, our enhanced attention from an intentional perspective. But then, and this is where the art issue sort of creeps into it. It's the idea would be something like the right hemisphere generates an imaginative landscape of possibility that could map that a normally. So you can kind of experience that if it's at night, you know, like say you're sitting alone at night, it's two or three in the morning, you're kind of tired.

Speaker 2:          05:23          Um, maybe you're in an unfamiliar place and there's a noise that happens that shouldn't happen in another room. You can play with that. So, for example, if you open the door slightly and put your hand in turn on the light and you watch what happens, your mind will fill with imaginative representations of what might be in the room, right? So it's like the, the, the, the landscape of anomaly will be populated with something like imaginative demons. And that's a first pass approximation. And it seems to me that that's a right hemispheric function. And then that as you explore further that imaginative domain, which, which circumscribes what might be, is constrained and constrained and constrained and constrained until you get what it actually is and that specialized in routinized. It's something like that. Does that seem like a reasonable, what do you think about that as well

Speaker 1:          06:12          for a whole host of reasons? Um, one is, you mentioned a defense and one of the ideas behind my hypothesis is that the right hemisphere is on the lookout for predators, right? Whereas the left hemisphere is looking for prey. And this has been confirmed in many species, have never heard that second part, amphibians and mammals. Yes. Um, uh, so, so when you're in left hemispheric mode, you're more in Predator mode and when you'd wave home as well, I mean, of course we are not uh, lizards or toads or marmosets or whatever. But in animals, generally speaking, this is the case getting and grasping. And after all our left hemisphere is the London. It controls the grasping hand, his left hemisphere and uh, exploring which you mentioned is more right hemisphere. And when the, when a frontal function is deficient, um, people often go into sematic mode of the hand of that side and the left hand, it's usually explorer, few emotions, meaningless ones, but trying to explore the environment and with the right hand it's grasping pointlessly at things.

Speaker 1:          07:25          So they, as it were, the automatic thing is with the, with the left hand, the right hemisphere to explore with the right hand, the left hemisphere to grasp. So when you said exploratory and you said defense, and you said also opening up to possibilities, these are all aspects of the way the right hemisphere. I often say the right hemisphere opens up to possibility, whereas the left hemisphere wants to close down to a certain team and you need both chaos, chaos, and order. And you knew I loved him. In your talk, you talked about um, uh, chaos and order, but if I may say so you've seemed maybe you'd like to gloss that a little. You seem to suggest that it would be good, we can't get rid of chaos, but you've seemed to imply that it would be better if we could, whereas my view is it chaos and order unnecessary to one another and there is a proper sort of harmony

Speaker 2:          08:17          well balanced. Well, yeah. Well, okay. That mean I think that's, that's as deep a question as you could possibly ask. I would say in some sense some of the, I would say there's a central theological issue there. The issue there is the, you know, in genesis the proper environment if humanity is construed as a garden. And so I see that as the optimal balance of chaos and order because nature is flourishes and it's prolific in his chaotic, yeah. Then if you add harmony to that, you have the garden. So you live in the garden, you're supposed to tend the garden. Okay, so now the garden is created. It's a walled space because eden is a wallet space. It's a pair of day side. So it's a walled garden. That's it. Now the thing is, as soon as you make a wall, you try to keep what's outside out, but you can't because the boundaries between things are permeable.

Speaker 2:          09:02          So if you're going to have reality and you're going to have a bounded space, you're going to have a snake in the garden. Now then the question is, what the hell should you do about that? Should we make the walls so high that no snake can possibly get in or should or should you allow for the possibility of snakes, but make yourself strong enough so that you can contend with them? And I think there's, there's an answer there that goes deep to the question of even maybe why theological question of why God allowed evil to exist in the world. I agree with you. It's like, well, do you make people safe or strong? And strong is better and safe might not be commensurate with being like, it might not be possible to exist and to be safe. Well, so existence is predicated on the fact that we die.

Speaker 2:          09:45          Well was never safe. Well it's certainly bounded, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's inevitably wrapped up with that sort of finitude. So there's this old, there's a lovely, lovely Jewish id and ancient idea. It's one of the most profound ideas I've ever come across. And so it's a kind of a Zen Koan and, and here it is. Is that, um, so it's a question about the classic attributes of God, Omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent. What is it being with those three attributes? Lock, what kind of question is that? The answer is limitation. And the second answer is that's the justification for being is that the unlimited lacks the limited. Exactly. And so because limited is us

Speaker 1:          10:27          for anything to come into existence and needs to be an element of resistance. And so things are never predicated on one pole of what is always a dipo. Everything is, has that, uh, diapers. Yeah, it's like a prerequisite for being, it is and it's imaged in the yen, yen idea. Um, but it seems to me very important because in our culture we often seem to suppose that certain things are just good and other things are just about, it'd be good if we could get rid of the bad ones, but actually my pursuing certain good things that are good within measure too far, they become bad and so forth. But let's go back to her and normally thing because Ramachandran calls the right hemisphere the anomaly detection. And so I think that that's a very important point because there are two ways you can react to an anomaly.

Speaker 1:          11:15          One is two and both have to be explored. One is to try and prove that it's not really an anomaly and therefore you can carry on with things as normal. And the other is hopeful that that's, that's the, that's the typical left hemisphere approach. It doesn't want anything to have to shift and quite reasonably, you don't want to be chaotically shifting if you're onto a good thing. Too stressful. Exactly. That takes too much work. And you might actually be mistaken. So in a way it's perfectly correct to be wary, but it's not correct to be so wary that you blot out anomalies. And there's a lot of evidence, as I'm sure you know, the left hemisphere simply blocks out everything that doesn't fit with it's cheap. It doesn't see it actually. You're tall. So it's a hugely important element and the right hemisphere going hang on. But the maybe another way of thinking that will accommodate this better and actually good science needs yes. To be skeptical about anomalies, otherwise there'd be chaos, but it also needs to be able to shift. And when an anomaly is really large enough, right, right. Quite a lot of them. And they don't really fit very well into.

Speaker 2:          12:23          Exactly, yes. Yes. So there's a, there's another observation that you made, which I loved it. I loved this observation. He was trying to account for radical personality transformation, right? And so his idea was this, and I think it's, it's, it's commensurate with the ideas of inhibition between the two hemispheres. So let's imagine the left is habitually inhibiting the function of the right to keep fear under control. It does that all sorts of ways, but so imagine that the right is I'm reacting to anomalies and it's aggregating them. Okay. The left camp deal with them. So the right is aggregating anomalies and maybe that's starting to manifest itself in nightmarish dreams. For example. It's like all these anomalies are piling up. It's indication that you're on shifting sound. Also then imagine that the right hemisphere aggregates normally is and then it starts to detect patterns in the anomalies and so now it starts to generate what you might consider a counter hypothesis to the left type offices. If that counter or hypothesis gets to the point where the total sum in some sense of the anomalies plus the already mapped territory can be mapped by that new pattern, then at some point it will shift and the person will kick into a new personality consideration. It's like a Piagetian stage transition except more dramatic.

Speaker 1:          13:34          It is. And what a Ph [inaudible] stage physician is also like and subsumes both is he galean uh oh fable. The idea that, um, uh, thing is opposed by something else, but when it, when there is a synthesis, it's not that one of them is an isolated, they're both transformed and taken up into the new hoe, which embraces

Speaker 2:          13:58          before look like look like an opposition. Here's a question for you. You know, when I read Thomas Kuhn and I was reading top piaget at the same time and I knew that piaget was aware of Kuhn's work by the way end. The problem I had with Kuehne and the interpretation interpreters of coon is they don't seem to get something who, who, who interpret Kuhn has a moral relativist in some sense. They don't seem to get the idea of um, increased generalized ability of a plant. So let's say I have a theory and a bunch of anomalies, a crew and I have to wipe out the theory. And so then I wipe out the theory and I incorporate the anomalies and now I have another theory. So that's a descent into chaos. That's my estimation. That's the old story. So the anomaly, yeah, disruption is the mythical descend into chaos. And then you reconfigure this theory with the chaos and you come up with a better theory. Okay, the question, why is it better? And the answer is what accounts for everything that the previous theory, accountants plus the anomalies. So there's progress. Yes, exactly. And but coon is often read is stating that there is no progress that you know there's incommensurate paradigms and you have to just shift between them. But there isn't, there isn't cumulative knowledge in some sense.

Speaker 1:          15:10          Well I think one thing that when we probably would both agree about is that we don't buy the story that you need because nothing can be demonstrated definitively, utterly to be the case. There is no truth. I mean I think we both believe that there are truths, things that are true or than other things. And indeed, if we're where we couldn't even talk and we, if we did, and even to say that there are no truth is itself a truth statement, which is, it's truer than the statement. There are truths so everybody automatically has truth whether they know it or not.

Speaker 2:          15:47          Yeah. Just because you were you, you said why? I don't think, it's not only that you can't talk, you can't even see no, cause you don't know how to,

Speaker 1:          15:55          you wouldn't know how to discriminate what coming into your brain. So it's inevitable. Um, uh, I think we would agree about that, but I think that there's maybe a slight point of difference between us in the time I'm very willing to, uh, embrace the idea of uncertainty. And I, I maybe wrong, perhaps you could expand on that, but sometimes you come across as, as a man who has certainties that

Speaker 2:          16:23          well, it's a peculiar kind of certainty. I'm certain that standing on the border between order and chaos is a good idea. That's a weird, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Now you need to be in the sort of slightly unstable position. Yes. You have to. How do you have to be,

Speaker 1:          16:39          um, what would you say?

Speaker 2:          16:41          Encountering as much uncertainty as you can voluntarily tolerate? Yeah, but I think that's equivalent to Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. So when we talked a little bit earlier about the idea of an instinct for meaning. So I think what meaning is, it's, it's, it's the elaborated form of the orienting reflex, but what meaning does its function, its biological function, which I think is more real in some sense than any other biological function is to tell you when you're in the place where you've balanced the stability, let's say of your left hemisphere systems with the exploratory capacity of your right. So that not only are you master of your domain, but you're expanding that domain simultaneously. And when you, I think that when you're there and it's a, it's a, it's a kind of a metaphysical place in some sense that you're imbued with a sense of meaning and purpose. And that's an indication that you've actually optimized your neurological function.

Speaker 1:          17:33          Yes. And the pimps, we could gloss the idea of purpose because I think there's a difference between, people get very confused. I think about the idea of purpose, particularly whether there's a problem that suggesting there is a purpose and I believe there is a purpose or they're, our purpose is to the cosmos. Not just to me and suggest that somehow it's all been predetermined by God. But this is to misunderstand the nature of time, that there are time static slices and God is there and he's sorted it all out and the whole thing is just unfolding as Bergson says like ladies fan being unfurled. It was extremely boring and, and, and, and an entirely static and noncreative universe. But actually something is at stake. Things are unfolding. They have overall a direction, but actually exactly what that direction is isn't known. And I know it's a fool who says anything positive about the nature of God, but I'm not convinced that God is omniscient and omnipotent either.

Speaker 1:          18:39          I think God is in the process of is becoming, God is not only just becoming but is becoming family. So being and becoming more, becoming, becoming as important thing. Why do you think that it's also a strange segue, I mean I'm not criticizing, but I'm curious what, what drove you to that conclusion? An awful lot of thing is really, um, I think that everything is, is a process. In fact, I'm writing a book called, there are no things, there are processes and there are patterns. That's why I think music is so powerful. Music is one of the most mysterious and wonderful things in the universe and I didn't think it was a tool foolish of people to have thought that the, you know, plan a few motions were in a song. No, no, no. It's great. It's the kind of music, I think it is a very important insight.

Speaker 1:          19:34          Music, you know I've said this in public lectures that music is the most representative of the arts and music describes how those parents should be arranged. You're using representative in a very different way. It depends on what you mean by representing the ultimate reality of the cosmos. Well I would like to say presented in or that it's not representing anything. It is actually when we're in the presence of music, something is coming into being, which is, which is at the core of the whole cosmic process. I think that's why people love music. I, they do and I mean I just hardly any originality in the idea cause lots of visitors say this, that the sort of the movement of atoms and the movement of planets and so forth, uh, are more like a dance or more music than they are like things bumping in track.

Speaker 1:          20:27          Right, right, right. Um, so uh, kind of things as patterns that people have made into tools. I agree with you and tools and what the left hand is who is always looking for. It's always looking for something new to grasp it. Ray phase processes that if you, it's all a matter of time. Every single thing including the mountain behind my house, if you able to, which is billions of years old, if you were able to take, as it were a series of like a time lapse camera, you'd see the thing morphing and changing and flowing. Everything flows as eric takes is one second. Everything flows. It's just a question of over the time period that you consider it. It's a question of the time. And so taking time out of things and considering them in the abstract you resonated from context, particularly from the flow and from the context of time changes them into something else. And I think that what, uh, in brief what Plato has done and what a lot of the history of more recent Christianity has done is two things, defy God and have an perfect states that are unaltered and torn. And I think that it is an ever, ever more wonderfully self self exploring self actualizing process that requires a degree of opposition as a stream in order to have the movements and the, and the, the, the ideas and patterns in it. It has to be constrained deck

Speaker 2:          21:57          when I've experienced want, it's hard to describe these experiences but when I've contemplated death deeply, it's his struck me as a, as a fundamental repair mechanism. Like it's part of the mechanism by which new things that are better are brought into being. Absolutely. And I mean you see that in your own being because of course without death you couldn't live because you're dying. The things about you that aren't right, even at a physiological level are dying all the time. They are unfortunately, you also completely die, which used to be a bit of the unfortunate side but more cosmically speaking. It does seem to me that death is the is I dunno man, I s it's, I've had intuitions are intimations that death is the friend of being and that's like, it's hard to get my head around that. Pete,

Speaker 1:          22:41          do you agree with you and indeed that's being said by the many, many ways of people then than myself and maybe even the yourself. No, but I mean I think that that's right, that death is predicated on life, but also that it shouldn't be seen as a sort of something that's the negative. It's, it's a necessary stage in the process of being, becoming what it is and since everything is ramified since nothing, it's just isolated. You and I may look or feel as though, but as you often eloquently say, we all have the history and we, we have in time, we come from a place, but also as a culture, we have history. We can't detach ourselves from it were expressions of it, but we're also inevitably dependent as all organisms are on the environment where I end and where the quote environment begins is, uh, I didn't like the word environment nature, which would suggest something that's always been born whereas environments around me from which I'm separate.

Speaker 2:          23:45          But anyway, all of that is connected supposed to. Yes. Yes. So I would see us as like an idiot in a stream or like a wave in the seed that he was never separate the coming together of physics with, with this, with a process philosophy, a very strong, when does that book come out? When I finished writing and I'm very worried that um, it's getting bigger and is, you know, all the time I'm writing it, I'm seeing more and more of things that I am really must get to know more about. It's an ever receding. Um, well it's a danger of a book that I know that aims at something fundamental because every run you never hit the proper boundaries as it, I need that war.

Speaker 2:          24:33          I also had experiences, I would say when I was trying to understand as they're imaginative experiences, when I was trying to understand, let's say the necessity of evil. No, because that's also a fundamental theological conundrum and a metaphysical conundrum. How, why isn't that being as constituted such that evil is allowed to exist, right? It's Ivan Carrabba's Arvs. What critique of our valley, Osha's Christianity essentially what kind of God would allow for this sort of thing. The ancient question. Yeah, it's an ancient question and I mean, part of what I thought, what I've, I mean I thought about the adversarial element to that, which is that you need to challenge because you don't, you're not forced to bring forth what you could bring forth without a challenge and the greater the thing that you're supposed to bring forth, the greater of the challenge has to be so you need an adversary, something like that.

Speaker 2:          25:21          But then I also thought that it would, it's possible that that, that being being requires limitation. You might say optimal being requires sprite, free choice. I know I'm going through a lot of things quickly. Free choice requires the real distinction between good and evil. Without that, you don't have choice. Well, so maybe it's possible to set up a world where evil is a possibility, but where it isn't something that has to be manifest, you know, where, where it's an option open to you and a real option and it has to be, and the challenge that was presented to you, but it's something that you can not, you can not move towards if you, so if you, so desire, and that seems to me to be something like the eth ethical requirement that that's the fundamental ethical requirement to avoid evil. Doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.

Speaker 2:          26:06          It's not the same issue. No, it isn't. It isn't. Um, an I, I under one could recount it as the need for otherness. It goad, need something other and that other, if it's not going to be just part of God has got to be free, otherwise we'll be no creation. I mean, the, the, the, the nature that there is something other than, than God. Um, it may in the end come from and come back to, right. That God, we know that divine essence or that whatever, but there's a wonderful thing I can't figure out either. Like in, in the Christian idea, there's the end of time where the, the evil is separated from God forever. And I think about that as a metaphysical, well, you might think if it's a form of like imagined, it's a form of perfection, a form of striving for perfection. You fragment yourself, you challenge yourself, throw what's not worthy into the fire, a lasting, something like that. And so what it, what you end up with retained as much better than what you started with through the trials. Something like that.

Speaker 1:          27:11          Well, that sounds a bit like the dialectical process that we've been talking. And you have alluded to a couple of very good, um, Jewish, um, myths and there's one in the [inaudible] Kavala, um, about the creation, which I don't know if you know it, but it's, it's absolutely river thing to me. Um, the idea is that the primary being and is off the ground of all being, um, needs something other to come into being the creation and that creation. What does that ends off do? It was this his first act as it to stretch out your hand and make something not a bit. The first act is to withdraw, to create a place in which the canvas something other than dance off. And so the first stage is called Sim. Solomon as it sounds negative, as so many creative things do withdraw. And then in that space the uh, vessels and a spark comes out of ames off and falls into the vessels and they will shatter.

Speaker 1:          28:19          And that's called a chef a how can you write? Yes. And then there is the third stage repair in which, um, what has just been fragmented is restored into something greater. And so this process carries on and it's in my terms, very light. What happens with the hemisphere. The right hemisphere is the one that is first accepting. It is sort of actively receptive, if you can put it that way too. Whatever is new. You were talking about Algorithm Goldberg and so, um, and then whatever that is is then sort of processed by the left hemisphere at the next stage into categories. So it's bit of that and try to understand it, but of course, whatever it is, as much bigger than any of the categories. So they all break down and it gets restored and the right hemisphere into a new hole. Um, the, the, to comb the repair, right?

Speaker 1:          29:15          Tiq Mti candidate. And I need the, the, the kind of easy way of thinking about it is learning a piece of music. Your first of all attracted to it as a whole. You then realize that you need to practice that piece at Bar 28 and you realize that, you know, at, at, at bar 64, there's a return to the dominant or something. And, uh, then actually when you go on stage, you've got to, um, just forget all about that. But it's not that that work was lost, it's just that it's no longer present. Right, right.
