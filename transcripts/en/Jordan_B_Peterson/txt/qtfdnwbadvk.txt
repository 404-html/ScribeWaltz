Speaker 1:          00:20          There are two ways of meditating on death. Uh, one is the more bid way, uh, which is uh, a kind of avoidance of life and a sense that nothing is worthwhile because it's all gonna come to an end. And the other is the creative way of recognizing that that your mortality is a fundamental part of all that you hope for. You know, when we fall in love with another, when one falls in love with another person, one is consciously taking under ones care, a mortal being and it's the sense of her fragility in term mortality, which is fundamental to the so the love that one feels towards her in my view. Uh, and uh, if you try and exclude the thought of death, uh, then that love is weakened. The sense that you're, you have that she is absolutely dependent on that love. And of course we'll one day escape from it in through death. That is absolutely a part of what the love is and why we find in erotic lover kind of redemption. That's asked what I would say 10

Speaker 2:          01:36          I would say as well that it's an, it's an aid to concentration and focus. You don't have much time and there's plenty of problems and so you and, and it's going to be a hard road no matter what. And so get at it. You know, for years, when I was in my twenties the first thought I had when I woke up in the morning was life is short. I really literally, it happened to me for years and I thought, no, time to waste. Then there's, there's, there's things to be done, there's things that need doing, get the hell up, make yourself efficient, aim at something that makes the transients of life worthwhile because such things exist. And then, and then do everything you can to manifest everything you can within that mortal frame. And, and it, it adds to life of a seriousness that would otherwise be absent.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Oh, I'll tell you my plumber story because that makes it concrete. I've done a lot of home renovation. I've worked with lots of workmen and on very creative projects as a matter of fact. And so that was very entertaining because with carpenters for example, we built a quite strange and unique third floor on my house in Toronto and I invited the carpenters to contribute. I told them what the overall view was and what we were trying to produce, but if they had creative ideas, then I was welcoming them because I wanted them to, I didn't want to tell them what to do. I wanted to produce something beautiful with them fully on board so that it was likely to manifest itself in the best possible manner. And so that competence that that I described rather rather utilitarian manner is almost immediately transcended by something that's more potent and more valuable in the actuality of it.

Speaker 2:          03:55          If you're participating in a project like that and you invite people into a reciprocal relationship, then the relationship begins to transcend the particularities of, of the, of the project, and then the project goes wonderfully well. So, and that is a reflection of something that's deeper in it. It touches on something that Sir Roger mentioned statement by Christ, that if two or three people are gathered together in his name, that he's there and you can, you can infuse every relationship you have with precisely that spirit if you're cognizant of it and careful, I mean it's and fortunate and, and far more than that. It's a thing to strive for and you won't manifest itself perfectly, but that can be there and all the particularities. And so that way you have the, the singularity of the project itself, the practicality of that, there's a reason that Christ was also a carpenter, right?

Speaker 2:          04:46          That's the particular, cause a house that's not built on truth does not stand, you know, and so those particular relationships should partake of that divine, the divinity of ultimate reciprocity. And then both are, both are elevated and, and so, so it that the narrowness of, of, of say capitalists trade is insufficient, but it's embedded in something that when it's not a zero sum game, it's, it's embedded in something that's far deeper than that and far more gratifying. And if, and if you're careful about such things, then the projects that you involve yourself with that or even somewhat mundane can take on a much more, much, much more beautiful and productive, uh, nature. And then that's, well, it's not frustrating. It's, it's, it's compelling and it works. So

Speaker 1:          05:38          yeah, I would just add to that that, um, what Jordan has said really is that in a job rightly done, the divine is imminent in some way and George Herbert said, and who sweeps the rumors for they laws makes that and the action fine. Um, okay, we leave out these days that drug makes drudgery divine bit, but, um, you know, the habit was absolutely right about that. That two W if you ask the question, where does God enter the ordinary life, it is in that sense of doing something for its own sake, uh, and uh, and acquiring the habit of doing so and not wanting a rewards beyond the thing. Um, which is co connects with Aristotle's conception of what a virtue is as well. So, um, Eh weren't, shouldn't despair that there is a moral education available to us, even in a world where there isn't a formalized and, and shared religion that that will bring that aspect of things to bear on human life.

Speaker 1:          07:21          What I, what I would say is the term happiness means ultimately the full fee, your fulfillment as a person, uh, and uh, that that isn't the same as gratification of your desires. It is, it means the kind of transformation of your, um, your being such that you can look on what you are and say for all my faults, uh, I accept that thing. Uh, and, and when they're on an occasion comes to rejoice, you're accepted and enter it rather than say, asking yourself, do I deserve it? You know, those, uh, that's that avoidance of joy, which many people have is actually itself a kind of narcissism. They're happy person goes out and embraces the, the occasion for rejoicing and he does. So, um, because uh, his own nature is at ease with itself and you can incorporate this into it. Of course, there's a lot more to it there. That one has to have, as Aristotle says, happiness is an activity of the soul in accordance with virtue. What he meant was that, um, that if you don't have the virtues, you're trading always on a thin ground that you all fall through in that wonderful moment when it at last few years is going to say yes. You know, uh, you, you turn out your, your nature as a Predator

Speaker 2:          08:56          is revealed. Do you use the Jordan's image? A new full, uh, irrecoverably but anyway, that's brief discourse on happiness. Well, I mean for me, like I find a tremendous, first of all there's an alliance between happiness and gratitude. And you touched on that. If you're going to accept the tragic reality of life, let's say, then it's also reasonable to accept happiness when it comes your way. And to be grateful for it and to be grateful for it is to accept it and to enjoy it. Well, it makes its presence felt it's something that visits I would say. And you can invite that visitation. I would say. Um, um, I do that primarily by playing. Um, I was very playful with my kids and my wife and still am, I mean most of the time with my kids, it was nonstop jokes of one form or another.

Speaker 2:          09:51          My daughter can barely say anything that isn't a joke of some sort, you know? And I hang around with comedians all the time and I usually have my best discussions with them and my best friends when I grew up, especially when I was young, young man, where people who were inveterate ironist and joke tellers and mostly what we did was competitive humor. The whole goal of it social gathering was to see who could say the most outrageously funny thing. And that was unbelievably entertaining. And so if that comes along and you can participate in it and you can play so much, the better. And so it's even useful to touch things that are difficult with a playful and light hand, which is partly why I traveled with Dave Ruben in my lecture series because Dave's a professional stand up comedian as well as a serious person in his own right. But all of the very disturbing lectures that I put forward, because I think they are disturbing our Lavand with, with humor and that, that there's purpose. That's, that's purposeful. It's necessary and desirable. So, but it's, but that doesn't mean that I think that short term happiness is a goal. It's, which I certainly don't think that it is.
