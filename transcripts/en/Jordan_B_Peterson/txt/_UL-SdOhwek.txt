Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So how are we going to do this? Are People just going to ask? All right,

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       yes. Speed brings chaos.

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       So you would ask that. The question is, the question is speech brings order out of chaos. That's what I said, but it appears that speech brings chaos out of order as well. And the answer to that is it does, right? There was only so many complications I could address in the talk simultaneously. If you look at, if you look at the most archaic of Archetypal Heroes, the heroes confront something that represents chaos. It's usually a monster that bears a treasure of some sort, and that's a symbolic representation of the class of all unexplored things, right? Because things that we have not yet explored are threatening and destructive, but also offer us infinite potential, but more elaborated hero stories, let's say. Also reverse that and say that, well, there are times when the order has become so corrupted, rigid, that free speech fragments that into its parts so that it can rejuvenate itself.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       And so actually in the gospels, that's the hero. That Christ is basically represented as. He's not so much the dragon. Confronting the dragon slayer who gathers the treasure, although that's implicit in the in the juxtaposition of Christ with the figure of like a Serpentine Satan, but Christ is the thing that stands up against the corrupt state and rejuvenated through speech and so technically speaking, free speech. The logos is the thing that mediates between chaos and order and you can think about this is represented in, in, in, in many cultures. This idea, you can see it most specifically, I would say in the Dallas conceptualization because in the Dallas world being is made out of chaos and order, Yin and Yang, masculine and feminine. Fundamentally it's chaos in order in order is the fact that wherever you go, there are things you understand in order and chaos is the fact that wherever you go there are things you don't understand and so the idea is that being is made out of the things that you understand and the things that you don't understand and it's always that way, which is why dow is the symbol of being per se, and it's the case.

Speaker 1:          00:02:31       Your brain is adapted. In fact, it's partly why it has two hemispheres for the world that you understand and the world you don't understand the world you understand roughly speaking, being handled by the left and the world. You don't understand roughly speaking, being handled by the right. Well, it's that line down the middle, that's Dow, that's meaning, and if you have one foot in chaos and one foot in order, you're maximizing information, float and rejuvenating yourself at the same time that you're maintaining structure and you will report on that internally as engagement in the world. It's the most fundamental orienting sense that you have and it's deeply instantiated neurologically, unbelievably deeply, and so it really is the case from an evolutionary perspective that reality is chaos and order. It's that to which you're adapted and so sometimes you're speaking on behalf of chaos and sometimes you're speaking on behalf of order.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       It's more complicated than now too though, because when we have a dialog saying we're, we're mutually attempting to climb towards the truth. Instead of convincing each other that we're right, say, then what we're doing is engaging in the simultaneous fragmentation of old and archaic belief systems and they're updating and you can experience that because someone will say something that sets you back and then you'll get what they're saying and it'll click together and what you're experiencing is the death of a of a, of an old conceptualization structure, its disintegration, and then it's reconfiguration in a tighter and tighter order and people love that. They live for that. It's, it's, it's really, it's what keeps you alive and you can experience that in a deep conversation, a truthful conversation, a meeting of the minds and soul, and people love that. It's curative. All psychotherapists know this because what you do in psychotherapy as well, in addition to helping people face the things that they're most afraid of so that they can overcome them, is to allow them to tell someone the truth.

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       What happened to you all? Listen, so they tell you and they take themselves apart and put themselves together. Well, they're speaking the truth about what happened and it puts them together. It's at the. No, the two fundamental elements of psychotherapy are let's find what you're afraid of and avoiding and help you confront it so that you can gather the information that's there and let's allow you to lay your story out in all of its catastrophe in detail so that you can straighten yourself out through speech. It's exactly what happens in psychotherapy, so when it should happen in every real relationship, it's. It's the spiritual purpose of a marriage fundamentally, right? Because you face someone who's different than you that you are tied to and cannot run from, and so you can reveal your really, really, it's a critical. It's a critical part of marriage because if you can run from someone, they will never show you their true face because if someone shows you their true face, you will run, and so you say, in a marriage ceremony, I will allow you to show me your true face and I will not run, and unless you mean that you'll never be married.

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       You'll never understand what it means and you'll never reap the benefits of it. Which are practical obviously, but also spiritual and psychological. There's a reason for the vow, but it has to be a vow because otherwise you have a back door open and you'll never really tell the person what your light and no bloody wonder because really, who wants to know what you're like, not even you. That's for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:06:10       I'm not surprised. I want to thank you because what was surprising about your lecture today was this concept of altruism. I think you've been able to just put everything together and at the end come up with a higher value of altruism and to was a surprise. You don't come in here and I have a relationship with altruism and the one that I find that it's difficult for me is that this is an evolutionary process. So my brain is an organ is developed. You know, and and I'm amazed at how often I think of three people, me, myself, and I do the point where where I've actually written down, counted all of the iterations of me, myself and I and neither my thoughts or my speech or even in someone else's. Then you'll get the page. We think of. We, as far as I've been able to ascertain, it's because I have to expend energy to think about someone else and and and yet yet I'm addicted to decent comfort because my natural evolution is what? Peace and comfort. You hear it in alcoholics anonymous. Take the problem. You're addicted to ease and comfort. How do I overcome my, my sense of ease and comfort to be able to make altruism a more natural state of being.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       Good. Good. Good question. So the question is, the first was a comment about the emphasis in my talk today on altruism, and the second is how do I, how do people overcome their proclivity to only act on their own behalf? Okay, so the first thing I will say is that I don't believe that what I spoke about today was in favor of altruism. And, and that's not a negative comment on your question, but there. So there's a, there's, there's a pride. Here's a primary religious injunction. Treat the other person like you would like to be treated yourself. That does not mean be nice to other people. It does not mean sacrifice yourself excessively for other people. It means think about the other person as if they were you, and figuring out how you can mutually interacts to better both of you. At the same time, you have to build yourself into the equation.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       It's an equation. It's not that it's not that others are more valuable, it's that we're all valuable, were equally valuable, and then you think, well, how do you remind yourself of that? And the answer to that is through terror because terror is the genuine motivator, so they save. Fear of God is the beginning of all wisdom. What does that mean? On means? First that you don't get away with anything and it's really useful to know that because if you really know that you won't to get away with while you still will because people are stupid but, but at least it will mitigate the possibility. So here, I'll tell you something that young said. This is quite. This is quite profound and I think the right answer to this question. So young believed he was interested in the emergence of higher morality. Something that the developmental psychologist, Yom Piaget was also interested in.

Speaker 1:          00:09:19       Here's a thought. We started out as individuals, then we learned to play games with other people, kids, children, learn how to play games with other children, and that made them social. So our society is a game. It's a giant gate that we're all playing together voluntarily. And so children will first learned how to play the game and only later did they learn the rules of the game and he learned how to play the game first and then learn the rules, how to speak the rules, and then at some point they realized that they were also creators of the rules. And so that's moral development on a continual on, on a. it's not a continuum, it's fractured staircase upward, but young was interested in elements of moral action that were higher than that. And so he conceptualized it symbolically. So imagine this, you did this in the last book he wrote called mysterium conjunction us.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       So imagine that you exist so that your conceptual structures and your emotions are in an uneasy relationship with one another. So you're sort of a house divided amongst yourself. And so what you have to do is you have to put together your mind and your and your emotions so that they're working as a, as a unit, and you do that in part by actually being forthright about what it is that you want for yourself and to other people and to learn how to negotiate that so that inner tension disappears. And so now you're a unified. You're a unified entity of emotion and thought they're not conflicting with one another. And then what you do is you take that entity which is still in some sense, separate from your body because you're not acting these out and you bring those two together and he thought about that as the psychological equivalent of the incarnation had integrated spirit integrating with the body.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       And what that means is that you take your emotions and motivations and capacity for thinking that are now one thing and you act out those things you. So you embodied them in the world. And that's another thing that brings integrity. And then there was a step past that in the step past that is to understand that there's no d. So you have the integrated spirit, mind and body in opposition to the world and this, the next thing you do is realize that there is no opposition with the world. Is that what you are is a. This is very, very complicated.

Speaker 1:          00:11:33       You're walking down the street, but the street is a good example of this in Toronto and they're guesstimated alcoholic, schizophrenia, littering the landscape so to speak. You walk around them, you say, well, that's not me. It's like, yes it is. It's you in so far as your tendency is to react in a negative way and to start the territory. It's a disturbance in your field of being. It's you. Now you don't know what to do about it and I wouldn't recommend that you do anything because you'd probably just make it worse. It's a very big problem that's lying there on the sidewalk and it may be well beyond your capacity to fix it, but in so far as it's a disturbance in your field of being, it's you, it's you and all the problems that are in the world that you experience there, you and so you stop thinking about things in terms of an opposition between what's good for you and what's good for the world because there is no difference.

Speaker 1:          00:12:28       There's no difference between the two and that that doesn't mean that the pathway from what's good for you in your more limited domain to what's good for everyone is an easy one to compute. It's very, very difficult. But there is no, there is no technical difference between them, you know, so if I'm engaged in a psychotherapeutic dialogue with my clients when I'm doing it properly, it's not like they're learning from me. It's that we're learning together and every time I solved one of their problems or help them solve one of their problems are you help myself. So of one of my problems, you know, because people bring to me, bring into my sessions the terrible things that go wrong with people in life. Their partner has cancer, their father's father has Alzheimer's, they're suffering with alcoholism. Their career is collapsing like these aren't things that are happening to them.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       These are things that happen to everyone and to figure out how to solve that for someone is to figure out how to solve it for yourself. There's no difference whatsoever and so and then so there's to know that to, to think of that and certainly works in in a, in a, in an intimate relationship. If you think that you're somehow different than your wife, while certainly she's going to remind you otherwise constantly, but it's an. It's an error. It's an error because you're. You're tied together so tightly that whatever happens to one inevitably happens to the other and that's true in in the work reality that we all inhabit. So then the terror thing emerges. When you start to realize that those problems that you don't address that or maybe magnified by your impulsive and foolishly self centered and instrumental behavior, you're manipulating the world on behalf of your own narrow interests, those will come back to haunt you and so it's a terrifying thing to think through, but once you think through and understand it, then what happens is you're more afraid of acting selfishly, then you are willing to do it. You think, no, I'm not doing that. Why? Because I know all hell will break loose if I do that and I'm not going there. And so the terror element is a huge one. It makes it, it, it, it fortifies your because you can't just act properly. You don't have the moral fortitude for that. You can aim it the good and run from what's terrible. Then you're, then you're motivated.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       So if I've understood you, I just want to recap, if you're suggesting a subsidiary with your environment, not the, not the few, uh, reaching out to your environment. That's an expenditure of energy, but rather as an investment.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       Yes, it's an investment. That's a very good way of putting it. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:15:12       I was wondering if you could, if it's plausible, it's race on our market. Typical or narrative origin for some of the intellectual denied the structures of language as corresponds to reality. Denied the psyche of the individual. I think you've done some of your top two that you think is possible from a psychological perspective to trace the narrative, origin, postmodernism and human behavior, or is it so unnatural?

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       No, no, no, no. It's an architect, architect. I mean there's always. There's always a forest, so to speak, that opposes. The logo's always had that. That's the hostile brothers. It's a classic archetypal story. There's always cain and Abel. There's always hostility between the two primary modes of operating in the world, so and this is the. This is the modern manifestation of that and it's partly. It's partly a good thing. Maybe in some sense because it's useful to be deeply challenged. It's good to have an enemy because the enemy makes you think. The enemy tells you things that no one else will tell you. It's a DNA and it's an advert. Adversity. It's an ad. It's the adversary that, that, that, that stops you from being merely inert, and so postmodernism plays that role. It's, it's extraordinarily critical, but, but things can go too far and and, and the motives and things can go too far when they go too far, they reverse. That's what happens and hopefully they're reversing now hopefully

Speaker 2:          00:16:55       as being mainly associated, we seem to be seeing something that had a different form today that might be, is more associated with the family. Can you speak to that and also what is the nature of this power over men that it seems to be able to silence us.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       Okay, so the question is, the totalitarian forms that we've seen primarily in the past have been male and, but maybe we're seeing something different now. I really don't think it's different. I think it's, it's of the other common kind that's expanded in its dominion, so you imagine that there's an essential feminine pathology just as there is an essential masculine pathology and the essential feminine pathology. Freud mapped out it's the eternal mother and the mother is the mother that gets too close to her children. Right. And intermingles herself with them too, too great. A degree that in her attempts to protect them undermines them fatally. And so there's a classic representation of the feminine in the West and the classic representation is married and here, here's one of the representations. It's lovely and it's derived at least in part from the story of Mary and the snake in the garden of Eden.

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       And so Mary has her foot on a serpent and she's holding Christ off to the side like this. Well, that's exactly what mothers have always done. It's a biological portrait of human women is they hold their infants out of the reach of the terrible Serpentine Predator. Obviously that's what we do. Well that's fine, but adults aren't infants and neither are children. And if you treat them like they are, you undermine them, you, you, you, you pathologize them, you turn them into old infants. That's an ugly thing. And that's the Friday a nightmare you know, in, in this happens in therapy very frequently. I mean, you can be tangled into a terrible relationship with your father. That's often either because he was absent or abusive or tyrannical. Something like that, but that the standard pathology with mom is she did everything for you. Well, what's left for you to do nothing including never leaving.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       Right, and that's the motivation for the woman who's nothing but protective mother. There's no role outside of nurturing, of nurturing, nurturing, of nurture, and of infants, of nurturer, of infants. Well, you just keep them. Infants, they'll never leave. It might kill you in your sleep, but they'll never leave. Sure, sure. I mean it's so comical watching the feminist postmodernist in particular rattle on about the absence of gender reality and act out the archetipal devouring mother at exactly the same time for them, for them. The world is divided into predators and infants and the predators are evil and need to be stopped and the infants need to be cared for. Well, that's what the mother does, but adults are not infants and all you do is destroy them when you treat them that way, especially when they're adolescents and just starting to develop. Now there's. There's a rule that I attempted to abide by when I had small children and the rule was don't do anything for your children that they can do themselves and it's annoying that rule because it takes you like 15 seconds to to dress a two year old, but you let the two year old dress himself.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       It's like 15 minutes or 20 minutes or half an hour. You chase them around the house, but if you let them learn to dress themselves, then you don't have to dress themselves. Any direct dress them anymore and they can do it and you do that with setting the table and you do that with everything. It's like, no, it's okay. You do that now while I care for you so much. Let me do that for you. It's like I don't care for you at all when I say that I don't care for you at all. I'm going to stop doing everything I possibly can for you as rapidly as I possibly can say, well, that's great. That's how you work in an old age home. Do not do anything for the inhabitants that they can do themselves because you robbed them of the last vestiges of their independence, right?

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       It's what you do when you're a manager, if you're a good manager, you make yourself superfluous by extending autonomy and independence to the people that you manage so that they can take over the whole job. You don't do that by doing everything for people and you certainly don't do that by dividing the world archetypically and uncritically into predators. Those who have more and victims, infants, those who have nothing and acting like all you can ever do is protect them. Protect. First of all, you can't protect people. You can only make them strong. That's it. You cannot protect them. You can make them strong and then they can predict themselves, but then they don't need you. Right, and there's the underground pathological elements of the devouring mother. It's like, never leave me. Here's the deal. I'll do everything for you. You just never leave, right? That's sleeping with your mother, right?

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       That's the Friday a nightmare, right? You don't invite your child into your bed, right? You distinguished between them and you, you distinguish between them and your husband and you facilitate their independence. A part of the reason why it's useful to have a mother and a father is because the mother has to fall insanely in love with the infant or she'd throw it out the window, right? Because they're. They're insanely demanding and they're always right, right? Because the right way to treat an infant, especially before nine months is I'll do everything for you and you're always right in your needs. Take priority over everyone's at one else's and anybody that threatens you is terrible. Exactly right, but after once the kid is ambulatory and starting to be independent, that's the wrong attitude. The attitude then is no, get the hell on with it, and men who are less prone to negative emotion and less compassionate are much better at fostering that kind of independence and so it's usually then when they step into the family and start playing with the kids rough and tumble play and pushing them forward and saying, you know, get on with it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       You can do it. You can do it at home. It's very hard for a mother to play both those rules because she has to fall, so in love with her infant that it's difficult for her to be young, universal caregiver and disciplinarian at the same time, you know, because the roles are the roles run contrary to one another. So now women have entered the political sphere right on moss and so they're gonna bring their essential nature with them all the while saying there's no such thing as essential nature. It's like, yeah, there is.

Speaker 2:          00:23:53       Can we grow by the state of Western civilization using the new chain idea that God is dead?

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       Well, it's the wrong question in some sense because I think it's too diffuse to me. They issue Morris, do you have problems in your life that you're not addressing that you could solve? And the answer is yes, and it's an easy thing to figure out. You sit on your bed one morning and say, okay, there's some things that need to be done that I don't want to do that I could do that would make things better by the end of the day. What are they? Well, your, your conscience will deliver those soccer's no time flat now and then you might have to say, okay, well how do I entice myself into doing a few of those and if you ask, instead of trying to force yourself to do it like you're a tyrant and a slave at the same time, you can usually negotiate with yourself so that you'll start to sort those things out, sort them out, put your house in order and then move out. Move on and out.

Speaker 1:          00:24:56       Yes, that's a 40 and slipped by the way. So it's important because the thing is you have a practice domain right there. There are things that are within your grasp that you couldn't fix. Fix them and you'll learn. You'll learn because it's harder than it looks, fixed them and you'll learn how to fix things and then something else will beckon as another problem that you could fix. You know you all have your problems. What does that mean? Like there's an infinite number of problems in the world. Some of them happened to be yours. Why is that? I don't know exactly, but you have your problems. Great. Solve them. You know, one of the things I learned as a therapist, every therapist has to learn this is because one of the things you wonder when you're first starting to be a clinician is how do you not take the catastrophes of your client's home with you?

Speaker 1:          00:25:46       And the answer to that is because it's immoral to. They're not your problems, they're their problems like their, their, their life. You all, your problems are your life. You don't want to solve someone else's problems for them because you take away the deep meaning. That's to be found in having them work through the problems on their own. And then you steal the credit. Well, I can help you with that. It's like, well, yeah, maybe, but I don't help you with the next problem. Then. So in any case, you sort sort out the problems that are right in front of you and you will, it will make you grow very, very rapidly and then you'll be able to sort out more complex problems without making them worse. So.

Speaker 2:          00:26:30       So you mentioned that through discussion and dialogue, we can order the chaos of the world together. But do you not think that there needs to be a higher creator, an essence of grace, but it would be possible like how can we each being flawed, even working together

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       create meaning or something good?

Speaker 4:          00:26:56       We don't understand what we are. We don't understand our own consciousness. It has a quality of some sort and it meant it manifests itself within us. It's an orientation towards the good. That might be one way of thinking about it, freedom to do evil, but an orientation towards the good and so you participate in whatever that transcendent element of you is while you try to speak the truth and sort out the world. It serves as a guide. So I know that you're making a, a, a query about some transcendent reality. Maybe the transcendent reality of God, but that's the best answer you're going to get out of me. Yes. Okay. Two questions. What's my opinion on the alt right and what's my opinion on cultural appropriation? The idea of cultural appropriation is absolute nonsense.

Speaker 5:          00:27:55       That's that. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:28:01       No, there's no difference between cultural appropriation and learning from one another. They're the same thing. Now, that doesn't mean I can't, that doesn't mean that there's no theft between people. There is no, and it doesn't mean that just because you encounter someone else's ideas, you have an immediate right to those ideas as if they were your own. But the idea that manifesting in your own behavior, some element of another culture, the idea that that's somehow immoral is insane. It's actually one of the bases of peace. You know, one of the things that the various groups of human beings that exist have to offer each other is the tremendous value of their culture. You know, it's been really interesting to me, for example, to watch the response of, of all of everyone, but for this argument to you, for young Caucasian males to hip hop, you know, there's an aggressiveness about hip hop that's really attractive to young Caucasian males and there's something absurd about, about the, the, the spectacle of the young Caucasian males taking on the persona of inner city black gang members. You know, but, but I'm sympathetic to it because there's an aggressiveness to that, to that art form that's a necessary corrective to the insistence that the highest moral virtue for a modern man is harmlessness, which is observed. Women don't even like harmless man. They hate them. They liked that.

Speaker 5:          00:29:31       No. What women

Speaker 4:          00:29:33       want are dangerous men who are civilized and they want to help civilize them. That's beauty and the beast.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       So, you know, I'll tell you a funny story and only engineers could have come up with this because they are the only ones that have the unparalleled blindness to social convention that would allow them to discover it. So the Google engineers, I like engineers by the way because they're very straightforward. The Google engineers wrote a book awhile back called a billion wicked thoughts, which was a study of Internet searches, billions of them literally, and they were looking a lot of pornography use. And while there's lots of known about male pornography use, partly and it's easy to understand. I mean males are pretty visually oriented in what attracts them to pornography is fairly straightforward. You can tell that if you look at graffiti and a men's washroom, you know it's like two circles and the triangle and the men are absolutely transfixed.

Speaker 5:          00:30:29       Bye

Speaker 4:          00:30:44       For women in the story is more complex. They use pornography too, but it tends to be literary because women tend to like words more than they like visual stimuli. And so the Google guys tried to track down the architectural structure of how they didn't use those words of female pornography use. And so some of you know how many of you know what a Harlequin romance is. Okay, good. So those are archetypal stories, right? That's the taming of the wild man. Essentially by the, by the desirable in virgin a woman. And if you think women don't want that, then you better bloody well come up with an explanation for 50 shades of grey. Right? Which is the most, the most rapid selling novel in human history and, and merged at exactly the same time that all of this noise about the lack of the absence of gender roles is being produced on Mohs.

Speaker 4:          00:31:29       It's like perfect female fantasy. It's exactly archetypally correct. It's beauty and the beast, so what the dual guys showed was the structure of beauty and the beast, although they didn't use that as a reference that the female pornographic fantasy was wild guy, you know, somewhat careless about the wants and desires of others attractive to everyone. Therefore, high status, tamed by the magic of a single woman and brought into a relationship with her. Okay, so, but here's the comical part. This just made me laugh, man. It was like, what were the five categories of most desirable male entity used most broadly and female pornography. Oh, it's so embarrassing. Women, you have to cover your head while I say this because Vampire Werewolf, billionaire, surgeon and pirate. All right. Another question. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:32:41       A,

Speaker 4:          00:32:44       I hear a lot

Speaker 2:          00:32:46       what you're saying. I want to drag you back to Yelp, right?

Speaker 4:          00:32:51       Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:32:52       What the we have right now and now the core is to believe in ethnic nationalism, but not the sort of oppositional nationalism that we all know. It's more of a rag salt or, or do gyn universal nationalism. Do you think this core belief of the alt right is. What is it logical? Is it revenue?

Speaker 4:          00:33:19       Complete, complete identification with the father and that's necessary, but the purpose of identification with the father is to become the son, right, and I mean that in all of its symbolic manifestation and the problem with nationalism is that it forgets that it forgets that the purpose of the nation is to give rise to the individual. And so, and what's happened now because our identities have become fragmented, is that there's a call to re constitute the father and that's. And that's at the core of the alt right, thinking. Well that's the benevolent part of the alt right. I mean there's a downside. There's a negative side to everything. I mean, one of the things that's quite disturbing about the alt right is it's pro click, continual proclivity to degenerate into anti Semitism. And I see that in the comments, for example, on my videos continually. So it's oversimplified and there's a, there's a terror, there's also no true recognition or not sufficient recognition that the state is also a pathological monster and the all right should understand that because of course that's what the left continually claims, right?

Speaker 4:          00:34:26       The state is a pathological monster. Oh, they're trying to produce. Sorry, this, the left is trying to produce. I got that wrong. It's the basis of the alt right's criticism of the left. The old right says the left is trying always trying to expand the dominion of the state and the state is a pathological monster. Yet what we should do is become nationalists. So like, sorry guys, there's a bit of a paradox there. And uh, well, so, so that's basically what I would say about that. It's not surprising and, and as long as the radical left keeps pushing the way they keep pushing, then all right is going to continue to grow. Although it's very also very difficult to tell at now to what degree to how large the movement is or how serious it is or any of those things at the moment. So,

Speaker 6:          00:35:10       so just to bring you back to cultural appropriation, is it possible that that plus about half a dozen other similar things that appeared in the last 10 years rather than be kind of like an empty or or ridiculous baseless philosophy are in fact tactical tactical constructs by postmodernist and in March there's think tanks we evidence for that would be in the fact that they are always selectively

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       enforced in a way which is the most destructive possible to our occurrences. So, so that's, uh, that, that kind of opens the broader question of, of conspiratorial action among political groups, let's say. So here's a way of thinking about it. And I think this works. So in any coherent philosophy, there's an impetus to action. That's partly what makes the philosophy coherent. And postmodernism is a coherent philosophy. It has an impetus to action. Now it's very difficult to describe the entire structure of postmodernism because it's fuzzy at the edges. It bleeds into other things. But imagine that there's a, there's a core of, there's a core of central concerns. Now imagine that most people who are normally postmodernists only understand fragments of that core concern, and so if you take the typical indoctrinated social justice warrior, Third Year Women's studies student, you might say, well, she's only 15 percent postmodernist and 85 percent still human, so but if you get, if you get 10 people like that together, 20 people like that together, each, there's enough of the postmodernist doctrine that fills the room because it's fragmented into different people that you have a coherent spirit that animates the group and it will act as if it has the intelligence of the philosophy and it will manifest itself as if it's conspiratorial.

Speaker 4:          00:37:08       Now there are elements that are also conspiratorial because people do things consciously as well, but you should always assume, assume stupidity before you assume organized malevolence. Right? Right. It keeps you. It keeps your thinking player because it's like. It's not like there's no such thing as organized malevolence, but it's rare and it requires a lot of skill. Whereas sort of distributed stupidity that can act conspiratorially without having to have a central agent. And so look there first and then and only with great evidence, make the next set of presuppositions. So

Speaker 2:          00:37:58       I first found out about you on which uses it for that reason, people feel like they can say anything, something, maybe something is lost because on facebook when your reputation is tied to all the opinions that you feel like you might want to test out, but on, on a place where it's anonymous, it's not, it's dark and you have an international appeal. You have this, uh, if I started at Jordan Peterson spread within five minutes, I've got people from 10 different countries or countries that aren't, don't have English as their main language are joining in and talking about, you know, the man who yells out the emperor has no clothes. I know we talked about how archetypes seems to manifest. What are you at

Speaker 4:          00:38:59       that is actually not me, it's my wife because she knows what I am and you know, it's not, it's not all that great, but all things considered

Speaker 2:          00:39:12       architectural point of view, what has manifested? What are you in embodying? That seems to. I mean, we don't need to see your real ugly face,

Speaker 4:          00:39:26       Jesus, right? I told you the story at the beginning of the lecture. I've been trying to solve a problem and I really done everything I can to try to solve that problem and I've been talking about what I learned and who I learned it from for 30 years, you know, and that's had a positive impact as far as I can tell them, the people to whom I've taught it and so I, I'm someone who's tried to solve the hardest problem that he could find. That's, that's all.

Speaker 5:          00:40:05       Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       Do you think individuals today should have a, a viewed relationship with religion and God to kind of rebuild the moral authority that's been lost?

Speaker 4:          00:40:24       Absolutely. Yeah. I think the question was, do I think that modern people should have a renewed relationship with religion and God? It's like, yes, absolutely. But it has to be predicated on, on higher consciousness, so to speak, and I mean that. I mean that very technically. So this is what happened. This is how our religious systems developed. I'll give you the very brief version. So if you look at the structure of a chimpanzee troop or a wolf pack, there's an ethic and there has to be because otherwise the wolves would tear each other apart and so with the chimpanzees. So the chimpanzees in their, in their dominance hierarchy structure is learn how to act out a society just like the wool stoop. So here's a rule for a wolf. Wolfej wants to be top dog and wolf be wants to be top dog. And so they, they snarl at each other and they puff out their funnel and they look big and ferocious and they turned sideways to scare each other.

Speaker 4:          00:41:16       And then one of them chickens out, rolls over and shows his neck. And basically that is the acting out of, well, I'm a useless applicant and you know, your majesty can do what he will with me. And then the proper wolf king says, yeah, well I might need your useless carcass to hold down a moose tomorrow so I couldn't tear out your throat, but I won't. And then they both get up and go along in the pack. And so the reason I'm telling you that is because there's an ethic there. Here's another ethic among animals. So if you, if you take juvenile male rats, they need to play, they need to engage in rough and tumble play or they develop attention deficit disorder by the way, which is quite interesting and something to think about for your little rats in school that are developing attention deficit disorder.

Speaker 4:          00:42:01       So if you, if you, if you take a juvenile rat and he knows he's going to be able to go into a space where he can play, he'll work to open a door to enter that space. So that's how you know he's motivated because you can't ask them because you can't speak rat and neither can he eat. So you let go in the play space and you'll add another rat go in there of about the same age. And imagine one rats 10 percent bigger than the other. So what happens first is the rats wrestle. It's not aggressive. They wrestled just like worldwide wrestling federation guys wrestle, you know, and, and for many of the same reasons, and the rats will pin each other and if you pin the other rat you went. So if you're 10 percent bigger than the little rat, then you can always pin them.

Speaker 4:          00:42:40       You can always win. Okay. So then what happens is the big rap becomes dominant and the little rat becomes subordinate. They have a wrestling match and then they part the next time they meet because it's an iterated game, the next time they meet the little ride has to ask the big role to play. And he does that the same way that you ask a child to play, you know, you do your play stance just like a dog does. You can understand when a dog does that. And so the little rat, you know, gets playful with the big rat and then they play. But if you pair them repeatedly, the big grand house to let the little rat win at least 30 percent of the time or the little rat won't invite them to play anymore. It's right. That's cool. That's so cool. Man. Jack Yak, Yak Panksepp discovered that he also discovered that if you tickled rats, they giggle, but they do it ultrasonically, so you have to. You have to like that. So he discovered the play circuit. It's a major, major neuroscience discovery, and so there's an emergent ethic. Can play a fair play ethic. And now hale, I can't remember what your question was.

Speaker 4:          00:43:46       Oh yes. Okay. So, so, so what happens is, is that that there is an ethic that emerges out of social interaction, but then because human beings are conscious, we watched that ethic emerge and then we start telling stories about it. We tell stories about the honorable person and the honorable person who doesn't just win today's game, but when's it in a way that makes everyone invite them to play games infinitely into the future. Right? So that makes you the Metta player. That's what you're trying to be your all. And that's the hero who goes into the unknown, right? It's the person who acts in proper interactions with other people. It's, it's truly an emergent. It's an emergent ethic. It's real. It's more real than anything else. We map that and that's somehow associated with our consciousness, well, we need to understand these sorts of things in order to put a biological structure underneath our religious thinking again and to tie it into our scientific knowledge and to become awake and aware of these sorts of things so that we can reestablish the foundation underneath our culture and it's a terrifying thing to do because it does place a burden on people.

Speaker 4:          00:44:47       Right, but you want to burden you and it's so interesting. It's really one of the things that's so cool about what's been happening. I don't understand this. I commented on this at the University of Toronto debate. The first thing I did which was unexpected to me and everyone else. They didn't know what the Hell I was doing. As I said, I looked around, I said, hey, you know, 80 percent of the people in this room are men. It's like, why is that something's going on here and it's an indication that men and women have different interests. Ninety one percent of my viewers of man, what the hell? Why is that? Look at this room. It's almost all men and men don't come to these sorts of things generally speaking, right? Maybe because they're stubborn and ornery, but, but so there's also something specifically in this for men and, and by, by, by implication for women because what do you want? Useless man. No, you don't want useless man, that's for sure. Although if you have a useless man, you get to dominate him. And so maybe that's not such a big price to pay for having someone around that you can treat like an infant. So that's the downside of the, of the war between men and women, but a woman with any sense once a man who's dangerous but team. So maybe that's part of. Well we'll leave it

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       that characterize your classroom occupying this space of the cognitive, a general he will say, I just want to know if you can substantiate the fact that there is a extraordinary diverse range of disciplines which required different kinds of skills, uh, in the university. Also with the kind of confounding variable that the university has made may not be considered by some people to be the most exclusively. The exclusion was once was as a as a representation of the enlightened.

Speaker 4:          00:46:44       Okay. Well I can talk. Let me talk about the situation at the Ivy League universities. First, the question broadly speaking covers the other question about intelligence and about its diverse manifestations and about its role in selection for universities to go back and look at the records at Harvard for example, in the early 19 sixties, the typical icu at for a Harvard student was about 100, five to 110, not much above average, but that's because they were finishing schools for the, for the rich, roughly speaking, and you know your. If you had a rich father and he made his money, he was probably well above average in intelligence, but if you are his offspring, there's regression towards the mean. So there's no reason to assume that by nature of your position you are going to be particularly intelligent anyways. The average Ivy League student wasn't, was bright but not outstanding.

Speaker 4:          00:47:35       So now it's like 100 Iq, 145, three standard deviations above the mean because. And the reason for that is because they're selected by the sat scholastic aptitude test. It's an Iq test. They won't say it's an Iq test, but that doesn't matter. It isn't tech, it's an Iq test. It's a simple as that. Any any task that contains a sufficiently diverse range of problem solving questions that's rank ordered in, in, in accuracy among people is an Iq test. The correlations like point eight, five. So and what has happened, there's two things that have happened. I mean the Ivy Leagues have got more and more selective because they can and so the average Iq of their students is just continued to move upwards and then the average Iq of the population is actually increased to a substantive degree to over the last 50 years. Partly because partly perhaps mostly because of improved nutrition and and information exposure along among the.

Speaker 4:          00:48:35       Like the more deprived members of the culture. It's better to watch tv than to sit alone in your crib for example, and isolated and people have enough food now. So the really low end of the intelligence spectrum is being truncated. And the general population Iq is increased. So with regards to institutions like the University of Toronto, say they average Iq at the University of Toronto was somewhere between 120 130 and we know that because we've tested it and it's not surprising because you're basically selected for cognitive prowess, right? Because grades are rough marker of intelligence. Conscientiousness, by the way also matters independent trade because the best two predictors of university grades are conscientiousness and intelligence, not creativity by the way. Zero correlation with creativity. So yes.

Speaker 7:          00:49:23       Comments on this free. How is committing suicide? Why is that happening? Guilt, yes. What you want?

Speaker 4:          00:49:40       Yeah. There's lots for people to be guilty about. You know, I mean you might say, to what degree should you bear the horrendous guilt of your ancestors? And that's a. that's a really hard question. I mean, the radical left answer would be to the degree that you're privileged by your ancestry, you should bear their guilt. Well, Robo, yes. The question is then what you do? Well, what you should do is, what I suggested today, I would say is take responsibility for your lives and understand that what you have came at a terrible cost and that you have an ethical obligation to use it properly and that would be sufficient to pay for the sins of your ancestors, so to speak. I think it's absolutely reprehensible that the radical left dares to attribute to to ethnically identified groups, collective guilt. There's absolutely no excuse for that.

Speaker 4:          00:50:33       It's completely murderous and that should be rejected out of hand. So, but that's independent of the issue about what you should do given that part of your wealth is a consequence of historical catastrophe. So you should try to sort that out roughly speaking and for everyone's benefit, but not necessarily because you're any more guilty personally. You're guilty as hell personally, but so is everyone else. That's the critical thing. So is everyone else okay? I would. I would like to answer that question, but I can't. And the reason, there's two reasons for that. One is that it's, there's, there's a large element of the answer that has to be legal and I can't do that, and the other part of it is because I've actually too tired to formulate a coherent response to that and I don't want it formulated incoherent response. So I'm sorry that I can't be. I mean obviously I believe that people's right to communicate should be as untrammeled as possible, but to bridge the gap between that and your specific concern requires a feat of mental energy that I can't do at the moment and maybe maybe ever that at the back.

Speaker 3:          00:51:56       The social construct of a safe space that our view on this whole white privilege thing. Is that university, all these other universities?

Speaker 4:          00:52:15       No, I think the idea of white privilege is absolutely reprehensible and it's not because white people aren't. You know, we have all sorts of privileges and most people have privileges of all sorts and you should be grateful for your privileges and work to deserve them, I would say. But the idea that you can target an ethnic group with a collective crime, regardless of the specific innocence or guilt of the constituent elements of that group, there is absolutely nothing that's more racist than that. It's absolutely a boring. I can't

Speaker 5:          00:52:48       thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:52:54       If you, if you really want to know more about that sort of thing, you should read about the Kulaks in the, in the Soviet Union in the 19 twenties, k, u l a, k, s because they were. They were farmers who were very productive. They were the most productive element of the agricultural strata in, in Russia. And they were virtually all killed or raped and robbed by the collectivists who insisted that because they showed signs of wealth, they were criminals. And, and, and, and, and, and Roberts. So. And one of the consequences of the prosecution of the Kulaks was the death of 6 million Ukrainians from a famine in the 19 thirties. The idea of collectively held guilt at the level of the individual as a legal or philosophical principle is dangerous. It's precisely this sort of danger that people who are really looking for trouble would push.

Speaker 4:          00:53:49       So, and, and just a cursory glance at 20th century history should teach anyone who wants to know exactly how, how unacceptable that is with regards to your first, okay, there's the safe space issue, but you also said something right at the beginning, you, you, you announced your sexual preference at the beginning and I understand exactly why you did that, but I have a comment about that and this is something for people in the audience to think about. I've received at least 25 letters from transsexual people and that's quite a few because there aren't that many transsexual people, right? So, so they're rare. They're very rare and every single one of them. But one was supportive and the one that wasn't supportive was mildly critical and they said exactly the same thing that you said. Rough. Roughly speaking is that. And so what we. One of the things we want to remember is that just because some some noisy activists stand up and say, because I'm a member of this group, or even worse because I say I'm a member of this group, I am therefore an advocate for that group's interests is we should just dispense with that, um, with that self identification as a worthy representative instantaneously because it's predicated on the idea that one dimension of a person's identity is sufficiently what would you say, broad and all encompassing so that you can infer their political stance, for example, which you can't.

Speaker 4:          00:55:14       And so the, the Trans people that have written me, they all say the same thing. A, those people do not speak for me. B, we're not all the same. See, most of us think that the enforced pronoun issue is doing nothing but drawing negative attention to us. D, most of us just want to be referred to by the other Pronoun. That's the whole point.

Speaker 5:          00:55:38       So thank you. So

Speaker 4:          00:55:44       this has been very, very reassuring to me because one of the things I presume right from the onset was that there was no evidence whatsoever that this nonsensical, logical legislation and the postmodern idiocy behind it is in fact demanded by this community or that it will in any way be in anyone's best interest. No, I don't buy it. I think it's rotten, right to the core. So then the safe, safe space issue. It's like if you need a safe space, see a therapist. Really, really university university is not a safe space. If University has done right, it is a radically space. If you want to go somewhere and get yourself taken apart intellectually and then hopefully put back together, then you go to university. Everything you believe should be challenged in every possible way, but not in a destructive sense. Right? Like when you're renovating a house, you don't just burn it to the ground and walk away, but that's what the postmodernists due to adolescence, by the way, you dismantle it in consultation with its occupant, attempting to build something even more beautiful and functional on the.

Speaker 4:          00:56:54       On the foundation. It's not a safe space, you know, in my classes, and I tell my students this right at the beginning, I'm trying to get them to understand why they are Nazis, right? There isn't anything more unsafe than that. And all of them, virtually all of them, right back to me afterwards and say that this was the most worthwhile class I've ever had in my life and it changed my life. It's like, well, I'm teaching you the worst possible thing about yourself and your response is, oh, that was so useful and I'm way better than I was. You know, it's, it's. But it's in keeping with the idea that you need to be exposed to things that you fear and hate because that's where salvation lies, roughly speaking. So yes,

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       uh, you mentioned how humanity and also how the good we need to attain is essentially achieved through inactive faith. We're just speaking the truth the best we can. And what I've been thinking about is how can we have competence in existence and the good of the logos? Is there anything to ground our competencies?

Speaker 4:          00:57:57       That's a great question. So what is there anything to ground our confidence in the logos? Yeah, sure. Two things. One, the testimony of the ages to practical experience. Try It, try it. You know, and what you, you start by while doing what I suggested earlier, which is fixing the things around you that you can fix because that's like the embodied manifestation of the logos. That's by the way why Christ was a carpenter, are continually speaking, right? Because he fixed things. So and you know, if you're a bad carpenter, the things you fix fall apart. So there's truth in being a carpenter, but then the next thing is you probably can't speak the truth because no one can, but you cannot say things you know to be lies and that's a really good place to start. And all you know, you can learn to pay attention to that very rapidly.

Speaker 4:          00:58:45       You kind of know already, but you, it's a consultation with your embodied being. When you say something, you know to be false, you won't be able to stand up straight. You'll get week, you'll feel a physical d division take place inside you. It's a shame because what you're not, you're failing to bear the burden of your existence and you're revealing that to yourself by your use of deceit. Stop saying things you know to be false and then watch what happens and this is the existential element of it. It can't be proved as far as I can tell, the same way that you would prove a scientific hypothesis. It can only be proved in the confines of your life and you actually have to sacrifice your life to the logos in order to find out because the only way you'll test it is by acting it out and see what happens.

Speaker 4:          00:59:31       You don't get to do it twice. So. But I think the consequences will reveal themselves relatively quickly. My experience has been that because I'm always working with my clients, I say clinical clients 20 hours a week roughly speaking, and we're always working on stating things more clearly, trying to make things better, you know, and, and it almost inevitably at least makes the horrible things bearable, which is a lot better, you know? And, and sometimes makes mediocre things way better as people's lives expand. And they get more confident and, and, and straightened things out around them. So, so it's the testimony of the ages and your willingness to test and existentially in, in the confines of your own life. You'll find that there isn't anything more interesting than you can do because what it takes, the predicted it takes the stultifying predictability out of your life. You never know what will happen if you say something that's true, it's a miracle. Miracles will happen. And that's a very interesting. It's crazily interesting. And so that's good. Crazily interesting. You've got that to set to say that you got that to set against tragedy and so well, so you can try it.
