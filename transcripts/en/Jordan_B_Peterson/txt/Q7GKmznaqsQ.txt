Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       this is the most practical of all the things that we've discussed so far. Um, it's really, you could consider it a component of industrial organizational psychology, but it's a component that has a strong emphasis on individual differences and so you could consider it first an exploration of the practical utility of psychological concepts in predicting real world phenomena, but you could also consider it a part of the validation of the psychometric models of personality that we've described because one of the things that you want to do to determine whether or not a construct. So what's a hypothetic hypothetical social psychological phenomena or entity, whether or not that's real depends to some degree on what it's good for. Right? Part of the aim of science is prediction and control and so

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       it's useful to take a look at important life outcomes among human beings and to determine whether or not you can predict that because that's one way of testing whether or not the phenomena that you've derived say from your statistical analysis, both in the case of fluid intelligence or intelligence more broadly. And in the case of the big five actually has the capacity to manifest itself in a meaningful way in the world outside of inside the lab. That's one domain of potential validation, but then outside the lab as well. And so what we're going to do today is to look at the factors that determine performance in the real world. And so you might think, well, what are some important real world outcomes on which performance might vary? And we're going to stick to those that are rather obvious today. We talked about creative achievement already for example, but you could think of creative achievement, entrepreneurial achievement, those actually clumped together.

Speaker 2:          00:02:14       They're part of the same phenomena. You think about academic achievement and you could think about success in the workplace and then those can be subdivided because success in the workplace for example, needs to be analyzed in terms of success. Say at simple jobs in success at complex jobs you'd like. There's different ways of fractioning fractionating a phenomena to increase your capacity, to understand it and to measure it and then to predict it. But those are rough domains where there's self evident individual differences. And where the capacity to predict performance would at least be of some utility, a performance in the workplace. This is an interesting one. Performance in the workplace is a tricky measure. A tricky issue. I've been working on performance prediction tests for a long time because I was interested in, because I'm a clinical psychologist and because I have a practical side, I'm often interested in what the utility of psychological measurements might be outside the lab.

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       It's interesting to consider that from an ethical perspective too. So if you're hiring people, you have to conundrums that lay themselves in front of you and one is the ethical necessity to give each person a fair chance. And the other is the ethical necessity to place the proper person in the proper position. And you might say, well you could do that randomly and like there are countries in Europe for example, that have a quasi random approach to the selection of university students. So Holland just like that, they have a pretty open admission policy. Now, what that means is that everyone has a chance to go to college, but the downside of it is that the failure rate in the first year, for example, is extraordinarily high. Now you might say that's a perfectly reasonable price to pay for the open admission and for the opportunity to give everyone a chance, but you could also say, well, that's a hell of a waste of time for the people who go into the first year of college or university and fail.

Speaker 2:          00:04:13       It's not a pleasant experience for them. It's a very expensive in terms of time and resources and perhaps it would have been better for them and for broader society had. They'd been able to determine beforehand whether they had two sets of qualities that were necessary to increase the probability of success. Because if I could tell you, well, you know, you have a 80 percent chance of success in this domain and only a 20 percent chance in this domain. You still might want to take the risk in the 20 percent success domain. But you might also think, well, I might as well go off and function where my particular combination of proclivities has the best opportunity to manifest itself. And, and because why not position yourself for success rather than failure? Now, I'm not saying that the ethical conundrum between those two alternatives is something that's easy to, uh, what would you say an easy thing to map your way through.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       It's by no means an easy way to map your way through because there are strong arguments to be had on both sides of the equation, so, but there's still the scientific question that remains, which is to what degree can you accurately predict people's performance and to what degree does that reflect positively or negatively on your psychological concepts? And then there's the actual practical utility of potentially offering to schools, to universities and to workplaces in general the probability of selecting people with an above average chance of succeeding. It's even more complicated. Say if you're selecting not so much entry level employees in a company because maybe you tell yourself they are more towards the possibility of bringing more people in and letting them fail or succeed in the job, but let's say you're replacing a management team at a medium to large size corporation. You know if you bring in managers that are in competent, not only are they going to fail, which is obviously not very good for them, and the failure rate among managers is very high.

Speaker 2:          00:06:11       It exceeds. It exceeds 65. I figure, I think it's 65 percent of managers. I believe that's correct. Add zero or negative net value to the companies. It's something like that. The failure rate in managerial positions is overwhelming and the problem with bringing someone into a managerial or an executive position even worse, who isn't competent to play that role is that they can wipe out the careers of everyone that they're supervising. And in the case of say, large companies, they can bring the whole damn company down and so it's not like the the, the ethic of people deserve an equal chance, let's say, to fail and succeed isn't a very practical ethic. When you're putting someone in a high demand position where the consequences of failure are can be overwhelming, not only for that person but for all the people that they happen to be whose destiny they happen to be involved in determining.

Speaker 2:          00:07:02       And so then you might say, if you could come up with a selection process that would increase the probability of hiring and above average manager from 50 slash 50 to 60 slash 40 or 70 slash 30. Maybe you're actually ethically compelled to use that. And in fact, by law, this is particularly the case in the United States. You're required by law to use the most effective, valid, reliable and nondiscriminatory selection process that currently exists in order to select your employees. And one of the things that's going to happen to employers in the next 10 years is they're going to get a very nasty shock for using interviews. Because the data on unstructured interviews indicates quite clearly that a, that they're discriminatory, partly because they they, for example, if you're tall and assertive and good looking and charming, then you're much more likely to do well in an interview, but that doesn't necessarily have any bearing whatsoever on the probability that you'll succeed in the position and so and not only that, the predictive validity of unstructured interviews is very low.

Speaker 2:          00:08:07       It's about point one, two. It's something like that which means that if you just pick people randomly for success or failure, let's say you'd have a 50 slash 50 chance of predicting whether someone was going to be a success or a failure. It's just a coin toss and then if you used an unstructured interview, you'd get that up to 56, 44, which is slightly better, but it's by no means it's not even close to the accuracy that you could get. For example, if you just use the standard test of conscientiousness, which would give you a correlation of about point two five with with say managerial with managerial productivity and there's this interesting. This is an interesting thing to know. It's called the binomial effect size, display effect size is the magnitude of an effect, right, and and it's not an easy thing to get a handle on all that you really need to, if you're going to be a psychologist, because in any study there is an effect size indicator correlation off often or an r squared, which is the correlation squared or a Cohen's d, which has the effect size expressed in standard deviation.

Speaker 2:          00:09:05       So something like that, but you kind of have to understand that at a basic level to understand what statistics actually do. And there's this phenomena called the binomial effect size display that can help you understand in an embodied sense what the magnitude of a correlation means. So here's how it works. Imagine that you have a predictor of point two zero. So the correlation is r equals point two zero between phenomena. One will say conscientiousness and phenomena, two, workplace performance point two, zero correlation. The question might be, well, how much? How much would you improve your predictive capacity over chance levels if you applied that predictor? And the answer is that the ar is the difference between the odds ratio. So let me explain that. So point five, zero point five zero. If you subtract one from the other, you get zero. So the predictive validity of selection by chance is zero point five, zero minus point five, zero equals zero.

Speaker 2:          00:10:07       That's the predictive validity of chance. If you have a predictor of point two zero, which is approximately, that's sort of the low end estimate for conscientiousness, then that would change your odds ratio from point five, zero point five zero, right? Random two, point six, zero point four zero because point six zero minus point four, zero point two zero. And so the correlation coefficient turns out to be the difference between the odds between the odds. So and so it gives you a quick rule of thumb. So for example, so if you have a point two zero predictor that gives you 60 slash 40, if you have a point three zero predictor, that gives you 60 5:35 because point six, five minus point three five is point three zero. And if you have a point six predictor, which is really up on the high end, right, you're really starting to push your limits of statistical predict prediction validity at that point.

Speaker 2:          00:10:59       That gives you a point eight zero minus point two zero. And so what you've done, if you use a predictive of a predictor that has a correlation Coefficient of point six zero, which you could get, for example, if you took conscientiousness and combined that with a good test of Iq for predicting complex jobs, you might be able to get up to point six that moves your odds ratio of selecting an above average person for the position from point five, zero point five, zero two point eight, zero point two zero. So it cuts your failure rate by more than half, right? Brings it down from point five, zero. Point two zero, because point eight, zero minus point two, zero point six zero. So that's a really good thing to know. That's called the binomial effect size display. It's really good thing to have in your mind. It's very simple.

Speaker 2:          00:11:40       It's just a, it's just subtraction and it gives you some sense of the power of, of, of statistical prediction. Now the question might be, well, let's say you had a predictor of point two zero conscientiousness. You might say, well, if you square, they are. That gives you four percent of the variance. Who the hell cares for percent of the variance? You've left 95 percent of the variability between people in terms of their performance unexplained. You might say, well, why even bother? Well, the answer to that question is how much difference in productive output is there between people? Because if there's a tremendous degree of productive, of difference in productive output between people than increasing your ability to predict someone's performance, even by some relatively small increment might have massive economic utility. If let's say the top 10 percent of your people are 50 times as productive as the bottom 10 percent of your people than shifting your ability to predict up so that you have more of those extremely high performing people or less of the extremely low performing people might more than payoff might more than pay for itself.

Speaker 2:          00:12:48       From an economic perspective, even though your prediction, your predictor isn't, doesn't have that massive amount of power when that actually happens to be the case. So back in 1968, there was a guy named Walter Michelle. He had reviewed, he's a social psychologist. He reviewed the personality literature up to that point and concluded that the typical personality measure only predicted the typical performance measure at about point two and that's actually remained relatively stable. I would say it's a little higher than that. It's probably point two five, especially if you do things like correct for measurement, error and so forth. And what Michelle said was, because it's only point two five, let's say you square that, that's five percent of the variants. You leave 95 percent of the phenomena unexplained. You might as well not even bother measuring personality and so that actually killed the field of personality from a psychometric perspective for about 25 years.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       Really until about the early 19 nineties when people woke up and thought, wait a minute, what are the typical effect sizes in other domains of prediction? And then they found out that, well, the point two zero correlation that was typical of personality prediction was actually pretty damn good by social sciences or health sciences standards, like it doesn't sound good when you just think about it as an absolute measure because it leaves 95 percent of the phenomena unexplained, but when you compare it to other things that people consider of reasonable magnitude than it turns out that personality psychologists are doing just fine. And then also in the 19 nineties, and I'll show you some of this, the economic calculations done and the so one of the calculations would be well imagine that you have maybe it took 20 companies and you did it a distribution of the productivity of their employees.

Speaker 2:          00:14:28       It's hard thing to do because you have to measure their productivity. So how the hell do you do that? Right? With salespeople, you can measure sales. That's pretty straightforward. With lawyers, you can measure hours billed. Like there are some, there are some occupations where the performance measure is sort of built into the job. But if you're a manager in the mid level of a large corporation, how the hell can you tell how productive you are? It's so there's a measurement problem on the productivity measurement and as well as the performance prediction and and it's. It's a very intractable problem and the way that people often do that is by saying, well, let's say you're a manager in the mid level of a corporation. How do we determine how productive we are? You are, while we might ask you to compare your, your work productivity with your peers, maybe construct up a questionnaire asking about your efficient use of time and so forth, and then we might get your peers to do the same thing to you.

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       We might get your supervisors to do the same thing to you and we might get your, your subordinates to do the same thing to you and then aggregate across all those measures and infer that that aggregate opinion actually constitutes a valid measure of productivity. You actually don't know, right? Because that assumes that what you're doing, that your peers and your supervisors and so forth. Our rating is actually related in some positive manner to the bottom line of the company and you actually don't. You actually can't figure that out. This is actually, I think why, why large companies start to become unstable is because if there's enough layers between the operations of the people in the tiers of the corporation and the real outcome measure, which is basically profit because that's what we've got. Then the relationship between your activity as a manager and the productivity of the company starts to become increasingly blurred and that might mean that you're working as hard as you can on something that's actually going to cost the company money so you would actually be much more productive from a profit perspective if you just didn't go to work at all and that that happens a lot in large corporations because you'd never know, especially if there's a lot of steps that have to be undertaken in a process before you can test the product in the market.

Speaker 2:          00:16:31       You have no idea if you're wasting time and resources. You just can't tell. So the performance measurement issue is a very, very complicated one. We haven't talked about it that much, but I gave you a kind of a brief overview of it. Now what you really want to do is have multiple sources of information about performance and aggregate across them and if you can use real world measures that are tied to two income generation, so much the better because you have to use something as your gold standard, right? You have to say at some point while we're going to define this as reality, when it comes to performance and in a free market economy, roughly what you do there is you say that what profit is the proxy for productivity and that isn't the same thing saying is that it isn't the same thing as saying that profit is productivity.

Speaker 2:          00:17:15       That's not the same thing. It's saying that at some point you have to decide what you're going to accept as a measure of productivity because otherwise there's no point in even talking about it and you can't just not talk about productivity if you're running an organization because the organization doesn't exist unless it produces something that will keep it going and generally that happens to be money. So anyways, it's quite, it's very complicated. All of this. I was also curious about because, because I'm curious, I guess is to find out what would happen if I took a measure that was derived in the lab and then try to launch it out in a, in the actual real world environment, tried to market and sell it and now that was very informative because I presume that we develop tests, which I'll talk to you about. There were actually pretty good at predicting performance, managerial performance for example, administrative performance.

Speaker 2:          00:18:03       We got ours have upwards of point six which is really bloody impressive. So we could, we could tell employers, look, if you use our tests, we can increase the probability that you'll hire an above average employee from 50 slash 50 to 80 20 and the economic benefit of that will be staggering. Staggering. And, and I'll show you the calculations that enabled that sort of, that sort of prediction to be made. And you might think, well and this is what you do think. If you're naive about producing something of value, you might think, well, if you can produce something that's of self evident, economic value selling, it will be a snap and that is so wrong, you just cannot believe it. So one of the things we found, which was really mind boggling to me was that you could make a case that the probability that a company will use a test that predicts performance, the pro, the probability that they will use the test is inversely related to the accuracy of the test, which basically means that the less accurate tests are easier to sell and you think, well, why the hell would that be?

Speaker 2:          00:19:01       Why? And the how in the world would it possibly be that corporations would rather buy tests that don't work than tests that do work and that that is what they do because really what they do by is the Meyer's breaks, right? That sells about a million units a year and the Myers Briggs has zero predictive utility with regards to performance prediction. So why do people use it? Oh, here's one reason it doesn't hurt anybody's feelings. Everybody wins, right? And so then you think, well, do corporations really care whether or not everybody wins when they're being tested? And the answer to that is yes, much more often than you would think so. So we hit all sorts of barriers. That was one. The problem with tests that work is that most of the people who take them don't do very well on them. And then the other problem is that people, people aren't good at statistical reasoning at all.

Speaker 2:          00:19:51       They're really, really bad at it. And so for example, they don't know the difference between a percentage and a percentile. So a percentage is if you get 40 percent on a test, it means you've got 40 percent of the questions, right? If you, if you are at the 40th percentile in the distribution of test scores, it means that you perform better than 40 percent of the people. That's actually not too bad. Right? But you'll think, no, that's not 40 percentile, that's 40 percent. And then you'll think that you failed. And so one of the things we found for example, was that when we were, when we were marketing the tests to mid level managers who had some say at least on whether or not they would be used, the first thing they would say as well, I want to do the test. And the thing you say about that is no you don't because this is derived statistically, you can't validate the test on the basis of your opinion about its applicability in your case, but you can't have that conversation that isn't going to go anywhere because they say, well, I'd never give a test to my

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       employees that I hadn't taken myself. It's like, okay. So then you think, well you're a typical manager, you're going to score at the 50th percentile. You are not going to be happy about that because you want a score at the 90th percentile because you confuse percentiles and percentages. And also because you don't notice that if you're doing better than 50 percent of the managers. That's actually pretty damn good question.

Speaker 4:          00:21:10       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       that's a good lead. I'll, I'll, I'll answer that as I go through this. Okay. Okay. So, so that was often at a dead started right there. And then the other thing we'd find this was cool to have horrible but cool. So imagine a large corporation and you go in and you try to make a sales pitch to someone and maybe they're in hr and they say, and you say to them, look, you could use these tests if you use it for 100. People will increase your bottom line by $2,000,000 a year. You think people would be jumping up and down about that. And they say, well how much does it cost? And we say, well it doesn't matter because the cost to benefit ratio is what you should care about, not the cost. Because they would want it say for $9 a test. It was like, no, if you do this for each and I'll show you the mathematics and a bit.

Speaker 3:          00:22:02       Each person that you select with this test will bring $20,000 of extra value to your company. You're not getting that for $9. And then they say, well wait a minute. We have a budget for testing that's limited to $9 a test and they say, well, it's going to produce $30,000 a year in revenue. They say, well that revenue goes to another branch of the company and we won't get any credit for it. We'll just get punished because we've exceeded our budget, our budget for selection. I thought, Oh yeah, I never, never, never expected that to come up as an obstacle so you know, so we had very well designed products. They also talk about 90 minutes because we, we started with a full scale neuropsychological assessment, so we took tests of dorsolateral prefrontal cortical ability which had before that been administered by neuro psychologists and we computerized and we did that back in 1993.

Speaker 3:          00:22:50       So it was among the first attempts to do this sort of thing and then we had a 90 minute test battery that also assessed the big five and then you could give that to employees and you know, you could, you could produce this 80 slash 20 differential that I described and well then we found out what that test was too long. It's like, well, what do you mean you're going to gain $30,000 a year per employee if you use this test? It's like, no, people don't want to be tested that log. It's like, okay, so you want an accurate test that doesn't discriminate against anybody. That makes everyone feel good. That's dirt cheap and that doesn't take any time at all. It's like, well, it took us about 15 years to build one of those after we had built the original thing that actually worked and so even then the the, the process of trying to introduce it into the workplace was almost impossible.

Speaker 3:          00:23:33       The other thing you find if you're trying to sell the large companies, this is this is worth knowing, is that it's great if you can sell to a large company because it's a large company man and so you. The potential for the sale is astronomical, but large companies are so slow you cannot believe it, and so it might take you three years. First of all, you have to find who you should talk to. That's impossible because they all the people that you can talk to have no decision making power whatsoever, so all you do is waste your time talking to them and they'll talk to you. They'll have meetings with you, but it won't matter because they don't have any decision making power and then you can't get access to people who have the decision making power because they don't let you have access to them.

Speaker 3:          00:24:12       And so that's a huge problem and even figuring them out is a huge problem. And even figuring out that those are the people that you need to talk to is a huge problem. So that might take you five years just to get it through your head that, that you're wasting your time. Ninety five percent of the time talking to the wrong people. And so then the next thing that happens, this is really, this is really comical. So let's say you do make some headway. It takes you three bloody years. You've, you've made a relationship with the person, they're ready to launch it. Then they have to market it internally and that takes them a year because they have to convince everybody to get onboard and then the corporation reshuffles and the person that you're dealing with disappears. It's like that happened to us. We were marketing to a very large company.

Speaker 3:          00:24:51       We would go all the way up to the CEO and ready to with this was with the future authoring program and we were ready to launch the damn product. It took us a huge amount of time to get through all the layers and just the week that we were going to launch it, the CEO resigned and the company stock crashed and that was the end of that. Bang and and large companies are like that. Like they're extremely slow and the typical duration that a person lasts in a given position, and this is something to consider with regards to your careers is both for years. So you'll occupy the position you're in for about four years and then while you'll either fail out, you'll move laterally or you'll move up. And so it's a three year sales cycle minimum, and that's interweaved with the possibility that whoever you're talking to is just going to disappear.

Speaker 3:          00:25:41       It's so. And then if you small cell to small companies, well they're faster, but they don't have any money. So that's not very helpful. So it's extraordinarily difficult even if you produce something of high value and that you have proof that the thing exists, it's extraordinarily difficult to sell it. And so here's another thing to think about. No, I think I've mentioned this to you before. If you write a book which is virtually impossible, and then get a publisher, which is virtually impossible, you probably have a rejection rate of 99 percent. So then if you do, if you do manage to publish the book with a reasonable publisher, which you won't because it's impossible, then you get eight percent royalties. That's it. So 92 percent of your labor goes to the sales, marketing and distribution end of things. And so it's just. So it's very, very difficult to generate capital as an entrepreneur.

Speaker 3:          00:26:32       And there's innumerable impediments. One of the things that people do, and this is something for those of you who might be entrepreneurially minded, here's another thing that you have to understand is that you can't really create a product and then launch it because first of all, you don't know how to do that. You might know how to create the product, but you do not know how to market or sell it. You don't know how to advertise it. You don't know how to communicate about it. You don't know how to ship it like there's all sorts of things you just don't know, but worse is you don't know if people will use it and so what companies do that, jen, that roll out new products on a relatively continual basis do is they don't develop the product and then go sell it. They continually communicate with their customers about what product the customer is willing to buy next and then they develop that and so you have to have your market identified and then you have to be in continual communication with the market.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       Well, you develop the product. It's not. I built a better mouse trap and the world comes marching to my door. That isn't how it works is that you got to find out if someone wants to buy your stupid thing and then the next thing is is that even if you have a great thing, you're going to go talk to people and they have 50 great things that they might buy and they're all great, but they're not going to buy all 50. They might buy one maybe and maybe they'll buy it this week, but probably they'll buy it in six months and they're not going to buy any of them no matter how great. Unless they're on fire and you're selling water because they're so busy already, right? They're so overwhelmed and preoccupied by their jobs that if you come in and you say, well, here, this is going to increase your efficiency by 20 percent and here's the three weeks.

Speaker 3:          00:28:06       You'd have to spend doing that, and then the payoff would come in the next years. They'll say, yeah, we'll all do that as soon as I have time, and as soon as I have, time is never. So if they're on fire and you have water, you can sell it to them, but that's all because otherwise it's a no goal. So those are all things that, that are worthwhile knowing because they're very hard to learn. And so and very comically, I mean, if you would've told me when I first started developing these tests that one of the reasons corporations wouldn't buy them because they worked that I would have just thought really. I mean, come on. Really? That's really the reason. It's like, yeah, yeah, that's the reason God. So very, very, very problematic. And then they already have their processes in place and they're entrenched. And then then the next problem is, you know, you haven't got any customers.

Speaker 3:          00:28:56       I think I told you that before, you don't have any customers and you show them the statistics, but they can understand this statistics and they also have 200 other people selling them things and 50 of them are crooks. So they're just lying about what they're doing. They can't tell the difference between the liars and the people who were telling the truth. And so they can't and they can't understand the statistics for themselves and they can't verify them anyways. So what they ask you is who else is using it? And if the answer is, well everybody, then you don't even have to do the sale because you're already rich. And if the answer is nobody, then they are going to say, well, why is nobody using this? You say, well, it's the hottest thing that's come along and they think, well, I'm not going to be the sucker who gets painted red dead fired because this failed that they do not think this might make me succeed.

Speaker 3:          00:29:39       People do not about whether or not they succeed. They care about whether or not they fail. And so that's another thing is that if you're marketing something and you can say, this will stop you from being identified as a failure than people might be happy about that. But if you say, this will really help you succeed. It's like, yeah, yeah, no, I don't want to succeed. I just don't want to fail. I don't want to succeed. I just want to be invisible and be left alone. And if you're looking for people's fundamental motivation, that's it. It's they want to be invisible and they want to be left alone. I tell you, the Zebra story [inaudible] you, any of you know that story. Okay, I'll, I'll tell you, this is ebro story. Tell it, stop me if I've told it to you before. This tells you everything you need to know about human beings.

Speaker 3:          00:30:27       So it's weird. It's worth. It's worth knowing. Okay? So zebras have stripes and people say, well, that's for camouflage. And then you think about that for two seconds and you think that's a really stupid theory because lions are camouflaged and they're like golden, like the grass and zebras are black and white. So you can see a zebra five miles away. It's like there's a zebra, it's black and white. So the whole camouflage thing that's just not working out so well as a hypothesis. Okay? So bylaw biologists go and they decided to take a look at some zebras and so they're looking at zebra at on the herd because there's no zebra, right? Just like there's no fish. There are schools of fish and there are herds of zebras. There isn't a fish. This is why I think the cod aren't coming back. There are no cod.

Speaker 3:          00:31:12       There are massive hundred mile long schools have cod, 10 stories deep, 20 million years old. You wipe out the school. You don't just get to throw a quad in the water and say, well, you know, off you go. It's like, well, where's my city? It's like launching you in the middle of a field. It's like, well, go out there and reproduce. It's like, no, that's not gonna happen. You know, so without the school that there's no cod and you can't just introduce a whole school of cod because you don't have a whole school of cod. So you know, maybe the cod are never coming back and zebras are the same thing. There's not a zebra, there's zebras and so you're looking at the zebras trying to study as zebra and you look at the Zebra and you make some notes and you look up and you think, oh Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:31:53       Which zebra was I looking at? And the answer to that is you don't know because the, the camouflage is against the herd and the black and white stripes. There's a variety of reasons for this. Stripes flies also seem not to like the stripes, but you know, usually people, things evolve for multiple reasons. But anyways, it's very difficult to parse out a zebra against the herd. You look down, you look up, it's like, oh, I'll hold those damn zebras look the same. Yes, the camouflage is effective, but it's against the herd. All right? So then you think, well we better identify a zebra so we can see what he's up to. So then you take your jeep and a can of red paint and a stick with a rag on the end of it. And you drive up to the zebras and you paint their haunch. Read that a little bit, put a nice red dot on their haunch or maybe clipped the rear with a clip.

Speaker 3:          00:32:36       And then you know, you stand back and you think, Hey, I'm pretty, now I'm going to watch that zebra. So what do you think happens to the Zebra? The lions kill it. Right? Right, right, because lions, they're smart, right? Hunter hunting animals are smart, but they have to identify a zebra before they can organize their hunt. They can't just hunt the whole herd. They have to pick out a zebra and so maybe it's like a zebra that's got a sore hip or something. And so you think, well, nature's kind. It just takes the week. It's though no zebra or lions, like really healthy delicious zebras, but they look like all the other healthy, delicious zebras so they can't get a beat on them. But if there are small and just born or if they're limping or there's something that identifies them, then the lions can pick them out and then they do pick them out.

Speaker 3:          00:33:24       And so the rule for human beings is keep your damn stripes on so the lions don't get you. And I'm telling you, man, if you want to remember one thing from my class about human motivation, that's a good thing to learn. People camouflage themselves against the herd and they like to be in the middle of the herd, which is what fish do. By the way, if you have a big school of fish, the smart, healthy, large fish are in the middle of the school because you know what you call a fish on the outside of the school bait, right? So that's what people are doing there are trying to move into the middle of the herd all the time and the herd moves around or the school moves around and people are going, well, I'm in the middle, I'm staying in the middle here, so I've got this protective ring of people around me so the predators don't pick me out and do me in.

Speaker 3:          00:34:11       So okay, so that's part of the reason why I said, well, you can't sell something to someone for success because you're thinking, well, people are aiming at success. Don't, don't be thinking that. It's not by any means necessarily true trait. Neuroticism is a potential most powerful motivator and trait. Neuroticism is let's not be too threatened or hurt, right? That's the negative emotion system. And the negative emotion system is a killer source of motivation. You know, you also see that there are scales of wellbeing that have been designed mostly by social psychologists, which means they're very bad scales most of the time because their psychometric capacity is absurdly low, generally speaking, so what you find with scales of wellbeing sometimes they're talked about as scales of happiness even is that people aren't after happiness thereafter, not hurting. It's not so they don't want to be extroverted and enthusiastic, right and and bubbly and full of smiles and laughter.

Speaker 3:          00:35:07       That isn't what they mean by I want to be happy. What they mean is I don't want to be anxious or in pain, and so wellbeing scales tend to be something like neuroticism, sorry, emotional stability plus extroversion, but the big loading is on emotional stability. The reverse of neuroticism. You want to avoid suffering. You don't want to be happy. You want to avoid suffering, and one way to avoid suffering is not to let the Lions Gnaw on you, and one way of doing that is to stay in the middle of the damn hurt and so and like, I'm not being a smart Alec about this. I understand why people do that. There's real danger to being visible. There's real danger in being visible. Now. You might be successful if you're visible, but you also might be dead. So okay, so now there's a number of things to consider if you're thinking about performance prediction and one of them is to what degree do people vary in terms of their performance capacity and you might say, well, there's very little performance variability, or you might say there's a tremendous amount of performance variability, or you might say there's an absurd amount of performance variability and it turns out that the claim that there's an absurd amount of performance variability is the proper claim.

Speaker 3:          00:36:15       Iq is normally distributed, so is conscientiousness, but productivity is distributed along the prieto distribution and I'll show you why and that follows a law called price's law from someone named Derek to solar price who was studying scientific productivity in the early 19 sixties. And what he showed was that a vanishingly small proportion of the scientists operating in a given scientific domain produced half the output. And so what you see and what's happening is that to do really well at a given productive task, which would also include generating money as as a proxy for, for, for creative productivity, is that you have to be a bunch of things, have to go your way simultaneously. So maybe you have to be really, really smart. You have to be really, really lucky. You have to be really healthy, you have to be really energetic, you have to be really conscientious, you have to be in the right time at the right place, and maybe you also have to have the right social network, right?

Speaker 3:          00:37:07       So it's a lot of things and each of those are small probability there. Each of those are small probabilities. And then if you multiply the small probabilities together, you get an extraordinarily tiny probability and you have to have all those things functioning before you're going to end out on the, on the, on the extreme end of the productivity distribution. But if you do end up there, then you produce almost all of everything. So it's a tiny number of people that produce almost all of everything. That's price's law and technically it is, and I mentioned this to you before, it's the square root law. The square root of the number of people in a productive domain produce half the output, right? So if you have 10 employees, three of them produce half the output. If you have 100, 10 of them produce half the output. If you have 10,000, 100 of them produce half the productive output, and so what that also means is that because there's massive variability in performance, you don't have to shift your ability to predict performance very, very, very much up towards being better at it to gain substantially on the positive side because there's so much difference in productivity and that actually happens to be also a function of the complexity of the job.

Speaker 3:          00:38:15       If the job is simple, which is means you can. This job has 10 rules, maybe that's a janitorial job. Let's say you do, it takes a little while to learn it, but once you've learned it, you basically do the same thing all the time. There's not a lot of performance variability in those jobs and most of that would be not by conscientiousness and also to some by neuroticism because the higher people who are higher in neuroticism would be more likely to miss work, but, but, but general cognitive ability for example, is not a good predictor at all. It'll predict how fast you learn the tasks initially, but not how well you perform the test, but if the task to you're doing are shifting constantly, so your responsibilities change or you're in a creative job where you're constantly solving new problems. So those are kind of the same thing.

Speaker 3:          00:39:00       Then Iq, as the complexity of the job increases, the predictive utility of Iq increases, which is only to say that smarter people can handle complex situations faster. So that's doesn't seem like a particularly radical claim. So price's law dictates that there's massive individual productivity differences between people. So increasing your predictive, your capacity for predicting performance even by small increments, has a huge economic consequence. That was established in the 19 nineties. The equations were first developed in the 19 nineties and that's part of the reason that I started working on performance prediction tests because I read the economics and I thought, oh my God, you can produce a test that costs $30 times. Say Baby, you have 50 applicants for the position, $1,500 to administer, and it'll produce an increments of something like 30 percent of salary permanently for the person that you put in a position.

Speaker 3:          00:39:52       So let's say you hire a $75,000 employee and it increases their productivity by 30 percent, so we'll say roughly $25,000, you'll get a $25,000 return on a $1,500 investment every single year. That person occupies the position on average, that's four years. That's $100,000 payoff for your $1,500 investment. I read that. I thought, oh, that'll be easy to sell. It's like wrong. Wrong. Even though the economic payoff was so massive, I told you the other impediments that did emerge, but the, the arithmetic or the capacity to produce these calculations was established in the 19 nineties and I'll show you the equations in a bit here. Okay, so we already talked about what a normal distribution looks like. That's the red line and a normal distribution emerges as a consequence of chance processes. So we'll take a look at those here. Hopefully this will work. Look at that.

Speaker 3:          00:42:27       So there's your corporate advertisement for the day, but it's not often you see a heroic, normal distribution, but they're. There you go. So, so, so what you see is that you get a pattern output as a consequence of chance processes and so where you happened to be on the distribution for all of the traits that we've described as a consequence of innumerable chance, genetic genetic and cultural processes. But a lot of them are a lot more than people like to admit her genetic. I mean you can make people stupid or with the environment, but it's not that easy to make them smarter. So because it's what I think about it, right, it's way easier to make something worse than it is to make something better, and so even if you take everyone and you give them optimal access to information and say optimal nutrition, which pretty much everybody's in that position now, at least in so far as we can manage it, you're going to get massive genetic differences in such things as conscientiousness or extroversion or intelligence as you would.

Speaker 3:          00:43:20       In fact, as you flatten out the sociocultural environment, say you take everybody and you provide them with optimal nutrition and optimal access to information, which you've pretty much done by the way with a computer, right? Because how are you going to give someone more access to information than to give them a web enabled computer? That's it, right? There's. There's just no better. It's an infinite library. You can learn anything with it. So we're done. We've equalized the education landscape roughly speaking and then nutritionally. Well, you know, yeah, some people eat badly and some people eat better, but the option to eat well is basically open to at least everybody in North America. Roughly speaking, you've wiped out the social socio cultural variation. You might think, well, that equalizes people. It's wrong. All it does is reduce the variability to the remaining biological differences. You maximize the genetic variability by minimizing the socio variability, right?

Speaker 3:          00:44:13       Very important thing to understand. This is why the gender differences between personality between men and women are largest in the Scandinavian countries. Tens of thousands of people have been assessed along these dimensions. We know that we know the data that have come in are clear. The biggest differences between men and women in the in terms of personality and in terms of interest are in the Scandinavian countries. Why wiped out sociocultural variation? All you've got left is biological differences, so, so, so well. You can draw your own conclusions from that. It's unfortunate and fortunate at the same time. All right, so here's a parade distribution. This is the distribution. Remember I showed you with the creative achievement questionnaire that almost everybody stacked up at zero, people have zero creative output, the median person has zero lifetime creative output and then there's a tiny proportion that are way the hell out on the right hand end of the distribution, right? Those are the people have who have everything is cycling forward for them and as they get more well known, of course they get more opportunities as well.

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       Con, cut. Person's very conscientious. So I just, I'll just run this simulation for you. Okay? And this shows you why the distribution emerges. Now you have to watch this quickly because it's a fairly fast animation. So here's what happens. Everybody starts out with $10. There's a thousand people playing the game. Everybody starts out with $10. We have a dollar, you have a dollar. I flip a coin. If I get heads, you give me a dollar. If I get tails, I give you a daughter. We go around and we trade with everyone. Okay? So the first thing that happens when people start to trade is this normal distribution develops, right? Because some people lose and some people when it's just like the Golden Board that I showed you, okay, so you keep playing. People start to stack up at zero watch because they lose 10 times in a row, Bang, they're done.

Speaker 3:          00:46:06       The bottom graph is a graph of the entropy of the distribution, which increases as the game continues because at the beginning it's maximally ordered, right? Everybody has exactly the same amount. Now it's being distributed. Same equations apply to the distribution of gas into a vacuum. Well, what happens now, someone you know, there are people out there at the, at the $50 range or at the $60 range, at the $70 range. You keep playing it. Well eventually what happens if you play it right to its conclusion is that one person ends up with all the money, so that's to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing. Everything will be taken. That's the law of economic productivity. It's called Matthew is the matthew principle and it's actually an economic principle that was derived from a saying in the New Testament. I'll tell you some more about this on Tuesday because I didn't get through all of it and I want to. I want to finish up the performance prediction lecture and show you a couple of things. I didn't get to show you the last time that we talked and then I want to do the closing lecture since we're done today, so we'll start with the performance prediction and so I've been thinking more about this prieto distribution issue because it's a really big deal and it's difficult. It's still difficult for me to understand and see. I didn't really learn about this about 10 years ago, which is quite a shock to me because

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       it's such a fundamental phenomenon that it seems to me that it would have been addressed in my training somewhere along the way and so and so. I'm still thinking it through what it means exactly. Now, here's, here's an interesting thing. You know, that Iq is normally distributed and it's a good predictor of long term performance and conscientiousness is normally distributed and it's a good predictor of longterm performance and an openness is also normally distributed and it's a good predictor of creative behavior, but creative output is not normally distributed. It's distributed in this weird prieto distribution that that's indexed here. And I showed you that with the creative achievement questionnaire most specifically because that provides a really concrete example of it. Um, so it looks like the capacity to think creatively might be normally distributed. That would be openness say and intelligence. But the consequence of that turns into this strange prieto distribution.

Speaker 2:          00:48:24       And the credo distribution with regards to creative achievement was best. The catastrophe of it in some senses best indexed by the fact that if I remember correctly, 70 percent of people who complete the creative achievement questionnaire, which indexes lifetime creativity score zero. So zero is a strange number. You know, zero isn't like other numbers. And the part of the reason for that is that it's difficult to do anything with nothing. So you know, if you, if you buy a stock and the and the price sinks to like two cents a stock, you're still alive. But if the price sinks to zero, you're done. Right? That's it. The game's over. And that's the thing about zero when you hit zero or maybe when you're at zero, the game is over. And when, when, when we were attempting to market, for example, the tests that we had designed to predict performance in companies, one of the big obstacles to begin with was having zero customers and zero customers is really the wrong number of customers to have.

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       And there's a big difference between zero customers then one customer, right? Because then you're in the game. But. And so there's these weird barriers to moving forward in life. And you see this, there's a poverty trap that's sort of like this too. Like if you're, if you're so broke that you can't keep up with paying your bills. It's really, really difficult to get out of that because you can't get a bank account, for example, and you can't pay your rent. And there's, there's, there's economies of scale that you can't take advantage of because you don't have any money at all and so you can't get going in the game. And then so there's the problem of starting out with zero, which is a big problem and very difficult to get out of. And then there's the problem of falling to zero if you are in the game because when you fall to zero, that it's very difficult to get going again.

Speaker 2:          00:50:07       And so. All right, so now I want to show you something about how, how trading games work. Um, so I think we stopped, we closed with this last time, but so this is a, this is a graph that shows you how a monopoly game starts roughly speaking, but you could say this is how you would set up the world if you wanted perfect equity. If you wanted everybody to have the same outcome, everybody would have the same amount of money. In this case it's $10. And so it's dollars along the, along the bottom axis. And it's number of players along the lefthand day. Oxys. And you can think about this as a monopoly game. Everybody starts with the same amount of money and then you start trading randomly and you know if, if, if you have $10 in your trading, a dollar each trade, if you have enough people, some unlucky person is going to end up with $0 after 10 traits.

Speaker 2:          00:51:00       And if they end up with $1 after nine trades, they still have the chance of recovery. It's a low chance, but it's not zero. But once they hit zero, they're out of the game. And so what happens is if you run this simulation, you have people flip a coin to determine how they're going to trade, then this is what happened. So the first thing that happens is you generate a normal distribution because some people win and some people lose. And most people sort of half women and half lose. But some lose continually. And some wind continually. And so it turns into a normal distribution. That's fine. But then when the game continues to play, then what happens is that people start to stack up on the zero end of things. And a tiny proportion at the upper end and if you play the game right to cessation, which is what you do, if you play monopoly, for example, somebody ends up with all the money.

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       And the funny thing about playing monopoly as you know, if you've played monopoly multiple times, is that the probability that you'll win continually across games is pretty low. You know, there's a lot of randomness in monopoly and if you play with the same five people, 10 games, the probability is pretty good. You're not going to win more than two games. So. So there's chance elements that come into play that determine the outcome. And so anyways, I was thinking about this more, a little bit more last night and somebody asked me, I was talking about it with somebody and uh, he asked me if the Prieto distribution was a necessary consequence of the fact that production is number one measured. And number two, social. And that's that. I thought that was really interesting question. It's like, do you get a prieto distribution every time creative output ends up being measured in some way.

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       And even if you can conceptualize it, so because it might be the, the idea might be that anything that you can assign monetary value to is first of all, is something you can measure because assigning monetary value to something is in fact measuring it, right? You're measuring it with money and then as soon as you assign a monetary value to it, you can, you can trade, you can trade it. And it also takes on some aspects of a zero sum game. And most of the things that we talked about with regards to the production of Prieto distributions were measured entities. And we're, um, we're, we're trading games as well. So even because I mentioned to you, for example, that number of, of basketball hoops successfully managed it by NBA players is praetor distributed. But that's also, those are measurable with

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       money because of course you get paid to do it and it's, it is a social game. And so maybe it is an inevitable consequence of trading in a social game that you produce preload cubs. And then I was trying to figure out why. And I've also always had this suspicion that what happens to people is that as they move toward zero, positive feedback loops get set up so they're more likely to hit zero. And as they move away from zero positive feedback loops get set up so that they're increasingly more likely to move away from zero. So here's an example. Let's say you're not doing too bad, so maybe you're in the middle of the normal distribution, then you lose your job. Okay? And so let's say you're a conscientious person and we could say just for the sake of argument, that you lose your job because of mass layoffs in your company.

Speaker 3:          00:54:08       So it has nothing to do with you. It's fundamentally, it's just luck of the draw basically. But then what happens to you? Well, if you're conscientious, you're gonna, you're gonna. Go after yourself pretty hard. So you're going to, especially if you're also high in neuroticism, it's going to depress you to lose your job. And maybe you're in a situation where you just, for one reason or another, you don't have that many other opportunities. Now maybe you should look for them, but maybe you're in a depressed state of the economy or you're geographically located somewhere that makes moving difficult or so on and so forth. You know, so, but you lose a job and then you start to get depressed because of that. Well, then as you start to get depressed, you know it decreases the probability that you're going to look for a job, but also maybe starts to put stress on your family and it also starts to decrease the probability that you're going to engage in positive social interaction.

Speaker 3:          00:54:56       So now not only are you unemployed and suffering from economic stress, but your marriage is starting to suffer and you're starting to isolate yourself from your friends. And then of course, as your marriage suffers in the stress builds up, then that's gonna make you more depressed and that's going to keep you even farther away from your friends. And that's going to decrease the likelihood that you're going to have enough positive emotion and enthusiasm to look for another job. And then, you know, maybe you want to add a bit of a drinking problem too. That just for fun and you can see that you can get a spiral going that's just taken you down. Right, and it's all sorts of things because lots of times people conceptualize, let's say you're unemployed guide and you go to counseling and you get a diagnosis of depression and the thing about a diagnosis of depression, it's sort of like the assumption is there's something gone wrong with your psychological structure.

Speaker 3:          00:55:43       It's like if you're unemployed and you're, you're depressed. It isn't obvious at all that the problem is in your head. You know what I mean? It's. It doesn't. It isn't even obvious that it's a psychological problem. It's just a problem and problems can take you out. And so the. You know, if you're unemployed and you're under economic stress and your marriage is starting to shake and you're isolating yourself from your friends and you're less likely to be motivated to go look for a job. You can sort of think about that as a depressive spiral, but you can also think of it as a conspiracy in some sense of external forces that are auguring you into the ground and we don't tend to conceptualize psychological disorders that way, but we should because lots of times when people are suffering from something that you could describe in psychological terminology and depression is a very good example of that.

Speaker 3:          00:56:31       It isn't obvious that there's something wrong with them. Psychologically. Often they just are in trouble and there isn't a category in psychological diagnosis for client in serious trouble. But my experience has been almost without exception that the people that come to see me come to see me because something's gone wrong with their life. Not because they have a psychological problem. Now you could say, well, there are psychological inadequacies such as they might be, are interfering with their ability to recover or maybe even served as precursors to, you know, increase the probability of the catastrophe, but it's still not exactly the appropriate way to conceptualize it. And you know, because you're, you inside you. And as a personality psychologist and as a clinical theorists, most of what I've talked to you guys about is your psyche and its structure as if it was like a soul that inhabited you.

Speaker 3:          00:57:23       And there's some real utility in that. You know, you're an individual demarcated from the community. You can be set up in a healthy manner, an unhealthy manner. The problem with that is that you're not just an individual, you're connected to all these external network dynamic networks that are really, really important. And it isn't even easy to separate them from, you know, like you might say, well this is especially true once you become a parent is like, is your child more you than your arm? You know what you think? That's pretty obvious parts of you that are physically linked, our more key to you to you as an entity, but it's by no means obvious. I think many people would much more happily sacrifice at arm than a child. You know. And so your boundaries are not where your boundaries are located, are not precisely isomorphic with the outline of your body.

Speaker 3:          00:58:09       It's not that simple at all. And so you're embedded in all sorts of networks that can pull you down rapidly or elevate you, because the other thing that happens is that, well, let's say I've never traded with anyone and I go up to someone and I say, well, do you want to trade? And they say, well, why? How? How can I trust you? And the answer to that is, well, you have to take my word for it with that's not, that's not a very good argument. You might say, instead, well here's what I have to offer and you can evaluate it, but the person is likely to say, well, I don't know how to evaluate it. And so I'm still stuck with taking your work. So that's a bad problem. And you'll see that if you ever tried to sell a product in the marketplace is if you don't.

Speaker 3:          00:58:48       If if the product is new and it's complex, then you're forcing the person that wants to buy it to evaluate it and then you're forcing them to take the risk of being wrong as well as the time it would take to evaluate it. And they don't like that. What they want is what's often called social proof, which is, okay, well you want to trade with me, who else have you traded with? And if the answer is zero, then they are going to say, well, you're an interesting person and all that. But, um, I've got these other people over here who have already traded with a bunch of people and therefore the risk is lower in part because let's say I have a supervisor and I'm going to make a decision. And my primary concern is that my supervisor will not hate me for making the decision.

Speaker 3:          00:59:28       It's not my, that my primary concern is to make the best decision. It's not the same thing. It's that I want to make a decision that I'm not going to get in trouble for, okay, so how do I do that? Because I need a post hoc justification so I buy something from you and it turns out to be terrible. And, and I get called for it, called on the table for it. And what do I say? I say, well, you know, that person was buying from it and that person was buying from, from, from him and that person was buying from him like all these other people were doing the same thing. So it's not like the error is localized in me and that's often a very credible story. But if the answer is, well, you know, I, I evaluated it and took A. Rick decided to take a risk.

Speaker 3:          01:00:07       It's like out the door with you sunny, because you know, that's just, that's an indication that you're not capable of doing that sort of thing. So I think part of the reason that people spiral downhill into zero is because Paul positive, like a positive feedback loop is a loop that increases the probability that the loop will continue, right? A positive feedback loop is you've experienced this when you hear microphone feedback in an amplified system. So you know the microphone sends a message to the speakers and then the speakers send out the message amplified and then the microphone picks up the message and and it gets amplified again and you get this howling occur, which is can be deafening but can also destroy the system because it'll keep amplifying upward until the speakers blow, for example. That's a positive feedback loop and a positive feedback loop can spiral you upward or it can spiral you downward.

Speaker 3:          01:01:00       And so a virtuous circle, a virtuous positive feedback loop is when, well, I've traded with him and I've traded with him and I've traded with him and now I can say to you, I've traded with these three people and you go talk to them when they say good things and so then you say, well, I'll trade with you. And then because of that, then you're even more likely to trade with me. And it's like the thing starts to spiral uphill and it does that. I think in a nonlinear form. And so because one of the things you guys are going to be asking yourself as you mature, because what's happening is that income inequality is increasing, right? And you might ask, well why that? Why is that? The first thing you need to know is that that's what income does. So it's not like you need an explanation for it.

Speaker 3:          01:01:40       This is the explanation. It's like a natural rule. If you run a trading game to its logical conclusion, one person ends up with all the money and everyone else ends up with zero, so you don't need an explanation for that because that's, that's it's in the natural order of things that that occurs, so to speak. It's a logical consequence of a random trading game with zero. As one of the polls, you still might ask yourself, well, what can you do about income inequality? And that's a perfectly reasonable question. And as I said already, the answer to that is what's if it's an extraordinarily complicated problem to to address, we don't really know how to address it. The only time it's really been successfully as far as I can tell, roughly speaking, is during the industrial revolution, especially in the part of the industrial revolution that occurred, say after World War II in the developing world where for one reason or another, it turned out that there were a tremendous number of high paying industrial jobs that people who, that people could get access to without having had the fortune, the good fortune of one of these positive feedback loops working for them, but those jobs are disappearing very, very, very rapidly and, and one of the problems is, as far as I can tell, is that computational devices are in intelligence and conscientiousness multiplier.

Speaker 3:          01:02:57       And that's a big problem because the more intelligent people are already and more conscientious people are already more likely to be tapped up on the, on the winner's side of the prieto distribution. Then you add, you know, if you have an Iq of 150, let's say you have an Iq of 150, you know how to use a computer and you live in Silicon Valley. So man, you're a deadly person, right? Because you're super fast, let's say you're super hard working. We could also say maybe you're super energetic and healthy because that also seems to be a criteria and that is a real important determinant of that kind of lifetime hyper success. So you need you're way the hell above average in ICU. You're very, very industrious. You know how to use computers. There are massive, insanely massive effort multiplier and then you're surrounded by people who are super smart.

Speaker 3:          01:03:41       It's like there's a lot of things going for you, right? You're going to be moving ahead at an awful, awful rate. That's again, why places like Silicon Valley are so damn effective is that they're bringing people from all over the world who are like that into one place like silicon valley. I don't know if you guys know about the Indian Institute of Technology, but it's India's answered to mit and it's one hell of an engineering school and but a huge number of the graduates from India go to Silicon Valley and work there mostly as entrepreneurs. They're very good at being entrepreneurs as it turns out, and they ship money like mad back to India and that's part of what's driving the Indian economy. But it's just another example is that because silicon valley is already full of brilliant entrepreneurial people, then more brilliant and entrepreneurial people from all over the world flock there like mad and it's just, it's one of these cycles that spirals upward, very, very difficult to, to set that up somewhere else. And once it gets going, it's an unbelievably powerful economic engine crazily, crazily powerful. So.

Speaker 3:          01:04:43       Okay, so, so what's the panoply let's say, of of predictors that we know of? Well, um, and so these are determinants of lifetime success as far as I can tell. Uh, and I would think about this because I'll tell you what it is that you need to do to be successful. Some of these things aren't so malleable, but others are things that you can work on. Well, Iq. Well that's a rough one because there is no evidence as far as I can tell that you can do a damn thing about your Iq. I was just reading a paper by Dan Simon today. Uh, it's a relatively recent review. Dan Simon did the invisible gorilla stuff and he was looking because there's all these companies that claim that these online brain training exercises can produce cognitive improvements, and he reviewed the literature. Gannon, I reviewed that literature like six times in the last 15 years because I keep hoping that someone will crack the problem, but it's always the same answer.

Speaker 3:          01:05:34       It's like you do brain training games. You get better at the game a lot better at that game. You get slightly better at similar games, but distal games that are still heavily cognitively loaded doesn't affect your performance at all. Zero. None. So the, the, the issue of how to raise Iq, man, that's a killer. No one knows what, how to do it. I can tell you how to stop your Iq from decreasing as you get older. That's not so bad because it does that. A fluid Iq decreases from the time you're 20 and, and pretty rapidly. It's a physical. Health is the best preventative. So exercise, physical exercise, weirdly enough, you know, you think, well, why? While your brain uses oxygen like Matt right handed and it and it needs to be kept clean and well oxygenated and physical exercise, both both like weightlifting, so anaerobic and aerobic, anaerobic and aerobic exercise both seem to be very, very effective at staving off cognitive declines across the lifespan.

Speaker 3:          01:06:36       So that's a really useful thing to know because that's the only thing we know that does that. So then the next best predictor of lifetime success is conscientiousness. While so and of the of the two aspects of conscientiousness say orderliness and industriousness, the better predictor is industriousness. So the question is, well, what can you do about your industriousness? And the answer to that is, well that's Kinda rough too because there's a strong genetic component, but you can work on micro habits with regards to your conscientiousness and I think the best micro habits. This is partly to do with this future authoring program processes. I think the best thing you can do with regards to your conscientiousness is to set up some aims for yourself. Goals that you actually value and the future authoring program helps people do that. And basically it does a situational analysis of it helps you do a situational analysis of your life more than a psychological analysis, I would say.

Speaker 3:          01:07:32       And so the questions are something like, well, alright, you're going to have to put some effort into your life and you need to be motivated to do that. And so what are the potential sources of motivation? You could think about them in the big five manner. If you're extroverted, you want friends, if you're agreeable, you want an intimate relationship. If you're disagreeable, you want to win competitions. If you're open, you want to engage in creative activity. If you're high in neuroticism, you want security. Okay? So those are all sources of potential motivation that you could draw on that you could tailor to your own, you know, your own personality. But then there are dimensions that you want to consider your life across. And so we asked people about, well, you know, if you could have your life the way you wanted it in three to five years, if you were taking care of yourself properly, what would you want from your friendships?

Speaker 3:          01:08:18       What would you want from your intimate relationship? How would you like to structure your family? What do you want for your career? Well, how are you going to use your time outside of your job and how are you going to regulate your mental, physical, mental, and physical health and maybe also your drug and alcohol use because that's a good place to auger down because alcoholism for example, wipes out five to 10 percent of people, so you want to keep that under control and then and then so maybe you know, you, you develop a vision of what your life, what you would like your life to be and that associates the. So the goal, once the goal is established and then you break down the goal into micro processes that you can implement, the microprocesses become rewarding in proportion in relation to their causal association with the goal and that tangles in your, your incentive reward system.

Speaker 3:          01:09:09       You know, we talked about the dopaminergic incentive reward system, but that's the thing that keeps you moving forward. And the way it works is that it works better if it produces positive emotion. When it can see you moving towards a valued goal, okay, well what's the implication of that? Better have a valued goal because otherwise you can't get any positive motivation working out. And so the more valuable the goal in principle, the more the microprocessor is associated with that goal start to take on a positive charge. And so what that means is while you get up in the morning and you're excited about today, you're ready to go. And so as far as I can tell, what you do is you specify your longterm ideal. Maybe you also specify a place you want to stay the hell away from so that you're terrified to fail as well as excited about succeeding because that's also useful.

Speaker 3:          01:09:56       You specify your goal. You do that. You do that in some sense as a unique individual. You want to. You want to specify goals that make you say, Oh, if that could happen as a consequence of my efforts, it would clearly be worthwhile. Because the question always is, why do something? Because doing nothing is easy. You just sit there and you don't do anything that's real easy. The question is why would you ever do anything? And the answer that has to be because you've determined by some means that it's worthwhile. And then the next question might be, well, where should you look for worthwhile things and one would be, well, you could consult your own temperament and the other would be while you kinda look at how, look at what it is that people accrue that's valuable across the lifespan. Look, look what? So you do a structural analysis of the subcomponents of human existence and already did that.

Speaker 3:          01:10:46       You need a family. You need friends, like you don't need to have all of these things, but you better have most of them. Family, friends, career, educational goals, plans for time outside of work, attention to your mental and physical health, etc. You know those are, that's what life is about. And if You don't have any of those things, well then all you've got left is misery and suffering. So that's a bad. That's a bad deal for you. So, so once you bought, once you set up that goal structure, let's say, and that's really in many in many ways, that's what you should be doing at universities. That's exactly what you should be doing is trying to figure out who it is that you're trying to be, right, and the aim at that and then use everything you learned as a means of building that person that you want to be.

Speaker 3:          01:11:34       And and I really mean want to be, I don't mean should be even those things, those things are going to overlap and it's important to distinguish between those because that's partly, and this is back down to the micro routine analysis. So I started saying, well, you're going to try to make yourself more industrious. Okay? Number one, specify your damn goals because how are you going to hit something if you don't know what it is that isn't going to happen. And often people won't specify their goals too because they don't like to specify conditions for failure. So if you keep yourself all vague and foggy, which is real easy because that's just a matter of not doing as well, then you don't know when you fail and people might say, well, I really don't want to know when I fail because that's painful, so I'll keep myself blind about when I fail.

Speaker 3:          01:12:14       ThAt's fine, except you'll fail all the time. Then you just won't know it until you failed so badly that you're done. And that can easily happen by the time you're 40. So. So I would recommend that you don't let that happen. So that's willful blindness, right? You could have known, but you chose not to. Okay. So once you get your goal structure set up, you think, okay, if I could have this life looks like that might be worth living despite the fact that it's going to be, you know, anxiety provoking and threatening, and there's gonna be some suffering and loss involved and all of that. Obviously the goal is to have a vision for your life such that all things considered that justifies your effort. Okay? So then what do you do? Well then then you turned down to the micro routines. It's like, okay, well this is what I'm aiming for.

Speaker 3:          01:13:00       How does that instantiate itself day to day, week to week, month to month, and that's where something like a schedule can be unbelievably useful. google calendar. It's like make a damn schedule and stick to it. Okay, so what's the rule with the schedule? It's not a bloody prison. That's the first thing that people do wrong. He said, well, I don't like to follow a schedule. And it's like, well, what kind of schedule are you setting up? Well I, I have to do this, then I have to do this, then I have to do this, you know? And then I just go play video games because who wants to do all these things that I have to do? It's like wrong. Set the damn schedule up so that you have the day you want. That's the trick. It's like, okay, I've got tomorrow. If I was going to set it up so it was the best possible day I could have practically speaking, what would it look like?

Speaker 3:          01:13:47       Well then you schedule that and obviously there's a bit of responsibility that's going to go along with that because if you have any sense, one of the things that you're going to insist upon is that at the end of the day, you're not in worse shape than you were then at the beginning of the day, right? Because that's a stupid day. If you have a bunch of thoSe in a row, you just dig, dig yourself a hole, and then you bury yourself in. It's like, sorry, that's just not a good strategy. It's a bad strategy. So maybe Twenty percent of your day has to be responsibility and obligation, or maybe it's more than that, depending on how far behind you are, but even that you can. You can ask yourself, okay, well I've got these responsibilities. I have to schedule the damn things in. What's the right ratio of responsibility to reward? And you can ask yourself that just like you'd negotiate with someone who is working for you.

Speaker 3:          01:14:33       It'S like, okay, you gotta work tomorrow. Okay, so I want you to work tomorrow. And you might say, okay, well what are you going to do for me that makes it likely that I'll work for you while you could ask yourself that, you know, maybe do an hour of of responsibility and then you play a video game for 15 minutes. I don't know, whatever turns your crank man, but you know, you have to negotiate with yourself and not tyrannized yourself like you're negotiating with someone that you care for that you would like to be productive and have a good life. And that's how you make the schedule. It's like. And then you look at the day and you think, well, if I had that day, that'd be good. Great. You know, and you, you're useless and horrible. So you'll probably only hit it with about 70 percent accuracy, but that beats the hell out of zero.

Speaker 3:          01:15:16       Right? And if you hit it even with 50 percent accuracy, another rule is well, aim for 51 percent the next week or 50 and a half percent for god's sake. Or because you're gonna hit that position where things start to loop back positively in spiral you upward. And so, so that's one way that you can work on your conscientiousness is a plan, a life you'd like to have, and and you do that partly by referring to social norms. That's more or less rescuing your father from the belly of the whale, but the other way you do that is by having a little conversation with yourself about as if you don't really know who you are, because you know what you're like. You won't do what you're told. You won't do what you tell yourself to do. You must have noticed that. It's like you're a bad employee and a worse boss and both of those work for you.

Speaker 3:          01:16:06       You don't know what you want to do. And then when you tell yourself what to do, you don't do it anyways. You should fire yourself and find someone else to beat. But, but my point is that you have to understand that you're not your own servant, so to speak. You're someone that you have to negotiate with and that's someone that you want to present the opportunity of having a good life too. And that's hard for people because they don't like themselves very much, so you know, they're always like cracking the whip and then procrastinating and cracking the whip and then procrastinating and it's like, god, it's so boring and such a pathetic way of spending your time. And you know what that's like because you probably waste like six hours a day. And I think we did an economic calculation about that a while back, right?

Speaker 3:          01:16:46       your time is probably worth 50 bucks an hour, something like that. I mean, you're not getting paid that now, but you're young. And so this is investment time and what you do now is going to multiply its effects in the future. So, so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour, which is perfectly reasonable. So if you waste six hours a day and you are, then you're wasting about $2,000 a week or about $100,000 a year. So like go ahead. That's what it's costing you every hour. And you need to know what your damn time is worth. So let's say it's not 50 bucks, it's 30, whatever, maybe it's a hundred, it's somewhere in that range. One of The things that you should be asking yourself is when you spend an hour was that, well, what have I paid someone 50 bucks to have had that hour? And if that answer is no, it's like, well maybe you should do something else with your time.

Speaker 3:          01:17:31       And it depends on whether or not you think that your time is worthwhile. But the funny thing about not assuming that is if you assume your time isn't worthwhile, what happens is you don't just sit around sort of randomly in a state of responsibility lists bliss. What you do is you suffer existentially and so that seems like a stupid solution. So okay. So anyways, as far as I can tell, that's how you can improve your conscientiousness. Hit an outline and goal that you actually would like to hit and even better, here's something else you can think about when you're negotiating in your life. You could say if you're going to pessimistic, you'd say, well, we have to negotiate an agreement. I'd like to walk away, not miserable and resentful. Okay, let's call that a baseline and that's how you're going to negotiate with your wife or your husband.

Speaker 3:          01:18:19       That's a good thing to know. You want to negotiate so that you don't walk away miserable and resentful because that makes you hostile and then you'll work to hurt them and I would say that's unless you want to hurt them and then of course they'll happily return the favor unless you. If you want to exist in a place where you're basically hitting each other in the head repeatedly for 30 years, you go right ahead, but I wouldn't say that that's a particularly good way of living. So you might say, well, the minimal precondition for a successful negotiation is that you don't walk away resentful and angry. And so that's also how you know when you have something to say to someone because the rule has to be. If you're going to walk away resentful and angry, you've got something to say. it doesn't mean you're right, by the way, but it does mean that you have something to say, but it's kind of a low bar.

Speaker 3:          01:19:05       You know, like if I wanted to live with you for 30 years, maybe we should say, how about we walk away from our mutual negotiations? Thrilled. Well why not? You know, you got to aim for something you could aim for that you want to negotiate with your boss for a new seller. You might think, okay, I've got this damn job. How much would I have to be paid, so I'd be so bloody excited to go to work. I could hardly stand it while you can at least know what that number is, and then you could go there and say, well look, you know, you like to have me around. I've been doing some thinking. I think if you paid me this amount of money, I'd be so thrilled to go to work that you could hardly even keep me away from here. And your boss might think, wow, I actually really liked to have someone around who would be so thrilled to work that I can't get rid of them.

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       It's like, maybe all, well, I can't give you all of that. I'll give you 75 percent. Maybe we can renegotiate it in a year, so like, hey, good deal, or you can be some weasley coward and go in there and snuggle about how awful your life is and walk away, barely able to tolerate the outcome of the. So like I wouldn't recommend that and it's funny because I've watched people do this repeatedly in my clinical practice because I do, we do. We plan all the time because the rule is you're going to come and see me. I'm going to try to help you figure out how to have the life that you want to have and we're going to think about that strategically. So you're making $50,000 a year right now. Maybe you should be making $150,000 in three years. And they think, well that couldn't happen.

Speaker 3:          01:20:34       It's like not with that attitude. That's the first thing. It's like, no, that's not going to happen if you, if you don't ask people for the damn money, if you don't look for a better job, but they're going to come along and just shovel a boat full of money at you. It's like, no, that's not going to happen, but why is that impossible? Look at you people in here. It's like, what the hell is wrong with you? Nothing. So you probably have what you want. If you could figure out whAt the hell it was and then you know, you diligently pursued it. So. and then maybe you wouldn't whIne about being alive. That'd be good because people who whine about being alive or dangerous to themselves and other people. So you might think I can have what I want, but you better well figure out what it is and you can't just wait for the like have what you want fairy to show up at your doorstep and granted because obviously that's not going to happen.

Speaker 3:          01:21:23       So. So. Okay. Conscientiousness, while we talked about how you could improve that social networking, that's another big deal. It's one of the advantages that older people have over younger people. And so for example, now that I'm in my fifties, roughly speaking, I know a bunch of other people who are relatively well positioned in the dominance hierarchy and they know all sorts of people. And so when I go to one of them and say, can you do x or do you know x? They say no, but I know someone who can. And that's a huge advantage. So another thing that you want to think about as you move through life and this is, is that use your ability to network properly. And that doesn't mean schmooze and it doesn't mean go out and impress people. That's all just complete bloody rubbish. It means you, you, you try to surround yourself with people who are competent in multiple different dimensions and you maintain your relationships with them.

Speaker 3:          01:22:11       And that's a trading relationship to right. It involves from reciprocity, but it's a huge advantage. A social network is a huge advantage and that's something extroverted people can be really good at because you know they have that sort of social ability and that goes along with the ability to sell. So another place that you can pick up power and power for the good, for the right things is to, is to consciously develop and maintain your social networks. And that also means, while, let's talk about friendships for a minute, here's how you know, if someone's, your friend a you can tell them bad news and they'll listen. They won't tell you why you know you're stupid and why that bad thing happened to you and how something worse happened to them once and you know, derailed the whole conversation. You can actually tell them bad news and they'll listen.

Speaker 3:          01:23:01       So that's a good thing. And then this is a weirder thing. You can tell them good news and they'll help you celebrate. And that's a really good way of deciding who you should have around you. Because if you have someone around you, you know some good habits you and you're kind of afraid to even admit it because you know god, something good happened to you. It's like you let that be known and it will certainly be taken away. So you know, you come out and you sort of tell someone halfheartedly that something good happened to you, they give you a whack and then talk about, you know, so the great thing that happened to them three years ago or worse, the great thing that happened to someone that they knew three years ago, you know, it's like go away from that person. They're not helpful to you and they're not helpful to themselves either.

Speaker 3:          01:23:42       And so you want to surround years, you've got to think about this. You've got to surround yourself with people who want the best for the best part of you. You can hang around with weasels and losers that are trying to pull you down to justify the fact that they're spiraling downhill as well. And you know, the upside of that is you don't have to have any responsibility, can whine about how wretched life is, you know, so that's pretty attractive. But I would say it's also a bad medium to longterm plan. And so it's, it's acceptable and desirable to try to surround yourself with people who were facilitating your development. You know when you might say, well, I've got people around, I know them well, you know they're, they're, they're not doing that well and they're and they don't fit into that category. It's like, what's your point?

Speaker 3:          01:24:29       What are you going to do with them? Exactly. If they'll, if they'll listen and cooperate with you and move towards a better future, great. if they don't pay any attention and they keep doing the same damn things over and over and they're not going anywhere and is painful, then maybe the proper thing to do is say, you just have your misery. I'll go off and have my life and maybe you'll wake up at some point in the future and think that's a better way of being because just putting up with it is while they call that enabling, right? You put up with that sort of behavior. You're providing tacit consent for it and even tacit approval. It's like bad idea. You have, I would say both the right and the responsibility to surround yourself with people who are good for the best part of you and that's not the same as you know.

Speaker 3:          01:25:16       Don't have to elaborate on that. You can figure out what that means. Skills, that's another thing you can do, and if you want to increase your probability of success every time you have an opportunity to take an opportunity that would provide you with a new skill. Do it right. Learn to program, learn to write, learn to read, read new things, learn to public speak. Learn how to introduce yourSelf to people. Learn how to socIal network, learn how to go talk to your boss in a matter. This is the right way to go. Talk to someone who's supervising you. I see this problem and here's the solution and so I'm coming to talk to you about the problem and the solution. It's like that person is going to want to talk to you a lot because the other people they're talking to, you are going to come and say, I've got a problem.

Speaker 3:          01:25:59       Can you do something about it? Like they don't want to do something about it. They already got things to do. You know? So if you're the person who constantly brings forth a problem, even if they're accurate problems, is why are they going? They're going to want to have you around. It's you're just, you're just another problem. Don't be a problem for the people who want to give you money. That's a good rule of thumb, man. You know, if someone wants to give you money, then help them do that. And if they want to give you status and success, then help them do that. right? And you do that in part by bringing them solutions and partly you do that by developing your skills. And so if things aren't going very well for you, this is also a good way of evaluating an opportunity. Should you take an opportunity.

Speaker 3:          01:26:40       Well, here's the rule, take the opportunity if it will teach you something that you can use for other opportunities because then even if it fails, which it probably will, doesn't matter because you've accrued something of value that you can bring forward to the next situation. So you know, there's this old union idea that I told you about the sharp cathedral, for example, the cathedral is made in the form of a cross and the cross signifies the center of the world and the dome signifies the sky and so right below the dome at the center of the world, and it's a cross because the cross is the place of suffering. So that's the center of the world because that's what you are, you're the place of suffering, right? You're the place of conscious suffering. That's the center Of the world. And so inscribed on the floor is a maze and you and it's a big maze and it's a mandela and, and there's a kind of a flower shaped resting place right in the center.

Speaker 3:          01:27:34       And what you're doing is walking in the maze and you walk all four quadrants and you get to the middle, which is where you want to be. You want to be in the middle. Well, how do you get there? You walk everywhere aNd what does that mean? It means every bloody time you're offered an opportunity, take it and develop your skills. And that's better than wealth by the way, in fact, it actually constitutes wealth because wealth constitutes what you have when someone takes all your money away, right? That's real wealth. And so the way that you build up that sort of wealth is you turn yourself into someone who's competent in multiple directions and you can be doing that all the time, right? Especially with the kind of technology that you people have access to. I mean, you can learn anything you want whenever you want. So what a good deal that is, man. And so there's, there's easy fruit hanging that you could pick and I would recommend that you do that.
