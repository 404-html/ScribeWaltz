Speaker 1:          00:00:00       There are coffees that have the drawings as well. Okay, so you should have 343 pages and how, how many drones are there? Susan, you have the many of drawings at the back of your book for four drawings living in the middle. Oh, oh yeah, those, that's different, right. We'll do the origin the way you might want to put those into the backs of your book because that's what you're supposed to be. Well that's good. That looks like everybody. So at 14 people, so that's a good stuff. Okay, so I'm going to lecture for awhile and then what you should have read today was the preface of the thing that you picked up from noman coffee and the first chapter which is called maps of experience.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       In terms of this book, you should be reading it now and also for the next class. We'll go over this in some detail too, so, so I'll start, if you have any questions, feel free to ask them. I'll try to leave at least half an hour up to hand open for general discussion and really like, you know, feel free to stop me at any point if what I'm saying doesn't make any sense or if you have some relevant associated issue. Okay. Now the first thing we have to figure out basically is what it is that we're talking about in this course. And uh, that's so we have to establish the domain of inquiry. That's basically the purpose of today's lecture. Um, the reason I got interested in this sort of thing as I mentioned to you last week was because I am interested in figuring out why people are motivated to commit acts of aggression. Really atrocious acts of aggression because that's the kind of I'm really interested in in defense of their, of their belief systems.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       Probably mast if you can pull in somewhere over there because they needed a closer with you. So if you guys could just cram together a bit, if you would, maybe we get a few more people in here. Okay. Now, once again, does everybody here have, is some of us okay? And does everybody have this book? Okay. Is there anybody that wants this book? Okay. All right. Hi Noman coffee. If you talked to the people that have a clue, they're binding it. People have been getting bound copies and if you don't get a phone call, tell them it's supposed to be filed. Okay. Cause you don't want to pack that thing around them about, yeah, I know they're doing the Mona order only basis now. Yeah. Although I ordered eight for the copies. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       Yeah. Well I didn't expect to get rid of 45 coffee. So did you get one that didn't have any high order? That's what they're doing now. No, I also teach it at the extension school. Oh, okay. Okay. So we're done with procedural issues theoretically. Okay. Okay. Well reverse myself here again. Okay. So what we're going to talk about today, let's start the story again. I got interested in what I'm going to teach you about cause I was interested in looking at motivation for social conflict. Maybe I can get you to shut the door so disturb the whole smaller Illinois with regards to the videotape. If you can ignore it, that would be best. There's no real purpose to it. I want the videotape. So it's not like you're going to be, your comments are going to be one of the children. Anyone tried to just know to worry about it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       Right when I started giving some consideration to the problem of motivation for social conflict. So I was interested in why people become rigid in their ideological identifications and their cultural identities. And I was interested in really why individuals do that. So I started to get interested in what role social identity plays in information processing, which is hence the title of this course, which is kind of wording and useless. But the thing is everyone knows that we have social identities and ideological identities. They're religious, their cultural, their intellectual, whatever. But nobody's really paid much attention to study how the representations of that cultural identity, uh, alter the manner in which we, we feel emotion, which perceive and by which we act. I'm interested in how our internal representations of our culture modulator or emotional expression, that's the best way to point and say you know, your brain basically is programmed as you're socialized.

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       That's what socialization is for and obviously it's socialization that instills cultural identity and equally obviously the process of socialization that leads to cultural identity must have some impact on the way you think and obviously leave that on the way that your mind functions and the way that your brain functions and see North American neuropsychologists have been loath to give any consideration to this sort of notion to think that cultural transformations might have some direct impact on physiological function by the time the Russians. By contrast, this has been a central tenant of their nurses neuropsychological theories basically since since day one. This is particularly true with regards to Alexander Luria and uh, uh, what's his name, the gods scheme. Now you can think about this, it's quite obvious if you think about it for a second with regards to something like the, the capacity to read silently. Now here's the case that, well this is a relatively new talent.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       I mean literacy is a new talent, right? Most people weren't able to read 500 years ago. It's only been 500 years and only for a little bit of that, that the capacity to read has been widespread and the capacity to read silently is a relatively new development in human history. Now. It's a cute your thing if you think about it, that nonetheless, the capacity to read silently localizes to a specific part of the brain, which is to say it's as if you have a part of the brain that's evolved for that purpose. It's the same place and everybody more or less their individual variations. There are differences when people are lateralized differently, but all that aside, if you learn to read, there's a part of your brain that specializes for that and it's pretty much the same place in every way and it wasn't there or wasn't doing that sort of activity 2000 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       In fact, I read at one point, I don't know where the reference to this is like so many things that I make reference to, but I've had at one point that people thought Julius Caesar was a magician in part. I mean he was obviously a remarkable person, but in part because he can read silently, he didn't have to read a loud, so it wasn't just reading. That was remarkable. It was being able to read without talking. Anyways, the point of all of this is that your brain, this is [inaudible] view of the brain fundamentally is your brain is an organ that produces sub organs, culturally specific subordinates, not it's that's it's remarkable capacity is that it can generate new molecules that are specialized for certain tasks as a consequence of environmental programming. This is an interesting sort of notion, which is to say that at some level of physiological there analysis, at least your culture determines how your brain works.

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       Now it's very classic. You know, your brain is very plastic. When you were a child. You can sustain immense amount of cortical damage in childhood and still grow up normally. For example, if you're a very, very epileptic as a child, sometimes what surgeons will do is take out a whole hemisphere, the whole right hemisphere gone. And children who have hemisphere activities, if they're done young enough, still grow up to be relatively normal, quite normal. In fact. And there are other cases too where people are hydrocephalic, which basically means that they're ventricles don't vamped properly. Um, and cerebral spinal fluid builds up in the sculpt. So these people often have stalls that are slightly larger than normal, not necessarily obvious, but what steel case. And they end up with a skull. It's essentially full of liquid with a very, very thin layer of brain tissue around this, this all of liquid.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       And, uh, there are a number of case reports of people who have like 5% of the aquatic and tissue intact who have high functioning intelligence, his normal personality. So the point is, you're, especially the higher cortical levels of your writing are very, very functionally flexible. We can childhood now by the time you're an adult, you know, the pattern changes a little bit done, kind of looks like your brain dies into it's adult configuration. That's an interesting we look at, which is to say you have way more neurons that you need, especially right before you're born. And a environment prunes your brain down to its adult configuration. So although of course you develop connections as well, but you lose a lot of neurons. So, uh, and by the time you're an adult, you're brain is nowhere near as flexible as it was when you were a child.

Speaker 1:          00:10:45       And if you sustain damage to certain parts of your brain that are already specialized, well and you know, then you have the damage and you can work around all that, but it can still be really prominent question. So that's sort of the market and it's, yeah, that's right. That's the department because it is the rent adapts, whereas the body, yeah, that's a great comment. You know, and if you start thinking about that, it has really revolutionary implication. So you can say, for example, if I have an idea that's really radical and saying in a sense that changes the configuration of my Cortex, I can transmit that maybe not to you. Maybe your brain is already fixed, so to speak, put down the generations and alter the structure of brains, hand spores. So you could say, well, ideas can spread through a population that way. That's a lamarche and sprint.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       But even more interestingly, I think this is speculative of course, but let's say that Tom, there are certain types of revolutions in thought that are actually the consequences of biological mutations. So you could see that, well, you're a particularly odd sort of person from the genetic perspective and as a consequence you think in a very, very unique manner. But the thing that's so interesting is that if you can still communicate those thoughts, then the effect of that genetic mutation can be transmitted throughout the population without any biological alteration at the genetic level at all. So that's, that's really something, something that's interesting because it means that the consequences of genetic mutations on combination can spread through a population as fast as communication can move. So that's, yeah, the Lamarckian does it, everybody know what Lamar can transmission is? Well, Lamarck was the character who thought that the reason that that you could, you could transmit acquired characteristics.

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       So the reason drafts that long the x is because it kept trying to stretch their net is basically, uh, so, and they transmitted the capacity to do the stretching to their offspring. So you can transmit acquired characteristics down the genetic line and there's no, you can't do that, that's wrong. But that's what Lamar thought. But he wasn't completely wrong because there is, that is how this sort of transmission works. It's non genetically mediated cumulation of biological resources. So that's very interesting. So, you know, that's a good comment. Okay. Anyways, so, uh, that's kind of, that's, that's some of the background of why I'm interested in, in the neuropsychology of culture. And if you're interested in that sort of thing, you want to read the golf ski and you want to read Luria. Um, because the Russians are really interested in the effect of culture on cognition and the regulation of emotion on as far as I'm concerned, like for a long time they were five decades of hand of North American Europe in terms of exploring this sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:13:22       I'm not exactly sure why that is, but that is the case. So, okay. Well the first thing that I started to started to realize I guess, and this, this is sort of an emergent realization. It wasn't something that happened early on when I was trying to develop these ideas. It became a way of making them clearer. I started giving some consideration, I guess to the old philosophical distinction between facts and values, no values, and you could say value. That's kind of it in the domain of what should be and uh, or ethics and a fat. Well that's kind of in the domain of what actually is or what, or what was more, what could be, you know, taking the past, present and future consideration as long be known in philosophical circles that you can make any, you can't draw any conclusions about what should be, what ought to be from an analysis of what is, which is to say you can't derive an ought from an nice, and there's some sort of divide there and you can sort of think of have this.

Speaker 1:          00:14:38       Um, just knowing the particulars of the situation doesn't mean that you know how to act there. And I think that's really where the division takes place, which is to say that come out with a description of the characteristics of a place. Like let's say you were from a lower working class family and you buy some Miss Fortune. You have to go to La, a Tuxedo ball where there'll be nothing but rich people. You don't really know how to act. You know, you can describe the circumstances, you basically know what it is that you're going to encounter. But that doesn't tell you anything at all about how it is that you should conduct yourself. And the other thing that's kind of interesting about that is that how you should conduct yourself. And this ties in directly to what we're going to talk about today's game. You want to or what goal you want to pursue.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       You know, so you have to decide that a priority. If you're going to go to this party, you can say, well I don't like people like that anyways. They're all capitalists exploiters and they deserve my contempt. And so I'll go there and act miserably and make everyone just like, and that would be perfectly fine. And that's an, that's an odd as far as you're concerned, that's some moral injunction and if you accept that line of reasoning, you're going to act one way. And if your other line of reasoning as well, maybe I have something to learn in this situation, I'll just shut up and watch. Then what towards the tubes, the Ot under those circumstances to something completely different. So you know you can switch around. What the should be is by determining where it is that you want to go. That's obviously not something you could do with Fox, like whether you want to be liked or whether you want to be hostile. It's nothing to do with like be the objective aspects of the situation. So yeah, there's a real, so that's a, that's a problem. So that's sort of the background. So let's go into this.

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       No,

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       we all know that people have belief systems, but we don't really know as far as I can tell what that means. It's like Kevin belief system.

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       This analysis sort of suggest that there isn't such thing is there, there's no such thing as they belief system is at the very minimum, my belief system is composed of two elements, which is your description of how the world is from the factual perspective and also your description of how the world should be. Or You could say your interpretation of the reality of phenomena. It also your interpretation of how you should act with regards to those phenomena. So at the very least when you're talking about beliefs, you're talking about something that has to constituent elements always be known for a long time. Now it strikes me that there's a real, there's an analogous division in human cognition between fact and value that you wait, describe that as the division between science. Math.

Speaker 2:          00:17:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       We don't really fight with people over what things are from the scientific perspective. I think in part because

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       unless you're, I emotionally identified with your particular, which basically means unless you're, you imbued your theory with dreams of career for example, or dreams of prestige or whatever, why don't you scientific theories pretty much as good as the next, which is to say that from the scientific perspective, all facts are equivalent. They don't have any intrinsic emotional significance. You're supposed to be objective with regards to your description of the world. We don't really have to fight about what the world is. From a scientific perspective. It's partly because there's not so much emotion involved in it. All that happens sometimes that's more of a contamination. Then something central to the scientific enterprise. People are always trying to get rid of that. You don't mess around with your data to make it turn out the way you want it to because the way you want things to turn out has nothing to do with the scientific enterprise, at least in part.

Speaker 1:          00:18:35       The other thing is from the scientific perspective is we have a method of solving arguments in the scientific world. Sorry, you can put whatever you're competing. Hypotheses are about the nature of things to a task and in a sense if you can't do that, what you're talking about is probably not scientific at all or that's what funding at the very least. So first of all, there's not a lot of emotion and tangled into scientific viewpoint. You, second of all, if there is a problem, a dispute, we have a very, very formalized mechanism for working it out and people are usually willing to abide by that because well, it works. It's, it's demonstrated its utility from the pragmatic perspective. Plus it's comprehensible. You can outline all the rules. I mean, we really have a strategy for that. You don't even have to be very bright to scientists. All you have to do is be very thorough and follow the rules. This is a making explicit, the scientific procedure that happened about 500 years ago there boats, we know how to, we know how to come up with a description of the world from the sensory perspective that everyone can agree with them.

Speaker 2:          00:19:36       We're less okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       That isn't what we fight with people.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       What's important to us is not what things are so much as what they mean and so then the question is, well in a sense what does meaning me? And that's much the same as asking what is an emotion or what is a motivational state or what does it drive state. These things of what we have proved very difficult to nail down in the past. What's the meaning of meaning but well aren't going to give you a provisional definition. And that is the meeting of something has its implication for behavior. And I mean that literally and behavior is the act of propelling your body through space. That's at least one dimension of meeting.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       There are more profound levels of meaning. You could also say that something is meaningful. If it has implications for the Schema that you use to generate behaviors, that's a more profound piece of information. Something that's more profoundly meaningful cause then a phenomenon and event that occurs can change your reaction to hold classes of the fans. That's a really been phenomenal, but we are not going to discuss that so much today. We'll just stick with the simple definition meeting, which is implication for behavior and, well, I'll give an example in the chapter that you were to read today about a girl little girl, three years old or whatever she is exploring her environment. We tend to think that when someone's exploring their environment, what they're trying to do is map the sensory properties of that which surrounds them and that's how we think. So the girl in the example I use, well what she's wandering around touching things and poking about using all the exploratory tools that she hasn't heard disposal, some of which she thinks up and some of what she coffees and she approaches a an antique table and on top of the table and there was a very fragile green glass antique vase and she reaches up to touch it in the course of her exploratory activity and your mother immediately shrieked no, don't touch that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       Comes over and grabs her hand, pulls it back six zero nine and it says that's not something for you to touch. Why don't you see the girl has just discovered something about what that thing is from the motivational perspective, which is to say, well you can view that object is something that has sensory properties, but you can also view it as something that has motivational significance. Then the motivational significance in this case for that child is ambivalent because the thing is interesting, it's green and it's shining. The draws, the explorer Tory candidates candidacy out of the, that she wants to approach it, but it's also something that's linked with punishment. So that's an ambivalent phenomenon. Much of what we do when we map our environments is map them for motivational significance. No, because we're so good at being scientists or we have become so good at being scientist for the last 500 years or so.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       We tend to think that when we mapped the environment, what we're mapping it, four is it sensory properties, but as far as I can, first of all, you think about it, animals are not scientists, so whatever they're doing is not a can decide. It's accepted, it's more primitive and it's more permanent form. Whenever animals are doing is more like whenever it was that we were doing before we became sides. So you could say, well, what was that we were doing whenever that was 150,000 years ago or 250,000 years ago, we still managed to Mac the environments because we can live in, I mean obviously we're all still here, so our relatives were pretty good at our ancestors were pretty good at doing that. We weren't doing it from the scientific perspective. We are doing something else. What we were doing is mapping the environment for implications for behavior.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       You see it when you really want to think about this good and heart because if you think about it, it's, it'll start changing the way you view the world because it answers some strange questions that are otherwise difficult answers. Like why do you stop asking questions about, you know, from the scientific perspective that you're surrounded by a certified of mysteries. There's nothing you comprehend. Absolutely. In your field of experience, there's more questions about the factual nature of things wherever you look, but sometimes you ask questions and sometimes you don't know what is it that stops us in any given circumstance. You can't answer that. If you start thinking about how it is that people think scientifically, you can only answer it if you start thinking about how does that people think from the motivational perspective because I can tell you that you'll stop asking questions.

Speaker 1:          00:24:02       Say about like I don't know any of you very well, at least at the moment. The fact that I don't know what you're very well isn't compelling me to do a tremendous amount of exploration because I know you well enough so that I can predict your behavior in this circumstance, which is to say that I have a very detailed vision in my mind of where this next two hours is going to go in terms of the whole two hour period in every sort of sub temporal aspect of that down to the immediate present. And as long as none of you violate my preset positions, I don't have to ask any questions about you cause I've taught you math and likewise for me, as long as things go according to your predictions, you know the world and the thing you're trying to predict is the, the effect that your behavior has on phenomena.

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       In terms of motivation. So anyways, so you can just sort of keep that in mind. So look, as far as I'm concerned, we think two different ways. One way is being formalized and that's the scientific way, but the scientific enterprise is, is the attempt to come up with an accurate description of the sensory properties of phenomena in so far as those are collectively apprehensible. But just to say that we want to know what things are from the sensory perspective and we engage in a communicate an exercise to determine that. Because if I want to figure out what this is from the scientific perspective is much more effective. If I could have a thousand people working on it all at once and we're all communicating our knowledge and we can build out a very detailed picture of the thing. But the only reason we want to do that so that we can track the motivational significance of things more accurate to say once again, why does an animal care if something is green rather than red?

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       Well, it may be because being able to discriminate colors. Finally we're finally means more accurate mapping of the motivational, motivational relevance. Just to say that if you can only see in black and white for example, if something that's the same hue red is poisoning as something edible green, well you've had it cause you can't distinguish them. If you can want to see black and white know if you can see color, which means you can make a finer level of sensory discrimination. You can keep better track of where the good things are, where the bad things are and as far as I'm concerned, that's really why we do science. In the final analysis when you get like, cause you've got to ask what's the motivation for doing all these kinds of things and looking at the fruit flies, et Cetera, et cetera. We want to keep track of where the motivational significance is up. Things are and we can do that better by making finer and finer discriminations between things because then we could say, well this thing is that and this thing is that and it's useful to be able to do that. What I don't understand the difference between interest and value. When a cat made me value the food days batty, that is not necessarily interested it. Um, but still he places value on it. So I don't understand the word how that works out.

Speaker 1:          00:26:50       Well things we are interested in, things that have value. So I don't think that I value having interests. So is normally don't think about food is that it's interesting if you're a food deprived and it's not if you're not. So it depends on your, it depends on your current state of interpretation. So you can never identify anything is having interest as an, an intrinsic aspect of that thing. That's something we'll cover in more detail too. But if something is valuable to you, your interest in the weather, the valence is positive or negative so that interests can fluctuate. I mean you, and when you ask a question like that too, you want to make sure that you discriminated in your own mind. The difference between the two terms that you're using. So there's obviously some overlap between interest and value. It strikes me that probably what you're referring to is that um, the things that have no specify biological significance but that are unpredictable are interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:27:51       Something like food is valuable. So you might be able to say that the interest is the more general phenomena of value before it's being discriminated into its sub components. Okay. Cause if something unexpected happens, it attracts your interest, which means that you value it but you have no determination of the value of yet. You can only say here is something that I didn't predict and then the purpose of exploration is to is to put it into the appropriate boxes or something that you want to, you want to give some consideration to cause that's like in a sense that's one of the most fundamental things that I want you to to to learn is that when we classify things using exploration, we're not attributing meaning to something that has a neutral background. We're taking something that has a very broad range of nonspecific meaning and restricting it to something specific.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       So, for example, we'll make it more cooperative and take a wrap by the tail and you drop them into a new cage. Interest is everywhere. It's not one specific. The racks going to sit there like this. First of all it's going to be paralyzed because it doesn't move like it's motor systems are inhibited by its anxiety system. It is not moving. And the reason it's not moving, well the rab doesn't know this but this is what we would presume the reason it's not moving is because in novel territory there may be a Predator and if you don't move and predators can't see it, so the route of sits there like this and maybe it'll sniff a little bit cause that doesn't draw any attention to itself. And if nothing happens that kills it slowly it starts to unwind a little bit. And then it's the systems, the bda curiosity, which are the incentive reward systems technically start driving the route around and the rattle explorer and what it's trying to do is reduce the nonspecific value of the novel environment to something specified, which, which you could say in a sense.

Speaker 1:          00:29:31       Is there anything here that will hurt me? So it's looking for punishment. It's actually looking to avoid them. But once they know where the hell they are, is there anything here that will make me anxious, which is to say is there anything here that signifies that the punishment is likely? Is there anything here that I can eat or they will otherwise satisfy? What am I consuming Tory requirements or is there anything here that will signify the presence of something that will satisfy by conservatory reprivatise those are four categories. Punishment, satisfaction, right. And hope basically. And what the route is trying to do is to restrict the indeterminate significance of the normal circumstance to a discriminant category. Which is to say it wants to know exactly where all the things that have determined value are located. Mostly it's going to map nothing cause that's the alternative.

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       Calculates no relevance. And most of the things around you, our map into that box. Like you'd think, well your reactions in this room, most of the phenomena in this room or not attracting your attention. And I mean you can, you can divert your attention to them. But you like those things, those are irrelevant. You know how had I not pointed them out? Perhaps you'd remember they were there and perhaps what they signify. Nothing from the motivational perspective so you've mapped them is irrelevant in most of the things you map are mapped as irrelevant. That is now they start with no started out as novel. That's the fundamental, that's the old position and does the historical progression guess

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       say for the sake of argument, the scientific method was establish more last 500 years ago. Say, well it was at that point where are our mythological models of reality and our scientific split. Now I'm going to ask you to swallow a presupposition for the time being and that presupposition is that town. It'll take me a while to explain the logic behind it. Look, you know how you get scientific information. It's basically talk to you explicitly and you can read experiments and you read theories and so on are the explicit education, but how you pick up knowledge of how to act well, that's not quite as explicit. It's not as easy to figure out. I mean, obviously you model, we know that children pick up a lot of inflammation by modeling behavior, which is basic English is a big coffee adults, and that basically means they watch adults act, move their bodies who space and they duplicate those patterns of action any generalized from, so that's one way behavioral wisdom transmitting.

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       Some of it's explicit as well, at least in terms of the receipt of rewards and punishments, because parents will modulate their children's behavior by engaging in motivationally significant interactions with them. At least that's what you should do if you're a parent. That's your primary responsibility in a sense. So that's what we mean when we say that you're paying attention to someone. It basically means that you're modulating their behavior with your behavior, with your emotions. So fuck a child will monitor, our parent will monitor his child and react positively when something that the parent wants to happen happens and native glee. When something happens that the parent doesn't want to happen. So the child's behaviors, well that's just the classical reinforcement theory. Basically you exchange rewards and punishments and threats and promises and more human behavior. We do that all the time. And your interpersonal interactions, that's part of the reason why people with personality disorders can sort of have an uncanny effect on which is to say if your personality disorder, do you have a really potent expectation about how someone else will behave?

Speaker 1:          00:33:39       Usually like a son of a bitch? Fundamentally. And if someone with a personality disorder encounter someone who doesn't back like that and they're a challenge to their belief system and even with personality disorders are extremely good at turning. Everyone may meet into the same person that they already met and they do that I think by exchanging very, very subtle and covert reinforcements, which is to say, you're engaged with me. I have a personality disorder. Every time you act properly I'll ignore you or say something contemptuous or look away or do something quite saddled. And every time you act like a miserable bastard, which is what I expect all, at least pay some attention and possibly even reinforce you covertly. And you'll find if you get close to me, that you, it's almost like you've been distorted by a gravitational field. As your behavior starts getting pulled in strange directions.

Speaker 1:          00:34:24       We do that to each other all the time, and one of the things you might consider it as well, our societies are very large. We're all engaged in these patterns of mutually modifying interactions and something emerges from that. The stable, and I guess I would say that the things I'm going to teach you about mythologies are the things that I do as stable, emergent properties from risk, from centuries of reciprocal interaction. So if we're engaged in some pursuit, you're going to modify me and I'm going to modify you, and neither of us really know precisely what that means because we're not conscious of all the reasons that we do everything and have to spend. I mean, it's bad enough if there's only two of us, but if there's like 50 of us, well then you can imagine that calculating all the permutations of the interactions becomes virtually impossible.

Speaker 1:          00:35:11       The point is we will settle into some sort of stable configuration or important or will disappear. Those are the options and a human societies do so settle into stable configurations and we don't really understand how that happens, but we, we have developed the ability to describe those configurations without understanding and, and I think that makes up a big part of mythology. So miss are the stories we tell ourselves how we behave when we don't know how it is that we behave or even why. So when a file that when you know things to consider in the future,

Speaker 1:          00:36:00       let's go back. Good. Was there some connection between what you, the distinction you were just making him the declarative declarative memory that just talks about yeah, absolutely. Yeah. We'll discuss. We'll discuss that in some detail. I think the is, so you have these three separate memory systems. One of them's knowing non declarative, which basically it's nonrepresentational ducks, the procedural system, procedural memory governance, your motor output. If it's habitual under an employee. That's right. You use your procedural memory to walk with because walking is way too complicated to do as a consequence of representation. It's like it's such a complex. While you can't think about how to walk. It's a habit. It's a skill. It's like if you play the piano, if you know a piece off by heart, as soon as you think about it while your fingers stumble over themselves because it's too complicated to think about.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       You can't handle all that information in your interactive conscious. Anyways. We've coded a lot of behavioral information in our procedural systems. It's not, it's not declarative. It's not representation. It's there. Well, I think part of what a story is is it is the representation of the patterns of behavior that are coded in a procedural systems. So you see when we're engaged in any sort of interaction, you and I are both modifying the contents of our procedural memory systems by exchanging to put it very harshly by exchanging reinforcements. We do not understand the nature of the pattern. That's the outcome of that exchange. But we can watch it and that's what the story is. It's our, I think, I think that's our, our episodic memory system that kicks up images basically cause we'll get it back. Your right hemisphere is good at recognizing patterns, you know, and your behaviors.

Speaker 1:          00:37:36       Behaviors have patterns obviously. That's why you can predict behaviors. One of the ways that we make those patens explicit is by making images of them and then describing, and that's basically my story and we, you get a story. Basically what you're doing is you're using words, activate images of behaviors. You're trying to, you're trying to instill behavioral patterns by doing that anyways. You don't understand the story. That's all BS. There's lots of stories we tell our kids that we have a little foggy snowstorms. Fairy Tales would like that. Very peculiar stories, but the kids are interested in them and they'll listen to them over and over and over. And that's because there's a lot of information in those stories like that or than you can possibly imagine all embedded in those stories. And the person who's listening to it doesn't understand it and the person was telling it doesn't understand it, but the inflammation is still transmitted.

Speaker 1:          00:38:30       So, which is very peculiar. It's very strange. So I started thinking about that because was very, well when I started understanding that religious systems of thought actually had some meaning, that they, that the stories they were telling were accurate. Then I couldn't figure out, well, if they are accurate, how the hell did they develop? If no one understands what they mean, if which is impossible, right? It's like how do you develop a system of thought in the absence of any understanding of what the system means? Well, that seems like a complete with insulin and with our problem, it's like, well, you, it's, you don't point about something similar with dream to set up a dream will sometimes give you a premonition of a future state and he didn't mean that you could interpret the future by reading your dreams. He meant that the thing that you will become is in, in a sense, operative now it's in its nascent form and on that nascent form has more to do with dream structure and imagination.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       And it does with anything explicit. If you can interpret your dream, sometimes you can see where it is that you're headed. And again, it was the same mystery. How is it that your brain can know where you're going to be when you can't even understand what that means? But that's why there's multiple memory systems. Theory is really useful because you can say, well, look at social animals, for example. Like a wolf obviously does not have a declarative representation of the nature of its social structure. You know, it knows who's white on the dominance hierarchy and knows how to behave, but it can't describe it's patterns of behavior. They're not conscious, meaning they're not representational, they're not declared, but they're still there and they're there because they've been selected for, from the Darwinian perspective. It's like these patterns of interaction. There's certain patterns of social interaction.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       They're stable over time. They emerge as a consequence of a social interactions. And they emerge way before the groups that have the patterns, understand what the patterns are and are. Our attempts to spin stories are descriptions of those patterns of action before we understand what they are giving. Another example of that same, uh, people have said that everything in Freud is in Shakespeare. But the thing about about Shakespeare is that nothing in Shakespeare's explicit, it's still all story, right? He was great spinner of drama, all Shakespeare's plays, plays, which was a reference to behavior. All Shakespeare's plays are images of patterns of action. You can say what Freud did in so far as you grant, he's theorizing Craig's is make an image of a pattern of behavior, explicit representation from the perspective of some manner from perspective of words. Well, same with maths. I mean we miss her full of wisdom about behavior, but it hasn't yet been made explicit.

Speaker 1:          00:41:05       And now the problem with us of course, is that we think we know our hands are full of a lot of bizarre nonsense and that makes it very difficult for us to figure out what it me. And that brings me back to this. This is where I'm telling you this whole story. It's 500 years ago, the scientific methodology was four formalized when we found out very rapidly. Let me read you something from you. He's talking about the typical attitude that commit evil individuals. So this is the Orthodox Christian media evil individual. And you have to realize that hundred years ago, the in Europe site, although there might've been sectarian differences within the Christian community, in most cases you are Christian. Not because that's what you believe, but because the world that you lived in, was it Christian world? It wasn't like you had 15 different belief systems, all of which were equally coherent to sort of choose between.

Speaker 1:          00:41:51       It was that the world you inhabit, it was Christian. That was the explanation of the universe. So anyways, young said, you know, it isn't till culture start mixing. For example, you can't take like a Muslim if you're a Christian, unless you've met one. And if they're not around, well the issue doesn't even come up. So anyways, you can see how totally different than the world appear to medieval man. For him, the Earth was eternally fixed and that rest in the center of the universe and circled by the course of a son. That's statistically, there's stone, it's more men. We're all children of God under the loving care of the most high, who prepared them for an eternal blessedness, and they all knew exactly what they should do and how they should conduct themselves in order to rise from a corruptible world.

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       Do an incorruptible and joyous existence, such a life no longer seems real to us. Even in our dreams. Natural sciences long ago torn this lovely veil to shreds. Well, at least you know at the, from a fundamental perspective, we know perfectly well that the earth was not the center of the cosmos, at least not in the way that it was procedure from the medieval perspective, and it was very, very rapidly after the scientific methodology became formulated. Scientists, we're generating observations like mad that seemed to exist in direct conflict with the most fundamental statements of religious systems. That's fine. For example, the fact that the sun was at the center of the will of the universe originally, but I mean, we don't even believe that anymore. It's just some, you know, semio obscure star, not all that particularly powerful, often some backwater corner of one galaxy among hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe that's so big that you can't even comprehend.

Speaker 1:          00:43:30       So I mean that's a different picture. And of course the logical conclusion to Joe, the to say the so same sort of thing happened to Galileo. The heavens were supposed to be perfect from the medieval perspective and we never plan. It was supposed to, supposed to have a perfectly circular orbit even because of the circle was the most perfect of figures and the moon was supposed to be something that was completely without blemish. Since it was part of the heavenly order. Galileo with his telescope showed that there were mountains on the moon and praise that he attempted to demonstrate this to. We need to look through the telescope because for there, for reasons that we're going to discuss that this course continues. But the point is, is that very rapidly after the formalization of the scientific methodology, our ability to regard mythic descriptions of the world as valid was essentially destroyed.

Speaker 1:          00:44:16       Well, I think this is, I mean, I would like you to think about this and see if there's anything wrong with the explanation because it seems so simple that it's observed. But I think we made a big mistake of logic somewhere along way because we made the presupposition that what we were doing when we were doing science with the same thing that we were doing when we were doing religion, which is to say that what religion was, was an attempt to describe the world in the same terms or are, are, uh, tending to the same phenomenon that we attend to when we're doing science. So then we have the general attitude that, well, what religion was at bask was sort of a, uh, a science with an abysmally poor methodology based on, you know, erratic and unpredictable and biased stuff. Uh, observations. There were all designed to produce a given an all the religious people seem, you seem to have a sort of swollen that more or less whole as far as I can tell too, because obviously these are generalizations and neurosurgeon exceptions, but people still seem to believe that whatever it was that religious religion is doing is the same thing that science is doing.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       It's just, it's like a different viewpoint in the same plane. So you get these weird arguments say between fundamentalist Christians and evolutionary biologists, they're talking about different worlds and they don't know on either side, you know, so that I want to tell you at least in part what the nature of the world that the miss described is and how it differs from the scientific world. And the basic premise of this is that why medstar concerned about is the world that you act the act. That's what he's trying to describes. So miffed tells you, well, here's how human experience is structured with regards to how you should act. It's not that big a surprise. And you know, religion is concerned with morality and morality is the study of how the APP, so it doesn't seem like such a major leap in some regards, but it seems peculiar that people couldn't have figured out on a general like in a general sense that what religions were doing and what science we're doing where we're not really convince her they weren't in the same domain.

Speaker 1:          00:46:23       Science is concerned with facts and religion. Stories are concerned to value and you know a story has a moral right. That's what you're supposed to derive from the story. You take primitive stories like aesop's fables, the is made explicit at the end here, here's the characters and acting out their roles and here's the behavioral information you're supposed to derive from that. Analyze the story for the moral. The moral is in the light of the behavior which you just received. How it is that, how is it that you should adjust your ongoing behavior? That's the kind of information that stories have. Stories provide you with information about how to act, which is the information about the motivational significance of things and situations. And when you have a story, a good story about a given situation, you know how to ask and knowing how to act inhibits your anxiety because knowing how to act means that we need to do something.

Speaker 1:          00:47:09       You can predict outcome and as long as there are predictable outcomes all around you, then you know, anxious. It's knowing how to act and inhibits your anxiety. So I would say, well then it's not much of the presupposition that it's stories that inhibits your anxiety. The fact that none of us are made anxious by any of the other people in this room is fundamentally because you share the same stories. So we act in a predictable way. So when you mess with someone's story, you're messing up the structure they use to attribute determinant significance to objects and situations. And you can mess with someone's story nearly by behaving in your own peculiarly, culturally determined way. If you haven't to be among foreigners, you don't have to say anything. Oh, the words sufficient are perhaps even more potent than behaviors, but just your mere existence poses a certain amount of threat.

Speaker 1:          00:48:04       Okay. Anyways, Nietzsche, he observes something similar to what I'm telling you. About a hundred years ago we said, you know what, I'm [inaudible], if you think about it, that we've worked, we've like pouring the intellectual foundations out of Christianity using science, but we all run around acting like Christians more or less. This is his employment. He started about Europeans here a hundred years. So this is peculiar. No, you might debate, can think to yourself, well, I don't act like a Christian or whatever it is that your particular religious background has to me. But of course that's really quite ridiculous because you did not advance all your behaviors. In fact, you probably imagined almost none of them, most of them are copied their coffee from your parents or from other people that you matter, you know, from significant others throughout your whole life, from, from books he read, from movies you've watched and so on and so forth. In so far as you are inculturated, your behaviors are not your only advantage. And that's the whole purpose of college. He had to invent every one of your behaviors. Well, you'd never get anywhere. So you coffee behaviors that have been accumulated by humanity over large periods of time. So whether you think you have a religious based morality, you're not. It's really knowing the issue because what you do,

Speaker 2:          00:49:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       Human human society as being religious for like veering or nearing the hundred percent of its entire developmental history. You don't shake that in 500 years. I mean really religions to boldly be explicitly tumbling down the cents per hundred years with the rise of big ideological systems to replace. All right? As far as I'm concerned, the system like communism or any authoritarian system mass just get replaced with religion. Anyways, Nisha said when one gives up Christian belief, for example, one thereby deprives oneself with the right to Christian morality. Christianity's the system consistently thought out and complete view of things. If one breaks out of been a fundamental idea like the belief in God, for example, on their by breaks the whole thing to pieces. What is nothing of any consequence left in one's hands. Christianity presupposes the man does not know and cannot know what is good for him, what evil he believes in God.

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       God alone knows Christian morality is a command. It's the region is transcendental. Beyond all criticism at all, right to criticize or possess as truth or we have got is truth. It stands or falls with the belief in God. If modern westerners really do believe they know of their own accord, intuitively what is good and evil if they consequently take, they no longer have need of Christianity has a guarantee morality. That is merely the consequence of the ascendancy of Christian evaluation and an expression of the strength and depth of this ascendancy so that the origin of modern morality has been forgotten and the highly conditional nature of its way to exist, no longer felt on Nietzsche is basically saying is that the fact that you might think that you can have a morality without a, that we're talking about crystal morality in this particular circumstance, but it can be any morality is derive from a system that was predicated on the notion that there was some transcendental Va. The fact that you can think that you have a morality that will last without that belief is proof of how potent that belief system is actually means.

Speaker 1:          00:51:36       It has worked so well and protects you still so well

Speaker 1:          00:51:43       that you can be incarcerate Lee convinced of its lack of necessity. Uh, I noticed in your footnote on that and hear that you said you had originally said been English. Yeah. Um, what's he, I mean I know this, I know this applies for up to a character of belief systems in general, but if he was referring to wasn't or, or what's he to the sort of moral realist philosophers. Yeah. To beat that English tradition, which I think was about the same time. Yeah. He was irritated by attempts to, to argue that we're already have a rational basis and it was in fact derived as a consequences of rational thought and you're going to see it. It's right there. And then normally that normally that you can see it and that it's right there. But that's how it was originally derived, which is to say that reasonable people got together and rationally decided that this is how they should conduct their affairs. Oh, neat. You said, look, don't look at the historical record. You behave first, then you figure it out. And there's huge gaps of, of, of tens of centuries between figuring out how to behave or between acting and then later being able to say how it is that you have. So, uh, he thought that the English, we're putting the cart before the horse in the man's man having no vision for the, for the length of historical development

Speaker 3:          00:53:02       so I can not happens. And then you make declarative representations of it. Then for instance, when a new person and you teach them, declared what you teach them verbal stories about the religion for example, does that get into their behavior? I need, so that then by listening to the stories about that they actually learn the behavior of the procedural level of how to ask and without believing.

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       Yeah. Well that's a good question to me. Um, I don't know exactly what impact, watching stories that has on behavior. And I think, I think really what watch the stories probably does too is reconfigure your conceptions of the present and the future so that the motivation, the significance of things shifts and that has a consequence on your behavior. Although, so you also have to realize that, you know, movies and books and so on portray heroes and heroes are more wireless for emulation. And a model for emulation is essentially someone to be annotated. So I don't think that you can write off the direct impact of the story on behavior. And when kids play, for example, when they, when they pretend that they're something, what they're basically doing is embodying and imaginative representation of a pattern of action. And that's what that is, what their play does, at least in part.

Speaker 1:          00:54:19       So there is, there's some direct effect, I think getting this neat, you said, look, you know, we have no rational reason for having a, for continuing to behave in the way that we behaved in the past, which is essentially a dog, Judeo Christian presuppositions in European society because we don't believe in the funds miracle. You don't believe in the fundamental premises of the system by which those moral rules we're generating. So you can say, well, Christianity Judeo Christianity is a tree, a tree of recent positions. Then the most, and we live out here in the branches and the most fundamental presupposition is that there is a god. And if you, if you break the tree at that point, then the whole tree is dead. You just don't know it. It might take a long time to die. And she would say, and this was basically his theory, for example, that's why people in the 20th century were so unbelievably susceptible to rationally ideologies like fascism and communism rationally described ideologists because well, well, because their foundation can be made very unstable by destruction at this point in their presumption hierarchy state. Well, this isn't an inhibitory network in a sense. You can think of it as a methodology for keeping anxiety under control. When this goes well, that whole thing is cast into doubt. The the grand inquisitor, the trunk of the tree was not god, but then it had been captured. The grand inquisitor is planning foundation of the society. Had been captured by the RG, religious and spiritual aspect that became be potentiated just undermine. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's fair enough. Well, that's something that we'll have to talk about. Talk about.

Speaker 1:          00:56:21       Yeah, I don't, I don't want to answer that right now. I

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       will just answer briefly. You can say, well, the belief in God is the belief in two things. One is authority, and the other is process of adaptation is simply and the priests, to the degree that the priest and Dostoevsky story encapsulate this, this was theoretically made unnecessary say, well, we'll tell you what the world is like. That's all you need. But you remember Dostoevsky story to the Grand Inquisitor, he met Christ out the back door because that's why that's brilliant. Story means standing, but does it as well, even though the grand inquisitor is a fascist, fundamentally, it's representative, I think, in that story of the Catholic church, tremendously potent authoritarian structure with sufficient flexibility to allow them the active process, some small measure of freedom in which to operate. What'd you say?

Speaker 1:          00:57:18       Well, and it goes to ask you a story that the process is Christ in the grand inquisitor. He's the act of spiritual.

Speaker 2:          00:57:27       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:57:29       Yeah. He's the act of spiritual process as opposed to the static structure of the church, which is basically once in government sense, it's trying to make things or disorders.

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       Awesome. Okay. So

Speaker 1:          00:57:46       many ways. As far as I'm concerned, we have a split in the recognizance consciousness and the split is between what we assume to be true from the scientific perspective and how we're willing to govern our actions because their actions are still governed by mythological presuppositions that we no longer presumed to be valid. We're still learning to accept them and we also know that they're useful. I mean, for example, Western democracy is predicated on the notion of the natural right, and the natural writers a transcendental idea. Nobody's been able to pin the damn thing down. I mean, what we found is we can't do without it. I know at the basis of natural, right, is the idea that you know, there's something about you that's more or less incomprehensible that I have to have respect for. Although I can't categorize it, I can't describe it rationally.

Speaker 1:          00:58:30       If I act like it's not there, things immediately go very badly astray. The notion of natural, I mean people have tried to come up with rational explanations for the natural, right? But that's foolish. That's foolish because like every system at the base of every system is a presupposition. That's because say well, that's because you don't know everything and because you don't know everything that means, but whatever you do has to be predicated on some preset positions, right? I mean, you have to take a leap of faith at some point that the presupposition of the national right tree is that there's something valuable about the individual and it's once you accept that, that's like a rule of the game, we'll just play that game. You're valuable and I'm valuable. We don't want to why? Given that premise, there's a whole bunch of necessary conclusions. Those are our main goal of the whole body of our natural rights.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       And you might say, well, once you've accepted this, you can rationally derive those, but you can't provide rational underpinnings for that because that's just in the sense it's in a sense it's just an arbitrary decision. It's just a game rule. It's like you want to play the game. If you want to play this particular game, you have to accept that rule. I don't think it's arbitrary now actually. I think there's a real reason why that particular phenomenon emerged. Like it's fundamental. That's another thing I want to do in this course. Sorry I jump all over. You know what that's like.

Speaker 1:          00:59:56       I want to show you that this precept position is not arbitrary, that it's a necessary emergent property of successful patterns of social interaction and then even if you wipe it out, he would pop back up. I you say say that emphasis on individual work is the hallmark of any society bedside, properly functioning and stable, stable in the long term and also capable of updating itself when it's necessary and then it'll just pop up over and over and over again of its own accord. So that'll help us get away from the idea that morality is arbitrary in some sense. You know, the old argument system, no matter what moral rule you can think of, there's some society somewhere on the planet who does exactly the opposite thing equal have used that sort of argumentation to too. But that sort of evidence to argue that there's no such thing as as transcendental morality that that's a useless pursuit.

Speaker 1:          01:00:48       Nature's point was people say that, you know, they're willing also to undermine their own belief systems by pointing out obvious things. Like you know, if you shoot a rocket far enough open space, you open going to find having, so God's not out there. We still act like our moral systems have value in their useful and it really does appear that acting that way. It works. So then you have to wonder, well it works. You know what's at the basis of it. And it's really interesting, like when I first started thinking about these ideas, there was still a lot of debate on the world scene in the sense of how it is that we should conduct two affairs. You know, at the very least, there's two major sources of, or two major bodies of ideas that were in, in like deadlocked competition and one was authoritarian, more or less the communists, the communist bloc.

Speaker 1:          01:01:33       They had the way of their head, their notions of how to configure the world. And then there was our side and you know, we were basically at each other's throats and that, that was very disturbing to me at the time that have sort of all fallen apart now with any luck. And uh, it does seem that whatever it is that we're doing in the West seems to work at least better than anything else anybody can come up with. So Nietzsche was already in this morality has tried sitting there origins, you can't have it if you don't accept the transcendental origins, you might think you have it past that just proves that you don't understand it. Uh, it's also the case that this morality, which has transcended dental origins works and it also seems to be the case that it's preset positions.

Speaker 2:          01:02:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:43       I wanted to borrow some time for discussion. So I just want to

Speaker 2:          01:02:54       covered too slow.

Speaker 1:          01:03:14       Is Concerned with morality is how to act

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       neat. You pointed out a hundred years ago that Tom, the fact that there was morality was a much more difficult problem to solve then which, and he was right. I guess in a sense the fact that there is morality is the question. One of the questions that we're going to give us facts. Why is there a morality? What does it mean that there is morality and given that there is morality, is there anything that can be said about if that's universal across morality? He's like, see, that's another thing is we know that within a different moral systems there are differences of opinion about what should be done. I'm sorry, across moral system there are differences of opinions, if any, about what should be done, but the fact that there are moral system seems to be a universal of human culture. So there's something universal in the domain of morality at the level of analysis that says that every human culture has a morality on.

Speaker 1:          01:04:11       I'm kind of interested in looking at the metal structure of the morality is to see if there's anything that we could pull out that is common to the ball because that would give us some idea about what morality is and if we want to come to agreement in the long term about how it is that we should conduct our affairs. And so in part lesson or propensity to engage the social conflict, it seems to me to be reasonable, to be useful, to be able to apprehend rationally what the basis for the fact of morality yet. And so the methodology here is Bob, we're going to look at some neuro psychology because I'm interested in, in what modern research has to say about the way we regulate our emotions. So that's one domain of evidence that we're going to cover. The other domain is comparative mythologies strap.

Speaker 1:          01:04:54       We're going to look at mythologies from different cultures and see if we can extract from them what their essential structure is to see if there are any commonalities and that structure. So that's basically, that was basically the notion. Say the basic issue here is how can the current state of experience be conceptualized in abstraction regards to its meeting? It's just the same. Well, that's what, that's what, knowing how to act meet. What are the significance of the phenomena that you currently apprehend? Say meaning means implication for behavioral output logically. Therefore, myth presents information relevant to the most fundamental moral problems, which is what should be done. So that's the question that stories are trying to answer how you should, how is it that you should act but desirable future, which is the object of what should be, can only be conceptualized,

Speaker 2:          01:05:54       sorry

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       can only be conceptualized in relationship to the present, which serves at least as a necessary point of contrast and comparison, which is to say, well, if you think that things should be a particular way, you're always conceiving that in relationship to the way that you conceive of them being now and those two things. What's this kind of a peculiar aspect of this form of cognition, isn't it? You evaluate your presence state in terms of your ideal future, but you also evaluate your ideal future in terms of your presence state. So there's a constant interaction going between the two. That's why poverty for example is relative and I think it's relative in terms of its socioeconomic effects. It's where you are in the dominance hierarchy to determines the effect of socioeconomic status rather than your absolute level of material. Wellbeing is something that's what really worth considering for a psychologist when they talk about ses because, well to give you one example, like the black community in the u s which is a population that's frequently studied with regards to the consequences of low socioeconomic status as a population group constitutes the 13th most wealthy nation on the planet.

Speaker 1:          01:07:12       You can also sign, so that's kind of interesting when you're thinking about things in absolute terms. It's also the case that even the poorest people in North American society, you know with exception of people who've fallen completely out of the world have access to two technologies. The 200 years ago were non existence. And I'm not talking about computers, I'm talking about like heat and running water. So poverty, that's just one example. Poverty is where are, you are construe with respect to where you could be. And there's some, obviously there's some level of absolute poverty too. I mean if you don't get enough to eat well that brings everything to a halt. But point is is that you can't conceive of where you are from the effect of perspective without also conceiving of where you could be in vice versa. Uh, mass to answer the following stories. What is, which is, what is the nature of the current state of experience from the motivational perspective, what should be to what Angie, we'd be moving and how can we get there? Well, and I, I showed you last week is faith.

Speaker 1:          01:08:13       Well that's a story as far as I can tell. Now you want to use your imagination for a minute saying his dad snores. Just the story. It's also a kingdom. What a ridiculous thing to say. You could imagine that there's a castle wall around that and that what surrounds it is hostile territory. So that can be viewed as sometimes in mythologies. It's viewed as a notion might be one way of looking at it might be viewed as barbarian lands are dark forces. The point is is the out heres where things that you can't predict take place and everybody who shares your story is predictable. They live inside your kingdom, everybody outside is contaminated with chaos basically. But you see why that is is even in this class is we have a vision of where the class is going to go both over the course of the whole semester. And just today, you know, we have a vision of how it's going to progress and how we can, how we can save ourselves in relationship to all the others in this class and exactly what's going to happen and what the plan is. And so as far as we're concerned, we compose a unit and we're a unit because we can predict all each other's behaviors and we can predict each other's behaviors cause we all have the same story. That's what the story is.

Speaker 1:          01:09:27       How does this tie in with mythology? But one thing, I haven't said anything about this. Why do I think this all has anything to do with mythology? It's kind of a glaring question. That's why you look at the Christian viewpoint. For example, I say map it onto the structure. Well, Christianity gives you a picture of Matt. That's what miss dew and Christianity says, well, what is man contaminated by original sin? That's a hereditary retained. You'd have it whether you deserve it or not. It's they're in desperate need of redemption and living in a sea of chaos and misery. Basically. I mean this is a pretty negative. This is a pretty negative summary, but it'll do for the, for the present purposes, that's our presence state like, and we don't want to trivialize this, that the Christian perspective basically is, look, there's something fundamentally screwed up with the world.

Speaker 1:          01:10:28       Human beings do not fit here really well. We're, we're, we pose a constant question to ourselves. We don't understand our place in the nature of things. We're always doing things that we don't understand. There's a central mystery here that we haven't solved. It's not, this is not a trivial conception and people laugh about original sin. What sort of weird consent concept of that, but this says, well, there's something about human beings that we don't understand. It makes them evil. Well isn't just lack of socioeconomic goods mass best. Well then there's also some image of the ideal future and that's paradise or heaven or even the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. It doesn't have to be something that's purely spiritual, spiritual. That means in a sense that means my domain of the imagination and you could say, well, paradise is the archetype of the ideal future, which is to say that whenever you're committing an action of any sort to act means to have a prayer, which means to say that you are here and you're going to go here and you have behavioral routines to bring that transformation about whatever act you undertake has that structure.

Speaker 1:          01:11:44       So you could say, well, the collection of acts as a whole has that structure to act is to adopt the structure. You could say, well, you could abstract out from all of the particular notions of your ideal future. Some abstract that met a notion of the ideal. And that would be paradox. So that's why you can see how these myths sorts in fills the notion that there is some sort of ideal, let something that's inherent to people and you can build your ideal well just by imagining what the best of all possible situations could be. And Christian morality, by the way, is the acceptable procedures by which the unbearable present can be transformed into the ideal future. And if you share that well, then you're part of a community. And a community means that you're walled in with all these other people who think like you and all the barbarian hordes and the discord and a male companion.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       The unpredictability that's outside. Perfect. So that's a story. And while that was, that was a religious story, you say, well, the communist stories like that, I mean it's pretty outdated story. Kindness in many ways. The current situation is characterized by a socioeconomic inequality. That's a consequence of class. The class struggle that we, uh, we can erect to heaven on earth by distributing income and opportunity equitably. We have to undergo a period of intermediate and chaos, which we'll get to later to bring that about, etc. Etc. So, you know, in one of the things that's happened to many, many, many European communities, and this is an appalling thing, is that when their religious structures collapsed, the first thing they do is replace them with like far more idiotic political utopias. And as far as, I mean this has happened in many places, happened in Russia. How in Germany, I think it happened to China, I think it's happening pullback as a, as a matter of fact as well.

Speaker 1:          01:13:39       Anyways, that's what I think when it came to quality last Roman Catholicism and you know, the late fifties and now we think that if the political situation was just transformed, that the world would turn into a utopian. That's what happens when people lose their religious beliefs. So that's the first thing. They do use these cause there's a big hole there. But okay. So that's the, that's the simple story. And you can say, well there's more to the story in a sense. There's also transformational grammar and that kind of looks like this. Say, well, it's w go ahead. I just wanted to ask you why, why you chose to call the president unbearable. I mean that seems to have such a striking implies a really strong effect instead of letting it be imperfect or, yeah, well it's just, uh, uh, what do you say? It's kind of satirical I guess.

Speaker 1:          01:14:26       I mean, you're always trying to change it no matter what it is. Look, I'll give you an example. Okay. Really quickly. I read this really funny story in the Atlantic magazine needs a weaken. I hated liking it because, but anyways, I did like, it was kind of funny. But um, so this guy, he's a travel writer and he goes on one of these cruises and everything's done for absolutely everything. It's like if he goes and goes swimming in the morning, in the morning and he sits down on his beach chair, he gets a towel. There's a guy there that's higher just to make sure he has a tell and if he gets up to walk around the pool, the same guy's job is to go and get his talent and replace it with another one. I mean he doesn't have to do anything. He said he could eat at the restaurant 18 times a day and if he didn't feel like walking up to the restaurant and he could call room service and get whatever you wanted and it would be there in 10 minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       As he said for the first three or four days, he was really guilty about this. Like he couldn't stand the fact that, well it's often uh, people from the third world, often man. And he ships by the way, because they weren't cheap. But anyways, he was real guilty about having, being waited on hand and foot basically. And so for the first two or three days he was sort of racked by guilt. But by the end he said, and this is quick funny, he said, by the end of the trip having adjusted to his new circumstances, he was finding himself increasingly irritated by the fact that when he called for room service and they brought him a sandwich, they always put it too close to the little decorative orange slice and the edge of the guts. Soggy. So anyways, sorry. See, this is very funny. You don't, that's when people are like, cause you know, he would just to sort of your, your expectations of just to bounce the situation and then you construe the motivational significance of events with regards to that that can conceptualization.

Speaker 1:          01:16:04       Well, so that's kind of why I put that as like for him, the unbearable president was the fact that, you know, of the corner of his sandwich was soggy. He was ready Urinetown of himself for, for reacting in this manner. But he said, well, that's just what people are like when we are, when you're set of expectations alters the valence of phenomena instantly changes. And that's why the Buddhists in part thing, the world is my ass, right? You just generate a story about what should happen. You can switch the valence of phenomena virtually, virtually at will, but not entirely. I mean, there's still certain constraints. So you're always trying to run from this incense to get to this. It doesn't matter what your situation is and this is permanent. Like that thing just moves more or less with you wherever you move. So, uh, that's the simple story.

Speaker 1:          01:16:52       And then there's the more complex story, which we'll talk about it in detail. So when you have this, that's the known, you know, that's an ideology, for example. Well, if something interferes with 20 year plans, something unexpected happens, you just switch to another plan. All right? But I started again interferes with a more fundamental precept position like who you are, where you're going, then this whole thing can come crumbling down. That's represented here. And this is transformation, transformation, grammar in since I guess it's how conception a can turn it to conception be, which is to say that, oh, people's belief systems will shift radically. So you also need a structure for

Speaker 2:          01:17:34       mmm,

Speaker 1:          01:17:39       you have a belief system, that's one thing and you need one. But you also need a process by which your belief system is outdated because your belief system is supposed to map the environment and the environment keeps changing and now and then you have to undergo a fundamental revolution in your beliefs. And that's basically what this is. When you have a, well, you know the example I gave you will read about it in detail. It's like, first of all, there's a little story in that, in this, in the book about this guy who was going to a meeting and he's going to be a real start. This meeting is elevators late, so he thinks he's going to be right in the fact that the elevators late three of distressing because he's construing the significance of that with relationship to his meeting. So that makes them mad.

Speaker 1:          01:18:20       Nays down, it goes up in front of the building and now he's kind of late to his meeting. It's a few blocks away. Like anybody who gets in his way, it makes a massive little old ladies are lovers out for a stroll or whatever. He construes their existence with regards to his plants. So if you had lots of time while they wouldn't bother him at all, but the fact that he's late makes them a bowl of irritation. So anyways, when the elevator doesn't show up, yes to shift plan, he goes down the stairs and said, well that's a minor league irritation. Well say when he gets back, he's done with his meeting and his boss calls me into the office and set aside, you're fired, you're incompetent, you're the worst employee we've ever had. Well, he had visions of being a star in his hand, was evaluating everything with regards to that.

Speaker 1:          01:19:05       It's still being quite irritated about the fact, say the elevator wouldn't show up like now something's really make it happen to them. That's a major league discrepancy. You know, it's, it's blown out. A few fundamental precept positions. It's knocked out his version of the, of who he is and what he's doing, where he's going. It's blown in. The whole structure uses to interpret the motivational significance of phenomenon and that means that it's an event that's not be emotionally neutral, has taken place. It's a, it's an event that has a tremendous amount of emotional significance. He's very anxious, he's very depressed. It's like you could say in a sense, and we'll try to outline this more details because motivational systems are no longer regulated. He doesn't know what anything means anymore and when you don't know what anything means, everything makes you anxious. That's a problem.

Speaker 1:          01:19:48       Actually this represents, so he's down here, everything's gone chaotic. You said, I don't know who I am anymore, and that happens to people you know. Then you have to reevaluate your whole past and your present and your future, your whole story shifts, everything changes and maybe you can do that or maybe you cut your throat because that happens to people too and everything falls down. It just can't handle it. They're overwhelmed by their negative emotions and that kills them. That's the end of the, well, let's say he pops back out of it. He's a little bit more humbled as time. Figure it out. Maybe he didn't like his God damn job anyways. You should have done something he wanted to do a long time ago. Maybe it wouldn't be in such a bastard and got fired in the first place. His conceptions of who he is and why he wants to be have changed because my emotions are reregulated.

Speaker 1:          01:20:33       He interprets the world from a slightly different perspective, but the metal structure of the perspective is still the safe. Right. He was here in this kind of structure when he was there. He's still in this kind of structure here. It's just what the contents of the structure and difficult, so there's a stability, there's a stability and structure as well as flexibility for change within the structure. This is the big mythological story by the way. Set us up. You can look at this all sorts of ways. I'll try to diagram this out later. These are castles. Kingdoms. Say this is a dominance hierarchy. That's, and then we'll discuss that in some detail later. It's like if you're in a corporation, for example, you share a dream with everybody in the corporation and you arrange yourself and a power hierarchy to attain the goals of the corporation to get from here to here.

Speaker 1:          01:21:20       You move up the dominance hierarchy and it's in your best interest under those circumstances to keep the corporation going and also to prop yourself up the levels of the dominance hierarchy. So there's a dominance hierarchy here and the king of the dominance hierarchy. Maybe it's the CEO or whatever, Hayes. He's the active representative of the ideal future, which makes him the king basically from the mythological perspective. Anyways, so that's a community. This is a dragon. That's one way of looking at a dragon is something that there's in a cave and it's very dangerous, but it sits on something very promising. Cord of treasure.

Speaker 1:          01:21:56       Dragons are the places that an almost events emerged from say their representations of the chaos that surrounds predictable territory. The thing about chaos is that it's threatening and policies at the same time. Yeah, and it seems that the majority of our behavior is not able to be planned or formulated. Declaratively. Yeah, adaptive behavior inside the little circles. All I meant really my plan is that like you draw on in your reservoir of habitual behaviors and put them into play to retain certain and so it's like even the guy rushing to the meeting, he doesn't have to think about how to walk like that's a hope. Those sequences of behaviors are already habitual. He just says, well, the plan is I will walk there. So that that's all I meant by that is that you just have like your conceptualization of your present state is somewhat general and so as your conceptualization of your ideal future, but do you have specific plans to move you from one state to another and you can shift between the felt, like I said, this is a simplistic viewpoint. It that structure. We'll look at the real structure of that much later in the court stuff. That's all I mean by it's just those are sub routines that will enable you to pursue your goal.

Speaker 3:          01:23:16       That's all. So what if you're doing something that isn't adapted behavior, it's not something like walking, it's something like trying to make a good impression. But what if, what if you're taking some sort of mythical knowledge that you've gotten about how to make things work out, but you can't formulate that the plan and you have this goal and this is how you're getting there, but you have a plan together that way. You're just trying to get their hope on a psychoanalysis, but you can have plants that you don't have a representation now, right? I mean isn't that,

Speaker 1:          01:23:45       no, it only plans but even representations of the ideal, right? Absolutely. Yeah. Well it depends on your left, their level of representation. So you can have fantasies that could haven't made explicit like this. By the way, I think this, this, this is a fantasy and so is this, it's the fantasies. That guy here, the guy, you're a motivational fit guide, your motivational, motivational judgments, your dreams about the future. If you don't know what you're doing, then you engage in exploratory behavior, you know? So it can say, well, I have this idea of future in mind, but I don't know how to get there. Then you try out different patterns and just that's something we'll discuss next week. So that's a, that's a default positions. I know where I want to go on, but I don't know how to get there. So since I don't know how it, since I don't know what to do, what can I do? That's a of a question, but the answer is, you know, the answer to that is you start engaging in exploratory behaviors of various sorts to make what you want to happen, start happening.

Speaker 3:          01:24:49       That syncs the things that you do know how to do that. You don't know, you know how to do. They just fall inside that little tickle on top like things that you're doing without being aware of planning to do then that way. But you're doing them

Speaker 1:          01:24:59       well. They would form sub routines of this basically. So you, you, you like, you use what you know how to do automatically in your attempt to do what, what it is that you want to accomplish, like walking or moving your hands, whatever you sequence those behaviors that you already know how to do. So I'm in describing the first circle, you, you basically described a kingdom, right? With an authoritarian rule and whatever. Yeah. Are you going to go into and during the class what, what kind of works best? Because, uh, you've also described elsewhere, I don't remember how democracy works and how it's not, there isn't a general generalized hierarchy, but, but people have a, a hierarchy and there are certain specializations. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, we're still doing really introductory introductory work can we will go into that? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Cause what I want to do is find out, well this is the myth of the way, by the way, this is the sit up there with it.

Speaker 1:          01:25:59       It's this story that myths referred to most, particularly as the structure of adaptive structures and how they transformed and when the myth is when math is describing the world, that's what it's describing said. Well this is from the mythological perspective. The world is constructed of the distinction between chaos and order. It's like before chaos, in order divided, you don't have anything and you could send them all, this is chaos and this is order by order is also something that has to transform because anything orderly that doesn't change dies because it's hard to say exactly why that is. Because things change and you have to keep up with them is the simple answer. I have no idea why that is. And just the as the case. So the mythical world is the world. It's always stable, which is to say there's an unknown. That's chaos. It has a certain effect of Valence, which is frightening and promising.

Speaker 1:          01:26:48       That's always there, the unknown. And then there's the no and that's your culture. That's the story you shared with everyone. That's your procedures to bring about what you want to bring about. That's your kingdom. That's always there. And then there's a process that mediates between the two. That's you. That's always there. Those are the three constituent elements of the world, chaos order and, and the hero actually hold on those, those all out. They're split into positive and negative representations and mythologies as well. So that's the mythological world. So, and it's as far as I can tell, it's a per ticket, I said completely code internally, coherent representation of experience. And it includes, it's concentrates on if effect of Valence and motivational significance rather than on sensor structure. So what sort of things would affect your content is the new adaptive structure. Okay. What, what do you mean by what sorts of things?

Speaker 1:          01:27:43       Well, w what would influence a particular shape that it takes a particular story that it tells hopefully past experience. I mean these are like these are fantasies, but to the degree that someone's healthy, their fantasies that are constructed on knowledge that's generated as a consequence of past endeavors. So let's say like you're doing something and you have to fail in a major way, in an unexpected way. Well hopefully what happens, but that basically means that there's a bunch of information about your circumstance that you failed to either notice or to adapt to. That's what it means. If a failure comes as a big surprise, as a general rule, you're not paying attention. So hopefully what happens when this is reconstructed, that's what sort of on a higher plane is that all of the anomalous information that you didn't take into account? Probably because it was threatening is now incorporated in here.

Speaker 1:          01:28:33       So hopefully that sounds like koons. That is not exactly that. What Kuhn, what Kuhn was describing. Look, that's normal science, right? Yeah. Max Revolutionary Side. Let's see. What Kuhn found basically was this structure in science, but what Kuhn found was only a substructure of a much broader process of adaptation. So it's like a mythic structure of science then. Yeah. Well, I mean what, what tune was describing is how cognitive systems stabilize and restructure, but in the scientific domain. But you could just say, well, cognitive systems stabilize and restructure no matter what we're applying to. So cool. I now this is a very strange quirk of history because you sadness, like in 19 both 1930 said, ah, this is not a religious systems progress and I can't, first reasons I cannot understand. No one seemed to notice that. And then coon said at 1962 or 61 this is how scientific systems transforming it was like what was the revelation? But anyways, who knows? Maybe it's easier for people to accept and understand probably in the scientific domain because we feel that we understand that type of knowledge and we do because the rules are, or explicit. It's harder to understand how this works when you're talking about they elance.

Speaker 2:          01:29:53       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:29:55       But the thing you have to remember, it's like I'm trying to, I'm trying to make this argument is as concrete as possible. You have to, Matt Damon says you have to because you have to know how to behave and you have to get what you need out of the world. And uh, we have a structure for doing that. It's, it's of primary importance. That's why we do, while we're alive, everything else is just an adjunct to that. So when you're looking at this sort of thing, you're looking at the most fundamental aspects of cognition as far as I can tell.

Speaker 2:          01:30:24       And you're,

Speaker 1:          01:30:26       you're basically the purpose of cognition as far as I can tell, it's to regulate emotion. That's why we have, that's what it's good for. We want to not be in pain. We want to not be anxious. We want to have a future that's full of hope and and satisfaction and we're always trying to adjust our models of the world, hopefully to ensure that battle curves when we do more specific cognitive exercises like sites, well that's a subspecialty specialization. It's very useful. Hopefully it's very useful. It's dangerous too.

Speaker 2:          01:31:00       Other questions?

Speaker 1:          01:31:04       You may just say that the second is more adaptive than the fall. Hopefully it doesn't happen. It doesn't have to be, you don't describe something that he called retro regressive reestablishment of the Persona, which is you're trying to do something and you fail and when you reorganize yourself sphere of the taxes, much more constricted. So like you can get worse as a consequence of this if you just cause all that anomalous information that you haven't processed. You can't just let that in. It doesn't change you by letting it in. You have to adjust your behavior to the anomalous territory and that takes a lot of, well, a lot of ingenuity and a lot of hard work and that's why fried, you know, fried found by the end of his life. He said, well, Mira consciousness doesn't entail cure. Well that's because just knowing that something, there isn't the trick.

Speaker 1:          01:31:56       The trick is if there's a threat that the environment, wait, let's say people find you obnoxious, generally flow, and that isn't what you want. It's interfering with your, your future as well. The problem, just knowing that people will find you have nauseous, that's normal. That useful to assimilate that information is to take it in and move differently and respond differently so that other people are no longer that category of things that's hostile towards you. So it's not, it's not just heightened consciousness, it's like total reconstruction of your behavioral outputs. You have to learn to pay attention and to listen to and to have some respect for somebody else's story. And so the new system also depends on what's available. Right. And that's why you can repress me. Is Your path available to talk to you about double the ideologies around? I mean, yeah, because that's true.

Speaker 1:          01:32:52       It's easy to about what's there is what you're proud of. A lot of it. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Well, that's why. And how brainwashing institutes basically work. Will they toss the nautilus information on you until you crack and then they just throw a new system out to you. When she grabbed onto immediately it, Koreans did that during effectively two American prisoners of war in the fifties so now I'm going, I mean, it's not just, that's how the army works. It's how fraternities work in a, in a more minimal sands. That's how initiation ceremony ceremonies. So it's not always negative that that will curse. I mean it's, it's only negative if what your hand is less useful than what you had or less useful than what you could have constructed yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:33:43       Okay. I know that was sort of randomly. Any other questions? What's the process of coming up with the whole system like that? Does that imply that you should have power over it or that it's exploration? What are you, where are you in? Can you talk about you're here, you're the thing that moves from here to here, but I mean, if you're the person who comes up with this system, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:34:25       that's right. That's right. That's why the way is the proper path of life from a mythological perspective. And who identify with the way is instead of identifying with this, where are with this, knowing that they're temporary is to identify with this because it's the only thing that's constant across the constant spans. You say, well, there was no one territory and there's unknown territory and there's the process by which what is generated out of the other. And you said, well where does the individual fit? Basically, where are you? Well if you're doing this voluntarily, then you're identifying with the process by which cultural information is generated rather than with the information itself. So that makes you always on the always in the proper locale, so to speak, to construct the world. That's where it will be less wear will be interesting. Occurrence is taking place. That's a proper place to live. I'll give, I'll close with that as an example of that. Say, well here's another symbol that you're all familiar with that that's dao and down means two things. It either means the way, depending on the translation, the way which is that or it means meaning.

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       So to live in Dallas, to live in meaning. And this symbol is a symbol of the totality of the world. And why is that? Plus, because this is chaos and there's usually give it the feminine connotation for reasons that we'll discuss later. And this is ordered and it's chaos and it's the split between chaos and order and the mutual coexistence that makes the world. And this dog is black because anything orderly can immediately be turned into chaos, more or less unpredictably. And sometimes by your own efforts and chaos can also be turned in order. That's why this little dog is white. Also by your own efforts. Exploration does that. And Dow, the man who lives in down lives on deadline with one foot in order and one foot in chaos and the reason for that. So that's where all the interesting things are happening. That's where the information is flowing.

Speaker 1:          01:36:40       If you're all here, you predict everything, well that's secure, but it's boring and it's not just boring. Symbolic, it defines boring. There's no new information happening here. And if you're here, well there are so overwhelmed with new information that that you can't do anything with it and you want to be here. And if you're here and you're doing this, you're paying attention to anomalous information always. You're allowing that to destabilize this structure when it's necessary, they have to do this. That's the hero in the belly of the beast, by the way, are the sun would packs it's way out of the dragon at night and back up. So that's the path of the hero. And in terms of systems that are stable over time and an authoritarian system says this is not necessary. So if the case as things change, a system that's property, government said, well we need this but we also need this and therefore we're going to have to allow a certain amount of disorder into the system so that flexibility can be maintained.

Speaker 1:          01:37:47       And the, the, the trick is belts. It's like too much novelty. Everything degenerates too much, order, everything. Petrifies. You wore the right on the proper edge and the way that you can tell you're on the edge when you were interested in something that's, that's the sign that says you say, well, there's an effect of sign post that tells you when you're here. If you're here, you're interested. If you're here, you're terrified. You're here, your board, it would be right in the middle of that and then that means your brain is on and it's optimal in an optimal manner because your sensory systems are probably heightened because you're a little bit anxious. You're doing a lot of exploration. We find it that pleasurable, like last left frontal activation. People like that. That's incentive reward pleasure. That's what cocaine does to you is this. When you're here you're on.

Speaker 1:          01:38:39       It's analgesic too, which is kind of interesting. There's no work flow. Yeah. It's not quite though because the problem with things like flow, and this is Joseph Campbell's thing too, is they're always talking about following your happiness. This is not right to get here. What you have to do is look at things that you hate from is no one would buy a book that tells them that it's a flow, but no, but this is amazing. This is a major problem. Um, problem with new age philosophy in general. It's the normally that you have to face and the a priori motivational significance of an anomaly is terror because otherwise people would be in flow all the time and they're not,

Speaker 2:          01:39:51       it looks expensive.
