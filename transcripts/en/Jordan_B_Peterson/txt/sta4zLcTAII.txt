Speaker 1:          00:02          So while you guys were gone, I went on Wikipedia and looked up, oh, cyrus, you know, because when I did the research for this book certainly wasn't possible to get access to that kind of information, instantaneous, you know, and the stories that are laid out in there, there's a thread that runs through the stories that's laid out there that's quite similar to the one that I told you, but there's all sorts of details that are very radically different. And so I don't really know what to say about that. And you know, part of the reason that people like Joseph Campbell and Carl young and, uh, the ridge, there was an original anthropologist and armchair anthropologist who wrote a book called the Golden Bough, whose name escapes me momentarily, but it was one of the first attempts to do across cultural categorization of mythology and to look for underlying commonalities.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Now, the problem is, you know, I told you about Naomi Klein going down to Argentina and looking at the factory through her particular Lens. The problem is is that when you develop a lens and then you look at things through it, you may just see what that lends heightens, you know, and I think that that's a criticism that could be leveled against the sorts of things that I'm telling you about that I've cherry picked certain stories and interpreted them in certain ways so that they fall coherently into a, a scheme of thought and so I'll tell you some of the things that I do methodologically to protect myself against that in so far as that's possible. So there's this idea in psychology called the multi-method multi multitrack method of construct validation, which is God awful agglomeration of, of a jargon, but it actually means something and it was the construction of two psychologists back in the late 19 fifties crime back in meal who are interested in what psychologists meant when they said something exists, like say anger.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Is that a real thing? Well, what do you mean? What do you mean thing? What is it that you're talking about? What? His anger exactly. I don't mean as anger, but as an idea what sort of idea is the idea of anger or the idea of anxiety or the idea of sadness or the idea of self esteem or self competence or any of these things that psychologists talk about as if their realities. It's like, well, some realities are very tangible, right? And and it's, it's somewhat easy to come to agreement about the contours of their existence in the borders, but other things are way more difficult than that. And so their idea was that if something actually exists that you should be able to measure it multiple ways using multiple techniques and still get the same answer. And so your senses do that. You have five of them.

Speaker 1:          02:51          The reason you have five apparently is because evolution has determined that if you only had four or you die more often, you know, so it seems as if you have five separate sources of information that all lead to the same conclusion. You can be relatively certain that the conclusion that's reached is real. Okay. Well, the multimap multitrack method is, is an application of that idea to construct validation, which is like you can think of anger as an idea, as a construct. It's a terminological issue. Just define it as a construct. Psychological Constructs. How do you know if they're real? Well, the idea is it's very complicated. You have to measure them in multiple ways. All the ways you measure them have to give the same reading. Then you have to show that that idea is the same in certain ways as other ideas that it's related to and different from other ideas that it's not related to.

Speaker 1:          03:48          So let me give you an example. There's a construct neuroticism, and you might say, well, there's another construct depression. Well then you might say, well, are those separate? Are they the same? Well, that's a tough one because in many, many ways they're the same. Are they the same in any important? Are they different in any important ways? Well, the way you do that technically is you would measure neuroticism, however you were going to measure it. Maybe I'd have you tell me how neurotic you were using a questionnaire and then I'd have your friend tell me and maybe you're a parent, so we got it pretty good triangulation on your neuroticism, and then I'd have them do the same thing. All of those people do the same thing with regards to your levels of depression and anxiety. Then I'd use both those measures to predict something else like how well your life goes in terms of career over the next 10 years and if neuroticism predicted and depression predicted so they were correlated, then I think, well there's some relationship and then I'd look at them at the same time.

Speaker 1:          04:55          If I predict with neuroticism and then I add new depression to the mixed, does that give me more predictive power? It's sort of like is does a equals C or does a plus b? We'll see. That's all you're asking your regression equation, roughly speaking. Well, if a equals c is just as good as a plus b equals c, then one of the things, especially if the two things are also correlated, depression and anxiety and neuroticism are going to be very highly correlated. Like point seven, something like that. You might say, well those are the same thing just because they have different names. It's not helpful. So. And part of it is, you know, it's a pragmatic conceptualize. A Asian of reality is like, is this, is this categorization structure good for something? Okay, well, so anyways, all unpack all that and say, well part of my rules for determining whether these things were useful or not was to see if the idea is applied across multiple levels of analysis.

Speaker 1:          05:54          So that's why I told you about the conceptual. So sort of the cognitive psychology and then the neuropsychological. So there's some, you know, input of brain research and then the narrative or mythological and then the cross cultural. I think, well, those all stack up in a certain way so that if you look between all of them, you can see a pattern and it seems to me increasingly unlikely that that pattern would be there across all of those levels at the same time. Now you could say, well, you know, that depends on how good you are at weaving a story, but at some point

Speaker 1:          06:34          encapsulating that many phenomena and weaving a coherent story out of them. If such a thing doesn't exist, it seems to be to become cognitively impossible. You just can't do it unless there's actually something there. So and every, you know, of course, everything I tell you also, is there a simplification? It has to be because you could spend your whole life investigating any of the things that we're talking about. And so what I'm hoping is that I've abstracted out the central issues of these multiple levels of analysis and that, you know, put together each of them support all the others anyways. Who knows, you know, I don't know, but so far so good. Okay. So this is a cool representation. I really liked this one. This is called the open virgin and it's a 14th or 13th century sculpture, if I remember correctly. It's made out of wood and these things were actually.

Speaker 1:          07:30          This isn't the only one of them. They were a form of religious representation that that had different exemplars. You could find different ones of them online. This is brilliant, this bloody thing as far as I'm concerned, so let me show you. Let me show you this, this figure again, so basically what you have here in this figure, this is at world conception and the world conception is roughly. There's an individual positive and negative. He's he or she is in a cultural sphere that's positive or negative, that's embedded in the world outside of culture that's positive and negative and all of it comes from potential. That's the idea. Now,

Speaker 1:          08:15          this map shows all of the positives and negatives in relationship to one another. You see it's not perfectly symmetrical and the reason for that is as far as I can tell, the adversarial element of the individual is the thing that generates the tyrannical element of culture and that's the thing that like gets in your way of establishing a creation, creative relationship with what you don't know. Well anyways, here's, here is a manifestation of that. I believe, and I liked this manifestation because like it's obviously Christian but not. It's more mythological than Christian and the reason for that, well it's quite obvious. So the, the super ordinate figure is married. The feminine now you think, well it's amazing the person who carved this just didn't get burnt up at the inquisition because it's a radical idea, but it's, it's just an indication of how the mythology can change the causal relationship between these different elements.

Speaker 1:          09:22          So you have Mary there, she's sort of, she's the ultimate in femininity, a ultimate feminine Deity, but only the positive side. Right? And then within her. So it's like nature opens itself up and benevolent nature opens itself up and what you see inside is culture. That's God the father holding the individual. And the individual in this case is the crucified Christ, which is a wonderful conceptualization as far as I'm concerned, because of course that is what life does to people. That's why that's such a powerful symbol. It's like, you know, Christ is the person who has to face the reality of his own death voluntarily or involuntarily who's betrayed by his culture and betrayed by his friends. It's like, it's, it's sort of like he's, he's exposed to the most, the most torturous elements of individual Ba and simultaneously, at least in principle, transcends them while you bloody well better do that because otherwise, well, what's going to happen?

Speaker 1:          10:26          You're just, you're done. If you don't do that, and it's even worse. It's not only that you fail, that's just the beginnings of it. If you can't transcend the tragedy of your being, then you get corrupted. You know, because I see this happening to people all the time. So you know, if you're suffering and you can't cope with it, generally speaking, what happens is that it embitters you. And once you get bitter, you get resentful. And once you get resentful, you look for revenge. And that can just get completely out of hand. Now that's a quick trip to the worst suburb of the underworld, that's for sure. So, you know, it's not only that if you don't manage this transcendent act that you're swamped by the tragedy of your life, it's worse than that. You're swamped by the tragedy of your life. And then that corrupts you.

Speaker 1:          11:23          And then you start working to make everything even more tragic than it has to be. And so I think that's why, you know, in medieval Christian conceptualizations in particular, that the idea of hell, the desk, that the idea that you were destined to hell was worse than the idea of dying. And that's a strange idea, you know, because you think this is what the terror management theorists thing too is like, oh, there's nothing worse than the fear of death. It's, that's wrong. They don't have the right imagination. There are lots of things that are worse than the fear of death. So I'm not trying to trivialize the fear of death, obviously, you know, but,

Speaker 1:          12:04          but I don't think it's very difficult to, to understand that there are some things that you would rather die than do. I mean, I'm sure that I could get you guys to sit for 15 minutes and say, okay, you list 10 things that you would rather die than do. Oh, that's easy. That's easy. Especially if you're a parent, you can think of those things in no time flat. Okay. So that was pretty interesting. So you've got the superordinate feminine figure here, which is not what you'd expect from a Christian representation, right? You expect God to be on the outside and then Mary and then Christ in all likelihood. Although that would also be a valid representation. Right? So because you can think of the mother as something that's protected by the culture and supporting the individual because that's basically what this representation shows. But then you see on the, on the open side, so I really liked this.

Speaker 1:          12:56          I think it's so cool is that you've got all these people who aren't archetipal figures there in the little crowd and they're gazing at the central figure and of course that's exactly what's happened in Christianity for 2000 years. Right? And so far spread is that for 2000 years people have been looking at that image which is the crucifixion transfixed by it. Well, why? Well, you know, for reasons that we don't understand, when everybody woke up and like the late 18 hundreds and said, why were we looking at that for the last 2000 years? The first answer was, well, we really don't have the foggiest idea. You know, it was just one of the things that we did, roughly speaking, it encapsulated people within the belief system. So that's another good example anyway, of how this archetypal imagery can manifest itself, say spontaneously in the imagination of an artist.

Speaker 1:          13:51          And the thing is the, that's a sacred image and it, it is. In actuality that's what it is. What it shows is while there's a superordinate transcendent natural order that's, that has a beneficial element that we associate with femininity and inside that there is a supportive culture, is properly nested if things are organized properly and it's both of those things that provide support for the suffering. Individuals like, yeah, that was pretty much gone it so now that doesn't exhaust the meaning of this particular representation. There's a lot more to it than that, but just that's not so bad.

Speaker 1:          14:32          And then you know, I can show you a, a more negative representation. I think I've showed you this before, like this would be a representation of the negative element of the feminine. And so you have Kelly here. Kelly is the goddess to whom you make sacrifices. Hopefully if you make the right sacrifices, then Kelly turns into her positive counterpart and you know, you think, well that's. You know what? Huh? How does sacrifice effect your relationship with the gods? Well, first of all, there's no gods and second of all, well then you know, what the hell are you doing with the sacrifices? But it's pretty straightforward. We've already talked about this at length, you do make sacrifices all the time and what that means is that you act as if you can have a relationship with your, with being, you assume that if you withhold certain things from yourself now that you will improve your relationship both with nature and culture.

Speaker 1:          15:31          It's like, and I already told you guys that as far as I was concerned, that was like the most stunning cognitive discovery of mankind. It's the discovery of the future and it's the discovery of the relationship between the present and the future. You know, it's, it's such an amazing idea that you can alter your behavior now and it'll pay off any year. God, that's not obvious. It's certainly not animals. Don't think that way. No, I mean some of them act that way, like these and so on, but that's just built right into their behavior as far as we could tell. So anyway, so there's Kelly, you know, she's a spider. She's in a web of fire. The fire is outside at web that's made out of skulls. She's got weapons in her hand. Your hair is on fire. She's got a headdress of skulls. I mean if you ever saw something like that, it would traumatize you so badly.

Speaker 1:          16:24          You wouldn't be able to get out of your house for like five years and that's exactly what it is. That's what it is. It's a representation of all of that. That would traumatize you if you encountered it and they know it's an attempt to encapsulate that as an image and what you could say in some sense is that the people who developed this image, we're attempting to conceptualize the class of all terrifying things and once you get the classical terrifying things conceptualize, you can come up with the class of all useful responses and that would be something like the proper way to behave and sacrifices and integral element of that. It's like, yeah, absolutely right. Absolutely dead on. So unless you don't believe that sacrifice works, in which case, what the hell are you doing here? You know, I mean you act out your belief.

Speaker 1:          17:15          So when it's a firm belief, and you would also say if things fell apart so badly that sacrifice, no, no longer paid off. Your lights would basically become intolerable, so because it would mean you have, you would have, would have abandoned all sense of control over the outcomes of your actions while you. You can't live like that. You'd just die of stress so well. And as I said, you know, she's, she was pregnant. She's given birth to this unfortunate character who she's devouring intense first, like it's a rough image. It's the image of the destructive element of nature. And so that's the negative side of the feminine, we might say, so

Speaker 1:          18:03          mirrors that positive representation. This is a Greek representation that's Diana or Artemis hoping. I'm remembering this properly. She's multi breasted. Know this circle around her head is undoubtedly a representation of her cosmic nature, you know, so it's like a halo. The Halo is basically a planetary body like the sudden, do you call it cosmic body, like the sun or the moon behind the head of the divine individual with all of that power, you know, shining forward. So it's an attempt to use, you know, if you look up at the moon or you look up at the sun, there's an element of that that's characterized by all. You can't help but feel that at least it's beauty and power and sometimes it's overwhelming. Well you, you take the representation of the, of the personality and you throw the representation of these cosmic powers behind it and it's an attempt to represent transcendent value. It's very intelligent, brilliant. In fact, and so partly what you're trying to do as you conduct your life is you're trying to get all of these archetypal forces in proper balance and I suppose in some sense to get them tilted towards the good. If that's possible. I mean that's what this. That's what this representation in some sense you might say, where is it here?

Speaker 2:          19:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:40          You might say, well, if, if, if you got everything ordered properly, this is what being would be like still pretty rough given that the crucifix is at its center. No, no. I don't know. If you think about it from a purely technical perspective, roughly speaking, each of these archetypes is split into positive and negative. You might say, well, that's just how it is. There is no appropriate. There is no way that you can interact with all of them so that the whole system tilts towards the positive. No, but

Speaker 2:          20:18          okay,

Speaker 1:          20:19          but I don't think that's true. I think you can get them lined up so that things tilt towards the positive and I think that you can detect when that happens because that those are the periods in your life where you feel that your richly enough engaged in what you're doing in life is meaningful enough so that the rest of it, the substructure that makes it necessary is, is worth it. It's worthwhile in all that the negative exists is okay, given the way that things are structured now, I think that whether or not that's true is in some sense the eternal question of mankind. You know, can you organize your life so that it's good?

Speaker 2:          21:04          Well,

Speaker 1:          21:05          it seems like you can certainly allow your life to degenerate so that it's terrible. That seems indisputable. Right? And there does seem to be an element of choice in that, although you know something terrible could happen to you that you have no choice, you have no choice of or control over, but it certainly seems that you could do any number of stupid and blind things that make everything worse. I think that's a common experience and I also think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who wouldn't say that there were things they did consciously and willingly that were up their own choice that they didn't have to do that made things worse. So we seem to have some sense of our moral agency and we seem automatically to accept some responsibility for the outcomes of our actions. And so partly what that means is that we do believe that we can make things better or worse. And I suppose in some way that means that we believe we can tap the whole architectural structure of being into the positive, into the positive. Well, I would say

Speaker 2:          22:11          no. If you

Speaker 1:          22:13          drilled down to the bottom of existentialism, in some sense that's the question, the existentialists pose know, is there a manner of conducting your life such that it becomes, it's not merely acceptable, it's more than that. You'd say, yes, this is how it should be.

Speaker 2:          22:31          Well,

Speaker 1:          22:35          what we're going to do now, although we're not going to do it today, is we're going to start talking about other representations of this substructure from other religious traditions and we're going to also talk about ways that you might relate to these figures. You know, because one question might be while you're part of your culture and it's got an orderly element and a protective element and a tear radical element. Okay, so what should you do about that? You know, should, you know, the tyrannical element is a real and it's corrupt and blind and so to the degree that you identify with that, well then you're tyrannical and corrupt and blind. But by the same token, you're the fortunate beneficiary of tens of thousands of years of cultural and technological evolution. And it seems to me that an effort, it seems to me that, you know, you should be at least appropriately grateful for that.

Speaker 1:          23:29          And so then you're in a real position because you have to be grateful and happy for the thing that tyrannizing controls you. Well, okay, that's not an easy thing to figure out because those things seem to conflict. So what exactly should your relationship to culture be? Well, I think there are myths that describe that quite directly and they take into account the corruption, you know, it's not a whitewash. It's like, yes, of course this thing is dead and blind and corrupt obviously, and you know, it's, it's foolishness and, and willful ignorance and willful blindness that make it that way as well as things merely getting old and falling apart. So the fact that there's some level, it's at the bottom of it is also true. Should you flee from Matt?

Speaker 2:          24:21          Well,

Speaker 1:          24:23          that isn't what the myths say. You know, they say what you're supposed to do is just like Pinocchio. You're supposed to go to the bottom of the ocean to the most monstrous possible part and rescue your father. And that's what you have to do before you become an individual.

Speaker 2:          24:38          No, and

Speaker 1:          24:41          I can't see how that can't be. Right. So in fact, I think that that's what you're doing in university. If you're here for, if you're actually getting a university education, what you're here to do is to sift through the dad remnants of the past and pull up what's vital that's so sophisticated and complex that there's no way you'd be able to think it up for yourself. But you know, it requires us, the discriminating agent. You know, if you read someone like nature or you read someone like Freud, there's lots to throw away. It isn't what you throw away though. It's what you keep that matters. And to be a discriminating reader means that you get rid of the dead matter and you keep the goal and you build yourself up a storehouse of the gold and then, and then you can live in the world.

Speaker 1:          25:31          And when you know, people often ask, you know, what's the purpose of getting a degree in the humanities? While the answer to that is that if you're properly trained in the humanities, you know how to live now, that's not the same as having a job and you need to have a job, but, but you know, knowing how to live is a more important thing than having a job even though having a job isn't important thing. So, and the reason for that is that if you don't know how to live, then things fall apart and that's not good and they can really fall apart. You know, and part of the reason I think that this became so, so much of an obsession for me is that I believe that we don't have the luxury of. We are narrowing. We've become so powerful that the consequence of our blindness will, is reaching uncontrollable proportions. If you're weak and stupid, well, you know, there's only so much damage you can do, but we're not weak. Not at all. We have unbelievable power at our disposal now and a lot of weird things are going to come down the pipes in the next 10 years.

Speaker 2:          26:47          So

Speaker 1:          26:49          the more people that have their act together, the better because then things will be tilted towards everything lining up in a positive direction rather than being tilted in the other direction. And that's important. And I think people can make a very powerful individual contribution to that wherever you happen to be.

Speaker 2:          27:11          So

Speaker 1:          27:16          you know, all of these myths always say the same thing. They say that the history, the future of the world depends on individual choice. And I think that's, I think that's literally true. So then you might think, well you better put yourself in a position where you make wise choices because if you don't, we've already seen what happens. We got a taste of it in the 20th century, so if you want some more of that, you could certainly have it.

Speaker 2:          27:50          Okay. So.
