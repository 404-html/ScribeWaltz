Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Welcome everyone and thank you for coming to this a forum this morning. Uh, I am David Cameron, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto. Let me begin by saying, uh, that we acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates for thousands of years. That has been the traditional land of the Huron wind at the Seneca and most recently the mississaugas of the credit river. Today. This meeting place is still the home to many indigenous people from across turtle island and we are grateful for the opportunity to live and work on this lab. The goal of today's forum is to help the university community and interested members of our society to understand the gender provisions and implications of Bill [inaudible] and the Ontario Human Rights Code. The Federal Bill See 16 passed yesterday as it happens in the House of Commons. As most of you will know, this matter has been a subject of intense controversy within the university and beyond. Our aim in holding the form is to provide the opportunity for academic discussion of the matter and a serious exploration of the issues in play.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       We ask everyone to engage with the issues and with one another in a spirit of civility and respect, upholding in the words of the university's policy on the disruption of meetings, the principles of freedom of speech and the freedom of individuals and groups to be free of physical intimidation and harassment. Today's forum is being live streamed. Professor Mayo, Moran Chair and moderator will be outlining the procedures and the format, uh, shortly. She's just here in the seat in front of me. Uh, but first I'd like to introduce the panelists for the academic discussion. Dr Mary Bryson on my far left is a senior associate dean administration, Faculty Affairs and Innovation and Professor Department of Language and literacy education in the Faculty of Education at the University of British Columbia, Dr Bryson chairs, the UBC vice-presidential trends to spirit and gender diversity task force. And as a member of the World Professional Association for the transgender health global education initiative. They're the recipient of multiple awards for their entire interdisciplinary scholarship, including most recently the American Educational Research Association, Significant Body of Research Award and a senior fellowship at Stanford University's Clayman Institute for Gender Research at present, uh, their, their CIA, CIA hr funded cancer's margins project is the first nationwide Canadian research study designed to advance our understanding of how sexuality and gender shape cancer health knowledge access and its mobilization in health and in treatment decision making.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       That's both medically and culturally competent. Brenda cossman in the middle is a professor of law and the director of the bottom center for sexual diversity studies at the University of Toronto. She is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the recipient of the Mandela metal awarded by the Attorney General of Ontario for contributions to letters and law professor of crossman's teaching and scholarly interests include family law, law and sexuality, human rights, censorship and freedom of expression. Her book, sexual citizens. The legal and cultural regulation of sex and belonging was published by Stanford University press in 2007. Professor Cossman, uh, other publications include the coauthored bad attitudes on trial, pornography, feminism and the Butler decision and censorship in the arts. Jordan Peterson and meet my immediate left is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and a clinical psychologist with his students and colleagues. Professor Peterson has published more than a hundred scientific papers on a wide range of topics in social psychology.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       He's the author of maps of meaning, the architecture of belief, a book which also forms the basis of one of his, uh, u of t classes. He's presented many of his lectures online, including the virtue of necessity. More recently, he has released the three part online series entitled Professor Against Political Correctness. This morning's forum will be moderated by Professor Mayo Moran, the provost and Vice Chancellor of the Trinity College and a law professor and former dean of the u of t law school. She writes about legal theory and problems of responsibility, including a book on the reasonable person published by Oxford University press. She is currently writing about the problem of the past for Provost Moran has done policy work on issues ranging from how to protect public participation in policy debates to accessibility, sexual violence and residential schools. She teaches a course called 10 cases about the, uh, 10 cases that change the world. It's of course I'd like to take that was recently listed by Maclean's magazine as one of u of t's cool courses. I thought. Cool is old, old fashioned now, but they, uh, the Faculty of Arts and science at the University of Toronto in is very grateful to all of the panelists for agreeing to take part in this morning's forum. And I would like now to call on Professor Moron to briefly describe the format of today's

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       discussion. Professor,

Speaker 3:          00:06:26       thank you very much Dean Cameron and welcome to everyone. I have a little bit of Laryngitis, so please excuse me if my voice isn't as strong as usual. Um, this forum, as you know, uh, today is designed as an academic discussion as Dean Cameron said on issues arising out of the current debate on the provisions of Bill See 16 and the gender provisions of the Ontario Human Rights Code.

Speaker 2:          00:06:52       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:06:52       Critically examining and in our hope illuminating the great policy issues of the day is a vital role for the university. The university is uniquely well situated because within the confines of the university we have people as students would know, who are experts on every possible topic and who have devoted their lives to understanding those topics. So the university is probably the best possible place, uh, to debate the great issues of the day, the issues that are causing controversy and discussion and to critically examine, uh, the public arguments in light of fact and reason. And that is the spirit in which we gather here today. So thank you for joining us and thank you to our panelists.

Speaker 3:          00:07:40       Um, in, in doing that, in pursuing that mission, as Dean Cameron said, uh, we seek to further at the twin, um, principles of the University of open dialogue and also tolerance. We acknowledge of course that sometimes those principles are intention with each other. But respect for both is absolutely critical to the mission of the university. I would like to begin by acknowledging that the subject matter that we're discussing today may be difficult and that audience members and indeed participants will have strong feelings about the subject matter that we're discussing. Um, we have arranged for support for anyone who would like it just outside the room and bearing in mind the nature of the discussion that we're having and our objectives, which are two aluminate discuss and understand. I would ask that members of the audience, even if you don't agree with some of the speakers to please allow them to voice their opinions. There will be time for questions at the end.

Speaker 2:          00:08:40       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:08:41       I now like to just say a couple of things about how we plan to, um, uh, how we constructed the forum, which we did a in dialogue with the participants. Um, so we're going to begin by, um, having, um, it'll be hundred minutes long and the first segment we'll discuss the provisions of bill. See 16 in the Ontario Human Rights Code and we'll focus especially on freedom of expression and human rights law. In that first segment, we will begin with Professor Peterson who will speak for 10 minutes followed by Professor Cossman who will speak for 10 minutes and we do have a timekeeper. Can you wave your hand? There we go. Uh, just to ensure we're trying to make sure, obviously we know there's lots to say on these topics. We're going to try to make sure that we've divided the time up and allocated it as fairly as possible. In the second segment of this discussion, we're again focusing on [inaudible] on the Ontario human rights code w we'll focus more on academic freedom, gender diversity and the implications for scholarship and teaching in that segment.

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       Professor Peterson will again begin and professor Bryson will follow and they will have 10 minutes each. Following that, I will have a short a period to just ask some clarifying questions of the speakers and I've agreed with the speaker so we'll keep our answers to three minutes each. I won't ask questions that are longer than three minutes. Just again in an effort to ensure that we have as much opportunity to air some of the issues that people might be thinking about as possible. Following that, we'll have 30 minutes for questions from the audience. You can see up here that you can email questions to that email address. If you don't have email here. Um, we have pencil and paper and people will go around and gather questions and then we'll have some people curate the questions and bring them back to me and I will ask them again in an effort to get as many of the issues as possible on the table. And the speakers have all agreed kindly. Again, they'll keep their answers to three minutes each. So thank you all very much. Um, and with that, um, I would like to begin and uh, I will ask a professor Peterson to start.

Speaker 4:          00:10:55       Thank you. Thanks. So, um, I'd like if you wouldn't mind, I'd like the audience to do something with me. The first thing I'd like them to do if you would, is if all the women in the audience would stand up. That would be much appreciated.

Speaker 5:          00:11:16       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:11:17       Okay. Now, thank you very much. Now perhaps all the men would stand up.

Speaker 4:          00:11:25       Okay, good. Sorry, I did a rough count when I came in here and I might be out, but I'm not out by March. I think it's about two to one males in here. And I thought I'd point that out because it's, it's kind of interesting to me because I'm a personality psychologist and this debate is about ideas and there's a personality trait called openness, which is associated with intellect and creativity and there are pronounced gender differences in openness such that men are higher and intellect, which encompasses interest in ideas and women are hiring is theoretics which encompasses interest in while in art and literature and that sort of thing. And it's partly for that reason that men read more nonfiction and women read more fiction. And I just wanted to point out that there was a natural gender divide that occurred automatically and without compulsion in this particular case, in the case of this debate and that the more our society, uh, enforces, it's increasingly absurd demands for equity upon everyone, the less likely it is that such natural divisions will be able to manifest them in ours, manifest themselves in our society, in keeping with the pronounced in deep differences between the genders.

Speaker 4:          00:12:37       So I just thought that makes an interesting initial, uh, what would you call it? Real world demonstration. So, okay. So about two months ago made these videos, um, I did it because I was trying to articulate my concerns. Um, um, for a variety of reasons. I've been keeping an eye on political correctness for a long time and I was also very upset with the human resources and Equity Department's decision to make antiracism so-called antiracism and antibiose training mandatory for their staff, which I regard as an unacceptable intrusion into their staffs, right to their political opinion, as well as noting that there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that mandatory anti racism and anti bias training has, it's has the impact that is claimed. In fact, the empirical evidence suggests quite the contrary when you mandate that sort of thing, you actually make more people more prejudiced. It's also based on what I would say is a rather pernicious form of pseudo science that's being promoted by social psychologists to group that I have a fair bit of trouble with and that's been transformed into a kind of educational fascism that has no grounding whatsoever in the empirical literature.

Speaker 4:          00:13:44       Now, what happened as a consequence of making these videos was, um, was really quite unexpected to me. There. We've, we've been trying to keep count, there's been 140 print articles published about this, whatever this is in the last two months. And then dozens and dozens of, of youtube videos and television interviews and radio interviews and demonstrations. Millions of people have been tuning into this online. And so obviously something's up and I can tell you that what's up isn't only a discussion about bill see 16 and about gendered pronouns. You know, sometimes when you're having a debate or discussion with someone that you love and you're having a little argument about something like who's going to do the dishes or something like that. Or you know how it, especially if you haven't been getting along very well with that person, you know how the discussion starts with something specific and then you start trading all the things that it might be about until you're arguing about, you know, the way that you behaved on your third date, you know, 10 years ago.

Speaker 4:          00:14:42       And the whole underlying unresolved chaos of your relationship emerges through the little portal that was defined by the argument, you know, well that's what this is about. So what, what the Hell's going on here? Exactly. And why are we, are we damn near at each other's throats? Look at what happened in the United States a week and a half ago. There's been things to talk about here in, I started to try to talk about the men. I would say that my freedom to do so was rapidly infringed upon. My career was put at risk. And, and I find this absolutely unacceptable because I am trying to sort this out and believe me, you know what you call people, you can't talk to enemies. And if we want to divide our society into armed camps of enmity, all we have to do is keep doing what we're doing. And I would recommend that we don't do this.

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       I've studied authoritarianism for a very long time. I know what happens when things get out of control and it can happen extraordinarily rapidly. And I would say we're on the cusp of that. And so we need to start talking and listening. And when you talk, it doesn't mean you're right. It doesn't mean you're correct, right? It means you're trying to articulate and formulate your thoughts, like the bone headed more on that you are, and you're going to stumble around idiotically because what the hell do you know? You're full of biases and you're ignorant than you can't speak very well and you're over emotional and you know you've got just problems that you can hardly even imagine that are interfering with your ability to state something clear. And so what you do is you do your best to say what you mean and then you listen to other people tell you why you're a blithering idiot.

Speaker 4:          00:16:13       And hopefully you can correct yourself to some degree as a consequence of listening to them. And you see that's what free speech is about because you have to, it, it isn't just the people can, can organize themselves and their societies by thinking you can't do that because there's only one of you. What you have to do is you have to articulate your thoughts in a public forum so that other people can attack you and hopefully in a corrective manner. And then you want to, you know, step back a little bit and think, okay, well you know I was a little arrogant there and I was a little over emotional there and I didn't get that quite right. And maybe I'm outright biased on that front. And you, you want to correct what you say because then you correct how you are and then you correct how you act in life and then you correct your society.

Speaker 4:          00:16:54       And to the degree that we limit free freedom of expression, we put all of that at risk. You know, I'm a clinical psychologist and one of the things, there's two things that we kind of know about why clinical psychology works and one is that people get stronger if they voluntarily expose themselves to things they're afraid of and that they're disgusted by. It's like a, it's a hallmark of clinical psychotherapy. And I would say it's also the defining characteristic of, of appropriate human adaptation, right? Is that you have to confront the chaotic things that you don't understand and then learn to master them and articulate them. And the other is that clinical psychotherapy works because people can come say into my office and they can say whatever they have to say, no matter how incoherent it is or how psychotic it is or, or how overbearing it is or confused or jumbled.

Speaker 4:          00:17:38       And sometimes it takes my clients months or years of continual conversation just to start to untie the hundreds of thousands of knots that have been badly tied in their minds. So, and that's partly why I don't believe that freedom of speech is just another value. I think that's preposterous. I think that if you claim that, then you know nothing about Western civilization and history is freedom of speech is not just another principle. It's the mechanism by which we keep our psyches and our society's organized. And we have to be unbelievably careful about in infringing upon that because we're infringing upon the process by which we keep chaos and order balanced, you know? And, and if chaos and order go out of balance, then then then, then all hell breaks loose and the situation is not good. And we've seen that happen many, many times in the 20th century. Right. Since the late 18 hundreds our societies, western societies have been careening madly between the hyper repressive order of the radical right and the absolute devouring chaos of the radical left.

Speaker 4:          00:18:40       We've become unmoored. We've lost our bearings and the only thing that can possibly save us from continuing to do exactly that is the dialogue of exactly the sort that I'm, I'm, I'm describing at the moment and what we're attempting to do today in this forum. Thank God the university agreed to have this debate, you know, because there's things to talk about and if we don't talk about them, then we're going to fight. Well, what is this all about? I can list you some of the things that it's about, it's about inclusion versus bigotry and prejudice, right? It's about the left wing versus the right wing. It's about who's free to choose their language and what, what, what elements of respect that you're due to people who are different than you say with regards to Pronoun Use are chosen names. It's about whether the subject of or the object of is going to take precedence because implicit in bill [inaudible] 16 and I'm telling you there's an assault on the idea of objectivity itself, an assault on the idea of biology itself and if the university thinks that the sciences are going to be immune from the ideological doctrine that's embedded in these, in these pieces of legislation, they better think again because there there is trouble coming.

Speaker 4:          00:19:49       I know that [inaudible] already has an anti psychiatry program and we noticed the Ken Zucker got hounded out of this job just a few years ago even though he was an entirely credible scientist and clinician. So it's about constructionism, social constructionism versus positivism versus pragmatism and there's, there's a mother versus father thing going on here too and you know, you kind of saw that with Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump. I would say that was the overprotective devouring mother versus the tyrannical father, which is not a good, that's not a good narrative from a mythological perspective. It's about also the adversarial spirit I would say versus the logos. That's at the deepest possible level of analysis than the adversarial spirit is the spirit declaimed. What I think right now is correct above all else and I have nothing whatsoever to learn versus the logos and the logos is a very complex, uh, idea and maybe the deepest idea of, of humanity.

Speaker 4:          00:20:44       I would say certainly the deepest idea of western civilization. And that's that the proper citizen is the person who embodies truth in speech and attempts to act it out. And that also includes listening because listening is part of communicative intent. And I think at the moment that we're in, we're embroiled in a war on every single one of those dimensions and several others that I haven't had time to list. And the, the evidence that we're in that sort of war is precisely the fact that this is attracted so much attention. I mean, I just sat at my bloody office at home and threw up a couple of amateurish videos, more or less attempting to articulate my feelings about a couple of policies and it's like all hell broke loose and why? Well, because that hail is right underneath the surface. I think to stop there, but you're right.

Speaker 6:          00:21:32       I'm done.

Speaker 5:          00:21:35       [inaudible] thank you.

Speaker 6:          00:21:50       Thank you, Professor Moran. Provost Moran. Um, I'd like to start by saying that I'm delighted to be here today except that I'm not, and I'd like to start by saying how much I support and respect all those faculty, staff and students who are boycotting today's event. I think that that is also a very important form of speech.

Speaker 5:          00:22:10       The a couple of days ago,

Speaker 6:          00:22:13       um, the Oxford English dictionary announced the word of the year and it's post truth. It's relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief. So I worry about the ways that post post truth claims have been affecting public discussions around bill see 16 around the Ontario human rights code and around freedom of expression. There have been some profound,

Speaker 5:          00:22:44       okay,

Speaker 6:          00:22:46       it's not part of my time, that little correction. There've been some profound misunderstandings. I'm circulating about the law and I'm here today as a lawyer, as a law professor, as a civil libertarian, as an expert in equality rights and freedom of expression to try to correct those misunderstandings. So let's start with bill [inaudible] 16 which passed third reading yesterday in the house. It's the proposed federal legislation that does three things. First, it adds gender identity and expression to the Canadian human rights code. It will prevent the Canadian government, federal agencies and businesses within federal jurisdiction, which are quite limited banks, telecoms, airlines from discriminating on the basis of gender identity and expression. This is hardly unprecedented. Indeed. The federal government is late to this game. I'm starting in 2002 and moving forward. The Northwest Territory's Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundlands, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Quebec, British Columbia have already passed these protections.

Speaker 6:          00:23:48       Ontario has had these since 2002 the federal government here is simply playing catchup. There's absolutely nothing unprecedented in this. Number two, Bill See, 16 adds gender identity and gender expression to provisions in the criminal code that define an identifiable group for the purposes of advocating genocide. The public incitement of hatred and the willful promotion of hatred. So how might these provisions affect the use of pronouns and do these provisions in any way criminalize the use or misuse of pronouns, not even close. First, it is absolutely not advocating genocide. Now the last one wants to start talking about we should kill all the axes then that's advocating genocide, but pronoun use nowhere. Close public incitement of hatred. Well, the provisions of the Criminal Code requires that the incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace. Now, does that sound subjective? Well, the Supreme Court of Canada has said there's a very clear, there's a very clear definition.

Speaker 6:          00:24:55       The threshold is violence. In fact, there has to be personal violence. It is an extremely high threshold, and again, the misuse of pronouns doesn't come anywhere close. Finally, the willful promotion of hatred, so called hate speech provisions now hates be provisions in the criminal code have a very, very high threshold. The Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly defined hate speech as only including the most extreme forms of speech the court has said over and over again. And I quote it is quote the unusually strong and deep felt emotions of vilification and detestation the court has said it is not disdain, it is not dislike, it is not offense plus something that's often lost. Hate speech. Criminal charges cannot be laid without the approval of the attorney general. So this is a high threshold. They are very difficult charges to bring. Third Bill, see 16 adds gender identity and expression to the provisions of the criminal code that deal with sentencing for hate crimes.

Speaker 6:          00:26:02       Now here under this particular section seven 18 to a one w we tend to be concerned about numbers, um, evidence that an offense is motivated by bias, prejudice or hatred can be taken into account. In sentencing, we already take a range of things into account, race, national and ethnic origin, religion, sex, age and others. So now evidence of hatred on the basis of gender identity and expression could be taken into account. It's important to emphasize section seven 18 does not create any new offenses. It simply means that any existing offense in the criminal code like assault or sexual assault or murder, if it's motivated by hatred, could be given an increased sense. This has no impact on pronouns unless of course, and accused was misusing pronouns while assaulting sexually assaulting or murdering someone. In other words, there's nothing in Bilski 16 that comes close to criminalizing the misuse of pronouns.

Speaker 6:          00:27:05       Nothing, not hate speech, not hate crime. Now let's look at the Ontario Human Rights Code. So the Ontario Human Rights Code is a provincial law that protects individuals from discrimination in housing, Employment Services, vocational associations and contracts. It's not constitutional law, which limits government action. It's not criminal law where the state prosecutes individuals and sends them to jail. It's a type of civil law where private individuals can sue one another. Um, and the, the remedy is generally damages. The Ontario Human Rights Code was first passed in 1962. It protects people from all kinds of discrimination. It protects people from being fired on the basis of their race or it protects people from being denied housing on the basis of their religion or it protects people from being called the n word or any other racial epithet in the delivery of services like a university classroom. Since 2012 the Ontario Human Rights Code has prohibited discrimination and harassment on the basis of gender identity and expression.

Speaker 6:          00:28:10       It prevents discrimination and harassment against Trans and gender non binary individuals in employment, housing and services. So what does this require in relation to pronouns? According to the Ontario Human Rights Commission's policy section 7.4, it specifically said that refusing to refer to a person by their self identified name or proper Pronoun could constitute gender based harassment. And as a result of some q and a's that were released yesterday by the commission, uh, clarifying this question of Gender Pronoun use, um, uh, they stated the following, refusing to refer to a trans person by their chosen name and a personal pronoun that matches their gender identity or purposely misgendering will likely be discrimination when it takes place in a social arena. Covered by the code, including employment, housing services like education, but about gender neutral pronouns. Well, the commission has said the Ontario Human Rights Code does not require any particular gender neutral pronoun. If in doubt, ask the person how they wish to be addressed.

Speaker 6:          00:29:16       Use they if you don't know or simply use their chosen name. So what it seems to require is the use of he, she or they. And if you don't like that, then you can always just use their name. There is no question of the 31 flavors that has been put out there that is somehow being mandated. Um, this is about he, she, they, or if you don't like it, use a person's name. Some questions have arisen about this. Is this the first time that a law has decided what we must say as opposed to what we cannot say? No, not at all. Not even close. It's not uncommon for the law to require expression. Bilingual labeling requirements on food packaging, health warnings on cigarette packages, the oath of allegiance to the queen that must be sworn at citizenship. Ship ceremonies. Not only is forced expression, not new, there's an entire chapter dedicated to it in Peter Hogg's constitutional law of Canada.

Speaker 6:          00:30:14       Now, for those of you who don't know Peter Hog is in law, we usually deal with, we refer to him in a hushed voice. He is the leading authoritative, it is the leading authoritative texts in Canadian constitutional law by Canada's preeminent constitutional scholar and lawyer. Okay, so is it constitutional? Now, are these requirements around pronouns constitutional? Does the requirement to not miss gender? The pronouns violate freedom of expression under section two B of the Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms? Probably a does. The Supreme Court of Canada says any restriction on speech is a prime fascia violation of section two b. But the thing is that's not the end of the story. The charter rights are not absolute. No charter rights are absolute. There's this whole other section in the charter called section one which says that all rights and freedoms are subject to reasonable limits as are demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society.

Speaker 6:          00:31:09       The Supreme Court of Canada has developed a very complex test through which it balances rights. On the one hand and reasonable limits on the other. This is what the Supreme Court of Canada does in charter cases. And the Supreme Court of Canada has on numerous occasions considered whether restrictions on speech contained in human rights codes are constitutional. It has consistently, and I have to emphasize consistently held that although any speech restrictions that are contained in a human rights code may violate section two B of the charter. They are a reasonable limit within the meaning of section one. They held this in the case of Ross in the case of Taylor and most recently, unanimously by the court in 2013. Um, I have a little thing then about why all this matters and I'm out of time. But why it all matters is um, because people matter and I worry that we've moved into a place now a kind of not only a post truth politics, but a kind of post empathy politics where we no longer seem to care about people. And this at the end of the day is about people. It's about trans and gender non binary people. These are our children, our siblings, our nieces, our nephews. These are our friends, our neighbors, our colleagues, our lawyers are carpenters and our teachers. How bloody hard is it to simply treat these people with respect and dignity? Because all this is about

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       all human rights are about, is respect and dignity. And if he could throw in a little kindness on the top, that would be even better.

Speaker 5:          00:32:49       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:33:01       thank you very much. Uh, professor Cossman and now we will go back. So what number? I said we're after we do the first section. We're going to go back to Professor Peterson. And on this section we're going to focus a little bit more on academic freedom, gender diversity in some of the implications for scholarship and teaching. Um, so professor Peterson, I didn't bite you to go first again, 10 minutes. We'll have our, our time, our excellent timekeeper back there. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:33:34       So I'm gonna read you something that a graduate student sent me from the University of Toronto the other day. And I can also tell you that I've received hundreds of letters like this today. I had a tutorial at the University of Toronto where I talked about Jordan Peterson and issues of personal identity, legally sanctioned identity categories, et cetera. I brought up a video of a tall white man in his thirties who asked students out of university how they'd react if he told them. He identified as a woman, as black, as short and as five years old. Spoiler alert. Students in the video resists some of the later categories a bit better, mostly accepting still students were not engaging in discussion. I asked them why one said it was because she was worried to share her opinion for fear of being singled out or saying something offensive. I asked who else was not speaking for that reason. The whole class put their hands up. That was shocking to me. I encouraged them to speak despite their worries and they gave me some good feedback on how to make it easier for them to do so. For instance, by working in pairs and being assigned an opinion so that they didn't have to be responsible for it or feel bad for defending it. No participation. Why

Speaker 4:          00:35:09       they weren't on interested. They were afraid to speak their minds. The PC police are in your heads.

Speaker 4:          00:35:23       He just turned the lawyer's opinion. I have many lawyers opinions. By the way. I'll start with lawyer one who was the counsel to several prime ministers. He talked to me about the human rights tribunal cause I went and saw him two weeks after this all started. Human Rights Tribunal is a kangaroo court in my opinion, and it should be abolished as fast as possible. It's one of the many institutions in Canada that pose a threat to your, to your freedom that that is almost unimaginable proportions. Here's what this top lawyer told me. If I'm taking in front of the human rights tribunal and will cost me $250,000 I will pay the legal costs for my opponents and I will lose. He said, go back to your safe little life and shut your mouth. Second lawyer told me my critique of the Ontario Human Rights Commission is spot on and absent the charter of rights and freedoms, which has these contradictions built into it that you just heard described.

Speaker 4:          00:36:21       Much of what I was saying was illegal and has been illegal since 2012 lawyer three told me that if I breached a tribunal order, so imagine I was taken in front of the human rights tribunal and I was fine and then I refused to pay the fine, which I've stated that I would do that equals contempt of court, which inevitably means jail until the contempt is purged. He told me the social justice tribunals, and that's the technical name of these essentially extra judicial bodies in Ontario, by the way, the social justice tribunals. So the PC authoritarian types aren't even trying to hide their terminology anymore. The social justice tribunals and the sjws social justice warriors who staff them have a robe nature. They can search your house without a warrant. They can use secret hearings. There are no rules of evidence and the judges are unaccountable.

Speaker 4:          00:37:11       Your worst fears of the effect of a poorly written law will manifest in that environment. The sjw say only the worst of the worst. We'll get punished. Think again with them at the helm. Anything can and does happen, but those are legal opinions. Let's, let's look at a real world case. Let's look at what happened when I made my videos. Let's look at how the university responded because I can tell you in the video, I said, look, what I'm doing is probably illegal and worse, my employer is legally responsible for it because that's built in. That's built into the codes as well. So by the way, if you're an employer, you're responsible for everything that your employees say and everything that anybody interprets what they said as being, whether it's unintentional or intentional, whether or not a complaint has been made. So just think about that.

Speaker 4:          00:37:56       Anyways, October 3rd the university said like all members of the university community, I have an obligation to comply with the law, including the provisions of the Ontario Human Rights Code, their policy with regards to workplace harassment, which the university implied that I was engaging in engaging in a course of vexatious comment or conduct where the course of comment or conduct is known or ought reasonably be known to be unwelcome. That was the October 3rd letter, which was sent to me within one week of posting my videos. And it was the first. So what happened? Essentially it was the university reviewed what I had done and then they reviewed the policies as laid out on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website. Where are you guys can all go read them by the way. And then you can decide if, if, if the legal information that you were just provided with it, with his in any degree whatsoever accurate. Because I would say it isn't, um,

Speaker 4:          00:38:45       the university reviewed my videos and they decided that what I said was true. They decided that the video I made was probably illegal and if they were responsible for it. And so in an attempt to distance themselves from me under counsel from their legal people and believe me the university has good legal people, they sent me a warning and this is what happens if you want a discipline and recalcitrant employee essentially what, so that you don't have to bear legal responsibility for their acts. You send them a warning to show that you're not in favor of what they're doing. Then if they continue, you send them another warning and then if they continue you send them a third warning. And after the third warning you can take further steps. Now I pointed out to the university at one point when when, um, we were discussing how this forum was going to proceed, that perhaps it would be in their best interests to not support the people who are trying to stop me from talking, but instead to support me legally and if necessary, to take this all the way to the supreme court. And the university said categorically that they would not do that. So I would say when it comes to the contradictory provisions that are in the Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms, and so we might say roughly equality versus freedom of speech, the university decided which side they're going to go down on. And you know, people tell you all the time,

Speaker 5:          00:39:54       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:39:55       that this has to do with compassion. You know, and it's obviously the case that all of the compassion in this disgust is discussion is on the side of the people who are, who are, um, any encouraging their listeners to play victim and perpetrator. And I can tell you as a psychoanalytically oriented psychologists that there's nothing more horrible for children and developing people than an excessive compassion, right? That's the standard Friday and devouring mother. And if you want a little archetype, uh, to go along with that, I suppose most of you have seen, um, the little mermaid. You Remember Ursula? Ursula wants to put King Poseidon's soul in a little jar in her collection and she wants to take away Ariel's voice so she can't establish herself as a conscious being in the world. And I would suggest very strongly that all these people that continually talk to you about compassion do not in the least have your best interests in mind.

Speaker 4:          00:40:48       And there are far more virtues and values than an excessive pity for people. You know, you don't want a pitty your children even. You want to encourage them to develop and strong and in a strong and forthright manner so that they can go out and take on the world. And an excess of compassion just to ensures that when they're 40 they're going to be living in your basement plotting evil routines about the world because their ability to manifest themselves as successful beings has been absolutely compromised. And I think that we're seeing this played out. We're busy, we're seeing this played out in society and, and I think it's absolutely horrifying. So on October 18th the university mentioned to me in another warning letter that if personal pronouns are being used, the refusal to use the personal pronoun that is an expression of the person's gender identity can constitute discrimination.

Speaker 4:          00:41:37       So now you see what's happened is that I haven't refused to use someone's gendered gender neutral pronouns I said that I would refuse. So it's not even the refusal itself that's producing the letters. It's my declared intent to engage in the refusal. And as far as I was concerned, what I was essentially doing was criticizing a piece of legislation that had not yet been passed, but the university's legal department decided that all that was sufficient for them to distance themselves from me and to engage in disciplinary activity. So, and then with regards to these human rights tribunals where all of this stuff would be sorted out, it's like those places destroy your reputation and destroy you financially and can they put you in jail? Well, it's a complicated argument in some sense, but I can tell you that if you refuse to pay the fine.

Speaker 4:          00:42:22       So that's the next step. So I think you're being sold a bill of goods here about how benevolent the intent of bill see 16 is. And I also know because another lawyer told me that the, because I suspected that the Ontario Human Rights Commission, people were behind all of this legislation essentially speaking in Canada and that that's actually the case because the federal people have indicated that these policies will be interpreted, interpreted in accordance with the Ontario Human Rights Commission's policies online. And so you guys should go read those because those are not fun. And I would say that they pose an incredible threat to your liberty and it's all done under the guise of compassion. So like I don't consider myself a particularly compassionate person, let's say. I think I'm more compassionate that I should be for my own wellbeing. But I can tell you that that is not the only virtue. And people who keep pushing that on you are making a massive mistake and their infant tantalizing you and they're terrifying people in the university community as you can tell by the letter that I just read it and I've really, I received dozens of letters like that. People are afraid to say anything because they're going to get targeted. And if you wonder or not, if that's true, then just think about what happened to me and ask yourself if it's true.

Speaker 4:          00:43:31       Good enough. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          00:43:33       [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:43:46       So professor Bryson, can we have you speak next and uh, may I just say thank you for coming out from Vancouver, uh, to join us. Every, everyone else here is from University of Toronto, but professor Bryson came out from Vancouver, so thank you.

Speaker 7:          00:44:00       Thank you, provost Moran. What a wild ride we're on this morning. We're all doing okay so far. I think as a Trinity College and Oil z alumnus, I'm typically delighted to return to the University of Toronto. Today is different to make sense of what it means to be here today. I've found myself going back frequently to the 1989 debate at western on the subject of race and Iq between Phillip Rushton, David Suzuki, the stakes then and now we're very familiar to borrow David Suzuki to opening words on that day. Quote, I do not want to be here. I do not want to dignify this man and his ideas in public debate and quote yesterday Bill See 16 passed third reading in the House of Commons and tomorrow is a trans day of remembrance. If you only hear this, know that I am unwavering in my belief that the fundamental rights to safety and the humanity of trans and non binary people are not up for debate.

Speaker 7:          00:45:13       There was, there was in 1989 at Western as now an extraordinary media frenzy concerning the apparent threat to academic freedom posed by the mere possibility that academic freedom is not an absolute guarantee that has scholars our relationship with knowledge and with the public trust is tempered by responsibilities and limitations of crucial. Important to my argument today is that this is a relationship structured not on juridical grounds. This is not about the law but on ethical grounds. The very real effects of the knowledge claims that we make as scholars require that our claims be subjected to rigorous critical scrutiny. And there is no set of knowledge claims. More important to subject to critical scrutiny than statements that appear to perpetuate and to insight already existing forms of hatred, violence, and prejudice toward members of minority groups. We need to identify and address the claims made in the recent public works of Jordan Peterson claims about trans people claims about the validity of gender identity claims about the proper use of pronouns and claims about academic freedom rights.

Speaker 7:          00:46:39       And let's be clear, we have a unique difficulty here today in subjecting these claims to scholarly scrutiny. What kind of claims can you have? An amateurish videos, although this man is making these claims, has Dr. Jordan Peterson as a professor and a clinical psychologist employed at a great Canadian University. The claims are not being made in relation to any publicly accessible body of peer reviewed scholarship. So why this, why now? The recent public works of Jordan Peterson provide a fabulous case study of the cultural production of true believers, the cultural production of ignorance in an age of reactionary populism, the cultural, a historian of cancer, Robert proctor coined the term ag natology to describe systematic attention to the production of ignorance and let's not beat around the bush. Bad Science is deadly, whether in the area of cancer or gender and population health. The cultural production of ignorance does not point to a vacuum, but rather represents a deliberate relationship to knowledge that is consequential in our lives.

Speaker 7:          00:47:59       For proctor, the tactics used by the tobacco industry provide a perfect example of how doubt and controversy are enlisted to produce ignorance. So let's take a look at how consequential and studied ignorance works in relation to gender. Here are the major claims of Dr Peterson's recent public works. Specifically the first of three lectures concerning bill see 16 and I will quote directly here from my lecture transcript bill. See 16 scares me lectures, Dr. Peterson, the Ontario Human Rights Commission is a particularly pathological organization. Social Justice Warrior types are overrepresented and I can't help but think it's because our current premier is a lesbian and the lgbt community has become extraordinarily good at organizing themselves and has a fairly pronounced and very, very sophisticated radical fringe. I'll carry on, and I quote, gender identity and gender expression are not valid ideas. They're not true. There's no evidence for it. I don't know what the options are if you don't identify as a man or a woman.

Speaker 7:          00:49:22       There's an idea that there's a gender spectrum. I think it's an ill informed opinion and quote rather than to address himself to this scientific evidence concerning gender identity and expression and by adopting rhetorical strategies more common to Breitbart news.com than a university professors lecture. Dr. Peterson goes on to discredit the very constructs on political grounds instead of on grounds provided by scholarly evidence that these constructs are in no particular order leftist radical and politically correct on the subject of pronouns and gender expression. Dr. Peterson is in phatic. That quote, I don't recognize another person's right to determine what pronouns I use to address them. I won't do it. For the vast majority of people. He goes on to say gender identity and sexual orientation and I guess he means sex are the same thing. And quote, as for the definition of transgender, Dr. Peterson claims that, and I quote, I don't believe that they, these people, these terms stand for good things.

Speaker 7:          00:50:37       I think that these people use these terms as a pretense that they stand for good things as a pretext for them to continue their nefarious activities and quote, well, this is hardly the stuff of academic scholarship. I'm a member of the global education initiative of the World Professional Association for transgender health and I can tell you without a shred of doubt that there is no link between the public claims made by professor Jordan Peterson about gender generally and transgender specifically, and a body of easily accessible peer reviewed scholarship. This body of peer reviewed research knowledge provides conclusive evidence that whereas anatomical sex is perhaps dimorphic Lee categorical and that's only if we choose to ignore intersects, that secondary sex characteristics cannot be argued simplistically to be determined by Chromosomal sex and that there is highly significant diversity in gender identity and expression which exists on a continuum that reveals persistent differences that cannot be explained by sex assigned at birth.

Speaker 7:          00:51:53       Gender identity and expression are dynamic bio social aspects of human diversity that are culturally and socially in a complex relationship with matter. Gender identity and expression are linked both to the extraordinary plasticity of human life and the fluidity of identity and as well. And this is where we must pay close attention linked to gender based violence to minority stress and threats to a whole host of rights in Canada that are not up for debate here today. These rights include the right to recognition, the right to communicability of presence, the right to culturally competent institutional climates, and perhaps the most profound of all rights, the right to safety and the right to culture and access to knowledge. Whereas almost all the media attention on the Jordan Peterson affair has focused on the possible threat to his academic freedom. I want to focus instead on the ethical significance of an academic's total dereliction of academic responsibility.

Speaker 7:          00:53:02       Academics are never free to distribute totally bogus claims while trading on the value provided by their title as a professor in a great Canadian University, and perhaps even worse as a clinician registered by an accreditation body, quite the contrary, every faculty member takes on academic responsibilities that embody an ethical commitment, which is precisely not responsibilities required by the law. Academic knowledge that appears to codify knowledge about minority populations must not add to the harms already facing minority groups by itself contributing to the consolidation of ignorance, nor by inciting hatred toward members of these groups. Faced with Phillip Russians perpetuation of racist assumptions in his research on race and Iq in the 1989 debate, David Suzuki concludes that one can only infer quote. He is either grossly ignorant or deliberately mischievous. Either way, what is required is action by scientists and academics. His claims must be denounced. This is not science and quote. Surely the deliberate production of ignorance concerning a precarious minority group constitutes evidence of the most unethical abnegation of the responsibility of academics to contribute to human wellbeing, collective intelligence flourishing, and the survival of planetary life. The institution of the Public University cannot and must not sanction ignorance. And most emphatically we must denounce the deliberate cultural production of ignorance. We can and we must do better and we must do better. Not because it is prescribed by the law, but because we have an ethical commitment to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in a democratic society. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:55:09       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       thank you all very much. Um, and so now I'm going to just ask a few questions of clarification. We'll go more or less in the order that the speakers went. And then as I indicated, there are questions from the audience. You can email them. The address is there. Um, I think there are people in the room. There we go. There are a few people. So put up your hands if you don't have a capacity to email and they'll get around to you. We won't be able to ask, answer all the questions some or post them, but we'll do our best. Um, so professor Peterson, I'll start with you since you were the first speaker. Um, of course there, there are a few lawyers on the stage here. Law seems to figure very prominently in your argument and in many of your concerns. And Professor Cossman is obviously set out a number of the issues in terms of what the laws to actually say.

Speaker 3:          00:56:12       You cited in response a number of legal experts and one of the things about legal experts as there are a lot of them and they often don't agree. Um, but um, in law we tend to between the law as it is and the laws we would like it to be. And the experts you cited seem to be critical of the law as it is, um, along with you. Um, but does professors costs minutes outlining of some of the elements of see 16 in particular, does that give you any comfort? Does that allay any of your concerns that it really focuses on the advocacy of genocide or the commission of hate crimes? And that those kinds of things are probably the sort of restrictions that most people in the room would think were reasonable restrictions. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:56:58       No, are you just give me any comfort. Um, and the reason it doesn't give me any comfort is because as far as I'm concerned, what this is actually about has already played itself out in my case. And I already explained, explained that to you. Um, I want to tell you some of the pernicious things about the, about the legislation and this is, and she means see 16, is that what you are actually, I mean the policy guidelines that it will be interpreted with him because the legislation itself is only a couple of paragraphs in it and it looks innocuous. But you know, I would say a, a legal doctrine is something like a virus and it has a life if you output, we think if you, if you let it go into a living system that it propagates and it has effects and the effects are a consequence of the philosophy that's embedded inside the law.

Speaker 4:          00:57:44       And if you really want to know about this, you should read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn school like archipelago. Because what he does in that book is tell you how the hypothetically humane doctrines that were embedded in radical Marxism at the end of the 18 hundreds unfolded into Soviet society and demolished it along with many other societies. I might, I might point out 10. He won the Nobel prize for that for no small reason and was regarded as one of the people who brought down the Soviet Union. And so it's a masterpiece. That book, and this is a complex issue, and to understand it, you have to do that sort of reading. But I want to tell you a little bit about what the law does. And this is with regards to its interpretation from the policy guidelines. It instantiates social constructionism into our legal system. You have to understand what that means.

Speaker 4:          00:58:26       There's a huge debate about how human identity is, is, is, um, uh, upon what grounds human identity is predicated. Now the radical social constructionists basically say that identity is nothing but a social construction and not that's in keeping with their philosophical doctrines. Partly Marxist and Parsley, partly postmodern, but that isn't, and that was what I was objecting to with regards to bill [inaudible] because it insists, do you understand this? It makes this legal doctrine, that biological sex, gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation very independently and they don't. Now the reason they don't is because 98% of people, it's 99.7% of people, by the way, at least with regards to the most credible statistics have a gender identity. This essentially identical with their biological sex and almost everybody who is male and female by sex and gender identity dresses that way. And that's what gender expression essentially is.

Speaker 4:          00:59:26       And then if you stack those three things on top of each other, they're basically isomorphic. You can add sexual orientation to that and 98% of people are heterosexual. So the idea that those things very independently is absolutely preposterous, but it's written into the law and that has terrible consequences. You see, I don't know, for example, now to what degree, any discussion in universities of the biological differences between men and women are legal and you think, oh, well that's an exaggeration. It's like, well, I debated Nicholas Matte, I believe that was his name. A professor at the University of Toronto on TV owes the agenda and he said, write out for everyone to hear that the scientific consensus is that there's no biological differences between men and women. And I've received letters from people who've told me that now the social justice activist types are complaining about the fact that the biologists assign biological sex to animals because it's only a social construct that we're projecting onto their being. And, um, you know, we just heard that the co, the chromosomal level of analysis is complex. It's not that complex. What we have is a bi modal distribution with a tiny number of exceptions in that, by the way, is not a spectrum. You see these words?

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       We're up. You'll have other questions.

Speaker 5:          01:00:46       Nope.

Speaker 3:          01:00:54       Uh, professor Cossman, it just sort of picking up on some of the, uh, items that Professor Peterson just mentioned. He was talking about social construction is, and then, uh, the idea that this is a very novel, um, issue when the law that like, you know, that the uh, see 16 one of the concerns about it, even if it isn't exactly, um, the specific provisions of the legislation, it's the fact that it's instantiating this kind of social construction into the realm of legal regulation. Do you, you're, you're an expert in law. Do you have any thoughts or comments about that? Um, I think that any of us who are experts in law would have something to say about that. Um, the law has been regulating social constructionism and social constructs since there was law, um, language, nationality, religion, citizenship, family, marriage. There's no there, there, there are social constructs are social constructs go to the very root of our common law, tradition, property, property, law, okay, sure. Property exists. It's there, right? But the idea that we own it, the idea that we own property is entirely socially constructed. Um, intangible property futures, contingent liabilities. Where are they? I can't feel them. I can't feel them there. Where are they? They're socially constructed. These are the things that law regulates. Um, let me talk about one that you know, that Professor Peterson is, is quite fond

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       of. Um, the right to freedom of expression. This is entirely a social construction of the enlightenment. It didn't exist before the enlightenment, um, of humanism and of liberalism. It depends on our understanding of democracy. It depends on our understanding of what a right is. It depends on our understanding of what a freedom is. And it depends on our understanding of what expression is. The idea that the law regulates social constructs is beyond irrelevant. It doesn't tell us anything about good social constructs and bad social constructs. It doesn't tell us anything about good laws versus bad laws. And one of the things that Professor Peterson seems to misunderstand is this difference between the law as it is and the law as he might like it to be. I have lots of disagreements with the law as it is, but what I've come and done here today is explained to you what the law is today and you might criticize it, but that's just what the law is.

Speaker 6:          01:03:25       And it disturbs me profoundly that Professor Peterson without arguments or support has done effectively a post truth claim on me. He has basically said, you're wrong. There's no arguments, there's no evidence, there's no support. That my description of what the law is as a 30 year expert in this field is simply wrong. Um, you know, I don't think it's wrong. I have some opinions on maybe how the law ought to be, but what I've done is I've common, I've described how it is. There's also I think a very important distinction that's being missed here about the penalties that are attached to different laws. Criminal laws involve imprisonment. Civil laws involve damages and restitution. An Ontario Human Rights Commission offense will result in a financial or a non financial penalty such as rehiring or training. So what happens if a person refuses to pay the fine? You don't get to go to jail. I'm sorry. You don't. Um, the mechanisms of civil enforcement come into effect. The two most common forms of enforcing judgements are seizure and sale of assets. And if your assets do not sufficiently cover the fine, then your wages will be garnished. It's about money. So yes, it's true. Your assets might be seized, your income might be garnished, but you don't get to go to jail. Huh.

Speaker 5:          01:04:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:04:59       um, so we'll go back now to professor Peterson cause there were two segments that we've agreed that we, we'd go back to him. And actually I think you were just starting at the end of your, um, of your discussion in your answer to the last question to talk a little bit about, uh, some of the points that professor Bryson made your, your picture of gender and, and the relationship between sex and gender in some of those issues. And um, you know, she, she lays out some of the science and some of the actual scientific findings, um, around those, around those issues. And I wonder when you, when you take a look at some of that research, does it, how does it affect your, your thinking on some of these questions about, in particular the point some people think of as perhaps a rather simplified picture of sex and gender

Speaker 4:          01:05:47       there. Okay. Well, a couple of things. The first thing I do, I want to make a quick comment about, um, Dr Crossman's critique of my analysis because she actually didn't address it. I didn't say that the law shouldn't regulate social constructions. That's what the law does. That's what she said. That isn't what I said. I said that the law now builds in a social constructionist doctrine into the fabric of the law. That's not the same thing. Obviously the law regulates property rates in all of that and to some degree those are social constructions, although not to the degree that she claims, but this is a whole different thing. This builds in a philosophy I've identity and one of the things that builds in for example, is the claim that identity is only subjectively defined and that's built right in. It says that your identity is whatever you think it is.

Speaker 4:          01:06:35       Well, let me tell you, as a practicing psychologist, that's absolute rubbish. Your identity to look when, when children are two years old, that's what they think. They think that their subjective reality is everything. And what you do is you socialize them between the ages of two and four to adopt an identity that's part of a cultural negotiation. It's like your identity as part of a cultural negotiation. It's partly the game you play in partly the game that I play with you and I have to be a voluntary participant in that. And not only, not only is it not subjectively defined, which detaches it entirely, by the way, from the underlying biological and the underlying objective reality making any claim you want for your subjective identity. Valid. The other thing it does is, um,

Speaker 4:          01:07:25       it did completely oblivious. It's the idea that identity is actually a Prac pragmatic entity for God's sake. It's like if you're a lawyer or a father or mother, like an identity that has some solidity to it, say, well, for most lawyers anyways, so I'm sorry I couldn't help it. Your identity is also a vehicle within which you traveled through life, right? It's a set of tools, a set of pragmatic tools that you use to interact with the social and the natural world. It's not only your subjective whim. So, okay. And so with regards to the science, it's like really, you know, I can give you just one example and oh and I'll start with this and hopefully I can do it quickly. The idea of gender identity, which is only defined subjectively in, in the, in the relevant law has been studied intensively by personality psychologist such as myself.

Speaker 4:          01:08:18       In fact, my lab has done some of the, I wouldn't say the most fundamental research on it, but you know, we're in the boat and we're in the ballpark. Here's a little story. Okay. So the, the differences between personality between men and women are basically what constitutes gender identity. And in so far as it's not merely subjective. And one of the things that's happened is that as the Scandinavian countries have equalized their political and sociological landscape, the differences in identity between men and women have got larger, not smaller. Do you understand that? That's a refutation of the social constructionist claim. So what happens is that if you flatten out the landscape so that there are very few socioeconomic differences say, or sociological differences in the treatment between men and women, what happens is the biological difference maximizes, it maximizes the understand that means men and women get more different, not more the same. And the thing about women in the audience, bloody hell you should think about this because don't you want to pursue the things that you're interested in? And if you pursue the things that you're interested in, cause you're interested in different things than men, I'm telling Ya. And if you look at the interest, if you look at the interest variation, this has been established technically. If you look at the interest variation, there's almost no overlap between men and women. If you sum up the differences in interest, interest in temperament. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:09:36       No.

Speaker 3:          01:09:45       So I think that this provides perhaps a good segway pat back to a professor Bryson. Um, just to talk a little bit, um, uh, but about some of the claims about in particular, um, you know, what, what does some of the evidence, what does some of the, um, whether it's sort of the objective realities in this situation that we might hold on to

Speaker 7:          01:10:10       one objective reality is what happens when you stop reading. So I'm going to recommend that for anyone who's interested in a current review of the literature on sex, gender, and gender differences, that you take a look at Rebecca Jordan Young or an fosto sterling who provide extraordinary and very detailed reviews of this literature. And actually it comes down to the fact that science about causality, about in essence, sex being linked and producing gender requires us to move outside of the current realm. All we have in this realm is quite high experimentation. We can't actually do studies where we manipulate the chromosome or the hormonal environment. And so since we can't remove sexism and misogyny from the production of gender, we can actually reach conclusions about what we take to be gender differences. And so although it plays really well on the cover of people magazine, brain sex, or whatever, a kind of arm chairs science that we want to rely on for cocktail party Chit Chat, this is not the stuff of nature.

Speaker 7:          01:11:21       And by nature I don't mean something that we take for granted. I mean the peer reviewed academic journal. So it's really good to keep reading if you're going to be employed at a great Canadian university point to pronouns. Let's put pronouns in some kind of context. And I think it's really helpful in going back to what Justice Minister Wilson Raybould said yesterday, following the passing of [inaudible] 16 and I'll quote, it's our collective responsibility to recognize and reduce the vulnerability of Trans gender diverse person's to discrimination, hate crimes and hate propaganda. And a lot of what we've been hearing here is hate propaganda. So what I want to say about pronouns is that we have to get beyond this simplistic discussion, which is either about grammatical, infelicity, singular plural, or that we should be nice to people. We actually have to deal with our responsibility in creating institutional climates that take very seriously the goal of reducing inequality.

Speaker 7:          01:12:27       That has always been the fundamental goal of education. So at the University of British Columbia, the trends to spirit and gender diversity task force is looking at everything in the context of what Greg Bower and her amazing colleagues at Trans Paul's call institutional and informational eraser. We are looking at housing, student health, how were trans and gender diverse students going to go to student health and get care that is both medically and culturally competent. How should we be organizing student information systems so that people can tell us their names and their pronouns? This is a technical challenge only and we have to rise to the challenge.

Speaker 4:          01:13:11       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:13:12       thank you. So now I know that there is much, much more to say an ever, but I have some questions from the audience. So I'd like to read those and, and I'll try again, uh, just to divide up the time and the questions are hopefully as fairly as possible. Um, so professor Peterson, let's start with you. Uh, so this question says, you present your issue with bill, see 16 to be that the infringement of freedom of expression regarding gender pronouns. See as a problem. Do you hold the same stance with other discriminatory language and the human rights code such as being able to use racist terms with regard to students? And if you believe that one of these things is a violation but not the other one. Why? I'm not sure I read that over all that well, but

Speaker 4:          01:14:00       okay. So one, one thing I would like to point out before I answer that just so you will notice is that I have in fact been denounced today and what I am saying has in fact described as hate propaganda. So one thing I'd like to suggest to you, every single person in the audience you're next. So keep it in mind. All right. So with regards to the question, well first of all,

Speaker 4:          01:14:30       I don't think that these issues are the same. I don't think they're the same at all. I mean, I think being thinking about the pronoun thing, you know, because one of the things that people, uh, it put me back on my heels for a while because the claim was basically, well, it's something like why doesn't the mean professor just play nice and, and respect people by using their pronouns? And it took me like three weeks to unpack that because who gets questioned about Pronoun use? I don't know why the hell I use the pronouns I use, I use them because they're part of the language I use. He and she, because that's what everyone uses. And so then I had to think about, well why, why do we in fact use pronouns? And we use them in part for the same reason that we use other categories.

Speaker 4:          01:15:06       And that's to simplify the world for functional purposes. Roughly speaking. But then I was thinking, well, is the use of he and she a mark of respect? And the answer to that is, well, no, it's not a mark of respect. It can't be a mark of what you call 4 billion people. Can't be a mark of respect. Right. It's, it's a mark of basic categorization. And so then the claim comes up, well if someone wants you to use a particular Pronoun, then you're disrespecting them. If you don't, it's like, hmm, okay, let's think that through a bit. Well that assumes that when I'm using he or she for, for people and you know, in normal parlance that I'm actually indicating my respect for them. And that's not true. It's like if I don't know you, I, Claudius classify you generically and basically I classify you in terms of how you present yourself publicly.

Speaker 4:          01:15:51       I suppose that's your gender expression and then I nail you with whatever pronoun and seems to fit. It has nothing to do with respect. And besides that, you bloody well don't get to demand my respect. Why should you, you know, I mean, it's not like I respect everyone. That's a foolish thing to do. You respect people who were respectable. You know, you, you make value distinctions between people and that doesn't mean you illegally discriminate against them. Those aren't the same thing. But I'm all for value judgments. If, if you don't buy value judgments, then why bother learning anything? Why, why bother doing anything? Why go from one point in your life to another if the next point isn't better in some manner? So on telling me that I'm not respecting people and I don't use their gender pronouns. And the other thing is I don't buy this whole idea that the people who are putting this legislation forward are valid representatives of the Trans community.

Speaker 4:          01:16:41       That's what they say they are. We have mechanisms for deciding whether someone's a valid representative of a community and that generally involves democratic voting. I've received at least 20 letters from transsexual people who are on my side and by the way, zero from others, believe it or not, who are perfectly happy with the idea of gendered pronouns. It's just they want to be the other one. Now you can have a discussion about that and there's lots of things to be said about it, but the idea that this community that's coming out in these demanding rights is somehow

Speaker 6:          01:17:09       representative of this homogenous dough press minority, I think is rubbish.

Speaker 3:          01:17:15       Well that leads us to our next

Speaker 5:          01:17:16       question.

Speaker 3:          01:17:26       Question. I'm going to ask both the professor cossman and professor Bryson to comment on it. Um, so one of the objectives of the transgender and queer rights movement is to enter into public conscience in a way. And this person asks, this can only occur through public conversation. Do you worry that it's, it may not be possible to have thoughtful discussion if there is government restriction about this kind of speech. And do you worry that it would skew, discuss discussion in one direction or another? Uh, still perhaps. So professor cossman first and then professor Bryson.

Speaker 5:          01:18:07       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:18:08       So I've spent a career being concerned about the way in which, um, thoughtful discussion is often shut down and I've been concerned about it on the right, I think concerned about it on the left and I've been concerned about it in the mushy middle. And, and I think that Professor Peterson has actually performed some of this today and so far as he just said that he was denounced here today and that they're going to come for you next. So the thing is about speech is it everybody gets it and you say something and you then get criticized. So professor Peterson hasn't been denounced. Some might want to, um, but he has been severely criticized and that is actually what speech does. That

Speaker 5:          01:18:51       is what speech does.

Speaker 6:          01:18:56       I think that, um, I think that there is an important way to have public discussions, um, around a whole range of issues. I would welcome a discussion on the role of hate speech provisions. I would welcome a discussion around the role of hate speech and its desirability, um, about whether the Supreme Court of Canada is right or not right in upholding its constitutionality. But I would like to have that debate with someone who is knowledgeable about the law.

Speaker 5:          01:19:32       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          01:19:32       And Professor Bryson,

Speaker 7:          01:19:37       one of the big questions that I had to deal with in considering whether or not to accept a very generous offer, a invitation of the University of Toronto to come here today would be the impact of this event on Trans and gender non binary people, uh, specifically at the University of Toronto and much more generally. And so whereas I would say that I recognize practices of peer review and practices of peer review are not denouncement practices of peer review, our practices that we utilize to make assessments about knowledge claims. Whereas I would fully appreciate being able to enter into a discussion about gender and gender identity and issues around trans culture as a means of practicing peer review. I think the difficulty that we've had and we've managed to reproduce this difficulty here today, uh, characterized just now by Dr. Peterson as simplifying the world for functional purposes, simplifying the world for functional purposes is not what I recognize to be academic practice.

Speaker 7:          01:20:50       This is not how we relate to knowledge. And so I think that there's a concern when we don't subject claims that are being made as knowledge claims by people who carry titles at great Canadian universities. When we don't treat those knowledge claims in the same way that we would in any other field. And when their knowledge claims made about members of minority groups and bottled vulnerable, marginalized members of minority groups, then I think that we all need to be very concerned about how it is that we're changing what we think we do in the university, which is supposed to be about the advancement of knowledge and excellence.

Speaker 4:          01:21:31       Thank you.

Speaker 2:          01:21:36       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:21:37       So it was sort of a slightly different uh, line, but back to you, Professor Peterson again from the audience as a clinical psychologist, refute it is Professor Peterson, sorry. As a clinical psychologist refusing to acknowledge how damaging it could potentially be to an individual to disregard their identity.

Speaker 4:          01:21:59       Um, the first thing I would like to say to Mary Bryson is that this is an invitation. If she would like to debate, if she would like to debate, um, the relationship between biology and gender identity, I'm extending her an invitation to do so. I'm sure that any number of student groups would be more than happy to host it. And I'll put my knowledge of the peer reviewed literature against her knowledge. Here we go to the question though. Um, identities, a very complicated thing and you know, when I engage in clinical discussions with my clients, it's all about their identity. And so the idea that it's a very difficult question to even engage with because I don't understand it's, I don't understand it. It makes things so simple that you can't discuss them properly. All I do in my clinical practice and I have about 20,000 hours of experience with clinical in my clinical practice and I've dealt with all sorts of people, far more variation people than the typical person ever encounters.

Speaker 4:          01:22:57       And I think I've done it at least reasonably competently all my discussions with people in my clinical practice or about their identity, given the definition of identity that I brought forth, how they feel about themselves, how they conceptualize themselves. Cause those are two different things. How that plays out in their interactions with other people and what the functional significance of that isn't arm I'm going to save forthrightly. Well two things. One is that I don't believe that any of my clients have had cause to worry about my interpretation of their identity. Because what I do in my practice is help them discover what that is. I'm really, I'm seriously not interested in imposing any ideas of identity onto someone. It's because I don't, I can't do that. I don't know what the right vehicle is for you to travel through life. What I can help you do is articulate your concerns.

Speaker 4:          01:23:42       I can ask you questions where I see contradictions in yourself. Articulation. I can help you make plans for the future. And I've helped thousands and thousands and thousands of people by the way, make plans for the future with the stuff that I do online. And so I'm helping people build a genuine identity. Um, well, and that's what I do. So that's the answer to that question and I think I do it well. I mean in the stuff we've done from a research perspective with the future authoring program, which I offered to people free and week and a half ago, to help them catalyze their identities. We've helped 5,000 university students increase their grade point average 20% and decrease their dropout by the same. And the biggest effect have it's been with men and, and non Western ethnic minority students who've accelerated their performance up beyond the range of the normal for the, for the dominant culture, a pure psychological intervention, I might say, a a sociological intervention. So I'm perfectly willing to stack my record on identity formulation up against anyone so and so, and I should also point out, I think where I'm most vulnerable in this entire debate and I expect this will happen and you know, there's already been noise about it on the Ontario Psychological Association website. I think they'll, that they'll probably come after my clinical license so that, that'd be my, that'd be my guess. So. So

Speaker 3:          01:24:57       I think we might be straying a little away from your question. No. So, uh, just uh, thank you. Um, so

Speaker 2:          01:25:04       no, we're doing because that, that question

Speaker 4:          01:25:07       question involved my clinical practice, I'm not straying a bit that involve my clinical practice. And there was a reason that the question was posed. So I'm not straying.

Speaker 2:          01:25:17       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          01:25:25       Um, the next question concerns how a free and democratic society is, uh, how that idea is developed in this is I guess particularly our for Professor Cossman. So you mentioned that, um, the uh, freedom of expression and the antidiscrimination equality provisions of the charter are balanced through section one, which explicitly it's section one starts out our charter. Um, and it has this idea of free and democratic society. So how, how is that idea established and who was part of that discussion?

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       So the language of section one is that all rights and freedoms contained in the charter are subject to such reasonable limits as are demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society. So like, I didn't write those right? Wasn't me. Um, it was a whole bunch of folks back in the late seventies and the early 1980s where there was a constitutional committees that decided what the Canadian constitution would be. It was parliament, it was the Senate, it was all the provinces with the exception of Quebec of course. Um, that came to an agreement that the constitution would be our highest form of law. And it's also important, there's a, there's a lot of misunderstanding around the constitution. So the constitution only restricts government action. It is not what's at play here in terms of uh, universities. In fact, the charter doesn't actually apply to universities. Human rights codes do, but the charter does not.

Speaker 6:          01:27:06       Um, and so the courts from the very early times of when the Supreme Court of Canada, when it had to start interpret all the charter rights, there's section two B, that's freedom of expression. There's freedom of religion. There's the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. There's the right to life, liberty and security of the person. There's the right to equality. Before the law, the Supreme Court of Canada developed a test whereby it said it was going to figure out how to balance rights. And so if you have a violation of section two be freedom of expression, which is, which is quite a low bar, anything that restricts speech is considered to be a violation of that, right? You then move to section one and the court in a very early case called the oaks case, developed a test whereby it, it does that balancing first it looks to see whether there are any pressing and substantial objectives in the government legislation that actually is limiting those rights.

Speaker 6:          01:28:02       It then looks at if there are pressing and substantial objectives and often in the context of hate speech, for example, that is about preventing discrimination, but there's many others as well. Um, it then looks to see whether the violation of the speech is proportionate to the pressing and substantial government objective. And there are many, many legal steps along the way here. It's complicated. There are lots of steps and it is the Supreme Court of Canada that does this. It is the Supreme Court of Canada that defines and ultimately decides how we balance those rights. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          01:28:40       Um, so another question for Professor Peterson. Um, why do you feel that someone's personal gender identity and pronouns infringes your free speech? Can one not also argue based on your interpretation that professors can use racial slurs in their classroom? Um, and the, that the inability to do

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       so would violate their freedom of speech? Well, that's pretty much the same question. I think. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:29:15       I think that we're crossing a dangerous line and the line is the requirement that's being put upon people by government agencies with the full force of the law behind them to decide what language categories you're going to use. Now, I think that's a form of compelled speech, which has a technical meaning. I know in the United States the American Supreme Court ruled against the government's, right? Do you use compelled speech in 1943 I understand that this isn't the United States, but we share a common law background and the doctrines are relevant. Um, for me, you see, when I opened this debate, this forum, um, I tried to explain what this is about and I couldn't explain everything and that it's about, because it's about too many things. But one of the things, it's about his etiology and the distinction between the left and the right. And let's say now I truly believe that these made up pronouns of which there are many dozens in fact and there's no consensus on them and that doesn't even begin to start a discussion about the use of the other kin pronouns.

Speaker 4:          01:30:23       And you can look those up if you want. Because if you can define your identity subjectively any way you want, then there's absolutely no reason that you can't claim a non human identity. And you may not know. But in the lgbt a rainbow coalition, there is q plus and the q plus people include the other kids who claim a non human identity and they're arguing in that rainbow coalition that they have the same right to their, um, to their pronouns that everyone else does. And their pronouns includes such things as work worms self. You're not supposed to interrupt. Actually, I was just going to ask if you could go back to the point about the analogy between, uh, the racial slur and the end. I don't think there's any analogy at all. But the thing about difference between, I'm talking about compelled speech, there's a difference between saying that there's something you can't say and saying that there are things that you have to say. And I regard these made up pronouns, all of them as the neologisms of a radical pc authoritarians. Do you understand that? And I don't, I'm not a fan of that sort of person. And the reason I'm not a fan of that sort of person is because I've done my homework, I've read everything I can get my hands on in the development of authoritarian political systems and I know the literature inside out and backwards. And I am not going to be a mouthpiece for language that ID test.

Speaker 2:          01:31:47       And that's [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:32:01       So we have one question left and I'm going to what end? It's for professor Bryson. Professor Bryson. Um, I noticed that you were on the vice presidential task force at UBC for a two spirited trans and other folks. And I wonder, this is obviously been a difficult debate for the University of Toronto, but from your perspective as someone who salt. So had a senior leadership role as well as being an expert in the area. Do you have any thoughts or guidance about what universities can do to ensure that we're moving things forward in a helpful, inclusive boy? Let's talk about

Speaker 7:          01:32:42       [inaudible]. So this week we heard from uh, Justin Trudeau's government about the apology that would meet be made to Lgbq Canadians concerning, uh, the extraordinarily violent impacts of discriminatory activities that were also research activities happening, uh, at Canadian universities and elsewhere to locate and to fire lgb Canadians from the public service and from the rcmp. And let's pay attention to some of the details of that situation. You can google the fruit machine and an incredibly bogus apparatus that was created, let's say not coincidentally by a psychologist at Carleton University Dr Wake, who was the chair of the psychology department intended only to identify, uh, supposedly homosexuals who then would be fired from government service and from the rcmp. Those actions were carried out by means in part of entirely bogus research claims supported and funded by a Canadian public university, Carleton University. If we fast forward to the fairly recent past, we could look at chem h making an apology for the incredibly damaging work carried out by Zucker in his focus conversion therapy based entirely on these ideas about sex producing gender constancy, which then in the case of gender diverse young people could be cured by means of conversion therapy.

Speaker 7:          01:34:26       Cam H had to apologize to the Canadian public and to Ontarians for the harms carried out by Dr Zucker. And so I think that we might need to think about two things at the University of Toronto. And one would be an apology for any, uh, damages to the right to safety and the right to humanity on the part of Trans and gender diverse people at the university and in the great city of Toronto more generally. And then of course, the University of Toronto. And perhaps it already is. And I'm sure you know more about this than I do, could implement the kind of wide ranging program to think very carefully about how in an intelligent way to accommodate gender diversity and Trans people in this wonderful, great Canadian University that is the University of Toronto. Thank you. We are, we are at the

Speaker 3:          01:35:24       end of our time. Um, I would like to thank all the participants, the organizers, the many, many, many staff who did a great job making this forum happen. And of course, uh, the members of the audience who came out today, I don't so like to acknowledge, and I think professor Bryson mentioned this, that tomorrow, November 20th is transgender day of remembrance and that observes the fact that many, uh, who many members of the transgender community, uh, either lost their lives or were injured in acts of violence. And on a moment like this, it's worth remembering that the reason, the legislation we're debating today and we're discussing today came into existence, was to protect those communities from those acts of violence. The five, 19 at five 19 church street has a number of activities and the U of t sexual and gender diversity office also does. Um, it's a, it's, I wasn't sure what to expect today, I have to say coming in as moderator. But, uh, I just want to thank everyone once again for the discussion and hope as we said, that some illumination has happened, which is after all of what we seek to do in the university. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          01:36:42       [inaudible].
