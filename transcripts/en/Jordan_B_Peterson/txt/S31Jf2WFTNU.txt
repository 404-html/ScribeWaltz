Speaker 1:          00:04          Hi there. So I thought I'd update you with regards to what has been going on at the University of Toronto in the last week. Um, since I released my three videos starting on September 27th dealing with political correctness, uh, at the legislative level and in terms of certain policy decisions at the University of Toronto, most particularly the mandatory requirement that the human resources staff take a antiracism and antibiotics training. So on October 3rd, I received the first of two warning letters, um, telling me that I was required to act in accordance with university policies and with the relevant law. I'm not going to read you the first letter. Um, but I'll read you the second one, which I got on October 18th. So dear Professor Peterson, we are writing in followup to professor ferber's letter to you of October 3rd, 2016. Professor Ferber is the chair of the psychology department and um, she gave me the first letter, um, as a consequence of her interactions with a variety of administrators at the university regarding the ongoing concerns related to your videos and complaints that have been made to the university by members of the university community, including transgendered persons and the organizations that represent and support them on campus about some of the content of those videos.

Speaker 1:          01:36          First, let us be clear that the university is committed to the protection of freedom of speech as a core value for our community and for any university in a democratic society. The university is likewise committed to protecting the academic freedom of our faculty members, including their right to criticize the university and society at large with freedom from institutional censorship. As articulated in article five of the Memorandum of agreement between the University of Toronto and the University of Toronto Faculty Association, the University's commitment to protecting these core values includes your right to express and debate views that may be discomforting or even offensive to others. However, as professor ferber has already pointed out to you, these rights are not without limitation and must be exercised in accordance with your responsibilities as a faculty member, including upholding applicable laws. You have continued to state public publicly that if a student or colleague or staff member requests that you referred to the music, gender neutral pronouns, you will refuse to do so and that you do not recognize the rights of others to tell you which personal pronoun to use when addressing them. The law of Ontario, specifically the Ontario Human Rights Code protects against discrimination based on gender expression and gender identity. Depending on the context, if personal pronouns are being used, the refusal by a teacher or colleague to use the personal pronoun, that is an expression of the person's gender identity can constitute discrimination.

Speaker 1:          03:13          In many situations. It is not necessary to use personal pronouns at all, but where it is the personal pronoun that is chosen as the person's gender identity related and gender expression related identifier should be used. Your statements that you will refuse to use transgendered your statements that you will refuse to refer to transgendered persons using gender neutral pronouns if they ask you to do so are contrary to the rights of those persons to equal treatment without discrimination based on their gender identity and gender expression. You should also be aware that many members of the university community are concerned and distressed about the declarations of your discriminatory intentions. The university has received communications from individual student groups and employee groups that find my comments to be unacceptable, emotionally disturbing and painful. Some members of the university community report that the statements and the invective that has followed in the ensuing commentary and debates on social media have caused them to fear for their safety on the university campus. Some students have reported being the target of specific and violent threats including threats of assault, injury, and death against them individually and as members of the Trans Community. We trust that these impacts on students and others were not your intention in making these remarks. However, in view of these impacts as well as the requirements of the Ontario Human Rights Code, we urge you to stop repeating these statements.

Speaker 1:          04:52          As professor ferber informed you, your responsibilities as a faculty member at the University of Toronto include an obligation to uphold the law, including the Ontario human rights code and to do so as you exercise your academic freedom or freedom of expression, your responsibilities as a faculty member also include dealing with other members of the university community in ways that provide equal treatment without discrimination. Article Five of the memo of agreement between New Toronto and and the U Toronto Faculty Association not only recognizes that faculty members have the right to academic freedom, but also notes the responsibility of faculty members to establish fair and ethical dealings with students as well as with colleagues. The impact of your behavior runs the risk of undermining your ability to conduct essential components of your job as a faculty member, and we urge you to consider your obligations as a faculty member to act in a manner that is consistent with the law and with university policy. You have referred to allegations of criminal behavior by some in at the Rally of October 11th, 2016 the university deplores acts of violence and it's just rupture of civil debate. The allegations of criminal behavior are being investigated by the Toronto Police Service. The university continues to emphasize to its community members the obligation to engage in civil nonviolent interactions at all times, including when difficult topics are discussed on campus. Yours sincerely, David Cameron, Dean Faculty of Arts and Science. See your band, Nelson, vice provost, faculty and academic life copied to professors, Suzanne Ferber, chair of the Department of Psychology. So

Speaker 1:          06:37          I'm being urged to stop saying what I'm saying. Well, the next video I'll post and hopefully today will be my response to that.
