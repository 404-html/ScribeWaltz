Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So back in February, I received the following letter from a student at Linfield college and according to its website with campuses in Mcminnville, Portland, and a prestigious online program. Linfield college is a premier choice in the Pacific northwest for a high quality traditional liberal arts education. Want to learn more, contact us for details about her degree and certificate program offerings. A student there who I won't name sent me the followup letter. Dear Dr Peterson. I'm an undergraduate student and Linfield college in Mcminnville, Oregon. The international students for Liberty Conference recently granted me a small sum to organize pro liberty events on campus with an emphasis on the importance of free speech. I'm writing to ask you if you're accepting speaking invitations at this time and if you're scheduled sometime between now and may, would allow it to help narrow down my options. I would like to offer you $1,500 and an invitation to speak here this spring semester.

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       Your travel and accommodation costs will also be covered. I perceived Linfield as an institution at an ideological crossroads. I feel it is my responsibility to pick the most effective voice possible for helping linfield chart a course that will ensure its future as a place of reason and academic integrity. After listening to many of your lectures and interviews, I believe your message is ideal for our campus. Honest and productive argumentation is one of your specialties. Linfield would greatly benefit from being introduced to your ideas on the subject. We're a small college of roughly 2000 students situated in quiet wine country. Your work continues to have a deep impact on my personal and intellectual growth. I'd be honored to hear from you. Thank you for your time and consideration. So after considering it for a while, I agreed to come and speak at Linfield College. On March 18th, I received a note from an invitation student, the inviting students who said, good morning Dr Peterson.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       I would be overjoyed to confirm a date. So we went about doing that on April seventh. He replied to me again to update me. He said the talk will be held in Ice Auditorium in Melrose Halt April 24th, beginning at 7:00 PM. I'm referring to the events simply as a talk with Jordan Peterson because his speaking style allows for a lot of fluidity in topic. However, the core theme to the event is the importance of freedom of speech, especially in higher education. Some of the administration slash student government have began to fret about the potential for people to feel open, quote, offended, and oppressed. Close quote by Peterson's talk. It's more pushback than I expected at Linfield. What? I don't think it's a cause for concern. I'm fighting hard to keep their worries at bay and there's a very supportive group of students and community members who have my back free speech. We'll win on April 17th. The following article appeared in student newspaper

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       Kenny Neal, editor in chief. It's called hate symbol on ball riles campus. The linfield young Americans for liberty groups, free speech ball outside of Walker Hall on April Twelfth, received attention from students and faculty when a student drew pepe the frog, which has recently been appropriated by white supremacist groups. Linfield college posted the picture of the ball when it's instagram account, but it was later removed because of the frogs association with alt right groups. As soon as it was pointed out that the photo included the image, the instagram post was removed. President Thomas Heli set the free speech ball event. The first event in this freely at series at Linfield encouraged students to express themselves by writing and drawing on the ball to promote free speech. Pepe the frog is a popular Internet meme that is often appeared in humorous ways. The Anti Defamation League has listed pepe the frog on its hate symbols database.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       I only heard about it secondhand and I understand that it is a place for free speech, but in all reality, it was certainly done in very poor taste. Junior John Christianson set according to its website, the a mission is to open quote, identify, educate, train, and mobilize youth activists committed to winning on principle. Our goal is to cast the leaders of tomorrow and reclaim the policies, candidates, and direction of our government. Post quote, a member of Y, a l drew the pepe, the frog on the ball, but asked to remain on identified open quote, I knew the person who drew happy. He didn't draw it to be negative. He drew it to be funny. Close quote, senior Parker Wells, a member of y, a l sad. He continued. We understand some groups appropriated the image, but any image can be appropriated. Wells set his goals with the free speech ball, where to get people thinking about the rights to free expression and to bring more attention to the y a l group. He said, I understand that it's necessary to set limits, but I don't think this cartoon fraud is a limit to set for free speech. I find it unfortunate that people can enjoy this event because of the frog image as a part of it's speak freely. Series y a l is bringing Dr Jordan Peterson to campus on Monday, April 24th. The group is also showing the documentary the red pill on Tuesday, May 2nd

Speaker 1:          00:05:48       professor of English resume Dot Fowler. Stab, stab, open quote. I find both the invitation of Jordan Peterson and the screening of the documentary, the red by the young Americans for Liberty Club, extremely problematic problematic because neither peterson northern film will be promoting dialogues about gendered inclusions, but rather be promoting a dangerous and offensive logic of gendered exclusions. Dr [inaudible] continued promotion of such exclusionary practices, greatly threatened safe spaces for our students, staff and faculty who belong to marginalized groups and violates our ethos of upholding mutual respect on our campus. The president's diversity committee will hold a discussion at 5:30 PM on Monday in the pioneer reading room titled Free Speech, what it is and what it is, not the discussion. We'll examine free speech and members of the Linfield community or encouraged to attend. So that's the end of that newspaper article. So I read that it was forwarded to me soon after I tweeted the following message. Open quote, I'm violating some more safe spaces. Suit Linfield College. April 24th.

Speaker 1:          00:07:05       Well, on April 19th I received a letter from the student who'd organized my car. He said things have gotten nuclear this email. The one I'm going to read to you was just sent to all of Lynnfield. One of the stipulations they are referring to is the contract which they rejected because it was a day late. Our Club is currently looking for space in downtown in Mcminnville to hold Peterson's stark and step. The media is likely getting involved. I'm sorry for this insanity. We tried very hard to keep things simple here. So here is the letter sent out to the entire community

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       linfield community. I am writing on behalf of the Linfield cabinet as officer in charge, what President Kelly is out. I want to let the Linfield community know that the Aas, Llc Associated Students of Linfield College has determined it will not fun Dr Jordan Peterson's appearance next week because stipulations for the event were not met by the requester, young Americans for liberty. Since the authorization parameters, we're not satisfied. The college will not host the event on April 24. Among the stipulations was that the event was to be a private linfield college only event by his own tweet yesterday to 107,000 followers. Dr Peterson indicates he would be open quote, violating more safe spaces soon. Linfield College, close quote, likeminded supporters from outside or community have responded affirmatively. Our policy on anti harassment protection and academic freedom states that open quotes, anti harassment policies are not intended to limit the free exchange of opinions or the vigorous debate over ideas. However, intimidation, harassment, exploitation, and the use or threat of force are incompatible with the preservation of this freedom. The letter continues based on the speaker's own words. This event no longer presents the possibility of academic inquiry within the Linfield community. Our policy is clear. Open quote, harassment and intimidation preclude the very possibility for maintaining an atmosphere of academic freedom. We cannot welcome speakers, witness stipulations for their appearances are not mapped and who attend, who intend to violate the safety of our community. Respectfully, Susan at Kipp and hand.

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       So I wrote a letter to Susan Agora Chippenham. Now you understand that by this time the flights had been arranged, the accommodation had been arranged, everything was in place, and of course they had known about this for a long time. Dear Susan,

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       I received a copy of your letter to the Linfield community this morning as well as an indication that my long scheduled talk at Linfield has been canceled. That is fine, I suppose except that the plane tickets have been booked and the hotel reservations have been made as well as three days taken out of my schedule at my expense. Alright, thank you. Are Treating me and the student group who invited me in a manner that is absolutely reprehensible as well as cowardly and underhanded. I have made arrangements to come to lynnfield which is extremely distant from me and that was the way in good faith. Now you cancel it with a plethora of specious reasons including your anti harassment policy. Although I have harassed no one nor intimidated, exploited, or threaten force had I not previously received notice of the controversy around my arrival, which is in my opinion, unwarranted.

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       I would not have tweeted my intent to open quote violate safe spaces, close quote, which is a satirical comment in case it needs to be said. Obviously you were looking for any excuse no matter how trivial to cancel this event. You also note that open quote, this event no longer presents the possibility of academic inquiry within the Linfield community close quote, I might point out that Lynnfield is a college not a community, and that ideas need to be discussed in a college. You also state that open quote, anti harassment policies are intended to limit the free exchange of opinions or the vigorous debate over ideas, close quote and then proceed to do exactly that. You also mentioned that you have received support from open quote, likeminded supporters, close quote from outside of your community, which is hardly surprising or informative, given that they were likeminded.

Speaker 1:          00:11:45       You also suggest that because the contract was delayed one day, that constitutes sufficient grounds for cancellation even though you knew well that the event was booked and finalized and it's such delays are by no means unheard of in such situations. You might also note that a guest invited to your college might expect to be treated with a modicum of consideration and respect. Here's what I plan to do. I'm going to make a video tomorrow morning at the latest reading this letter on Youtube. Explaining that by invitation has been revoked what that means for me and the nature of the reasons given. I will also read this letter of response from me. It shouldn't be watched by about 150,000 viewers, many of whom I imagine will be linfield alumni, supporters and students. I'm perfectly willing to see what they all have to say. Then we can let the dust settle where it may sincerely.

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       Dr Jordan Peterson, professor of psychology, University of Toronto. I received absolutely nothing in response. God, no, he didn't even have the decency to send me a notification explaining their rationale. Nothing. So I was treated as far as I'm concerned with, with uh, well, let's call it unprofessionally and leave it at that. So what's the story now? The organizing students tried to book an alternative venue. They didn't have enough money to rent a suitable theater or lecture hall. I told them that they could use my honorarium to pay for the space which they did. The yamhill valley news registered Dotcom posted this update April 20th off campus venue found for controversial Speaker Linfield college student government organization this week with drew permission for a newly organized club, young Americans for liberty to bring up controversial speaker to campus for a free public talk. Monday, the group has responded by lining up an off campus location for the presentation featuring Jordan Peterson, Canadian professor whose campaign against gender neutral pronouns is considered offensive by some do the transgender population. Peterson has been rebooked for seven to 9:00 PM at the falls event center, housed in the former chapel on the evergreen aviation and space museum campus. So on with the show, and you can figure out what I think of the linfield administrators who pulled this stunt on your own.

Speaker 2:          00:14:20       Thanks for watching.

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       Members of the community community for liberty, other organizations that support this events in those who travel to get here along with the people on the live stream. My name is Lucas Carter and I'm the president of the linkage chapter of young Americans for liberty. My Vice President Keeper Smith Been. You've been in the coordinator market grills in Secretary Alton Ramsey who was handling tonight's a live stream.

Speaker 2:          00:15:16       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:15:21       So we're the team that organized this to ensure that liberty wants a night judging by this parallel. I think we accomplished that, but first, just a couple of technical things to get it. Either way, we're all doing a live stream because we received support from all over the nation and I mean all over. So we're asking to stay off the white bike please. So all our friends and families can enjoy this live stream without any hiccups. Uh, secondly, we do have a donation bucket in the back to help cover a Jordan Peterson's travel expenses. Right now my goal is a $750 in any excess funds will go towards his research.

Speaker 3:          00:16:06       So moving on, I can talk a little about the club when keiffer nice story of this club. Back in February, we didn't know what to expect. We didn't have a vision. However, given recent political events, not just the splits, many people are afraid to speak out over years of aspects to how was the club as Dr Nate Libertarian values, let's engage the public in the community and like open free the bait for the sake of intellectual advancements, being able to debate, being able to reach conclusions with St, t in respect to one another's, I'd like to think leadership that just introduced all the hard work towards it towards accomplishing this goal that we truly believe in. Finally, I was the best next semester as chapter President Keeper Smith era. Take over next semester after I graduates.

Speaker 3:          00:17:16       Now, more importantly, there was something I need to address to the lingo community on behalf of the club on behalf of the club in the leadership. I like to take this time to publicly apologize for eating unintended harm that has occurred over these past two weeks. It is not within the clubs with tensions degenerate any arm or create environment where people feel unsafe. We just want to make that clear. We want people be more movement. That's our intention and I'm also going to ask the public to not raising it. Pitchforks at my school. I love my school early. Do I didn't move all the way out here more to just to like trash anything. I love my school. And beyond that situation behind the scenes is a lot more complex than what's been released to the public. Cloud itself has made mistakes too and I just got to say thank you for cooperation in these matters. Now I'd like to introduce the main coordinator of this events. He has done far more work than any of us. You know, he spoke with Pearson for an advance. He spoke with the media who found this venue last minute. Such a beautiful venue by the way. He handled most of the paperwork and more. I can't think of another note. Please welcome event coordinator Parker Wells.

Speaker 4:          00:18:43       Thank you.

Speaker 5:          00:18:52       Hello everybody. I'm a senior at college and I'm overjoyed to see a third response, uh, considering ms dot Dubay had some major complications just last week. Uh, it's overwhelming. The response has been so, so positive here. So thank you for that. Um, I have to express my gratitude to students for liberty young Americans, for liberty, for students who are unsure about how to get involved on your college campuses. I highly recommend the network of liberty minded organizations because they've been very supportive throughout this whole whole thank you to them. Lastly, I like to frame tonight's talk as an opportunity for us to open our minds and make an honest effort at understanding each each other and on that note all the way from the University of Toronto. Please welcome Dr Jordan Peterson.

Speaker 4:          00:19:48       Thank you. Thank you burt, and also thank you for your persistence. The first thing I'd like to say is that Parker told me can 10 minutes before the talk that he has very much enjoyed going to linfield college, which I just had had the opportunity to stroll through absolutely spectacularly beautiful lakes. Looks like everyone's dream of a classic Liberal Arts College, and so he wanted me to let everyone know that he's had a great time in Europe.

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       He didn't want to bring any disrepute on colleges, so I thought I'd end up. It's important to know that it's easy for things to be made black and white because that's simple, but certainly things are the least bit simple. It's useful to keep that in mind. So I'm going to start this by reading you something that I wrote specifically for this talk. I want to. I always want to do something different in each talk because one of the previous talk and part of the reason that you talk is to get things clear in your mind. It's a good way of thinking. It's the best way of thinking. So I suppose in some sense it's opens a poll. Maybe that's what it is. It's. It's what I hope to cover tonight. So what I'm going to do is read you the outline first. I guess it's an outline and then I'm going to go through it line by line and see if I can clarify to us and also to beat what I mean.

Speaker 5:          00:21:57       So I'm going to orient the talk tonight around the ethics of free speech we've talked about about or thought a lot about, let's say the right to free speech and something you might want to also consider the obligation to free speech because I actually think it's deeper than a right. I think you're obligated to speak freely because otherwise people don't have the benefit of your whatever wisdom you possess and at least you possess the wisdom of your own experience. At the very least you have that and that's as valid as a form of truth, as any other form of truth and it's often a truth that can be usefully communicated to other people. And so it's to the communities benefit. You say what your experience has taught because there isn't anyone who has experience like you and one of the things that I've learned from being a clinical psychologist, but I would say more specifically from being a very careful listener, is that if you listen to people and they can talk to you, they tell you the most amazing things.

Speaker 5:          00:23:04       You know, my, my typical week I work, even today I was speaking to four different people. They're supporters of mine online and I beat some of the and I had four conversations that were just absolutely profound and it's so interesting because if people are allowed, encouraged to express themselves and that's something that you could do by listening to someone, they open up and they were there as it's as interesting as a Dostoevsky know people's actual lights are extraordinarily interesting and and important that they can speak freely about them because then they can tell you all the things they know that you don't know and then you get to know them and that's such a good deal. So. So I'm going to tell you some things that I believe to be true and constitute the back of his talk. So the first thing is that life is suffering. And then I would say that this is an attempt to. This is my attempt to reconcile the existence of multiple transcendent virtues. Transcended virtues are the lights that guide you through your life essentially that the principles by which it's necessary to live if you're going to have a life that's meaningful and profound and beneficial, and there are multiple transcendent values. It isn't clear how they relate to one another, and this is my attempt to understand how they relate to so I started with the truth that I believe to be supreme, which is that life is suffering and then that love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering, ameliorated

Speaker 5:          00:25:07       and the truth is the handmaiden of law and the dialogue is the pathway to truth. And then humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn and then to learn is to die voluntarily and be born again in great ways and small. So speech must be untrammeled so that dialogue can take place so that we can all humbly learn. So the truth, concert law, so that suffering can be ameliorated so that we can all stumble forward, so to speak, to the Kingdom of God. So I'll try to unpack that.

Speaker 5:          00:26:11       Well, I think the idea that light is suffering. This comes as no surprise to anyone in my estimation. There's two reasons for that. One seems to have to do with the structure of being itself, and by that I mean there seems to be something about limitation that's required for existence and it's a difficult notion to make clear, but I can tell you a little story about what I call him. My son was young when he was three years old. Um, I thought he was a remarkable creature. I thought Saint Nicholas, my daughter, there's something remarkable. Have little kids.

Speaker 6:          00:27:01       No, they're, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:27:06       they're a little beacons of enthusiasm and wonder. I suppose it, although it takes great effort to care for them, they repaid you partly by their enthusiasm and partly by the fact that they looked at the world as if it's a new thing and that allows you to do the same thing when you're around them. So they refresh the world for you. And, and that's, that's a great thing. Now, of course, if you're a parent, one of the things that sprite Info your children is that they're vulnerable.

Speaker 5:          00:27:47       That's part of the burden of responsibility that's associated with being a parent, but then you might think about that vulnerability as a well as a liability. I suppose that's one way of thinking about it, but then I thought, well that's an interesting way of looking at it that it's only a liability because maybe you would like your child not to be vulnerable. But then I thought that through and not the practical map price close. I thought, well, because I was worried, you know, he'd go up the street and the car would go into the playground and some bully would knock them over a dog bite up or something like that, you know, and of course little kids are always backing themselves and falling down the stairs and that kind of thing. And I thought, well, what would you have to do to have a little being that didn't have those problems?

Speaker 6:          00:28:37       Well, I thought you could.

Speaker 5:          00:28:40       Well, it's like a superhuman intelligence. That would be a start. It could be 20 feet tall instead of three feet tall and he can be encased in titanium and know he could be made him vulnerable or at near invulnerable. But the problem with that is that you have to replace what he was piece by piece until there was nothing left. And so that's one. That was partly when I realized because realizations like this of course unfold over time, that when you, when you deeply care for someone, you don't care for them. Despite their vulnerability. You care for them with the knowledge that their vulnerability as an intrinsic part of them. You care for the remarkable fact of their weakness and specificity just as much as you care for them for whatever abilities they bring to bear whatever capacities they have. And so to love someone is to Simmel tediously accept their vulnerability as a valid part of their feeding and that's a necessary thing to do in life because life is suffering and but without, without, without the vulnerability that brings suffering, then there doesn't seem to be any possibility of individual existence.

Speaker 5:          00:29:57       And so to me, it seems that in order for us to exist as individuals, in some real sense, we have to be limited in precisely the manner that we are limited in the Ba in some sense requires that limitation and that vulnerability. There is an old idea, I don't remember where I read it. It was many years ago. I think it was from Jewish commentary on the Torah. It was like a Zen Koan almost. The question was what does it being with the classical attributes of God omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresence? What does it feel like now? It's a very interesting question because of course, obviously the obvious answer is, well, nothing, but that's the wrong answer. The right answer is to be like that blacks limitation and the commentator was putting that argument forward as a justification for the creation of man. And I thought that was a spectacularly brilliant insight that there was something that something that lacks nothing, blacks max lack itself.

Speaker 5:          00:31:02       And I read something about something written by Kierkegaard where he said the same thing. He said that he knew himself as someone who was never going to be able to make life easy for people in the way the great, the great inventors of the late 19th century had been things increasingly easy for people and so that his task was going to be to determine how was he could make life more difficult for people and he knew he would be thanked as one of the benefactors of the age for doing precisely that regard. Tempted to, I suppose lay a heavy moral burden on his readers and he knew that that was perhaps not something that people would appreciate immediately, but perhaps on reflection they would find that that was exactly what they wanted and one of the things that speak very remarkable to me as I've been speaking to people recently is that because I think that I'm doing something similar. I'm trying to lay a burden on people and by all appearances I'm trying to lay a burden on me. At least that's who's responding to it. I mean, look at this audience. It's like it must be 95 percent. It's very, very interesting to me, but, but there's something about about responsibility. It's associated with the transcendence of suffering and it's absolutely necessary for life to proceed properly,

Speaker 5:          00:32:34       so life is suffering because we're vulnerable and it's also suffering I would say because we're evil and I've tried to define evil. There's the tragic part of life is the fact that our, our vulnerability is built in and we we have psychological problems or physical problems and we all die and that's part of the structure of existence. It's the same structure that brain is about tornadoes and hurricanes and earthquakes and natural catastrophes of all types. It's, it's the impartial brutality of reality and that contributes greatly to human suffering. Probably would be, as I said, it also be a precondition for being itself, but then there's the other kind of suffering that we bring the corner herself and I would categorize that under the heading of malevolence and malevolence is the desire to break, to increase suffering in some sense, for the sake of suffering itself.

Speaker 5:          00:33:34       It's like an art form. I think that's the best way to conceptualize it. Something is authentic. It's the same aesthetic that drove the Nazis to put that up. Terrible Jill, about gates of Auschwitz, which was that work with make you free, and of course the freedom that is being offered it in the Nazi camps was death and that was great, terrible joke and it's. It's a very malevolent spirit that would dare to joke in that manner, but that's the spirit that we all have attended because there's part of each of us that because of the suffering that life entails is bitter about existence, would wish in some sense to see it eradicated and something I learned from reading those great play faust. He as a character in there Mephistopheles who's sort of the intellectual version of Satan, I suppose, and hurt the has mephistopheles attempt to explain the reason for his existence or at least the reason for his modem.

Speaker 5:          00:34:34       Ba in memphis softly says memphis golf means basically says, if you're. That hasn't say this twice, that because the existence is characterized by such dreadful suffering, it would be better if it never existed at all. And that's what he's bringing. Working to bring about. And that struck me in a very deep manner because I had recognized by that time that life was difficult enough so that it was challenging to walk through it without becoming embittered and resentful, let's say, and and then to become arrogant because of that, and then to become a judge of existence. Because of that, if you ever wonder, of course you do what is going through the minds of people who do such things as shoot up elementary school's full of schoolchildren knowing the things that I just described is very useful in developing some understanding because the people who do that are resentful and bitter and the brooded upon it for well not hours, weeks, months and years, and they conclude that existence itself is evil and that it should be.

Speaker 5:          00:35:43       It should be taken revenge upon. The way that you take revenge on existence most precisely is to find the most innocent people and punish them the most. Dreadful, and that's the motive behind shooting elementary school kids in a playground. Let's say that's a very dark place to go, but that's a place that people are perfectly capable of going up. The terrible thing is that we have the motivation to go there and you can make a rational case for going there, but that doesn't make it the proper place to go and that brings me to the second point, which is that love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering. Ameliorated lob is a very difficult word to use because in some sense it's been most today. I know such a commonplace. If you're attempting to affect virtue, then the first thing you do is speak about love and it's very difficult to speak about love without feeling.

Speaker 5:          00:36:43       I would say self contempt really because it is a word that's misused so bad. I'd like to offer a technical definition of it and then put it into relationship, into proper relationship with what I already discussed. If, if hatred is the desire to CPA eliminated because of its catastrophe, that blog is the desire to see being developed elevated maybe even because of that suffering and to say that the proper orientation in life is to work diligently for the alleviation of unnecessary suffering and to make that the core element of your being, your actual aim. Because you need a name, everyone needs an aid. We're we're, we're, we're, we're creatures who are evolved to aim or hunters for that matter, and we need a target to a map. We're not ever oriented properly without name and then he might say, well, why not choose a name that is everything that you could possibly wanted to be an and I would say that that is what you want to do because first of all, being miserable and vulnerable and subject to catastrophe of decay.

Speaker 5:          00:37:59       It's easy to see st and to self contempt and misery, self-conscious misery, and I think the only way out of that as to voluntarily shoulder a burden that the shouldering out brand students some respect for your own existence and so then you think, well, the way forward confidently is to find the biggest load that you can possibly lift and then lifted and then walk forward with it because they had. You can see that there's something to you that transcends your vulnerability. It knows the world and works against the very terrible problems of suffering to the level that might drive you to despair to begin with. And so when I'm working with my clinical clients, and I think when I'm speaking to people in general, when I'm properly oriented,

Speaker 5:          00:38:59       this is the development of thought that was originally laid down in part by Carl Rogers, so he was deeply influenced by by his Christian background. He was a very famous psychologist and he said that when you treat people in therapies with unconditional positive regard, and I would say that that's unknowable formulation, but it's erroneous because that isn't exactly in my estimation what you should do with people and I don't think it's what I do with people. What do I do with people is to try to find the part of the striving towards the light and that would like being itself to be elevated and unknowable and suffering ameliorating especially the unnecessary suffering. And then form an alliance with that and communicate with that and encourage that. Which is what I think you do to people that you love and you can't do that if there's bitterness in your heart because that's actually the part that you want to destroy.

Speaker 5:          00:39:54       If you're bitter as the story of Cain and Abel tells us in a carer in a terribly brief period of time the terrible power you replaced contempt for being and resentment and hatred with, with law, and that's the desire to see the good flourish in you and others, and I don't mean the good and that smarmy and contemptible manner that it's often presented. I'd been good as the combination of brilliant awareness and courage and strength that it really is you would wish to bring forward at everyone to encourage and everyone if you were oriented properly in the world and to seek that kind of orientation is to ground yourself in love instead of Mephistophelean, Patriot and

Speaker 6:          00:40:53       and

Speaker 5:          00:40:55       you have nothing better to do that now. You might as well do the best that you have to do because when you have to lose, you're going to lose everything anyways. So in the process of preparing to use everything, you might as well risk everything you have doing the best thing that you can possibly conceive of and there's no loss in that for you. There's nothing but gain. There's nothing but gain for everyone around you if you do that, and so why would you not do that? Except for bitterness and resentment? Perhaps luck, a lack of confidence perhaps because you haven't been encouraged properly and that's too bad. That's a lot different than being empowered by the way to be encouraged. It's a much better word. So then I wrote the truth is the handmaiden of love and what I meant by that because I've always wondered knowing that truth in love or perhaps the cardinal virtues, what is the proper way of conceptualizing the relationship? And it seems to me that truth has to be oriented towards something. It needs a context. There's no such thing as not in the way that I'm thinking of truth. There's no such thing as context free truth up in the moral domain, not in the domain of action, and that's the talking about truth in action.

Speaker 5:          00:42:31       Truth is the handmaiden of law bicycles because having orienting yourself to the highest good that you could conceive, whoa,

Speaker 5:          00:42:40       like Japan or wishing on the star and Oak Hill. Then you speak truth with that orientation in mind. Having the faith, I suppose that because B is good, articulating its nature as clearly as possible is the best way of continuing to encourage that good to spring forward. Otherwise you're presuming if you use deceit and falsehood, that being is essentially corrupt because otherwise you wouldn't have to falsify it in order to operate in the world. So you could say, well, you could make the courageous assumption that being is good despite I suppose some evidence to the contrary and then take the great risk of speaking truth in relationship to that under the assumption that whatever speaking truth produces, if it's oriented properly, is good.

Speaker 5:          00:43:47       You have to make decisions like that in your life. I mean, I can give you a simple example. I suppose awhile back I was speaking at mcmaster university and there were a lot of protesters there and that made me nervous because you never know when someone is going to do something unforgivably stupid. And so far I've been fortunate that in the controversies that I've been embroiled in that no one has done that. They've pushed the edges of that but. But they haven't done it and truly thank God for that, but having said that, I wasn't upset by the presence of the protesters because I couldn't tell if in fact they were. There was a good thing or a bad thing. It could be a good thing. You couldn't be a bad thing. It was a consequence of what I had been speaking up and that's what happened.

Speaker 5:          00:44:47       And so I thought there was no reason not to let that play itself out because the end of the story has not yet been reached. And the meaning of the events could not yet be specified. And you know, sometimes in your family, if you tell someone the truth, and I don't mean I hope I've coined this, I don't mean black truths, you know, there's white lies. It's in a way that I with to preserve a higher moral virtue, you, you continue to get lower moral virtue. You know, perhaps you don't tell a child dying of cancer that they're going to die. I don't know because it depends very much on the particulars of the situation. But you can understand that you have mixed motives in a situation like that. You can also speak black truths and black truth is when you say something that's normally true, but you're using it as a weapon for another purpose and that's the truth, that's that's really more a more profound an evil lie than any other one that you can possibly manage because you're using the truth in a way that corrupts.

Speaker 5:          00:45:49       It corrupts the truth itself and that's really reprehensible, but barring the use of the block truth, you know, if within your family you say what you mean, say what you think. That can often cause tremendous upheaval because, well, because many relationships are cobbled together by various alliances of willful blindness and things left unspoken and that's a very bad longterm strategy. You know, I've seen people who are embroiled in the death throes of a relationship that perhaps a crew 100,000 lies over its course and became so unstable because of that, there is no hope for it. Each of those lives was a forced stole opportunity to address something difficult with truth that was for gone and all that does is make those unsolved problems accumulate and multiply and they eventually take over and attack and generally when you're least expected. And so if you speak the truth in your family cautiously and carefully and knowing that it could be wrong, you will cause a that conflict, but it's conceivable that that's the least amount about people in conflict that could exist to make things right. And I believe that that is the case and that one of the things that I tell people who are too agreeable, let's say I don't like to cause conflict and I actually don't like to cause conflict because I'm more agreeable than I should be.

Speaker 5:          00:47:38       Is that the ethical requirement to tell the truth trumps any desire to avoid conflict. And it's partly because you only forestall the conflict and magnified. There's no escaping it and it's better to engage in directly when it first with the necessity first arises then to forestall. And so for people who are only too willing to make peace at the expense of themselves, let's say I try to encourage them to generate conflict by telling the truth, and I would say inevitably that has nothing but beneficial medium to longterm consequences in their life, even though it exposes them to more conflict in the short term. It also alleviates their resentment because if someone has made me resentful or if you become resentful because of someone's actions, then there's only two real reasons why. One is that you should pull up your socks and quit complaining. Quit whining because you're being required to shoulder responsibility or you're being oppressed and tyrannized by someone who doesn't know where their proper limits are and in the former case that you should get your act together and in the latter case, you should stand up and stop that person from encroaching upon you so you speak truth in your family.

Speaker 5:          00:49:18       Let's say perhaps even to yourself at the risk of conflict and often severe conflict. But the ultimate goal is to bring peace. It's paradoxical because we often don't think of a piece of something that's reached in conflict, but that is precisely, for example, why we value free speech because the wisdom of humanity and the wisest people that we know that would include those people who were intelligent enough to follow this country on the principles that is found on knew that whatever conflict free speech might produce pale in comparison to the conflict that was generated by tyranny and repression of exchange of opinion, and so it's never a matter of picking a safe path because there's no such thing as a safe path. It's only a matter of picking the path that produces the least catastrophe possible and it's an. It's an inviolable principle, I would say, and also the fundamental principle of Western civilization that speech freely exchanged is the best pathway to peace and redemption that we have identified and so it should remain untrammeled under all circumstances possible.

Speaker 5:          00:50:33       Subject to very infrequent restraints of the sort that are already encapsulated in law such that, for example, you cannot incite someone to criminal activity humility. Dialogue is the pathway. You can truth. Well, I understand that you have to understand why we fake and the reason we think is for the same reason that animals, including us act and the reason that animals act is so that they can survive in the world. They do things so that they can survive in the world, but the problem with doing things in the world, the problem with acting in the world is that you can act in a manner that causes the substation of your Ba. You can act in a manner that gets you killed. You can act in a manner that makes you sick. You can make a mistake and you pay for that, and that's the danger of acting.

Speaker 5:          00:51:38       So human beings have replaced near acting with thinking and what you do. What you think is you produced variance of yourself and you walk them through an imaginary time and a place and you know what happens to those imaginary variants. As they act out those particular patterns of behavior and you know which ones get into trouble at which ones succeed and you let the ones that get into trouble die and you let ones that succeed grip. Hold of your behavior and act them out in the world. It was a brilliant innovation you might say on the part of our ancestors to grow cognitive resources, sophisticated enough to produce variance of ourselves in a fictional space so that our thoughts could die instead of us, and so that's why we fail so that our thoughts can die instead of us, and then the reason that we speak is to learn from other people's thoughts, but more than that, it's that thinking individually is a very limited process because you're ignorant, which means you don't know everything and not only that bias in many, many ways your bias by what you know and what you don't know.

Speaker 5:          00:52:56       You're biased by what assumed you're biased by how you deceive yourself. You're biased by your temperament and your locale at your and your position in history. All of these things make you a very limited observer of the world, and so I think as you like, you can never think sufficiently. And so what we do because of that is taught. And so if I talk and I'm speaking truthfully, which means I'm telling you how things appear to be to me, that does not mean that I possess the truth, that means that I am saying as in an articulate manner as I possibly can, how things appear to me, that you can tell me how things appear to you and I could listen to you and maybe you can tell me some things about how things appear that I don't already know. And that's such a good deal because the purpose of thinking is to let our thoughts die instead of us.

Speaker 5:          00:53:50       And if you can kill one of my thoughts because it's stupid, then I don't have to act it out and die. And so that's like a really good deal. And so the reason that we engage in dialogue is so that we can take our thoughts that protect us from our own mortality and improve them and perhaps improve the morale. And there's just no loss in that. And so what that means in some senses that you can view everyone who disagrees with you as a source of potential wisdom. Because if you talk to someone who agrees with you, all you're going to find out is what you already know. You already know that. And if you talk to someone who doesn't agree with you, maybe one out of 10 things they say or maybe one out of 100 things of God only knows, you know, um, maybe there is wise is you and they're perverse way.

Speaker 5:          00:54:37       You can discuss something with them and they'll tell you something you never really thought of before and that'll just make some potentially miserable event in your life that much less likely and how good for you can that possibly be in like. I do believe that I've learned that. I've talked to you a great variety of people and I don't care if people agree with me. In fact, generally speaking, I find it more interesting if they don't. And I don't try to convince people because I don't believe that I have any right to determine their destiny. And I don't want to be turned in their destiny because I don't know what's best for them. And so I do listen to all sorts of strange and unlikely people and they tell me things that I don't know all the time and now it's just a spectacularly good deal.

Speaker 5:          00:55:24       And I decided a long time ago that one of the fundamental choices you make in life is whether your in love with what you know or in love with what we don't know. And I would say there's a lot more of what you don't know that there is what you know. And so it would be better to be in love with what you don't know because you don't know so much that if you could make friends with what you don't know, then you're going to be continually enlightened. And to be enlightened is to be engaged in the process of being enlightened. Not to be enlightened in any final sense because that's just not possible. So it's to act in a manner that continually in you. And a huge part of that is humility. And that's another word that's very difficult to use. I would say like love because it's, it's another word that's been both to death in some sense.

Speaker 5:          00:56:17       And it sounds like kind of cringing cowardice, limitation, but that's not what it means. What it means is that you know that there isn't enough to you and you can tell if there isn't enough to you because your life isn't everything. It could be. That's the arrogance, right? If your wife has everything you could imagine it to be, well then perhaps you don't need humility, but since you're life is not everything you could imagine it to be, you're deeply wrong about a lot of space, and so since you're wrong, then you should be looking around for the opportunity to correct those errors. Because why wouldn't you accept to protect your territory and that territory by definition, give them the existence of your own suffering is insufficient, so why are you playing to it so desperately? It doesn't provide what you need or what you want and a transformation of it and the expansion and up and the refiguring of it might be everything that you could possibly want.

Speaker 5:          00:57:20       And so then you start to envision yourself instead of as the holder of a piece of territory, as the person who is attempting to expand their capacity to act within all sorts of territories and exposure to more people into more viewpoints, especially with those people are telling you the truth, which they will do if you actually listen to them, then you can have your cake and eat it too. That's a great deal. And it's another way of reducing unnecessary suffering in the world by certainly reducing suffering and then perhaps learning to be how to be a greater use to people around you, which again seems to be nothing but for the good.

Speaker 5:          00:58:10       So humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn in order to overcome the insufficiency and then to learn is to die voluntarily and be born again in great ways in small. That's an archetypal idea at the basis of Western civilization is the idea that the logos, which is the capacity for truthful stage, is somehow associated with the act of death and rebirth. And there is multiple ways of interpreting that idea. And because I'm a psychologist, I tend to interpret it psychologically. I don't claim that the psychological interpretation exhausts the concept because I don't believe it does, but you see you are a certain way and some of that way is an error. And then when you learn them, an error has taken place. You have to let go of the conceptions that produced that error and that can be very, very painful.

Speaker 5:          00:59:09       For example, you may have entered into a relationship that was pathological and you know it's about analytical. What you're hooked into it in, your emotions are hooked into it and you've configured your life around it. And then in order to move forward, you have to let go of that. You have to admit to all the errors you've made through the time was wasted and you have to allow a large part of himself to die. Let's say you experienced in grief and misery and sorrow and and and anxiety and sleepless nights and all of that. But it's better than dying completely. And what? What that indicates is that every time you learned something large or small, the part that was in the era prior to obtaining that bit of information has to deteriorating, disappeared. There's pain associated with that, but then there's the possibility for growth and transformation and one of the most fundamental decisions that human beings made in their lives is whether or not they're going to identify with what they are or with what they could be and if they identify with what they could be, then they have to continually let what they are die so what they could come forward and so to learn is to dive.

Speaker 5:          01:00:22       Voluntarily, have to be born again in great ways and small. So then I wrote, yeah, speech must be untrammeled so that dialogue can take place. I think of the discussions that I've had with my wife and my kids, but primarily with my wife who's a very honest person. In fact, I've been married for 28 years. I've known her for 45 years and I'm 55. It's a very long time. We'd been friends with very long time and when she first came to be with me 30 years ago, I was learning to some of the things that I've talked to you about tonight and I told her that if we were going to be together

Speaker 5:          01:01:19       that she would have to tell the truth because if you didn't tell the truth and I wouldn't know who she was and I wouldn't know where we were and I wouldn't be able to solve any problems and neither would she because we'd be living a fictional relationship with one another. That struck me as a very bad idea, and so she took that to heart. I would say. I would also say it's like the more honest person than me and I'm not claiming claiming to be morally virtuous at any particular. I'm aware why multitude of faults, but the fact she has ripped so tightly onto the truth means that if I ever have a problem that I can talk to her and I know what she thinks. She doesn't tell me that she's right. We've learned that you know, because to tell someone the truth does not mean to play that you're correct.

Speaker 5:          01:02:10       It only is to claim that you're trying to communicate the way things look to you as clearly as possible and that you're open to the of correction, right? Because if someone can tell you how you're wrong precisely exactly how you're wrong, that's such a gift. If someone is willing to tell you the truth, then you have the possibility of learning from them and then you have two grades instead of one and that's a good deal and that's actually the spiritual purpose of marriage, let's say, is to produce a union between two people. It's predicated upon the truth so that the information flow between the kid maximize and so that they can both be elevated above the, the the restrictions of their own solitary bias existence and that facilitates. That produces the proper environment for children because then the child children don't face the father or the mother.

Speaker 5:          01:03:05       They faced the union of the father and the mother and that's an inviolable forest and the children will attempt to play one person off against the other. Because they're tricky because they're human and they're full of trouble. They're very good at poking and prodding and manipulating and invest in, but they want to hit a wall. They want to hit a wall that doesn't move because that makes them secure and if you have a relationship that's based on truth, then you can talk about how it is that you should meet with your children, for example, and you can agree upon it, and then when the children push the limits as they inevitably will, they don't find something spongy and dictate and eat a find something that's strong and sturdy and it's a wall and of course they can't move through the wall and that's frustrating, but then they're protected by the wall and that stops them from being anxious beyond their capacity to bear.

Speaker 5:          01:03:59       And so that structure that's brought about by truthful communication builds the walls around children that allow them to play freely and expand themselves and exist properly in the world. And so speech must be untraveled so that dialogue can take place. It's the only. If you talk to me, I want to know what you think. I don't say I don't agree with it. If you disagree with me, I'm going to fight with every bit of power at my disposal to determine who is correct. Well simultaneously recognizing that it's possible that it's you and not me and I'm not going to risk undergoing the small or large death that I have to undergo. If I find out that you're right without being convinced that you're right, so I'm learned to hit him with everything I've got, but part of that is also a quote that if I'm wrong, you will provide me with a better argument than the one I already have and that will make me better armed when I go out into the world. And so there's utility in neat, defeated by a skillful opponent and my wife is precisely that sort of opponent. Also has the addition, remarkable talent of being able to string together a list, a vicious insults, one after the other, like one I have ever encountered in my life.

Speaker 5:          01:05:24       It's quite comical because sometimes when we're embroiled in conflict, she'll start to do that and say something so outrageous, so absolutely beyond the Pale that he'll make me laugh and crack up, and then of course that's great, useful because if there is something ridiculous about quieting and that always brings to mind and when she does that, then I'm reminded why I liked her so much back then and still do because it's something to see someone with that kind of at spirit, that solar array for that, so speech must be untrammeled so that dialogue can take place so that we can all humbly learn. Well. That's the other element of humility is that humility is a precondition for learning. Right, and you have to be open to the possibility that you don't know what you need to know. That's the thing. It's not that you don't know everything because obviously you don't know everything, but it's more specific than that is that you may not know what you need to know.

Speaker 5:          01:06:21       Sometime in your life was going to be a piece of information. That's pretty sure it'll be in a negotiation or maybe in a medical decision or or maybe relationship decision or an art or in a, in a complex, in a, in a, in a complex tense situation with urgency and danger and you'll need a tool and then in there or things will go badly for you and you won't have it because there was an opportunity at some point in your life where have you been slightly more humbled you would have learned, you would have learned how to formulate and and utilize that tool right then and there and you didn't, and that left you. I know, and the thing is that your most powerful arms are your words by any, by any measure and the opportunity that you have to sharpen your capacity to use your words through dialogue, which is why space is cannot be safe for any length of time.

Speaker 5:          01:07:19       It's because of the safer the space is made now that more dangerous the space is made in the future and that's something that people are unwilling to understand it because they don't want to face the fundamental truth that life is suffering. There's no real escape from it, and so they make artificial spaces where people could delude themselves temporarily into naive again that life can be made safe, would in fact the best you could do is arm people to move forward in the past. When you do that is to test them with combat at every opportunity that you have to do that with the most carefully crafted arguments at your disposal and to teach them to stand up and defend their thoughts so that when they entered the real world and they're challenged, they know how to stand up forthrightly instead of crying and running home.

Speaker 2:          01:08:05       Thank

Speaker 5:          01:08:18       so that we can all humbling so that truth conserved love. Well, that's the goal is to inform yourself and that's a good word to inform yourself. It's. It's of course the short form of information and I really liked that word because it breaks into in formation and something information is formed properly. Ambien, the order. It's information, right? It's everything is aligned and moving in the same way like an army of information and so if you expose yourself to information, you get informed and we put yourself information and then your crystalline in your structure and and and and difficult to contend with and that's what you want to be. That's the thing to be. And you do that by learning humbling and that once you are in Toronto than your capacity to speak properly and to formulate your arguments and to negotiate and to formulate problems and to formulate solutions and to seek consensus makes you powerful enough.

Speaker 5:          01:09:28       Not so much that tragedy stays away from you because it can't, but so that when tragedy does come along and perhaps even when malevolence comes along that you'll be maximally prepared for it and we'll be able to deal with it. Which is what you have to do as a human being. Because there is in fact no avoiding it. And so what you do with someone that you love as you make them strong, you do not tell them that the world's safe and that they're secure and that there's nothing there to get the. Because there is everything there to get the

Speaker 5:          01:10:02       and so the best you can do is strengthen them and that's what a college is supposed to do and that's where the university is supposed to do and I would say that the colleges and the universities are increasingly failing on both of those fronts and it might be said that that's isolated only to the colleges and universities, but we should remember that those are the storehouses of our cultural knowledge and the generators of the new leaders and if the university's falter and that's particularly true of the humanities, then that falter and undermines the entire culture. Perhaps the entire civilization, and I do believe that we are in the process of doing precisely that now and I don't think that what I did six months ago and the creating of these two little videos complaining about a rather obscure piece of legislation in the rather tiny and insignificant country would have the track that the attention that it did attract. If it was only about pronouns. It's certainly not only about pronouns. In fact, it's not about pronouns at all. So the truth can serve low. Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       well you want to articulate

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       yourself and you want to be information so that you can formulate your existence. You generate your narrative. You could take your position in the world forthrightly and and with the capacity to intimidate when necessary and with the capacity to be a monster when necessary, have to be civilized and unnecessary and there was nothing in that that making yourself sharper or improve to make yourself sharper is to carry a sharper sort. Of course in these days with the highest virtue is harmlessness message like that seems positive reverse, but it's completely wrong. This is why I think my talks attracts men, is that a woman who hates, he wants to castrate you and make you safe that way, but a woman who loves you and wants to make you incredibly powerful and wise because then your housekeeper destruction is regulated in that manner and you're still good for something and so that would be the optimal solution rather than merely weakening and destroying. And I think we've had plenty of that. You've had more than enough, and I know as well, but women who have their souls intact, I would rather have monstrous man who were civilized and cringing milk sops, who were harmless but good for nothing.

Speaker 2:          01:12:37       Thank you.

Speaker 5:          01:12:49       Most women already have enough children to take care of.

Speaker 5:          01:12:57       So the truth conserved love so that suffering can be ameliorated. Well, obviously that's the goal. No, I, I hear people all the time who are possessed by a certain nihilism of spirit and that's not surprising. The understructure of the foundations of our cultural to be severely assaulted. I would say there were under tremendous assault. That's a process that has been unfolding for very many years perhaps since the development of empirical science, which is, which is one of the contributing factors because it's undermined our faith in our, in our traditional religious viewpoints. There was structure our, our moral behaviors or decisions about value. There's many other reasons why the foundations upon which Western civilization rests are under assault. Um, and because of that, it's easy to be uncertain and to say, well, what is the meaning of life? There is nothing to life. There's rolling, rolling significant, and there's nothing but suffering and why should I do anything in the face of all?

Speaker 5:          01:14:03       I would say, well, we can take that. Part of that is a fundamental truth is that the fact that life is suffering is a meeting. It's a meeting that no amount of rational argumentation we'll, uh, will, will rescue you from. In fact, the more nihilistic you come, the more the fact that life is suffering becomes self evident. It's almost as if he was trying to teach you something and it is trying to teach you something. It's trying to teach you that you cannot argue with your way of suffering and so then you might as well do something about it. And then I would say, well, that's where you can find the meaning. It's very straightforward. There's suffering in the world and much of it is aborad and, and, and, and unacceptable to anyone who attends to it. Anyone looks at it and the right answer to a child who's, who's been beaten and abused is not who's going to care in a million years.

Speaker 5:          01:15:04       But what can I do to stop that right now? And the nihilistic response that everything is insignificant means that the pain of children, for example, is insignificant. And that seems to be to me close enough to self evidently wrong so that it's an argument. 15 just be dispensed with. And so I might say to people who are wondering where to look for the meaning in their life is to take the self evident phenomena of, of phenomenon, of suffering seriously, and to orient themselves as rapidly as possible towards its amelioration and to work diligently towards that and for a number of years. And then to reevaluate the wife at the end of that and see if they think any differently about the world because they certainly will. And so the nihilistic argument to me seems remarkably weak both on its space and in depth because there are things to be done and the things that need to be done are obvious to anyone who will open their eyes and look at them.

Speaker 5:          01:16:07       And so then I would say, well, open your eyes and look what needs to be done immediately around you and do it and keep doing that and keep doing it. And then you'll find that the APP, the questions, the answers to the questions that you have been paralyzed you for so many years, will manifest themselves to you clearly enough so that you won't have to believe that because they will be self evident so that suffering can be ameliorated so that we can all stumble forward. Well, why I stumbled well, that's because we stumbled when we move forward because we don't know everything and so we moved forward in error constantly, which is why we need to speak with other people, can listen so that we don't stumble and fall and be unable to arise and so we stumbled forward because forward movement is necessary to human beings and forward movement implies that there is something better to go to and there is something better to go to the that is at least a world where there is the least amount of suffering that is commensurate with the existence of the world.

Speaker 5:          01:17:22       And I would say that we have ameliorated a substantial amount of suffering in the 20th century. We're doing a very good job of doing such things as combating absolutely already. You may or may not know that every single day about 150,000 people worldwide are lifted out of absolute poverty and about 300,000 people are attached to the electrical grid that we have. We have the enriching the bottom segment of the world's population for the last 15 years at a rate. It's absolutely unprecedented in human history and that makes me wonder just how well we could do if everyone really put their shoulders to the wheel and pushed and so if we did that together, then perhaps we won't degenerate into absolute chaos, which is certainly something that learns now and is a real threat. We're at a crisis point as far as I can tell, and we need to determine whether we want everything to go to hell, which it certainly could and I wouldn't recommend that or whether or not we can work together.

Speaker 5:          01:18:28       And that brings me to the last line, which is that so that we can all stumbled forward to the Kingdom of God. And why do I put it that way? And the reason I put it that way is because. Well, first of all, everybody does really know what that means even though they may not believe in it, but that doesn't really matter. I mean, I think that to believe is to act and not to spout a set of statements and it is certainly possible to act as if what you were attempting to do is bring about the Kingdom of God and I would say that doing so is something that will radically justify your miserable existence and that's really what you need is radical justification for your miserable existence. And because human beings are so powerful, really powerful beyond the limits of our imagination, we have no idea what our ultimate destiny might be.

Speaker 5:          01:19:21       That it's not unclear what our limits are. That if we decided to improve the place, let's say, and I would say starting with ourselves because that is the safest and humblest way to begin. That. There's no telling where we might end up and since we're all fragile and vulnerable creatures and we're going to lose everything anyways. We might as well risk everything to obtain the highest possible good, and then that will make the mystery that constitutes our life bearable as a consequence of our intrinsic nobility and there's nothing in that accept the good and so then why not do it, and so that's what I would enjoy and encourage, encourage everyone to do because there's nothing better to do than now and we might as well all do that, which there is nothing better than that.

Speaker 2:          01:20:17       Thank you

Speaker 5:          01:20:29       and so all repeat the outline

Speaker 2:          01:20:34       and then

Speaker 5:          01:20:39       no, I was talking about the boundaries of free speech and I believe that speech should be untrammeled because it's too dangerous with counseling does not mean that. I believe that speech free speech comes without responsibility. I believe quite the contrary. The free speech carries with it the highest responsibility because you went right to speak and wish to shoulder the responsibility of speaking. Then you have to contend with the fact that your words are the force that shapes the world and that with every word you utter things tilt slightly heavenward or slightly pell word and that that responsibility rests firmly on your shoulders and it's inescapable and that's a terrible thing to realize is a very meaningful thing to realize and people saying that they would like their life to be meaningful, but that's a questionable claim because to recognize your life is meaningful, is to understand that everything you do matters and that what it means for things to matter is that you're deciding in some sense between heaven on earth, hell on earth with every decision that you make and the decisions that you make echo far beyond you in ways that are almost incomprehensible and the destiny of the world is determined by the collective decisions of all the individuals that make up the world and that we're all locked together.

Speaker 5:          01:22:11       Deciding in which metaphysical direction our little planet will

Speaker 2:          01:22:17       we'll go.

Speaker 5:          01:22:19       So free speech carries with it heavy responsibility, but the responsibility is something you want because it justifies suffering of existence. Said life is suffering. Love is the desire to see necessary suffering. Meliorative truth is the handmaid of love. Dialogue is the pathway to truth, humility, that's recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn to learn is to dive voluntarily and to be born again in great ways in small

Speaker 2:          01:23:00       Paul,

Speaker 5:          01:23:03       so speech must be untrammeled so that dialogue

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       can take place so that we can all humbly learn so that truth can serve law so that suffering can be ameliorated so that we can all step forward towards the Kingdom of God. Thank you for inviting me to Mcminnville. Thanks. Now we'd like to take the opportunity to open things up for questions to answer and what we might do here. Obviously a the person in the simple answer your questions. Thanks for everything you said. Excuse me. I've ever had the opportunity to see so many people in here and he knew of test, validated. My whole exists. To thank is we're working importantly in India and we're alone and we're. We don't eat together. It's like a death trap. Medicare bringing people together is a monster. What is it that people are resonating to that we can use that will bring people together so that we can talk about solutions? No. I watched this Netflix special with Russell Peters and Russell Peters, for those of you who don't know is a Canadian comic. He's of Indian descent. He was raised in a suburb in Toronto which makes them acutely or culinary Canadian and he's very

Speaker 7:          01:26:05       similar to the Canadian culture and Russell has made his living insulting every racial and ethnic group that he could possibly insulted and so interesting because he filled up an entire arena in London. I think it was the most people that have ever gathered together to see a comedian before and it was a United Nations in the. In the arena. The Arabs were there and the and the Jews were there and the Russians were there in the south. Americans were there and every group was waiting with their tongues out so that Russell could insult their particular ethnicity so that they could feel finally that someone was saying something that was truthful and not hide it and to say it openly in some sense and to make light of it and we would say you bring people together by telling them what you think without manipulation, without care for the outcome, and people can hear the very rough terms if they trust who's stating the heaters is trusted by everyone because he's, I suppose non discriminant prejudice. He hates everyone equally.

Speaker 7:          01:27:32       There's nothing behind his assaults except the desire for everyone to come together in recognition of their idiocy and vulnerability of people very much enjoy that and so I would say you unite people to the degree that they can be united by saying what you think without trying to manipulate the outcome, and so that's a better way to live anyways because you don't have to keep track of anything that way. Not so nice. Say what you think carefully. You observed the response and adjust your behavior and and everyone likes that. So I don't know a better way of doing, of doing it now,

Speaker 8:          01:28:14       so I'm an author and a biologist and I was researching district keep disturbing. It was written by and the Irish. It's a peculiar, neither exceed because it voted so much energy and the author took this and her proposition was so full of basically and the brain as much of a race.

Speaker 7:          01:29:47       Well, that's a cool question. I think that you retool the story of the fall genesis, you see, I mean that because as far as I can tell that story means is that at some, at some point in time people became conceptually sophisticated enough to understand their own vulnerability, to realize their own native units. Do you discovered the path to discover the necessity of work and to be blown out of that preconscious paradise into the tragic believe history. I believe that's what that story means and you can read that as a tragic catastrophe with no solution. And I would say though, however, that since that time and God only knows when that was, the human race has been collectively attempting to address the problem and the solution that's emerged is something like, although a little bit of excess consciousness demolish us, a lot more consciousness could save us, and I think that that's the case.

Speaker 7:          01:31:02       There's no going back, right? Alcohol makes you unconscious, for example, when that's part of why people like it then it's not surprising sedatives to the APP, the things that people do to themselves to destroy your consciousness by distraction, do that, alleviate the terrible catastrophe of being morally that is easy to bear, but it's the wrong solution. The right solution is to be even more awake and to pay even more attention and there's a way out the problem that way. And so the fall, the idea of the fall indicates something about people that's irredeemably damaged. Well perhaps not redeemable, serious, right? There's this schism, Mba, let's say that's not easy to rectify. What historic indicates, and I think it's tightly tied with the kind of evolutionary process that were just commenting

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       on, the Irish elk was actually

Speaker 5:          01:32:04       developed its excess antlers. The theory goes as a consequence of female sexual selection course, female human beings are very choosy maters. Unlike chimpanzees, let's say, and there is reasonable evidence that one of the factories that propelled our political evolution forward was female sexual choosing this and and that's what perhaps that it's eve tempts Adam into self consciousness in genesis, and maybe that's why there's been new eternal enmity between men and women ever since, because women certainly do make men self conscious. It might be the primary effect that women have. Men that's advantageous in a more conscious men are better, but it's disadvantages for the manner in itself. Consciousness is generally a very unpleasant emotion, so I would say however, that self consciousness is the gateway to transcendence and development, and so the best thing for human beings to do is to bear up underneath their self-conscious tragic end to transcend passed that by becoming even more conscious. And I think that's the hope that we have. I think that that's what the great religions of the world constantly dangled before us is that if you are suffering in your half a weak state, then it's time to wake up completely and then perhaps that will go away. Well, we don't know, but we don't have a better option. No other option is annihilation and that seems a bit premature, shall we say.

Speaker 5:          01:33:35       Yeah. Given that we're not all we could be, it seems a bit premature.

Speaker 4:          01:33:43       Some of your youtube videos you have talked about the ancient mythology of Babylon in Egypt and you described it as a way that they act out what they sensed to be true, but even because they couldn't articulate, is there a modern day equivalent of acting out the truth and if so, describe it for us?

Speaker 5:          01:34:14       Well, I would say in large part Christianity's exactly.

Speaker 4:          01:34:19       No, it it. It's fundamentally

Speaker 5:          01:34:25       description of pattern, but in an optimized being be and the way that it was generated, and again this is a psychological interpretation. I don't claim that it's exhausting. Not The least is that you could imagine that as people move through time, this is akin to the idea that the figure of Christ is implicit in the Old Testament, which is also a psychological idea. Imagine that as people progress through time, they observed that some

Speaker 7:          01:34:58       were handling exist, it's better than others, and those people attracted attention and admiration and stories regenerated and so you might say that out of 100 people, the most capable of honorable and respectable and useful and benevolent person was identified and then celebrate it at least with admiration and then perhaps with stories and so then you might imagine that there were 10 groups of 100 people in each of them had their story of the most admirable person and then those stories came together as those tribes amalgamated and then the story of the 10 most admirable people was amalgamated into. I figured that was the most admirable of those 10 and the entire groups group of ten one hundred tribes. People could come together under that banner and it really looks like in some sense that's how monotheism or polytheism is. That the tribal groups had their local ideals, let's say, and then when they came together and it was a local ideals were amalgamated into what you might describe as a mat at ideal and people were able to unite under that Metta ideal. So for example, in in Mesopotamia there was a god known as martyr and Martin had a very large number of names, some of which are quite fascinating and the reason he had a very large number of names was because he wasn't available. Have a very large number of previous thoughts.

Speaker 7:          01:36:33       So you know, there's an idea, a Christian idea, for example, that Christ we cave case, let's say, or a hero of heroes. And from a psychological perspective I just read that was straightforward observation is that pass the stories of the great people of the past, amalgamated. Out of that emerged in the human imagination. A conceptualization of the ideal. It's a very strange conceptualization because if it falls something like the voluntary voluntary acceptance of suffering and it's simultaneous transcendence at that's a candidate in some sense, the old stories of the hero who fights the dragon because of course in some sense the ultimate dragon is about death and also at the level that might produce an unjust death and to be able to face that without shrinking is perhaps the essential hallmark of the most well developed character out that ideal is a product of the collective imagination of humanity. From a psychological perspective, what it means to be on that, if anything, I no position to determine. Okay,

Speaker 7:          01:38:24       great. Okay, so the question is how do you speak truth in a highly hierarchical environment like a workplace where perhaps you have disagreeable than even tyrannical managers and a resistance to the truth? Well, that's an excellent question. The first thing I would say is you prepare yourself and so if you want to negotiate, for example, you can negotiate from a position of weakness because you lose, you'll lose in every way. You can't stand the conflict. You've got nothing to fall out. So if you're in a workplace that's, that's not admittable to informative messages, let's say the first thing you do is look for another job or I don't, I don't. Mainly you take another job. That is what I need. I mean you need to provide yourself with credible options because otherwise you'll be weak when you, when you stand forth and especially somebody who's a bully will just pull you right over because we've got no power and so you have to prepare yourself and you do that by reducing the risk to yourself in an intelligent map.

Speaker 7:          01:39:38       And one of the things I counseled my clients, many of whom are executives or people who are successful, is that you should always be prepared to make allowable awkward movement move because otherwise you have negotiating power. And so of course that means that if you have the options, you're in a weak position, but it is the case that if you have the options that you're weak position. So you keep your CV update, you develop the skills necessary to make you movable in the marketplace. You reduce your fear of interviews as an alternative. Know that the processes that you have to go to through to seek alternative employment, which is a very good thing to do anyways, and then if you could put yourself in a position of relative strength, then you can decide what it is that you have to say first. You don't fight unnecessary bouts and you don't make unnecessary enemies and perhaps you put forth attendant of suggested with brain argumentation behind it after perhaps also finding out if there are other people who feel the same way you do and I'm formulating intentional solution and then generally speaking, under those conditions, the probability that you will be successful will be buried.

Speaker 7:          01:40:58       I would also say that if under those conditions you still can succeed, that you should leave because you're purchasing security of a person out there, pricing, security, soul, and that's a bad choice. It beat you down across time and you don't want that.

Speaker 6:          01:41:18       So Yep.

Speaker 5:          01:41:39       Chicken, chicken, you again, really young Americans for liberty. So I'm thinking you guys and thank you. Obviously I'm, I'm also here for Portland. I completely agree with your assessment with some colleagues from the newsroom, miserable newsgroup called torch cast your mind if you've got split testing. Um, I do have a societal question for you. What in your view is the macro agenda or the goal, the end goal, the end game for the current sjw left who fight free speech, obfuscate the basic concepts of identity and you pedal outright falsity in regards to the with things, for instance, in the media and on college campuses and is a solution, not the solution, but a solution to that moving of the overton window, so to speak, through mischief, trolling

Speaker 6:          01:42:40       speakers.

Speaker 7:          01:42:42       Well, the motivational issue is, is complex. I think some of it is the naive good harkness of youth. Fair bit is that some of it I think is the consequences of the introduction of women aren't passive to the political environment and the manifestation of the personality trait, the personality trait, agreeableness as a political force for perhaps the first time in history. It's a radical transformation and have women occupy positions of power and we don't know what that will be for better or for worse. To think that it will only be for better is naive. You want believe so and then there's willful blindness. There's ideological possession and there's. There's a kind of.

Speaker 7:          01:43:43       I'm grateful there's a deep gratitude as well because in a sense of historical lack of historical perspective, it's quite compelling to me to my way of thinking perhaps because I'm reasonably well versed in the nature of historical catastrophes. The fact that we can all assemble peacefully in this unbelievably beautiful place in this crazily beautiful town with with the tension that does exist. Just rather minimal white historical standards and engage in this sort of discussion peacefully and productively is almost incomprehensible given the evidence that's come forth to us. Throw a kiss and I don't believe that we do enough to teach our young people just exactly how improbable that is and so I don't think they know and so what they see instead of the improbable functionality of our culture is all the errors that it still makes and it's reasonable for them to see that, but not without that broader context.

Speaker 7:          01:44:58       What to do about. Well, I think the fundamental thing to do about it, as I said, is for, and this is I believe the western way fundamentally is for people to Excel to magnify the degree to which they're taking personal responsibility for their life because I think that as individuals they'll find the proper way to fight the micro battles that will be necessary in order to stamp the type of rising radical radicalism. Let's leave it at that. What I think will have with the amount of what I would also encourage people to do is to stop enrolling in those classes. I mean the humanities are bleeding. People like map men are leaving in droves. There won't be a man in the humanities at 10 years. And then most of the social sciences as well. I mean I've watched the enrollment curves for really for decades and have seen this propagate itself across time, but more delicately even is that the overall proportion of enrollment amongst students in the humanities has declined every decade since the 19 sixties. And so as the humanities moves farther away from what it is that they truly have to offer, which is the transmission of the wisdom of the past to youth so that they could see their proper way forward and to become articulate well are responsible citizens. As they abandoned that responsibility, then all they have to offer is dynamism and resentment. That doesn't sell well except to a tiny fraction of people who would like to have as much of that as they can possibly manage.

Speaker 4:          01:46:52       We see it. We see it happening. That essay, overall cultural shift tour. I'm selling also to people in the liberty rally in Berkeley. You look at essentially every post college protest on the streets, Portland to Chicago. It seems that how, how do we address the. This type of narrative is not just adding all this, but it seems that the idea of what you were given your framework of getting into the Kingdom of God, the kingdom is completely different for the cultural issues.

Speaker 7:          01:47:37       Yeah. Well, well, you know, in many times in my life I trucked face, let's say the choice between a political group and this say philosophical root or a psychological root that I had chosen to go and what I gave you tonight is really the best answer that I have. I'm not trying to make the case that would that. That's a comprehensive answer, but I think that if you want to move forward properly, the best thing to do is to organize yourself. I need personally to organize yourself as well as you possibly cap at the gift, those things around you that aren't in order in order your family, how you conduct yourself because then you're going to be in the best position to make the proper decisions in the specific situations that uptake to you and I think that that's where people have their power and I think that power is not insignificant. Not at all. So that's the best I can do for that.

Speaker 5:          01:48:40       Yeah, I mean I can. That was a really interesting question and I'm not a social justice warrior myself, but as I understand it, I think a lot of people I've talked to who we think about that, I think they're really trying to dismantle what they see to be unfair systems have advantages and the patriarchal structures they have it. So, um, my question is because this, this truth idea really, really interests me. Uh, do you feel that because of the limits of your own human experience and your own identity, that there are things that you will never be able to change your mind?

Speaker 7:          01:49:22       I think there are that, there are things that I'll never. There are things are, let's say would stake my life on, which I think is a better way of putting it. I'm one of those is that it's better to serve, to denounce it at that it's better to, to not lie, let's say instead of telling the truth, because someone asked earlier, how can you go about telling the truth and in some sense you can, but you can't stop seeing things you've known to be false. Which is a good start. And that's within anyone's scrapped and I could say I'm not likely to change my mind about the utility of doing that either because I've decided that I'm going to accept the consequences of doing that gratefully regardless of what the consequences are. And so at some point in your life, and perhaps not precisely when you're young, you have to decide what it is that you're going to act out something Carl you specify, he said, know you're going to act out of mythological structure of one type or another.

Speaker 7:          01:50:31       You're either going to be aware of it or not. If you become aware of it, that perhaps you could choose it. And that doesn't give you any guarantee precise, you know, because even if you act out, let's say that her path, you know when you and you face the dragon and combat, there's no necessary. It's not a necessity that you when the dragon to the EU. But the idea is that that's your best. Fap All things considered. It's your best bet to face it forthrightly. And I believe that. I believe that because I'm a clinical psychologist and one of the, one of the things that clinical psychologists know is that if you help people confront the things that they avoid voluntarily, they get better and that that's a fundamental truth and I think it's the fundamental truth of human advancement and learning and it's possible that we are Irish elk and our fundamental approach to the world is deeply flawed and if we pursue it wholeheartedly will end up estate.

Speaker 7:          01:51:32       It is possible that that's the case, but if that's the case that there's nothing I can do about it, time, part of the human race and I'm going to act out its destiny the best that I can manage and and I'm not willing to reconsider things at that level. I think that that's because I've thought them through sufficiently for me and because I've also determined the course of my own life, that and from watching the effects of what I be talking about or other people that what I'm doing is serving the good at least as well as I could do it and what I've learned is be very helpful to me personally. It's been very helpful to my family. I know it's been helpful for my students because they always tell me that and people write me all the time and say that they'd found a great utility in what I was communicating and so that's enough evidence for me right now that I'm on a path that's sufficient, that sufficiently justifies me. So I'd just like to say we have about 20 minutes until probably going to take five

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       or 10 minutes more questions then about 10 minutes to fill about talks about themselves and make their way out. So typically I just like to thank everybody who helped organize this event. Um, I've been watching yourself on youtube for a while now and I really felt that you help me and I'm sure really, I really appreciate. Hey, it's a pleasure. So I'm just wondering, based on history and whatnot that you go into a discussed like the archipelago and whatnot, what kind of role do you think government should play in society?

Speaker 7:          01:53:46       I think that it depends on the circumstances and so I don't think that that's the right question. I think the right question is how should the government constituted itself so that it can respond flexibly to the demands of the situation. I believe that there's utility in a conservative viewpoint and I believe that there's utility in a liberal viewpoint, but that it determined it depends on the specifics of the situation and that there is also error and even catastrophic error on both sides, so the government needs to be constituted. I would say much like it is what else were sovereignty is, is instantiated it people for better or worse so that the people can learn from their errors and that we progress by engaging in dialogue across people of different temperamental types because sometimes the borders are to open and they need to be tight and sometimes the borders are too closed and they need to be elusive if they be.

Speaker 7:          01:54:57       If the borders between everything become completely closed and everything, God's right, it's deprived of air, water and everything died. So there's endless mythological representations of that would be part of the reason that Egypt, for example, in the mosaic story, is a kingdom of Sam. That stone is because Sam Stone Water and Moses who's, who's, who's someone who leads his people out of tyranny is a master of water and the message and that story is that sometimes the kingdom turns to stone and it's a tyranny and new revivification needs to be integrated. The doors have to open, a new information has to flow in, but then there are times when I. The story, for example, there are times when, uh, there's too much influx of inflammation. That's a flood. That's one way of reading the flood stories. There's just too much pouring in. Everyone drops. And what we have to always ask ourselves is, are we tending the garden properly?

Speaker 7:          01:55:56       Right? It's not drying out for lack of water. It's not drowning because there's too much, there's too much moisture coming in, and the only way we can determine that is by paying attention to communicate. And that's why free speech is such a fundamental necessity. So it's not, it's not precisely what the government can do because it has to do many things, but because it's the society of people and people have to do many things, but how the government goes about making decisions and then at least with the government that has to do is protect those, what would you call the rare and precious processes that enable it to continue to be a responsive and alive entity. And I think that we have done a remarkably good job of that. The West and I think that the US is a great example of that for all its flaws. Everything is flaw,

Speaker 4:          01:56:47       but,

Speaker 7:          01:56:49       but the proper analysis is flawed compared to white. And the answer is to the hypothetical utopia of your imagination. The answer is to other similar systems that have actually existed in time and space. And by that measure I would say the West is doing spectacularly well and I don't think that we should sync it because of. Because we're ignorant to vote. It's available.

Speaker 4:          01:57:17       Thank you. Postmodern philosophers, they mentioned this happened. That's destructive ideas caused people questioning. We cited a who has mentioned as an inspiration, so, uh, I wonder how might somebody like or somebody like me getting each other?

Speaker 7:          01:57:52       Well, a reasonable amount of food, colon, I would say that among the postmodernists he's rather remarkable in the fact that you can actually understand what you say, what he wrote particularly surprising, like the idea that mental illness is in part a social construct is if you're a reasonably educated clinician that's more than self evident in virtually every complex activity that human engagement is culturally determined to a large degree, a exterra doubt that I have a problem with. Uh, and I also know that he put his finger on a very complex problem, which is like the central postmodernist place. Every situation allows for a potentially infinite number of interpretations which is true, and therefore it's difficult to determine which interpretation should be held up as paramount. Now that's true. In fact, the artificial intelligence researchers ran into that. They were trying to design systems that could perceive the world because the original idea was that perceiving the world was easy because it's just made a phase and learning how to manipulate those states.

Speaker 7:          01:59:10       That act would be the complicated problem, but it actually turned out perception was the complicated problem because there's an indefinite number of ways to perceive things. Now, the reason the postmodernist role were wrong is because there aren't an indefinite number of interpretations of the world that don't kill you or make others killed you. There's a very constrained number of interpretations that allow you to continue to exist and equally importantly, allow you to continue to exist in the presence of other people. So although there are many interpretations that you can ferret out of the Shakespeare text, your job is to ferret out what that actually helps you live. And that's hypothetically the goal of the guides to great literature. And so I think the postmodernists radically overplayed their hand and that's particularly true with data. And I think that the people who followed Aryzta are in many cases doing so because it's a hell of a lot easier than actually doing the difficult job of extracting out useful tools from the literature of the world, which is what you do when you read, you extract out useful tools with regards to nature being each has said something about everything.

Speaker 7:          02:00:24       And so every philosopher of the modern age, one way or another is deeply influenced by nature and the problem with niches that he was a thinker prolific beyond comprehension. Virtually I did recently. I did a, I think it was a 45 minute video on one paragraph. You choose beyond good and evil and you know, I barely started to scrape the surface of it and of course he has multiple books. So Nisha is a very strange character. And he said that he philosophize with a hammer and he meant it. And his critique of Christianity was devastating I would say. But I would also say, and this is a rather shocking comparison, that nature play. The role that you played with regard to Christianity was the same rule that a complaining that wooed, which is the can devour athlete but disease, flesh and leave, what's healthy behind, and I think there is a reading if Nietzsche that allows each of that allows for precisely that when he said that God was dead, he also said that that would be a catastrophe.

Speaker 7:          02:01:31       The likes of which we could not even imagine that society itself would oscillate back and forth murderously for centuries as a consequence. So it wasn't triumphant. He strolled to find out what an alternative to that point. Yet he formulated the idea of the overlap, so essentially right. The Superman was capable of creating his own. I think that each state there, I think it was a mistake that was rectified, Carl Young, because you'll know that I think was really the first person. Although Nicha has has intimations of this because nature does say that art drives philosophize, right? Which is very biologically oriented observation. Like what you noted was that, well, we don't create our own values because the values are implicit within us, but we can read the start and that's why he was so interested in the analysis of mythology and the unconscious and so I think the postmodernists took the the part of nature that's only destructive to its final conclusion and that's what's being played out now.

Speaker 7:          02:02:36       Derrida's critique of modern civilization is failing a logocentric right? Male dominated, centered around the idea of the logos. He regarded that as nothing but a tool of oppression and marginalization. There's some truth in that because whenever you produce a value system, you also exclude things from the value system as valuable obviously, but the problem I think that the postmodernist smoke address you the alternative pretty all your systems and dealing with the with the exclusive that comes along with that is to drop it nihilistic chaos and worse while you're drawing to get nihilistic chaos, you're going to call out sources of totalitarian order and so it's no, it's no sweat. What I seek postmodernism doing do students, generally speaking, it's demoralizing completely until they come to university. Looking to categorize the identity, often cleaning to the last rebated shreds of their culture. That's just what's keeping them afloat.

Speaker 7:          02:03:39       All the postmodernist professors do is take those remaining. Frank's took her along to stay above the water, tell their illusory and take them away. It's like, well, now you're free. Like I've dropped you in the middle of the ocean. You could swim in any direction you want. You're free. And I think that that's rooted in large part. Even in hatred of youth. I really believed that because why would you crippled people if you didn't pay? And so there's hatred of humanity lurking at the bar, but the worst excesses of video logs in general. You know, you hear this from environmentalist, so I've heard this many times, the planet, it would be better off if there were no people on it. It's like, well, let's keep you away from the thermal nuclear weapons.

Speaker 2:          02:04:27       Thanks.

Speaker 7:          02:04:31       So it's not easy to come up with a canonical interpretation of nature. There's no doubt about that. Again, would say, I thought for a long time from a psychological perspective, I tried to understand whether the speeches philosophy that drove him insane, but I think the evidence for that is nonexistent. I think he did suffer from a degenerative brain disease severity and I actually think different fundamental laws, which I haven't read everything he wrote because there's books, pumps, but I read this great works in chronological order, I think is fundamental. Philosophy is is affirmative negative, but he's a critic and he wanted to find something that he could stand on and that's what critics, real critics here. You're not looking to destroy you. I'm looking for something that you could stand up and nature was certainly very useful to me in. I knew it was also extraordinary useful to crawl your was a real student of nature and I was really devoting himself to solving the problem that each proposed, which is well, what do we do with the aftermath of the depth of God and humans? Answer was we rescued from the deaths and that's the right dance. That's what the university should be doing with young people. It's like you're dead. Father's in the library, go out there and fought. Fair to help. Right. And Unite. Live and become the thing that keeps chaos at bay. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:05:52       Thank you.

Speaker 7:          02:06:01       Concludes our talk with Jordan Peterson. Please join me in thanking. You've been getting.

Speaker 2:          02:06:06       Thank you.
