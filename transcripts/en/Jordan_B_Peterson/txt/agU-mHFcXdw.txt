Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello. So some of you may have heard about the Google memo at his been circulating virally around the Internet for the last couple of days. That was written by James Damore who was fired for it last night. And a colleague of his reached out to me and put us together. And so I'm going to talk to James today about exactly what happened and why and perhaps what should be done about it. So all, so that's what we're going to do in the interview I had with him, which finished at about three o'clock on Tuesday, August 8th follows immediately after this introduction. Hi everybody. I'm speaking today with James Demore and an unidentified google employee who wishes to remain anonymous. Um, reasons that I think are obvious. And James last week put his hand in a blender by circulating an internal memo that I would say has become somewhat infamous. So James, let's start with, let's start with a bit of discussion about you to tell us who you are, about your background, and about what you were doing at Google.

Speaker 2:          01:22          Yeah. So I, I was actually just, you know, I'm really interested in science and psychology and stuff and then I really like puzzles and that's how I got into Google. Actually. I did one of their coding competitions. They just recruited me out of that. And so I Google, I was mostly working on search and image and video search in particular.

Speaker 1:          01:47          So what's, tell us about your educational background a bit.

Speaker 3:          01:51          Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:52          Yeah. So I just did a random science and math and undergrad and I ended up with a degree. I didn't really know what I was going to do. So I started doing research at Mit and then, uh, I went to a systems biology at Harvard. I initially wanted to work with Martin Nowak. He's really great at and evolution and Game Theory. But, uh, then I started working on other things. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:21          So tell us a bit about systems biology. What is that exactly? What kind of research were you doing at Mit?

Speaker 2:          02:28          Yeah, so it sounds, biology has many different meanings, but it's generally just mathematical biology and uh, I guess seeing biological systems as a whole rather than just individual molecules. And so I, I liked looking at populations and so my interest in evolution.

Speaker 1:          02:52          So why did that make you a viable candidate and doodle? It's eight.

Speaker 2:          02:58          Uh, I think they just

Speaker 1:          03:00          saw a smart guy that could code. Now you've been there three years, is that correct? But also has an intern before that.

Speaker 2:          03:09          Yeah. So about four years total.

Speaker 1:          03:11          And so how would you say you've performed as an employee and doable and people being happy with you? Or have you been here?

Speaker 2:          03:19          No, I got promoted twice. My last review was the highest possible. Superb, which is the top few percent aisle. So I, it definitely wasn't based on performance that they fired me.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Have you enjoyed working at Google? Has it been a good experience?

Speaker 2:          03:37          Yeah, I mean I love Google then. That's horrible part. Like I've always been the biggest google fanboy, all like, I've never had an iphone. I've always tried to convince my friends to use android and all of these different things. And yeah, I mean this is just puts a sour taste in my mouth.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Okay. So, so you've got a good educational background. You were interested in things that Google would be interested in. You're a good coder, you've worked with them for a number of years. We've done an excellent job and you're pretty pro google. That's basically the background. Okay. Now last week you wrote a memo which has attracted a tremendous amount of attention and in that memo you, you made a number of claims and the claims were, and please correct me if I've got this, if I'm not summarizing this properties, you were attempting to describe reasons why there might, why a lack of gender parity might exist within Google for example with an NGO in engineering or broadly but also in patients more broadly. And um, you laid out in a very elaborated document and I reviewed it and as far as I can tell, your opinions are well supported by the relevant psychological science. And I think what I'll do in the description of this video when I link it is putting the references so that people can decide for themselves. I want to put up a web page about gender differences in general, but I'll try to hit the highlights for this particular document. So why did you do this?

Speaker 2:          05:14          Yeah, so about a month and a half ago, I went to one of our diversity summits, all of it unrecorded and to proceed credit. And they told me a lot of things that I thought just were not right.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Okay. What do you mean unrecorded in super secret? Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:34          Well, I mean they were telling us about a lot of these potentially illegal practices that they've been doing to try to increase diversity. And

Speaker 1:          05:45          what kind of practices?

Speaker 2:          05:48          Uh, well basically treating people differently based on what their race or gender ours. Yeah. Basically. I

Speaker 1:          05:57          see. And so, and it was ultra secret, an unrecorded. And in what manner?

Speaker 2:          06:03          Uh, yeah, so I, most meetings I Google, I recorded anyone at Google come watch it. We're trying to be really open about everything except for this. They don't want any paper trail for any of these things.

Speaker 1:          06:17          Okay. Why?

Speaker 2:          06:19          Because I think it's illegal and I mean, as some of the internal polls showed, there were a large percent of people that agreed with me on the document. And so if everyone got to see this stuff, then they would really bringing up some criticism.

Speaker 1:          06:38          Yeah. A large number of people in Google and a very large number of well-informed biological scientists we might also add. So I mean it was quite, I was quite struck by your document given that no, it would have been a decent document for a well informed psychologist, research psychologists to write, but it was somewhat of an outsider. But you've got the, you got the highlights accurate as far as I'm concerned. So, okay. So you went to this diversity meeting and you weren't happy with the sorts of things that you were being told and with the practices is, is that both correct? Yeah. And what were you mean tool?

Speaker 2:          07:16          Uh, well, so that I think there's a lot of ways in which they pressure people to increase the diversity of their team. And you know, there's no way to do that besides actually choosing someone based on their race or gender. Right.

Speaker 1:          07:34          I don't lucidity precisely,

Speaker 2:          07:37          uh, I more women or underrepresented racial minorities.

Speaker 4:          07:45          Can I jump in? Yeah. I would hesitate to say that that's 100% true across 100%. Right. So the organization that I'm in, I have not personally seen anything that I would deem crossed the line. Um, you know, I personally believe that there are a good amount of synergies to be found if you can combine, you know, slightly different ideologies, um, into a room. And that is the, the thesis that some groups are working towards. Um, obviously there's going to be a distribution of how people follow the rules. Um, and you know, it's unfortunate to hear that it's, you know, it could be that some people fall to the wrong side of that distribution, but that's certainly wouldn't, it would not apply to everybody.

Speaker 1:          08:36          It certainly also distressing to hear that there is acceptance of the idea that diversity can be mapped on to race and gender, especially with regards to performance because there's no evidence for that whatsoever. So. Okay. So you went to this meeting and then you, you just started to write this document and, um, how long had you been working on it before he released it?

Speaker 2:          08:58          Uh, yeah. So I was doing it like throughout my free time. I, and I just wanted to clarify my thoughts on this and I really just want it to be proven wrong because you know, if what I was saying was right, then something bad is happening. And so yeah, about a month ago I submitted it to feedback to that program and you know, I saw that people looked at it, but no one actually said anything.

Speaker 1:          09:24          And what's your, and then did you submit,

Speaker 2:          09:27          uh, I basically said what I said in the, in the document and then I linked to the document itself. And so I actually published this about a month ago and it was only after it got viral and then we, to the news that Google started caring.

Speaker 1:          09:46          Can you, so how did it go viral and do you know and how was it leaked?

Speaker 2:          09:51          Yeah, so I, there was a group at Google called skeptics and so I was like, okay, maybe there'll be able to prove me wrong in some way. Like there's Scott's a rule about things, right? I wasn't naive, I guess. And so I sent them a message like, okay, what do you think about this? Is Google in some sort of echo chamber or I'm crying and echo chamber. And then it just exploded after that. And you know, our internal, yeah. It was just spread throughout. I've all of Google.

Speaker 1:          10:27          Do you and do you know, was it the, was it the skeptic's group that started to spread it around?

Speaker 2:          10:33          Yeah. And then there were a lot of upper management that uh, you know, specifically called it out and start saying how harmful it is and how is unacceptable. This sort of viewpoint is not allowed at Google.

Speaker 1:          10:49          Yeah. What sort of viewpoint, exactly. The idea that there were differences between men and women that actually might play a role in, in, in, in, in the, in the, in the corporate world that that's an opinion that's not acceptable.

Speaker 2:          11:02          Yeah, it seems,

Speaker 1:          11:05          well, I know, you know, understandably it is, these issues are tricky morally and politically, but thing that was disturbing to me about watching the response to you is that as far as I can tell, there isn't anything that you said in that paper. First of all, that is in fact biased in a manner that should open you up to the sorts of charges that had been opened up against you or that violates the scientific literature as it currently stands. So both of those are rather distressing.

Speaker 2:          11:35          Yeah. And there was a lot of misrepresentation by upper management just to silence may I think?

Speaker 1:          11:42          Yes. And why is that do you think? Like why? Why is it the Google couldn't have actually, do you think that Google couldn't have come out and have an intelligent discussion about this instead of, well, first of all, releasing like Dan, I Read Danielle Brown's response to you, which I thought was absolutely appalling, down to appalling. And then they fired you, which seems to be like really bad pr move, but more importantly, it doesn't actually deal with the issues at hand. You know, they're basically saying something like, well, what was the rationale for firing you? Exactly. What was the excuse that was given?

Speaker 2:          12:15          So the official excuse was that I was perpetuating gender stereotypes

Speaker 1:          12:19          that you were perpetuating gender stereotypes. Yeah. And it, did they say anything else about your performance or about anything else that you had done?

Speaker 3:          12:28          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:28          No, it was, that was the only reason.

Speaker 1:          12:31          And who, who, who fired you? Technically?

Speaker 2:          12:35          Uh, it was my hr representative and my director.

Speaker 1:          12:41          Okay. And do you end, do you have any idea on who's ordered as they were acting or if this was something that they conjured up themselves or,

Speaker 2:          12:50          hi, I'm sure I probably went from higher up than that because I'm, this is a huge pr move. So they would need approval from higher ups.

Speaker 1:          13:02          Right. And I think the CEO, the CEO, actually made some comments about the issue today, which I'll probably cut into this video as we, as I edited. So, yeah. Okay. All right. So the first question is, how are you doing?

Speaker 2:          13:20          I'm doing okay. I, there's a lot of messages that I'm trying to sort through and just trying to figure out what I should do now. But

Speaker 1:          13:30          yeah, you've been given some interesting job offers as far as I can tell.

Speaker 2:          13:35          Yeah, I've gotten a surprising amount as a part. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:38          Yeah. Well, I suspect I'm sacked. I'm virtually certain that you have a majority viewpoint. It's just at the people who hold the alternative perspective, which are the radical social constructionist types who insist that everything is a consequence of socialization. There are a little bit more organized politically, but there are clearly wrong, scientifically they're wrong. So actually the wrong ethically for that. So, so you, you probably have more support than you sake and it'll be very interesting to see how that turns out. So, so what do you think about having written this are mean now your life is going to be turned upside down and for quite a while I suspect. So you put yourself out on the line doing this. So what do you think about that?

Speaker 2:          14:27          It definitely sucks, but I mean at least I was proven right. You know,

Speaker 1:          14:33          when, what do you mean by proven right?

Speaker 2:          14:35          Oh, just that the whole culture just tries to silence. I need a dissenting view and then we really need some more objective way of looking at these.

Speaker 1:          14:52          Yeah, well I felt the same way with the University of Toronto decided to, you know, an attempt to shut me down after I need my videos. I thought, well that just proves my point. Yeah. Cause I mean to me the video saying well I don't like the climate that's developing and it's making it very difficult to have conversations about certain things. And your examples even more egregious I think because you know, I at least objected to a piece of legislation that in principle would have been a benefit to an identifiable group. But say the transgender group, I don't believe it is of any benefit to them, but you could make a case that it was, but you, all you did as far as I can tell it is review the modern personality literature and the literature on individual differences relating to men and women and other groups. And there's actually not very much opinion in your piece at all. So what that does is that it is not possible to actually have a discussion about the scientific literature on these issues without putting yourself at risk. And that's a hell of a thing for an engineer because being engineers and rely on the facts as far as I can tell, and one of the things I liked about engineers is that they tend to stick fairly closely to the facts that they're not a very political group. You know? Generally speaking, they're much more practical.

Speaker 5:          16:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:15          I, I don't know how that can expect a silence so many engineers then intelligent people and just

Speaker 5:          16:23          deny science. Like it's like

Speaker 1:          16:24          this. Yeah. Well the question too is what are you supporters within Google going to do? Because you know, I would say you're a great warning then because you, you showed what happened, you showed exactly what happens if you have enough, I don't know what you'd call it, curiosity and courage I suppose, but, but mostly curiosity to lay out what you think for discussion. I mean, you opened this conversation, you said that, you know, you weren't jumping up and down and insisting you were right. You were trying to lay out what you understood from doing a fair bit of reading and, and make the case that the, these facts, the facts about the differences between men and women and employment choice and payment and all that aren't being discussed and they're not being discussed. I mean we know for example, and I'll put this citation in down in the description that's been very difficult for the, the Swedes for example, to flatten out the gender distribution for engineers in Sweden and in and in and in the Scandinavian countries in general, despite their advanced social engineering, let's call it.

Speaker 1:          17:38          And they also can't get male nurses. You know, I think it's four out of five nurses in Scandinavia, if I remember correctly, are female. And the reverse number are our engineers are male. And you know, that seems to be associated with this quite well founded. Um, scientific observation that women tilt towards interest in people and men tilt towards interest in things and that that's associated with testosterone exposure in utero. This is so much science. You know what? It isn't anybody beating an ideological trump because most of the people, I would say that most of the people who are publishing this would have been even happier. How did turn out the other way? You know, the findings actually run contrary to their biases because academia is generally full of people whose biases are left and now and then, you know, scientific findings emerged to dispute, um, uh, nydia logical proposition, not certainly the case with the role of biology versus society in establishing gender differences. So the science is very credible. It doesn't mean it's completely beyond dispute, but that's not the point either because your survey was actually pretty decent survey of the current state of affairs with regards to individual differences. That doesn't mean it's right. So, okay, so what, what are your, what are your, what does your family think about all of this?

Speaker 2:          19:06          Yeah, they definitely support me, but they don't really know what I should do from here. They don't want me to just go to a ton of news corporations and do all these interviews and stuff and because they just want a twist, whatever I say towards their agenda to it's, it's not really clear what I should be doing.

Speaker 1:          19:26          Yeah. Well there's certainly no shortage of people that want to talk to you. I mean, I'd been contacted by four or five journalists who would like to speak with you. Um, we can talk about that afterwards. I could like to know who they are, but um, yeah. Well, you've got a, you've got a conundrum on your hands. Nope. I mean you're, you're a, you're a very straightforward person and you're obviously not grinding any acts, at least not in any obvious way. So my suspicions are that talking to the right people could be of substantial use to you. But I guess it also depends on what it is that you want me. And that's something we can talk about. Now you've, you've,

Speaker 1:          20:09          you've rattled up the cages, a fair number of people and a fairly large organization. Interestingly enough, just on the heels of Google and Youtube is announcement about the new free speech restrictions on, on Youtube, you know, when and their incorporation of NGOs into that sensor set process. So it's been quite a week for Google I would say. So you've opened up this can of worms. What is it? Yeah. So imagine if you're looking six months down the road and say, and things happened that were good because of what you did, what is it that you would like to have happen?

Speaker 2:          20:45          Huh. I, I at the very least I want, because I do still care about google. I want some conversation to be had and for the ideologues to not just have their way, but yeah, I still don't have a clear vision on how exactly this will happen and how, how this can spread farther than just google.

Speaker 1:          21:12          You spread it farther than just google, that's for sure. Yeah. You know? Um, I mean, I would say my experiences with the premise is that the first thing that happens that will happen is that you'll get jumped on by people who call you the sorts of epithets that would be appropriate if you were a bad guy and you should just shut up and go away.
