Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:03          did you see the news? Professor Jordan Peterson of the University of Toronto, the professor who's been fighting so valiantly for free speech and academic freedom and against political correctness. He has had his scholarly funding cut off his grant application to continue as academic research. It was rejected for the first time in his career 10 times. He's applied 10 times as being granted. He's a successful professor, beloved by his students, huge popular following, lots of published research. He'd normally be treated like an academic star, but as soon as he was attacked by the forces of political correctness and he refused to submit to them. Well, just by coincidence, he was cut off by an anonymous government committee. I'm sorry, I'm not buying it. Just to be clear, this research money isn't his salary, it's the budget he needs to do his research to hire graduate students and other out of pocket expenses to pursue his scholarships. That's what's being rejected. They've cut off his studies, which just happens to include studying the psychology of political correctness. So I said to professor Peterson, I said, we can raise some money ourselves. We don't need to depend on the government and they're anonymous bureaucrats. I know for a fact that hundreds of thousands of people, millions actually have watched his videos, read about them in the news, support them. What if everyone chipped in a little bit for his research ourselves. What if we set up a website@wwwdotsupportpetersonresearch.com and he said, sure, let's give it a try.

Speaker 1:          01:42          I don't know why my research application west rejected the reviews are anonymous and all the reasons are not yet in, but it's the first time my funding request is being rejected in 20 years of applications and I think it's important research. It's basic science and more rarely it has immediate demonstrated public applicability, which is hypothetically one of the social sciences and humanities research councils, mandates. I requested funding to continue research into the fundamentals of personality psychology by not published a paper in 2007. Dr Colin de Young was the primary author, the differentiated the standard big five personality model into 10 aspects. That's extroversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness. How we differentiate each of them into to some some traits we call them aspects and that's become very widely used among scientists as has the work we've done on creativity. We need to understand everything we can about personality as it's an important predictor of human behavior and I want to do the fundamental research property.

Speaker 1:          02:44          We've also been assessing the relationship between personality and political belief, liberal, conservative and now politically correct and it's the first time the latter has been investigated scientifically. Those beliefs are having a huge impact on our culture and we believe it's important to understand. Finally, we've been producing online interventions such as the self authoring suite. You could see that@selfauthoring.com and that's helped thousands of students get better grades and stay in school. We've raised the grade point average of students 25 percent drop the dropout rate by about 20 percent and that's been especially useful for men and also for non Western ethic minority students and we want to continue the basic research upon which such programs depend. I should know too that none of this salary, none of this research money goes to me, none of it. It doesn't supplement my salary, doesn't pay any of my personal expenses.

Speaker 1:          03:34          It's pretty much all spent on the celery and tuition of my three graduate students and I have three excellent graduate students and helps me support a postpartum postdoctoral student. The remainder pays research subjects with a bit leftover for travel. We're supposed to present the results of our research at scientific conferences. We spend a little bit on computer equipment. It's bare bones funding. Am I live is very efficient in spending, so the rejection of my grant application primarily hurts my students as well as bringing the research effectively to a halt, so I'd like to try to crowd fund it. I think that would be interesting for people who support my work, who've watched my videos or listening to my podcasts are for anyone interested in the research that I'm doing. I guess I could invite you to join us and be part of it. Doing so.

Speaker 1:          04:17          It would also help me learn whether that sort of funding for scientists as possible because I've already been contacted by others whose research was curtailed for what appeared to be political reasons, so if it can be done for me, perhaps it can be done on a more permanent basis for others. It'd be interesting to investigate that and see if it's possible. My application was for a five year grant, but it's less daunting if we do it one year at a time. Anyways. You can see anyone interested, conceived by a full proposal and a shorter summary of it beneath this video and now also app support Peterson research. Don't come back to you. Israel. Thanks Professor

Speaker 2:          04:53          Peterson. I'll chip in the first $100. It's the least I can do in the name of free speech and academic freedom. Now, if that's too much for you, well please consider $10. If you can do more than $100, please do. Anyone who contributes $100 will get access to an exclusive thank you video from Professor Peterson for just $100. Donors and anyone who contributes $250 will be invited to a reception where he and his students will discuss his progress and if you contribute the thousand dollars, you'll get all of the above as well as a bound copy of the finished research personally autographed by him. So let's do this. Go to support Peterson research.com. We'll send all of the net proceeds directly to professor Peterson specifically for this research project. Let's show the university and the government panel that rejected this project. The Canadians believe in Professor Peterson and his research and we're not willing to let him or his work be silenced. Let's show Canada and the world that our universities are still free. Go to support Peterson research.com and let's help a great professor and scholar complete his work. Thank you.
