Speaker 1:          00:48          Oh, hi guys and girls and interested others. So on October 18th, I received a letter from the University of Toronto asking for my silence with regards to what I've been discussing. On September 27th, I made a video I called fear and the law, which was a discussion of what I believe to be a set of particularly insidious legislative moves on the part of the provincial and federal governments in Canada. I'm laying the groundwork for requiring a certain kind of compulsory speech from, from the citizens of Canada. And I commented in that video that I believed that the act of making the video itself and discussing the issues that are relevant to that legislation was probably illegal. I'm on October third. I made another video decrying the University of Toronto Human Resources Departments, recent decision to make anti racism and anti bias training mandatory partly as a consequence of their interactions with a group called the black liberation collective, which is, I'm not a particularly savory group to say the least.

Speaker 1:          02:17          And then on October fifth, I did another video by recorded another video laying out what I described the PC game, which is, um, uh, an ideologically motivated victimization slash perpetrator game. And I outlined some counter tactics in those videos. I said that discussion of gender issues has probably become illegal now in Canada, maybe even a hate crime. I'm one of the consequences of that was a number of lawyers wrote articles saying that I was just scaremongering and that bill [inaudible] for example, doesn't have that intent. I didn't say precisely that bill [inaudible] had that intent, although I believe it opens the door to such things. But I did say that the surrounding policy discussions on the Ontario Human Rights Commission, which is not a good place, um, indicated that, that it probably had become illegal. And I would say the fact that the university has now written me two letters, suggesting that in fact what I was doing was illegal.

Speaker 1:          03:18          Makes my argument better than any but a better than anything I could do. I also said that biological sex, gender identity and gender expression do not vary independently. And they don't vary independently by the way, even though that's become axiomatic in the underlying legislation, and they don't vary independently because the overwhelming majority of people have a gender expression, gender identity and biological sex that are the same in that 98 percent of biological males identify as male and dress as males. And the same is true of females. So they don't vary independently. People confuse that with me saying that there were no such thing as say nonbinary people or transgender people. And I never said that, but that doesn't really matter. Apparently. Uh, my fundamental concern was that we are now legally required to use an approved language when speaking and when speaking about fundamental issues like gender and there's very few issues, more fundamental than gender.

Speaker 1:          04:19          And I said that I wouldn't do it because it is a very dangerous requirement. It's the first time that I can tell where instead of restrictions on free speech being of the sort, that there are things you can't say say hate crime things. And I'm not an advocate of hate crime laws, by the way, hate crime speech laws. I think they're dangerous. But in any case, I can understand why people think they're necessary, but this law requires us to use a certain kind of approved language. And I thought that that was a line we shouldn't cross. I also said I wouldn't mouth the words of the ideologically possessed and that was with regards to gender neutral pronouns because those pronouns which haven't passed into common usage by the way, because they're very awkward and not well crafted to me, they're words that have been produced by a certain kind of radical left wing activist radical egalitarianism whose ideology I regard as perhaps posing the most serious threat to the freedom of the West that currently exists.

Speaker 1:          05:19          And so I'm not going to use their words. And I said that free speech is in serious danger in Canada because of an onslaught of radical leftist ideology. So that was basically my, uh, my claims. Um, I got a warning letter from Suzanne Ferber, chair of the psychology department. I'm a in the background, David Cameron, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and science. Cheryl [inaudible], vice president, provost and Kelly, Hannah Moffat, vp hr and equity. The person by the way, who's now responsible for the mandatory anti racism and anti-biased training initiatives at the University of Toronto and who has refused to disavow her department's Association with the Black Liberation Collective, despite the fact that they, they will not disavow violence in the pursuit of their aims. And in spite of the fact that two of the people who produce, who organized that particular organization have a history of misbehavior to put it, um, to put it mildly. The letter said, the initial initial letter said that, I mean to me did not recognize the rights of others to tell me which personal pronoun to use when addressing them.

Speaker 1:          06:33          And yes, that is something I do not recognize. It. Do not recognize the rights of others to tell anyone which personal pronoun to use when addressing them. I'm standing by that the UFT said that was required to acceptance of their statutorily protected right to equality and equal treatment. So now my failure to use, um, preferred pronouns like Zi answer or whatever pronouns people want for that matter is, um, is transgressing against their rights in a, in a manner that, that appears to contravene the legislation that, that it's interesting that the university warned me of that because of course, that's exactly why I made the video to begin with. The letter also said, I do not accept that gender identification can be independent of biological sex. The UFT said that was discriminatory as well. I did not say that. And I informed the UFT that their letter did not do a good job of actually I'm accusing me if they didn't accuse me properly of what I said.

Speaker 1:          07:31          And I offered to give them the letter back so that they could write it properly, but they refused. So, um, then it stands the way it stands. So, but we won't talk about that letter too much because we muzzled talk about the newer one. So the consequences of, of what I did were crazy. Really. There were two demonstrations at the University of Toronto. The second one, which was the free speech. The first one was our demonstration against me personally, I would say, um, because of what I had dared to say. And the second one was a free speech rally that was organized by students. I have nothing to do with it except that I came to speak at it as did lauren southern, who's a journalist for rebel media that has obtained massive online and youtube coverage, partly because lauren southern was the victim of what appears to be an assault at the free speech rally.

Speaker 1:          08:20          And that has now been viewed by, I would think several million people. It got what I did go mass and the demonstrations and all of that got massive traditional media coverage. Uh, the national, the national radio in Canada, uh, the, uh, national TV, all our major stations, a huge number of newspapers, columns, op-eds, all sorts of things. So it's been one of the biggest stories in Canada for the last 10 days, I would say, and massive online coverage as well. Um, and so I think the reason for that, because, you know, I just sat in my office and made a video about bill [inaudible] and complained about political correctness, but I did something different. You see in this is what I think the difference is, is that people complain a lot about political correctness but they never get the tire to hit the road or are they never hit the nail on the head with a hammer.

Speaker 1:          09:13          See, what I did was I said I don't like political correctness and here's something that I'm being required to do by politically correct people and I will not do it. I won't do it, period. And I stand by that I am not going to use made up pronouns to refer to people if we sort this out linguistically in the next 20 years. And, and we spontaneously come up with a term that solves some of the problems with gendered pronouns that perhaps we have. Although I'm not convinced that we have. But if a spontaneous and I'm a and consensus oriented decision is made around the use of a new term, then I'm willing to adopt it as well as, as, as much as the next person. But I'm not having it forced on me and I don't think anyone else should and I'm not using the damn made up words by radical left wing activists. And that stopped.

Speaker 1:          10:06          So anyways, I also got two letters from the university. I'm the first letter said you believe that some of your commentary may be illegal. Yes, I believe that that's why I made the video because I don't think that the sorts of things that I was saying should be illegal in a free society. I think it's unbelievably dangerous and short sighted. The letter said, I must comply with the law including the Ontario Human Rights Code. Um, and I must consider the impact of my words and actions on my students and colleagues. While let me tell you this, I considered the impact of my words and actions on my students and colleagues extraordinarily carefully. Um, I might say, in fact, I considered the impact of my words and our actions far more carefully than did the people who wrote these letters, and I'm going to explain why I believe that.

Speaker 1:          10:52          So the second letter, which actually requested my silence, the first one was more of a warning, was signed by David Cameron, dean of the Faculty of Arts and science, and see a Ben Nelson, vice president, faculty and academic life. And I read it in the previous video so you can help post it as well, so you can look at the details, but I'm going to go over it more or less topic by topic now. I'm going to analyze it. I'm going to deconstruct it. That's what you might think for all you postmodernists out there. Here's an example of deconstruction in action. Okay. So the first part of the, the, uh, letter detailed out essentially what the University of Toronto understands to be my comments and, uh, and the complaints the UFT has received. Then the ut are outline their hypothetical commitment to free speech. I'm talking about my refusal to use gender neutral pronouns. Describe that refusal as illegal. Um, so, so the letter first details out my comments, um, you know, discusses the fact that I made these videos and then the states that, um,

Speaker 1:          12:12          there are ongoing concerns about those videos that have been expressed by a variety of, of groups and individuals at the university. The next part of the letter, at least in principle details the University of Toronto's commitment to free speech. Now I found this interesting and rather orwellian way, George Orwell of course, discussed the use of something he called doublespeak, which is to say one thing and mean another or maybe mean precise out there. So in the letter that the second thing, the University of Toronto does it stress that it has a commitment to free speech, but then of course, later in the letter it decides that that does not extend to its professor's choosing their own pronouns. So you can decide for yourself how deep that commitment goes. Um, then they discussed that my refusal to use gender neutral pronouns is, um, probably illegal. Now, there's a variety of ways of looking at this. One way of looking at it is that there is a provision in the Ontario Human Rights Code.

Speaker 1:          13:14          Yeah, this is it, that any act or thing done or admitted to be done in the course of his or her employment by an officer or official employee or agent of a corporation, et cetera shall be deemed to be an act or thing done or admitted to be done by the corporation trade union trade or Occupational Association, Unincorporated Association or employer's organization. So basically what that says, that section 46 point three, one of the human rights code is that if you have an employee who says something and it's not a good thing, then you are responsible for it as if you said it, which is another part of the legislation that I was actually complaining about it in the initial videos. And so the ot, I think partly they wrote me this letter maybe because they had a conversation with their legal department and they said, well, you know, this professor might be right.

Speaker 1:          14:04          This could all be illegal. Maybe it's even hate speech and if and if he's doing it then because you're his employer, you're also responsible for it. So maybe that's part of the reason for the warning letter, but anyways, they've decided that my refusal to use gender neutral pronouns is potential. It's certainly discriminatory, discriminatory, as far as they're concerned and may also be illegal, which I would like to stress again, was exactly why I made the videos to begin with. So it's not like they're reminding me of something that I don't know. So the next part of it was, uh, a discussion of distress in the University of Toronto community. They have received communications from individual students and employee groups finding my comments unacceptable. Emotionally disturbing and painful. Um, you know, you can watch the videos yourself, see if they're emotionally disturbing and painful. I might point out that if listening to my comments is painful, then if you think that's painful, then it's possible that nothing actually painful has ever happened to you in my life, in your life.

Speaker 1:          15:03          Like I was thinking over the last couple of weeks, people have been asking me about how stressful this is. It's like, well, it's, no, it's no walk in the park, I can tell you that, but compared to something that's really stressful, like maybe a family member has cancer or you know, or that's a good one or, or you're, you've, you've actually been thrown in jail by an authoritarian society are being tortured. I mean this is not very stressful. This is political dialogue and you know, I would say that there was a week or two there where I thought my job was probably in danger and maybe it still is, but compared to a real pain, real pain, real suffering even that is, I wouldn't call it trivial, but it's not traumatic. That's for sure. Anyways, the statements, my statements and the invective that is followed caused them to fear for their safety and they become the target of specific and violent threats.

Speaker 1:          15:55          Well, I certainly think that threats directed to people are reprehensible and I'm, I'm not calling for that. I'm calling for reasoned and articulate debate, but I would also like to point out, and this is another part of the letter that I seriously object to, is that it would have been much better had the University of Toronto written me and said, look, we've received a whole variety of of communications regarding your videos. Some positive and supportive and some critical and negative and having carefully reviewed all of these. We've decided that it would be in the best interest of the university and maybe in keeping with our policies and the relevant laws. If you stopped saying these sorts of things that you're saying, but that isn't what happened. The letters select selectively omitted to mention the fact that the University of Toronto has received a petition that has at least 5,000 signatures in support of me and also several hundred letters, which I know because I've been cc'd on them and that it appears that the bulk of public opinion is also on my side.

Speaker 1:          16:54          None of that was mentioned in the letter and that also taught me how institutions become corrupted when free speech is in danger. Because, and I've often wondered this because I know that such things happened in the Soviet Union where people over decades swallowed very large lies and seems to me that this is the way it happens. Institution start writing letters that are, uh, that contained sins of omission, right? The omit, relevant information and that's and, and present a very biased in one sided view of an issue. And then once that's written down, it becomes the reality because one of the things that psychologists do know is that if you write down a set of opinions, those rapidly become your core beliefs even if you don't think that you had those beliefs before you wrote the letter. So and then of course the issue with the threats. That's a real interesting one because when lauren southern was assaulted at the u of t free speech rally and that was captured on video and more than I would maybe 2 million people have watched that now the university didn't say a thing about it in their public communications.

Speaker 1:          17:55          But when there were threats, rape threats made by some bone headed a morons online. And we don't know who these people were by the way. We don't know if they were trolls. We don't know if, if they were provocateurs, we don't even know if they were the such social justice warriors themselves. And I wouldn't put it past them because they've done that sort of thing in the past. So these were threats from unverified sources that were posted online. The university immediately sent out a memo stating that, you know, an unsafe, potentially unsafe atmosphere had been produced on campus and that, you know, the university decries or as opposed to all sorts of violent and aggressive accent expressions. They're up. But they didn't send out the same memo when, when Lauren southern was assaulted at the free speech rally. And, uh, they also, and this is particularly the case with Kelly hand and moffit, who's the human resources vice president, I informed her, and many other people have that the black liberation collective from whom she's taking advice with regards to antiracism training has, is, uh, is the next best thing to a promoter of violence in, in, in seeking social change according to their website.

Speaker 1:          19:06          And is has, is run or has been organized by two women who have manifested in their public behavior a number of things that I think a reasonable person would regard as reprehensible. So that's another interesting thing is that the bar, the one sided reporting of what constitutes a threat anyways, they say that they trust that these impacts were not my intention, although they certainly implies strongly that it's my fault. And that's another thing I object to because here's the thing to think about. Imagine that there's a forest in front of you and it's extremely dry. It's extremely dry. It's been a long hot summer, or maybe it's been a drought and there's a hot wind blowing and it's tinder dry. And there's a lot of deadwood because there hasn't been a fire for a very long time. And so the, the conditions are poised for a conflagration and someone comes along and, and uh, produces a spark.

Speaker 1:          20:03          You can't blame the conflagration on the spark. Now I sparked this storm, but that doesn't mean the deadwood hadn't already gathered. There's a lot of things that our society needs to talk out and to lay. The trouble that's emerged because of these videos at my feet, I think is a, to call it an underhanded ploys is a, is a very mild statement. You know, it's like Jordan Peterson is responsible for this media storm about political correctness is like, I think I don't think so much as I might like to take credit for it from a purely egotistical perspective. I'm the groundwork for all of this was late, well before I made my videos. And the only reason I had they had the effect they did is because I actually said that there was something that the pc, uh, thugs want me to do that I'm not going to do.

Speaker 1:          20:52          So I drew a line and it happened to be around issues of gender nomenclature, but it could have been somewhere else. And so of course, because of that, I've been, um, attacked in various ways on the gender issue, which is also a very important issue which we need to discuss. But, you know, it could have been in some way. It could have been any other issue where anybody else drew a line anyways. Then they request that I start repeating these statements. Okay, so here we go. I am not going to use made up pronouns to refer to people at their whim. I'm not doing it and I'm not going to be silent either. And that's that. And then they remind me that I have an obligation to uphold the law into including the Ontario human rights code and to deal fairly and ethically with students.

Speaker 1:          21:39          Which, um, yeah, well I knew that there might be a legal issue and that's why I made the videos to begin with. So that hardly came as a surprise and I actually think it's quite comical in a darkly ironic way that the university itself is the institution that's verifying my primary concern, which was that making the video itself was likely illegal. We need to think about that because that's a bad thing. It's a bad thing. It shows you very clearly that freedom of speech is under attack in Canada and elsewhere of course as well. And that's why there's been so much international attention given to this is the sequence of events. So, um, they also suggest that this might behavior undermines my ability to conduct essential components of your job as a faculty member. I disagree with that. Most of them mentally. My fundamental job as a faculty member is to speak what I perceive to be the truth.

Speaker 1:          22:32          And that doesn't mean I'm right and it doesn't mean that I am speaking the truth, it's that I'm trying to speak the truth and I'm also trying to listen to people so that I can speak the truth more carefully and I'm not going to stop doing that. And that does not undermine my ability to conduct essential components of my job as a faculty member. In fact, that is precisely and absolutely my job as a faculty member. And then of course to act consistent with the law and university policy. While we've already covered that, I'm telling you, here we go. I sat in the first video that making the video was probably illegal and the University of Toronto agrees with me or they wouldn't be warning me. So we need to think about that and then there's a bit of hand waving about the uft deploring acts of violence and the disruption of civil debate.

Speaker 1:          23:12          Well, they might deploy it, but they didn't do anything about it and they didn't even report on it when it happened. And so I think that their claims, their fundamental claims to have a, let's say peace and safety as their primary concern and I'm not even sure that should be the primary concern because truth trumps peace and safety. I think that their actions, you know, the administration's actions do not indicate a very clear commitment to exactly to exactly the principles state they claim to uphold. So, okay, so what did I do about this? Well, here's what happened. I went and meet, met the Dean, David Cameron on Friday. I dropped in on him. Um, he was kind of nervous as far as I can tell. He's an older guy. I think he's a decent guy. Um, he listened to me. I think we had a very productive conversation.

Speaker 1:          24:02          I went through my concerns about the letter and then what I suggested to him was that the University of Toronto host a series of debates, a debate or a series of debates. I would like to see three of them where we discussed such things as, um, the biological determination of gender versus the environmental determination of gender identity. That would be a good debate. We could have a debate on whether Western society is an oppressive patriarchy or an enlightened civilization. I'd like to have that debate. And then the last debate would be freedom of speech, be something like freedom of speech versus social justice. So that would be three topics I said we could have a civilized debate. The university could host it, um, and we could sort these things out like civilized human beings and maybe the University of Toronto could be a beacon on a hill, so to speak, which is what we should be.

Speaker 1:          24:54          And um, maybe it would also help all the universities in the United States and in the western world that are wrestling with these sorts of things, clarify the issues and, and move our society had in a productive and peaceful way. Because I thought about before I went into the meeting with the Dean what the best possible outcome could be and that wouldn't be victory for me because I'm not after victory for me. I'm after truth and peace. At least that's what I'm trying to be after. And so I thought, and I discussed this with my and my family, what would be the best possible outcome? And one, you know, one not good outcome would be the entrenchment of the two positions into increasingly rigid blocks and the escalation of the situation in a nonproductive way. But then another productive way would be to think of this as an opportunity and say, look man, we could have a real discussion at this university.

Speaker 1:          25:42          It's a great institution with shoulder our damn responsibility. We'll have a debate and will enlighten ourselves and the public. And so I'm going to meet with David Cameron here in about half an hour and I'm going to find out what the university has to say about that. So thanks very much for listening. And I guess I'll close with this. I would say to my fellow Canadian citizens, you guys better wake up, you know the true north is no longer strong nor free as far as I can tell, and are our rights to free speech are under assault and you better wake up because it's not pretty and it's not good and it's happening a lot faster than you think. One of the things that happened on Friday, it was, it was announced in the globe and Mail, is that the liberal government, the justice minister, so to so called justice minister has decided that to pick our judiciary, which is one of the most important things that can happen in a country.

Speaker 1:          26:32          The candidates for the judiciary now will be required to produce a dossier listing out their group identities, race, religion, sex, gender, identity, gender expression and all the things that differentiate us by group membership. And then the people who picked the judiciary are going to be subjected to unconscious reeducation of their unconscious, so unconscious anti racism and anti bias training so that they don't, so that they're not biased when they review the candidates with the aim of selecting candidates on the basis of their identity, which, and I think there's nothing more racist than that period. And so that almost passed unnoticed. And I would say with regards to unconscious bias training, first of all, we can't measure unconscious bias very well. This is all the implicit association test and you can look that up. We can't measure that very well because the test isn't very reliable.

Speaker 1:          27:24          It was never intended to be used to document individual's unconscious bias. But that's where this idea has come from. Um, there's huge debate on what that bias means. Like, I don't believe it. I don't believe that it means what the, what the proponents of unconscious racial bias say. It means the science is far from settled. And I mean far from settled. It's a serious topic of discussion. And, and, and then to educate people out of their unconscious biases. Man, that's an Orwellian thing, you know, it's one thing to pete controls people's speech that's bad enough, especially when you start controlling what they can say instead of what they can say, but then to go after their unconscious minds and then to make that a precondition for the panels that select our judiciary, it's like this isn't good, this isn't good. And I'm speaking as a psychologist and a student of authoritarianism and political psychopathology. So wake up, this isn't good. Do something about it. And I've got a website started that I, that I'm where I'm going to post things that people can do. So. But that'll, that'll happen later in the week. So anyways, thanks for listening. That's all I've got to say for now. Bye. Bye.
