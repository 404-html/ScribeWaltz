Speaker 1:          00:32          So let's take a look at the structure of paradise as it's presented in the in genesis. So the first aspect of the initial paradisical state is unself consciousness. Now, if you look at factor at an analytic studies of human personality, you note that self consciousness, although it is arguably our greatest gift, also loads almost entirely on the factor that defines negative effect. And you might also notice that when you say I became self conscious, you generally put a negative cast on that in that I was talking before a group of people and suddenly I was seized by self consciousness. And as a consequence of that, I was flooded by negative emotion and was fundamentally a mobilized. So it's a very paradoxical, a very paradoxical state of being that our highest a gift say, and the only one that clearly distinguishes us from animals is also that which when manifested, makes us almost unbearably anxious.

Speaker 1:          01:32          The initial paradise state when Adam and eve first walk in the garden of Eden is characterized by an animal like unself consciousness, Adam and eve, whatever they are, are not clearly segregated from the rest of the world. They have no idea, for example, of their own nakedness, and if you think about what nakedness means, you immediately understand that that's also a very profound dramatic representation, you know, with children that are around the age of three or four. Many of them, regardless of their motive upbringing, start to become very concerned about privacy, say with regards to bodily functions and also very concerned about ever showing themselves without clothing and it's perfectly reasonable to presume that that's a consequence of their emergent self consciousness and event that takes place somewhere between the ages of two and five and that's a defining moment, right? That makes them segregated, will say from their mother.

Speaker 1:          02:27          And so you also have images of paradise that float through Western history that are characterized by the image of the unconscious union between the mother and child. Right, which is a which has an images stick representation that eradicates the tension of self consciousness both for the mother and for the child. So the notion that the child is living in a paradise will condition that somehow lost as he or she approaches adulthood gives another sort of symbolic layer. The notion of the pre self conscious paradise, it's also a place where order in chaos are imperfect balance and you know that because what paradise means is para around days a, a wall while Eden means delight or a place of delight. Paradise Paradise is a walled garden, a wild place of delight and a garden is precisely that place where the forces of nature or chaos and the forces of culture are held in perfect balance, right? That's what a garden is, its nature given form by culture and it's a place that's architecturally pleasant, a place where the intervention of human activity has produced a kind of stability that transcends that of nature because it's a cultural construct, but also that transcends that of culture because all of the plants and the other growing things that constitute a garden are somehow transcendent even though they're under the cultivating hand of culture and the individual.

Speaker 1:          04:03          If you look at the manner in which the fall story is represented, you all can also see that the place of previous stability can be regarded as a kind of paradise. So if you remember the story of Moses leading his people through the desert, it's clearly the case that when the Israelites were in the desert, even though they got away from the tyranny, it was easy to look back and say, well, you know, tough as it was, the place that we were before. It was much better than the place we are now. So it's perfectly reasonable and expectable for people who are caught in a crisis to look back to the time prior to the dawn of that crisis with longing, even if the crisis that they're presently experiencing is a necessary precondition for further development of personality. So the story that's laid out in genesis has has its structure.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Something like this, before we became self conscious, the world was perfect as a consequence of the rise of self consciousness. We were thrown out of the Garden of Eden out of Paradise and destined to live the profane existence that characterizes our president mode of being where we're subject to knowledge of mortality and the possibility of illness and alienation from God. And wouldn't it be ever so great if we could only return to that condition of unsolved consciousness and make all our problems go away and you see this kind of pathological paradisical reminiscence manifesting itself in the most banal forms of conservatism, which are always projecting the ideal, the ideal past somewhere back into the unattainable reaches of time and also in those situations that obtained psychologically when people are absolutely possessed by depression and anxiety and wish for their consciousness to come to an end, if not metaphorically so they desire to sleep.

Speaker 1:          05:51          Then actually so that suicide is viewed as a kind of unconsciousness who's paradisical nature. The absence of all opposition is viewed as clearly preferable to the difficulties of actually maintaining. Being Julianna says, the idea of paradise once and then paradise lost is not something unique to western or a great eastern societies. It's a widespread motif just as wide as this as the flood motif. Regardless of where you go in the world, you find this notion when heaven had been abruptly separated from the earth, that is when it had become remote. As in our days when the tree or vine connecting Earth to heaven had been cut or the mountain which used to touch the sky had been flattened out, then the paradisical stage was over and man entered into his present fallen condition. In fact, all myths of Paradise show us primordial man enjoying a beatitude, spontaneity and freedom, which he has unfortunately lost in consequence of the fall that is of what followed upon the mythical event that caused the rupture between heaven and earth.

Speaker 1:          07:12          As I said, Eden is delight, a place of delight by terminological definition. Whereas paradise is a walled garden. I want to show you what knowing that does for analysis of the relationship between eastern and Western thought. So let me tell you quickly the story of the Buddha and I'm going to represent it fundamentally like this. Buddhist starts his life in what's essentially a walled garden by all, by all reasonable comparative analysis and as a consequence of his emergent self consciousness. The unselfconscious childlike perfection of that early state is permanently disrupted. So you have a situation where the greatest redemption story of the east follows precisely the same grammatical track as the greatest creation story of the West. So this is the story. Buddhas farther is visited by an angel who tells him that his son is going to grow up to be the greatest temporal profane ruler the world has ever seen, or a great spiritual leader and his father.

Speaker 1:          08:20          Being a pragmatic and conservative man decides that there's no possible way. I'm going to allow my son to take the ambivalent road of spiritual enlightenment. I'm going to allow him to fall completely in love with the world so that he will remain attached to his domain. So prior to Buddha's birth, his father constructs a great city with walls around it. And inside that city he removes all signs of pain, frustration, and disappointment. Any sign of ugliness, theat and the only people that are allowed to exist within the city are those who are in perfect mental and physical health who are paragons of beauty and virtue. And the idea that lurks behind that archetypal story is that when a father has a child, the his moral obligation is to shield the developing consciousness of that child from contact with any of the horrors of life that could provide the child with an experienced too traumatic for that developing consciousness to apprehend so because it's an archetypal story that relates to the development of all people, not just the redemptive savior, and that's the motif that the Buddhist story initially follows at good father makes his child fall in love with life by enticing that child into a direct relationship with all that life has to offer.

Speaker 1:          09:46          So Buddha grows up within this walled garden, this unselfconscious paradise, but precisely because he's been shielded to this degree and allowed to mature. His consciousness continues to expand, and the world outside the boundaries that his parents have established for him starts to attract his attention. Now we know already that the forbidden fruit, right? The layer of what's outside the walls is something that human beings just can't keep their mangy little paws off. Right? We are absolutely uncontrollably curious and the best way to make sure that we investigate something is to lay down a structure that says whatever you do under whatever circumstances, never look there, right, and then the automatic systems that underlie our orienting and that motivate our seeking experience are constantly pulling our attention precisely to that forbidden spot, compelling us to investigate exactly that which has been forbidden. So because Buddha is a consciousness developing in a healthy manner, he immediately becomes curious about what lies beyond the the limits that have been established with him and he makes a decision to go outside of Paradise. Right? Which seems a particularly ridiculous thing to do given that in principle he has everything you could possibly want inside the walls, but then again we have the troublesome notion of the original sin of Adam, right? Which is if any of you are offered a forbidden fruit, again, under circumstances mythologically equivalent to those that are obtained in the beginning, you'd immediately reach your hand out and take it. Because what we haven't got for human beings is always far more compelling than what we have got.

Speaker 1:          11:32          So Buddha goes outside the walls, but his father, who's a good father, although somewhat conservative, decides he's going to rig the game a little bit so it gets rid of everybody that's diseased or unhappy or uncomfortable or ugly or old or anything that could possibly disturb the Buddha, any lines, the streets with flower waving women and puts pedals on the road and sends his son out in a gilded chariot. But the gods who were lurking around right, the troublemaking gods who represent chaos and disorder in the unknown decide to stand in front of Buddha. A sick man who hobbles unsteadily interview. And Buddha asks his his retainer precisely what this phenomena represent sand. His retainer says, well, you know, human beings like you, sincere human are subject to the deterioration of these physical powers in an arbitrary way. And this man is one person who's been so affected and so buddha is completely disenchanted by his exploratory move out into the terrible unknown and runs back into the castle walls and shuts the door and is perfectly happy to think of nothing for months.

Speaker 1:          12:39          But then as his anxiety habituates and his curiosity grows, he can't stand the notion of never going outside the walls again and outside. He goes again and this time where after his father prepares the route ever so carefully, the godsend insight and old man who hobbles interview and mood, it looks at him in shock and horror and says to his retainer, just precisely what's going on here. And His retainer says, well, that's an old man and everybody gets all and you're going to get old too. And that's the way of all humanity. And that's the point at which voted. Self consciousness expands not to only include the possibility of degeneration, but to include the temporal horizon. That's characteristic of life. And he finds that so terribly shocking that he runs back into the castle and shuts the walls down and plays with his friends for another six months or maybe a year till his anxiety.

Speaker 1:          13:35          Finally habituates. And he goes out one final time. And this time the godsend. A funeral parade for him and he sees his first dad body. And this is such a terrible shock to him that he can't even go back to the castle. So his father prepares for him a great party in the woods near the castle full of nude dancing women who are perfectly willing to flaunt themselves and to offer themselves to him. But Buddha is so absolutely a catastrophic, really shocked by this notion of emergent death, that he can't take any pleasure whatsoever and what's being offered to him, and he leaves the kingdom once and for all. And you think, well, that's exactly what happens to you when you grow up. Right? If you're reasonably well socialized and properly looked after, then your curiosity gets the better of you and you keep going out into the world until what year parents have established for you is no longer sufficient for you.

Speaker 1:          14:26          And as a consequence of that movement out into the world, you find out all sorts of things characteristic of your own life that not only your parents can't precisely explain to you, but even the broader formal structures of your culture have a very difficult time handling. And when you finally do encounter such realities and allow their effect on you to fully manifest itself all, then you're finally independent and you no longer can return home, but from that point forward, you are also burdened as Adam is burdened when he loses his Paradise Hill unselfconscious snus with the full revelation of what it means to be limited and alive. So what happens to Buddha as a consequence of this revelation, he becomes an apprentice and the chronicles of the Buddhist adventure are careful to say that he becomes the world's most proficient practitioner of Samka, which was a philosophical precursor to yoga and then to yoga so he masters all the positions and the assanas until he's disciplined physically to an almost unlimited degree.

Speaker 1:          15:33          And then he decides that he'll adopt a stance of world renunciation, which is also something he's a remarkably good at. And he starved himself until the chronic lewis say he resembles nothing so much as a pile of dust and then having exhausted all the disciplinary structures that his sophisticated culture has to offer him, but still not precisely finding the answer that he's looking for. He retreats into the forest place of the unknown and sits himself at the base of a tree underneath the tree. He's visited by visions and temptations. The first division is in essentially erotic one life itself, camps him back out of his self conscious state into the domain of pure physical pleasure, a perfectly reasonable temptation, right, and one that is powerful enough so that Hindu philosophers say, b, as their churches and cathedrals are covered with erotic drawings. If you can't get past the erotic drawings into the church, that's the domain that you should still inhabit, right in the dawning phases of life at least till middle age.

Speaker 1:          16:35          That's the appropriate motive being to be enticed and seduced by the physical pleasures that life has to offer, but in the final analysis, those are not sufficient to solve the problem of emergent self consciousness and so the angel of death visits him and offered him the opportunity to exist permanently in a state of Nirvana. A very, very interesting twist on this story because you have to wonder, given the association, say between suicidality and the notion of paradise that exists underneath that. If what Buddha isn't being offered by the angel of death is in fact death and this sensation of all the problems of being regardless, he rejects that attains enlightenment briefly and then decides to return to the world to share what he's discovered with all of suffering humanity. The idea being that the Buddha who is the awakened or enlightened one is capable of attaining a transcendent state, but also knows fully that because human beings have a shared social aspect, it is not possible for any one person to attain redemption until all people attain redemption. The reason being that it's very difficult to be transcendent and enlightened when you see someone who's sick lying in a ditch,

Speaker 1:          17:56          so then we shift from that back to genesis and the attempted fall of man and read the third chapter, and they were both naked, the man and his wife and were not ashamed. Well, what does that mean? Well, Freud pointed out one of human beings, most common nightmares is to be stripped of clothing in front of a crowd. Now, why would that be precisely? Well, your naked self is the most vulnerable aspect of you, right? Were all closed and for good reason, partly that's protection from the terrible natural world, right, but it also offers this the possibility of placing a barrier between ourselves, our vulnerable cells, and the searching and critical gaze of the community, right? Because not only are we vulnerable to the rigors of nature were also vulnerable to the depredations and criticisms of society and the notion that a man and a woman could exist naked and not know.

Speaker 1:          18:54          It is a clear, is a clear of finger pointing in the direction of a story that says these people were not conscious or if conscious they certainly were not self conscious and what's how does the story develop? The serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman, Yea Hath God said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden. And the woman said unto the serpent, well, we meet of the fruit of the trees, of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the center of the garden. God Hath said, you should not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die, and the serpent said to the woman, you won't die, for God knows that in the day you eat thereof. Then your eyes shall be opened, right?

Speaker 1:          19:44          A clear pointing to the notion of an awakening and an illumination, and you should be like gods, knowing good and evil, right? Which attributes to humanity a dawning sense of morality, explicit morality of faculty for comprehension that we do not share with any other animal, and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her. And he did eat women trouble. What's the tree? Well, we talked about this a little bit before. So you say, well, if you look at the structure of experience from this particular perspective, and you think about that in a vertical planes with the layers, one on top of another, then you can imagine the tree as the thing that unites these three layers.

Speaker 1:          20:38          The tree is the domain that unites chaos and order and the individual, the structure running up through the middle of it. And you see a representation of that. Interestingly enough from norse mythology, this is egg sale. The, uh, the, the tree of the gods, the tree that stands in the middle of the norse paradise. And one of the things that's very interesting about this particular tree is that if you look at its roots, it's the roots are covered with snakes and serpents. Sand underneath the snakes and serpents is water. And so that you see that the tree it stands at the center of the world is rooted in chaos, fundamentally is rooted in whatever it is that constitutes the pre cosmogony matrix of being. And then the central aspects of this domain are nicely laid out as the domain of territoriality. The end of the borders that the individual understands and the habitual territory that he inhabits, and then the tree in the center represents whatever it is that central to this to our mode of being, and so let's take a look at that in some detail and flesh it out.

Speaker 1:          21:49          Symbolically. We find really add is saying the tree stands hypothetically at the center of the world is precisely that structure that Sharman climb when they make their transition from the normal mode diversely being into their transcendent mode of being. So Elliot, it says, the symbolism of the ascension into heaven by means of a tree is clearly illustrated by the ceremony of initiation of a shaman. The candidate climbs up a post in the middle of his, your. His tent reaches with summit and goes out by the small coal, but we know that this opening made to let out. The smoke is likened to the whole made by the pollstar in the vault of heaven. So you can imagine there's a conceptualization of the world as centered around a particular access and that the tent is regarded as at least Trans Trans. Literally as a symbolic equivalent of that cosmological structure among other people's, the tent pole is called the pillar of the sky and as compared to the pole star around which the world rotates a, at least from the visual perspective and his name Dallas, where the nail of the sky, that's the ritual posts set up in the middle of the court, is an image of the cosmic tree which is found at the center of the world with the pole star shining directly above it.

Speaker 1:          23:03          By sending it, the candidate enters into heaven. That is why as soon as he comes out of the smoke hole of the tent, he gives a loud cry invoking the help of the gods up there. He finds himself in their presence.

Speaker 1:          23:19          The tree is an absolutely archaic symbol and it seems to me most likely that it represents the structure of the nervous system. I think a structure that's rooted not so much in the spinal sensory motor structures, but deeply in the autonomic structure, stretching down into the center of the body and planting the mind firmly in its material substrate so that the autonomic system and its projections up into the Amygdala and the limbic system and then up into the cortex constitute the interface between the spiritual domain that our psyche and habits and the material domain that constitutes our body. The tree at the center of our being. What is it? Tree do well, it bears fruit well, what sort of fruit? Well, there are multiple medieval representations that are quite peculiar showing Christ, for example, as the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the fruit of the tree of life, and what does that mean? It means that conceptualizations, like the hero are products of whatever it is that this tree represents. The tree is something that produces fruit. Fruit is also something that can be ingested, and as Eric Newman point out,

Speaker 1:          24:37          wherever liquor, fruit, herbs, etc. Appear as the vehicles of life and mortality, including the water and bread of life. The sAcrament of the host and every form of food cult down to the present day. We have an ancient moat of human expression before us, so imagine the idea of the piagetian idea of assimilation and then accommodation and then understand it's a similar type of nutritive underlying metaphorical nature. The idea being that there is a tight analogy between ingesting something material and undergoing a transformation of of energy attendant upon that, right, which is what happens when you eat and ingesting a piece of information which offers you a new mode of doing things so you can say, well, people will trade work for information. They will trade food for information. There must be a kind of equivalence between work and information and food and information because otherwise the trade wouldn't make sense and then you realize that if you're informed, you can undertake transformations of yourself and the material world in a much more efficient manner because that's what being informed means and that means that being informed, acquiring some information and eating something are all tied up in a complex way into the same metaphorical structure.

Speaker 1:          25:56          Eat something forbidden, transform as a consequence. Conscious realization is acted out in the elementary scheme of nutritive that simulation and the ritual act of concrete eating is the first form of assimilation known to man the assimilation ingestion of the content. The eaten food produces an interchange. Transformation of the body cells through food intake is the most elementary of animal changes experienced by man.

Speaker 1:          26:25          How a weary enfeebled and famished man can be turned into an alert, strong and satisfied being or a man perishing of thirst can be refreshed or even transformed by an intoxicating drink. This is and must remain a fundamental experience so long as man shall exist. Eric, new ones. Point being that our psychological experience of the capacity of psychological transformation through eating is a metaphor waiting to be applied to the equivalent experience that we obtained, the equivalent excitement and sense of transformative possibility that we acquire as a consequence of coming across some new and truly valuable piece of information. So you have any idea that the tree that stands at the center of the world, the individual mode of being and something that bears fruit and the ingestion of that fruit. That idea say or that that piece of information is something that can produce a permanent transformation.
