Speaker 1:          00:01          Well I won't back down. You can stand at the gates of hell.

Speaker 2:          00:18          Good Morning Boys, girls and interested others. So the calls for my discipline and silencing have begun in earnest. Um, so I'm going to read you two letters that have been produced, um, publicly and, and within the uh, within the university community itself. Um, the first one has received some press attention, I don't believe the second one has yet. So, um, October six, 2016 so this was produced by a variety of student organizations and I'll discuss who they are. At the end of the letter to the attention of the University of Toronto Administration and the U of t community. We the undersigned. Community members at the University of Toronto are appalled, concerned and saddened by recent transphobic, racist and anti black comments made by professor Jordan Peterson and an online lecture series that he published on Youtube on September 27th, 2016 in October 3rd, 2016 Peterson has abused his position of power as a tenured professor and has tried to use my, his academic freedom to disguise his bigotry and prejudice as an intellectual disagreement.

Speaker 2:          01:26          However, to suggest that these comments add value to classroom discussion is absurd. By the way, that's not a suggestion that I've made. We would like to bring attention to the University of Toronto statement of equity, diversity and excellence. No doubt they would like to bring attention to that which states that the University of Toronto will proactively seek to increase diversity among our community members and it is our aim to have a student body teaching and administrative staff that mirror the diversity of the pool of potentially qualified applicants for those positions. And, and it is our responsibility to help in the creation of an equitable community. One that is diverse as well as inclusive and that is respectful and protects the human rights of its measure members. Something that requires the work of every member of the community across all our sites and capitalists, including students, teaching staff, administrative staff, visitors, alumni and guests.

Speaker 2:          02:22          The university is committed to internal policies on issues related to equity and also operates in compliance with all legislation that bears on equity and human rights. In a recent two part lecture given by Jordan Peterson, which was published on Youtube, see the relevant urls. Peterson goes on a 57 minute rant regarding his disapproval of bill. See 16 which proposes to include gender identity and gender expression has prohibited grounds for harassment and discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act and the criminal code. This same bill is considered by many political scholars and members of trans communities as an advancement of human rights, equal protection under the law. Peterson is also a man who has complained that the Ontario human rights commission's terms and definitions are over inclusive and all encompassing. Surely inclusivity is an important factor when discussing human rights protections. In one of his lectures. Peterson includes various disparaging comments about members of the Trans Community.

Speaker 2:          03:18          He argues that there is no evidence to support the existence of non binary identities. That is not something I argued by the way, a statement that is inaccurate. Furthermore, when discussing the use of his students preferred pronouns, Peterson stated, I won't recognize another person's right to determine what pronouns I use to address. I won't do it. Yes, that is true. Purposefully mis-gendering a trans person is an act of violence. While you better pay attention to that because what that essentially means is that speech is now an act of violence and that more importantly, refusal to use the words that someone else demands that you use is an act of violence. That's what I'm being accused of. Okay. In my second 57 minute rant titled Part Two Compulsory Education, political education, a real world case study at the U of Toronto. Peterson states his disapproval of the mandatory antidiscrimination and anti bias training that the u of t has mandated for its HR professionals and opinion that he was not asked for by anyone.

Speaker 2:          04:19          The black liberation collective was successful in advocating for this equity training to be done, not for the comfort of those who have always been accommodated in welcome within the institution, but for those who are made voiceless, it was crafted from a place of wanting better in the environments that we as students daily partake in keeping in mind the ways in which people in powerful positions of this university are allowed to dehumanize students through microaggressions, gaslighting, and blatant disrespect without any accountability or repercussions. According to the U of t statements of institutional purpose, the University of firms, it's dedication to fostering an academic community in which the learning and scholarship of every member may flourish with vigilant protection for individual human rights and a resolute commitment to the principle of equal opportunity, equity and justice. The fact that a tenured professor employed with uft refuses to acknowledge the use of personal pronouns.

Speaker 2:          05:12          They mean preferred pronouns. By the way, I do actually use personal pronouns and has the audacity to try and rationalize and quantify racism is something subjective I have. I have no idea where that comes from. Not only discredits the lived experiences of students who have dealt with this reality, but also silences them more violence occurs as someone in a position of power who not only has the nerve to say such statements publicly, can still be a respected member of the university community and not face any formal university backlash and continue to enjoy tenure. We are sick of discriminatory faculty members denying our expertise in our experiences are not respecting who we are, especially when we merely ask for our lived realities to be respected and not disregarded. While you'll see how much asking is being done later in this letter, we are deeply concerned about the university's lack of action on this situation, especially as Peterson continues to spread is transphobic and racist ideologies through various media outlets.

Speaker 2:          06:07          I really have no idea where the racism thing is going and I'm not transphobic, so Bam, whatever. The university has failed to act on this situation and this ultimately showcases that quote, diversity, inclusion and equal respect are simply legalities and are not principles that the u of t tends on upholding the UFT has failed at maintaining a positive space and campuses free of hate. As a result, we, the undersigned are demanding accountability from the university administration and governing console with the following five demands. Now one thing you'll note about the people who do this sort of thing is that they're always demanding and that's for sure and a demand means or else, and that's also what legislation means. A public apology from professor Jordan Peterson and a full retraction of his comment. Yeah. Well, hello freeze over before that happens. Removal of is transphobic and racist lectures from Youtube, thus affirming their commitment to free speech.

Speaker 2:          07:01          A town hall with President Merrick Gertler, provost, Cherrelle Regnier, Vice President Angela Hilliard, and professor Jordan Peterson, where community members can explain the issues that he does clearly does not comprehend. And here's a good one. Mandated, anti-oppression trevor training at all levels of the University of Toronto, including faculty administration to happen every academic semester. A commitment at the University of Toronto will take action to defend students in university community members in future instances where tenured professors have made prejudice comments against an individual or group on the basis of race, sexual orientation, ability, sex, religion, gender expression or gender identity. We would also like to remind the administration at the University of Toronto statements on equity, diversity, and excellence states our support for equity is grounded in an institution wide commitment to achieving a working, teaching and learning environment that is free of discrimination and harassment as defined in the Ontario Human Rights Code. In striving to become an equitable community, we were also worked to eliminate, reduce, or mitigate the adverse effects of any barriers to full participation in university life that we find including in physical, environmental, attitudinal communication, or technological hateful.

Speaker 2:          08:13          Common should never be tolerated, especially not from someone who was considered to be an educator. No student should have to endure a two hour lecture, whether gender identity, existence, and realities are being debated and refused. Ultimately Peterson's comments erode the safe campus learning environment to which the university states a commitment. We hope that the university will respond to this situation within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with the policies established by the Governing Council. We also hope that these demands are approved when the Governing Council meets on October 27th, 2016 and so here's the people that are doing this. Daniel Lourenco, Utm Su Lgbtq coordinator, I'll make their email addresses available at the end of this video.
