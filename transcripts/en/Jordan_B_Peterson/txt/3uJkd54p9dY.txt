Speaker 1:          00:00:00       All right, welcome back. So the next four lectures are also oriented towards discussion of primarily clinical theories of psychology and psychopathology.

Speaker 1:          00:00:27       We're going to talk about lines of thinking that in some ways run parallel to those analysts because the thinkers we're going to discuss now with a few small exceptions, well all of them, all of the thinkers we're going to discuss in the next four lectures were either influenced heavily by Freud, human adler or were themselves thinkers who influenced Freud and young. So there's an intellectual continuity stretching over with with people who are deeply educated and who are very thoughtful. There's intellectual continuity ideas stretching over exceptional spans of time and so it's exactly the sort of thing that you would. That sort of relationship is exactly what you'd imagined. Roger has had a variety of influences, so let's say Freud and Jung and Adler, but he was also very much influenced by it. Phenomenological ideas and the phenomenologists were and are phenomenal of brand philosophy and which I'll explain more deeply and the other primary domain of influence on Rogers was Christianity likely and then Christianity also via probably northern European culture as far as I can tell.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       The reason I'm, I'm talking specifically about Christianity in relationship to rogers is because as a young man, he was a fundamentalist Christian and he was a seminarian. So we had. He was quite oriented towards mainline Protestant Christianity, but when he was in university, he had a crisis of belief, I suppose, when he was even going to go to China as a missionary at one point, um, but he had a crisis of belief in university because he'd also been scientifically trained. His father was a farmer who used rather advanced farming techniques and so rogers was trained to think scientifically from a very young age and he experienced the conflict between his religious belief and his scientific presuppositions quite intensely. And in that battle is formal Christian belief was the loser. However, his thinking is very much influenced by fundamentalist Protestant presuppositions and

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       the effect of those all described as we walked through Roger's thinking. Now, it's important to understand the philosophical underpinnings of a global personality or psychology theory because every theory is set within a set of assumptions, things that you have to assume to be true in order to proceed with the theory. I like the axioms in, in, uh, in classical geometry. You can't prove the axioms. You have to accept them. Once you accept the axioms, then you can move forward and use the whole system. I think the reason that systems have to have axioms which are elements of belief is because every system is incomplete, right? It doesn't cover the entire world. And so in some sense, you need a place to dispense with your ignorance. And the way you do that is by making assumptions. We're going to act as if the following is true and then you can proceed with a partial theory and you'll have some success with it, but it's useful to understand the presuppositions because they'd orientate new properly towards the theory. Now Rogers is a phenomenologist and phenomenology is a brand of philosophy which I believe started with Edmund Husserl, but was probably made most influential by his student, Martin Heidegger. Now heidegger

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       was, there was a philosopher, I suppose somewhat like Nicha and that he was very much his thinking around, very much counter to what you might describe as general academic philosophy. For example, heidegger believe that ever since the time of Plato, which is when people think philosophy began, more or less western philosophy, had taken up an erroneous direction. It had become too concerned with the nature of structures of thought and not concerned enough about the nature of being and so you can determine those two things being as how things are and thought of course is how you represent things, and one of heidegger's missions was to reestablish being as the central reality of philosophy. Now, that begs the question, which is what is being well to conceptualize reality as being is not to conceptualize it the same way that you conceptualize it

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       in terms of modern Western thought. Because one of the presuppositions at the basis of modern Western thought is that the most intelligent way to divide up the world is in terms of and objective experience or subjective and subjective experience and object of world. So the fundamental scientific presupposition you might say is that there is an objective world. It's the real thing. You come to that by performing certain procedures, documenting them, describing now of those procedures, documenting them, and then allowing other people to do the same thing, operating under the presupposition that if they experience the same outcome from the procedures, then what they're experiencing is real. That's basically the scientific method, right? Method results, your detailed the method, which is how you act on the world. You get the results, you compare them maybe across multiple observations that you do, and then other people do multiple observations. You come up with that with a consensus, but it's a method bound consensus and then of course you abstract out general principles from that works very powerfully, right? Make no mistake about it. The objective, the idea that there is an objective external world and that that's the best way to conceptualize reality is an unbelievably powerful tool.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       Now, whether or not it's an accurate description of reality, that's a much more difficult question and it's partly a matter of definition actually,

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       you know, it's the case that there are different forms of geometry. You might know this, you can start from the presupposition that reality has a three dimensional structure and then you're basically within the realm of Euclidean geometry, but you can also start with the presupposition that reality has afforded emotional structure and that kind of geometry was invented in the late 18 hundreds and it turned out to be the perfect geometry to describe the universe that Einstein conceptualized when he came up with his great theories in, in the second decade of the 20th century. So it's interesting because you could start from different assumptions, build tools on the basis of those assumptions, and sometimes you find out that those tools work very well. Indeed.

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       Now it's not that easy to think of flaws in the subjective experience. Objective, world conceptualization, and that's partly for, as for us as modern people, it forms the basis of so much of what we think that we just think about it as axiomatic. It's just true. It doesn't bear any question, but I'm going to offer you a couple of examples of why it might bear some questioning and you can, you can think about, you can think about it. The first problem is that that the classical scientific view of the world has a very difficult time accounting for certain things. So for example, these are called quality, uh, often by people who are interested in consciousness. So knowing the wave length of light doesn't seem to tell you much about the subjective experience of color. You know, we, we experienced, for example, in a non continuous fashion, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       Because we see discreet colors like you'd see in a rainbolt. I mean they shade into each other to some degree, but it's not like they go from light red, dark red in the continuum, there's clear demarcations of color. While that's because of the way your brain is wired, you know it, it seems like over the course of evolution, what we've learned is that parsing up that wavelength fragment in terms of categories which would be the different colors that we see has substantial practical utility. Now what are the things you might ask is, well, do those colors exist? Well, objectively, they don't seem to exist as colors, partly because of the wavelengths that we see are actually continuous. So when one color shades into another, there's no radical transformation and wave lake length. It's a continuum, but we see it categorically. Okay, so is that real or not?

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       Or The colors we see real or not? Well, that's a good question. Um, you can't get a collective experience of pain, like you can get a collective experience of the blackboard, but pain seems to be something that's limited to subjective perception, but it's very difficult. No one acts as if pain isn't real. I mean, I would say that of all the things that you might consider real, we act as if pain is the most real thing. You certainly can't argue yourself out of it, for example. It seems like a fundamental element of experience. Okay, so that's two places. We also have no account in the subjective objective.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       What breakup? Bifurcation of the world. We have no explanation whatsoever for consciousness. That seems like a big problem, right, because you could make a case that there's no being without consciousness. Like is there something if there's no one there to receive it, by the way, that is not the same question as if a tree falls in the forest and there was no one there to hear. It doesn't make it sound. It's not the same question. It sounds superficially the same, but this is a much more complex question because we don't know. For example, if we don't know the relationship between time and consciousness, like we have a certain perception of time. We have a certain temporal realm within which we exist. Our refresh rate for our vision, for example, is about 60 hertz, which is why you can see computer screens flicker. If they have a reflex rate that's slower than that, so 60 hertz to us looks continuous, but you know there's a lot of microseconds in a second and for a computer, especially a fast process it computer that can do maybe a trillion operations per second.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       If it was watching, so to speak, a movie, it would just see a picture still picture that was there forever and then another still picture that was there forever and like it wouldn't have the impression of continuous movement. So there's this weird subjective element to time. It's very difficult to understand. And then here's more, here's a more complex criticism of the subject object idea. I thought about this for a long time. So the best example I know of it is I read this book a while back written by a kgb officer and it was published after the fall of the, you know, the wall and the Soviet Empire. And this KGB officer claimed that he had worked in a biological warfare unit in the Soviet Union. And the purpose of the biological warfare unit was to turn infectious diseases into aerosols so that they can be sprayed on enemy populations, and so they were working on two things, developing a very, very silent infection.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       And so if your infection is one that's very severe but also very transmissible because those things are separate and then also one that could survive being aerosolized because it turns out that that's quite difficult, which we should all be very thankful about. And one of the projects they were working on was a, an attempt to cross Ebola was smallpox. Now Ebola is, you all know about Ebola, I presume it's a. it's very, very fatal, although they've learned ways to treat it now and maybe have a vaccine, but at that time it was very, very fatal and a smallpox is incredibly contagious and so they were hoping they could develop something that it was very, very contagious and very, very deadly that you could spray on civilian populations. Now you know here, here's where it gets tricky. It gets tricky here because how you answered this question inevitably, inevitably depends on how you define truth. And truth is actually something you have to define before you can have a conversation about it, which is a kind of a strange thing anyways. You can make a case that determining how to cross Ebola with smallpox and aerosolized. It is a perfectly valid scientific question

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       and because science is value free, it's very difficult to make an argument that that's any worse experiment than any other kind of experiment or any other kind of investigation. And you could also imagine even that if you didn't go to the aerosolization stage, that positive things might come out of it. Maybe you'd end up with a more detailed understanding of DNA or something as a consequence of the investigation that would have positive consequences. But it still seems that the idea of doing scientific research across crossing Ebola, smallpox, it, it seems to be something wrong about that. And it's maybe that sense of wrongness as well that can't be captured with inside inside scientific models. And so one of the things that you claimed in and Rogers and the is that in some sense is that the scientific reality has to be encapsulated within a unethical reality rather than the other way around. Now Rogers would say, you know that feeling you have when you hear about someone crossing Ebola with smallpox, that feeling you have in your body. That's a real thing. That feeling and that that's part of being

Speaker 2:          00:15:18       now

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       for the phenomenologists being is actually complicated to define and it's hard to understand, but what the phenomenologists do, we start with a different set of assumptions. They don't assume that the best way to approach reality is to break it up into this objective and the object it presume instead that the way that you should approach reality is by assuming that all of your experiences real all of it. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't different categories of experience, you know, because you could still say a dream and the experience you have walked dreaming of walking down the street and walking down the street are still different things. And the phenomenologists would say, yes, you can keep your categorical distinctions in tact, but you have to say that they're both real.

Speaker 2:          00:16:10       Now

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       this is an assumption and I told you why. The assumptions generating part of the reason the assumption is generated. The alternative assumption is because there are problems that emerged with the set of assumptions that make up the scientific worldview. Now, it's not that surprising that the scientific worldview can't encompass the subjective because the scientific world view was actually established by by Bacon and descartes safe and by well, by other thinkers of that time, it was set up to exclude the subjective from the conceptualization of objective reality. So you can't really criticize science because he does that, but you can say the fact that the subjective is excluded is a fault or at least an incompleteness and that incompleteness sometimes has extraordinary extraordinarily serious consequences that you can't just dismiss because you might say, well, have the Russians being the Soviets being successful in crossing Ebola with smallpox and aerosolizing it. Then we might all be dead and then he might think that any theory that leads everyone to be dead might reasonably be criticized for its assumption to universal truth. Now you can debate that, but and, and rightly so, but all I'm pointing out, is there a reasons to go at this from another approach?

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       Now, it was Roger's basic assumption that you were more likely to be properly oriented in life if you adopted a phenomenal, logical approach to your experience and to break up reality in that manner. So let me give you an example. When I, when my daughter was about three, she have nightmare and she came running into

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       her parent's bedroom and she told me her dream and she was all upset by it. She might've even been younger than three. At that point had she had dreamed that there was a clear stream and that it was quite beautiful and that there was garbage littering the bottom of it. Now, by that time, you know, she, kids are quite sophisticated in their ability to categorize. You know, by that time she'd already learned the difference between a kid things and adult things. And you think that's a bloody complex form of discrimination, you know, because like what objective features do adult things share in common that differentiates them from things you, you can't actually come up with a set of objective criteria that allows that distinction to be made. But kids by the time they're three years got a pretty clear grasp of that so they can come up with very sophisticated classifications.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       I'm about the same time and one of my friends had a two year old who went outside their house one day and looked down the street and there were a couple of garbage cans knocked over and the kid said, oh, and you know, that's also extremely sophisticated because you think, you know, the whole street is a very complex visual set of visual stimuli. And to be able to glance at that and then to know that something is out of place and then to make an otter and solid to draw people's attention to it is a ridiculously sophisticated cognitive out. And my daughter was doing the same thing within the context of her dream. So she was upset about this. Now it's quite interesting because you think, well why would someone who was three the upset about the fact that a stream beautiful, clear stream was with had garbage in it, you know, it's, it's a really, it's like innate environmentalism or something like that and a concern for the environment and that could easily be the case, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:20:03       If we found our environment up continually during our evolutionary history, that was likely to have very negative consequences. Even birds cleaned their own nest and so the fees and you know, they keep their hives, cleaning all of that. So it could be a very primordial instinct. Anyway, she came in with this dream and she was quite upset and then you think, well there's a couple of things you could do about that. You could say it's just a dream. Don't worry about it, go back to sleep, but you know, that's a philosophical statement, right? And it's, it's, it's a misleading one. Or You could argue that it was misleading because what does, it's just a dream mean? Well, it means that it's certainly not something to take, like you would take serious. Take something that occurred during the day, seriously, it's a mirror like a fantasy, but with the definition of fantasy being some fundamentally useless

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       act of what to play, I suppose that you can ignore with no consequences and not only that, but you should ignore it and you know that's. That's not necessarily true because then you're making the case or you might be making the case that you don't have to pay attention to products of your imagination. That seems like a pretty dopey thing to tell a child given a, that anything creative that you ever produced is going to come out of your imagination and be the way that you set goals and plans for your future is by imagining them dreaming about them. Right? Everyone knows what it means to pursue a dream and you know you might say, well, if you're depressed, it means all your dreams have disappeared. It's like so maybe you shouldn't be telling your child that it's just a dream and so you can go.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       You can ignore it and go back to sleep. You know, you don't know exactly what you're doing when you, when you do that, you're certainly not paying attention to the child's experience because it's. She did have that image and it did make her upset and those are facts and as far as people like Rogers would be concerned, those are facts about reality. Are there elements of reality and they should be dealt with as such. So I told her to close her eyes and to bring the dream image APP, inner imagination, which she could do very well. And then to imagine that she had some rubber boots on and that she could go into the street and pick out the garbage and put it in the garbage bag and that there was a garbage can nearby and she could put it in the garbage can. And so we went through that and that calmed her down and then she went back to bed.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       And then you might say, well, what? What am I doing doing that? Because you might say, well, that's just a fantasy. Just like the dream and because they're just fantasies. Neither of them have anything to do with reality. But you know that again, that's not very sophisticated way of thinking because the dream presented my daughter with a problem, or you could even say a class of problems and the class of problems. It includes all of those things that people do too and I and other animals, of course, all the ways that the environment can be defiled well, that actually is an existential problem, and then you might say, well, what should you do about it now? So that might be, well, maybe you should do something about it in so far as you can do something about it because then you're conceptualizing yourself as an active agent and not just a passive victim or a passive recipient of the problem.

Speaker 1:          00:23:44       You could actually do something about it and that's a way different messages. Then it's just a dream. You can ignore it and go back to sleep. You know what you've maybe you shouldn't actually tell your child to be ignoring reality and go back to sleep. Maybe you should be telling them to wake up and see reality as clearly as they possibly can and not ignore any of it, including their fantasies. In their dreams, and that doesn't mean that they're fantasies have the same reality as the reality that you experience with everyone else, but the fact that it's not the same reality that you experience with everyone else doesn't mean it's not reality. Now Rogers would claim, for example, that to ignore a private experience warps you fundamentally.

Speaker 2:          00:24:33       So

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       here's the basic outlines of his view of the world, so there's first of all, you exist within a phenomenal logical field. Now phenomenon. Phenomenon comes from the Greek word famous thigh and famous thigh means to shine forth and so phenomena are those things that shine forth for you. Now the way to understand that is to imagine that you're reading a book and maybe a passage of it really strikes you as meaningful. Well then you might say, well, why? There's lots of passages in the book. If someone else was reading the book, it's not obvious that the same passage would strike them, and then you might say, well, is that a consequence of the structure of you as as a, as a, as an interpreter of the book? Or is it a consequence of the contents of the book and the answer to that is you actually can't tell because the book is neither the thing that's printed, nor the reader. The book is the interaction between the reader and the book, and that interaction is actually unique for each person. Even though there might be some commonalities across people because otherwise you would need to be able to talk about a book.

Speaker 2:          00:25:46       Well,

Speaker 1:          00:25:50       regardless when you're interacting with something, some things announced themselves on your field of consciousness and other things don't, and so the phenomenologists would say, well, something shine forth for you. Well, other things don't. It's a little bit like one of us ideas about the development of the self. Don't believe that if you follow the things that announced themselves to you as meaningful, that they would take you to through a descent to begin with where you would encounter things you were afraid of or terrified of and disgusted by and wanted to avoid. And then the consequence of that would be that you do incorporate a lot of new material into your personality and the consequences of that would be you'd be reborn roughly speaking as a stronger person, and then if you just kept doing that all the time for the rest of your life in small and large ways, that you'd become more and more and more fully differentiated and developed, and he wouldn't have said that the the ultimate potential target of that kind of development was what he described as the self. The self is a multifaceted conceptualization, so that's not all there is to it, but the self from the union perspective is who you could be if you could be who you most deeply are. If you didn't shy away from anything, if you, if you accurately encountered and then integrated even in a pod and sense your experience. Now that's. That's exactly the same idea that Rogers had. He believed that

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       there's a phenomenal field and it's full of experience. All of your experience manifests itself as the phenomenal field is quite interesting because if it means also that other people are part of your phenomenal field, part of your experience, and then that all within that field, there's a circumscribed area that he described as the self that's it's different than the union itself, so it somewhat terminological confusing. Roger yourself is more like Freud's ego, but Rogers would define myself as those aspects of the phenomenological field that you, that you call. I felt like I've had clients who tended to talk in the third person about their emotions or they would say the body. They wouldn't say I maybe they're describing cutting themselves. They'd say, well, the body needed to be cut,

Speaker 2:          00:28:36       and

Speaker 1:          00:28:38       what Rogers would say about that was that

Speaker 1:          00:28:43       person existed in the phenomenological field and part of that phenomenal logical field was demarcated by the self, like the self hadn't expanded to incorporate as much of that phenomenological field as it should have. The other concept he had was the con. Another concept he had was the concept of the organism. Now you can think of the self as what you identified with it and then you can think of the organism as all those things that are unique to you that you might identify with the art. Now it's tricky because imagine that you get angry during a fight with someone argument and they say, you're angry and you say, no, I'm not lost. Like what exactly are you doing there? The other person we're gonna. Assume the other person is right for the sake of this argument. They can clearly see that you're angry, but you're not

Speaker 2:          00:29:37       allowing

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       the organismic manifestation of motivational state or emotion to be incorporated with those things that you identify with. Rogers would call that into groans and he believed that incongruent was roughly equivalent to psychopathology, so that part of your goal was to

Speaker 1:          00:30:08       was for the organism to respond appropriately to the broader phenomenological field. Now we can talk about what appropriately means, but we won't do that yet, and then what the self was supposed to do is accurately symbolically represent organismic responses to the broader phenomenological field. So now you can see that there are similarities between that concept and say Freud's idea of the ego and they know because the Ed was this sort of external thing that was the home of motivational and emotional forces that couldn't be easily integrated into the ego and for partly because the Super Ego said, for example, that they were wrong and so there is this, these sets of phenomena you know, that all of the different clinicians are talking about, but all of them are talking about it starting from different initial presuppositions and it's like a group of people in the room shining a flashlight on a very complex object.

Speaker 1:          00:31:08       You know, they're all standing in a slightly different position. The complex object is the same thing, but you can only see parts of it and so you need multiple different ways of looking at things so that you can come up with a cohesive and coherent account of something that's actually beyond your understanding. Because of course not only can you not accurately, symbolically represented the phenomenological world, the entire domain of your being, you can't accurately represent even the organismic. The aspect of that field that's related to the organismic you, there's this part of you on top that you identify with, I roughly speaking, and it's trying to model a model of something very complex and of course that's extraordinarily difficult. Now why is it doing that? That's the central mystery of consciousness. You know, there's this problem that consciousness researchers always refer to it. It's an annoyingly termed, I think it's called the Zombie problem, and the Zombie problem is why is consciousness necessary? Like why is it necessary for something complex like a human being to actually have awareness and self awareness? Why couldn't it just wander through the world reacting in predetermined deterministic fashion? Zombie like no awareness robot, like let's say what's consciousness for

Speaker 1:          00:32:45       Rogers doesn't really discuss that and so we won't at the moment. Although I think there are some reasonable ideas. Consciousness, for example, I was using generalized between certain phenomena anyways, regardless, there's the self, the organism in the broader phenomenological field. Let's say you go into a

Speaker 2:          00:33:15       pub bar

Speaker 1:          00:33:18       and you're, you've been there many times and so you know the people in there, you know where to sit. You know what's going to happen. You may have friends there, you might say that your organism

Speaker 2:          00:33:30       exists

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       at least in part as a very accurate model of that broader, phenomenal, logical world, and then inside that you're aware of your knowledge of them,

Speaker 2:          00:33:43       the bar, and so

Speaker 1:          00:33:49       if your organism is properly adapted to the broader phenomenological field, when you go into the bar or other familiar place, things that you expect and want happened instead of things that you neither expect nor one, and you could say, well perhaps that's a reasonable definition of adaptation. Now this isn't biological revolutionary identification, right? This is personal adaptations. There are similar in some ways, but importantly different mean you can be adapted to an environment without that in any way having any effect whatsoever on your evolutionary adaptiveness. So

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       now if you're, maybe you're not very well organism actually adapted to the environment. You have a model of it and because of that, when you go somewhere familiar, people don't like you as much as you think they do and you're not nearly as much of a master of that situation as you think you are and one of the consequences of that, so that would mean that your self representation is too rigid and simplistic and full of defenses to notice the discrepancy between your organism and the broader environment that's pathological and the way that's going to be marked is first by anxiety. You know, maybe you tell a joke. There's some people sitting around you, you tell a joke and you see people kind of, you know, making that face maybe rolling their eyes. It's like, well that's not exactly. You might think, well, they're joking. You know, they're just, they're just teasing me.

Speaker 1:          00:35:21       Well maybe they're not. Maybe they're damn sick of your stupid stories and you've told them 50 times and you're not very funny and they'd rather you work in the bar at all and it may be that you'll actually notice that, but you don't necessarily notice it in a symbolically fully symbolically developed. Now, what that would mean is maybe you start feeling anxiety and Roger's identify as different levels of feeling. It might start with this subception and to succeed something which is a word that I guess comes from general semantics, is to have the event affect the way that you're interacting with the world in ways that you don't necessarily notice, so it sort of equivalent to the idea of subliminal when you're talking about advertising messages. Flashed out unit suddenly changes the way that you're interacting with the world, but you don't notice that. That and that happens to people all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       I mean it's actually a part of our normal cognitive structure and when you walk into this room, the room tells you all sorts of things about how to behave and you don't notice that the room is telling you those things because you know what it's telling you so well that you just act it out. You don't need to go through all the complex processes of actually perceiving and thinking about it, and so Roger's oranges that you can detect things organismic Lee. That will affect the nature of your experience without necessarily either even perceiving that or definitely not symbolically representing it. Now maybe the social discomfort that's inherent in the situation rises up to the level of perception that's not symbolization yet. Then you might think, well, what does it feel like to be anxious?

Speaker 2:          00:37:10       Well, that,

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       and I'm not asking what are the objective markers of being anxious because we actually don't know those. We know we can kind of infer them. Sometimes people's heart rate goes up, but sometimes it decelerates and then there are facial expressions that are associated with anxiety, but you have to use those to infer. If you get anxious, I don't feel your anxiety, I have to infer it, but if you get anxious, you feel your anxiety and so then the question might be, well, what does it mean to feel anxious?

Speaker 2:          00:37:39       Wealth?

Speaker 1:          00:37:41       That's a hard question and the reason it's a hard question is because you never have to answer it because if you tell someone I felt anxious, then they refer to their own feelings of anxiety and then they know what you mean and you never have to come up with an explanation of what it feels like. The feeling this, the idea that the feeling is an element of experience is something that we just take for granted. You know, I got angry today. Everybody nods or maybe I tell a little story and say, well, you know, I got on the bus and I was missing like two cents and I asked the bus driver if he would let me get on the bus and he didn't and not really annoyed me because I take that bus everyday and the driver knows me and I got angry and everybody not.

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       And the reason they nod is a partly because they can imagine that that's how they would have reacted in that situation. But even more importantly, they accept the reality of angry as a response and they know what it feels like. So explaining it. That's a much more difficult thing, so the point is is that you can have experiences that you know of. First of all, you can have experiences that you don't know of that would be the subsea experiences. Then you can have experiences that you perceive but that you haven't symbolically represented and those might be emotional or motivational experiences, and then you can have experiences that you have symbolically represented in a way that captures their just accurately in a way that's reflective of your adaptation or lack thereof to the broader phenomena. Logical world and Rogers would say that latter state is preferable.

Speaker 1:          00:39:16       You know how to act or you know that you didn't act properly and you know how to fix it, which is almost as good and you represent that accurately. Now you might imagine that you could concentrate on the mismatch between organismic responses and the environment. That's what behavior therapists really do. They say, well, how are you acting and what are the consequences, but that isn't really where Roger's goes. Rogers is more psychoanalytic than the behavior therapists and what he seems to be primarily concerned about is whether or not your self representation is an accurate representation of of how your organism is responding. In some sense, for Rogers, the organism takes the place of God. It's more or less omniscient, so your organism is going to tell you the truth in every situation and it's up to you whether or not you're going to pay attention to that and make sense of it or whether you're going to engage in any of the different kinds of shenanigans that you might engage in to stop yourself from going through the complex process of symbolization.

Speaker 1:          00:40:31       Because you might say, well, you're back in the bar and you might say, well, you notice the anxiety and then you know, different ways of symbolizing it. Come to mind. These people are all people are all just jerks. And then another thing comes to mind is, well, maybe nobody likes me. And then maybe another idea that's associated with symbolization comes to mind, which is, well, maybe there's elements of my social behavior that I should adjust. And I presume that if Roger's was having a conversation with one of his clients, he would assume that that was the most, that was the most fruitful potential step towards accurate symbolization. Now Roger's felt that anxiety emerged when the self concept was not accurately symbolically representing the organisms experiences, and so that would be in some sense if you're a house divided within yourself, then you're your pathological from a Rogerian perspective. And you can think about that in some sense as a move away from necessary. Simplicity

Speaker 2:          00:41:42       mean

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       if your self concept is set up property, it doesn't contain contradictory and misleading bits of information. Everything works seamlessly together. And so what that would mean is that you think about something, you act it out and it works, and then that's an indication that the organization between say these different three different levels of being is the right word, is icer morphing each represents the other with sufficient accuracy. And so that means that you're congruent and if you're congruent, then the world is treating you not only in the manner that you want to be treated, but also in the manner that's most likely.

Speaker 2:          00:42:27       Two

Speaker 1:          00:42:30       further your actions in the world as an organism, and so that's partly why Rogers believed that the organism had wisdom because it's natural proclivity was to operate in the world effectively and to expand its competence at the same time and what self actualized person because that's one of Roger's phrases is someone who self concept accurately represents their organismic

Speaker 2:          00:42:57       being.

Speaker 1:          00:43:05       Now Rogers was primarily a clinician as well, and his theories were derived from his clinical experience and his theories informed his clinical practice and Roger's invented or developed what he believed to be a new kind of therapy and he called that client centered therapy. Now you've probably heard about student centered education in Rogers. I ideas have had a tremendous amount of influence, certainly not at least in educational psychology. Also in conflict reduction of various sorts.

Speaker 1:          00:43:45       You start with Rogers initial assumptions, which is first of all, you should regard your experience as real. Second, that your organism will give you accurate information about the totality of experience and third, that your self concept should accurately encompass your actual experience. There are implications of that theory for therapy and one of the implications is that you can figure out what you should do if you want to because your organism will tell you or at least hint at you about which directions are correct and which directions are, and if you follow those, then you're going to naturally gravitate towards a state of being where you're more and more accurately represented by yourself, but also that your representation and your organism are going to act more effectively in the world. They're not bumping up against each other all the time and you know they're not even conflict anymore, and so that's the goal of the self actualized person at therapy in part is the art of furthering that process of self actualization. Now, Rogers Rogers

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       was opposed to diagnosis because he felt that it didn't sufficiently represent the vital minutia of the client's individual experience and I think that's. I think that his claim was extremely important. No, because medicine psychiatry tends to classify everything and you might say, well, are the psychiatric diagnostic classifications real? And then the answer that is, it depends on what you mean by real anyway. Think well that's an annoying answer, but it is. It is still the answer. So I could say if I was being cynical, although I don't really think it's a cynical response, if I was willing to sound cynical, that the only reason that psychiatrist diagnosed their clients is so that insurance companies can pay the bills and I actually believe that that's more true than the claim, that the psychiatric diagnostic categories accurately actually capture the essence of the person's problems. In my clinical experience, classification has had almost zero utility and the reason for that is because it's too low resolution. It doesn't capture the individual property because the thing about a client clinical client is that it's precisely their individuality. That's the fundamental issue. It's like they have to make their way through the world in their body and their in their time and their position in culture with their advantages and disadvantages. And that requires a unique solution that's unique in many ways. And one that's also personally

Speaker 1:          00:47:21       and rogers also wasn't a particularly great fan of the psychoanalysts tendency to look for the causes of present behavior in past events so he didn't. He didn't regard fishing in the past as a useful, necessarily useful expedition or as unnecessary expedition. Although if issues of the past came up in therapy, he was perfectly willing to to to deal with them. He didn't accept except the Freudian theory that the fundamental cause of psychopathology was saying traumatic past experience.

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       Right

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       now, this gives Rogerian therapy a particular flavor. You could also call it non directive therapy. Now if you're a behavior therapist,

Speaker 1:          00:48:28       you might actively strategize with your client about what they're going to do in the next week and then once they've established their goals, you might offer some hints about what strategies they could use to monitor themselves and to attain those goals and maybe you'll even have to keep track of it. Roger's generally speaking, wouldn't do something that directive and in fact he strove not to unduly influenced the client's decisions about important future events. And in that way, he was quite similar to Freud because Freud would sit behind, would sit, so the client would be laying on a couch and fred would sit so that the client is patient, actually couldn't see him and then he would listen to the person free associate, which in some sense means that they would ramble on and he was attempting by doing that to facilitate the self realization of their, of their own memories.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       If things happened to you in your past and they still cause you emotion, let's say they're more than 18 months old for the sake of argument, Freud, but assume that if you kind of wandered around that memory somewhat haphazardly and in an in an association will weigh the way conversations naturally unfold, that you would bring things to light and that would allow a certain kinds of emotional expression in that. And in fact in itself would be curative. But for I didn't want to with your fear with that process or guided to any great degree. And so rogers was like that he, he wanted you to make your own decisions. So he believed that the therapeutic endeavor required could not, could not occur unless certain conditions were met and the conditions were

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       willingness to tell the truth. So when, when a client comes to see me, one of the first things I tell them is, you can tell me anything you want, although you're perfectly within your rights to maintain your privacy, you can tell me anything you want, but tell me the truth as much as clearly as you can. Because if you don't, there isn't. I don't know what's going on with you and there's not a possibility on any possibility at all that I can, that this process will be useful if we're talking about things that don't exist. So one precondition is the person is willing to come and see you. So that means they want to transform. The second precondition is that they're going to communicate with you and communication means they're going to do their best to tell the truth. But the therapist takes the same

Speaker 1:          00:51:15       vow in a sense. And so one of the things that I tell my clients is that I will never let them do anything that makes me resent them. So if I'm asked to step out of my way for some reason to take an additional session or maybe to meet them somewhere and I do it, they can be assured that there won't be a price that will be extracted from them later for interfering with the smooth flow of my day. So, and the other thing that I do, and I've learned this from Rogers and from the other people I've read, is that I'll listen to people talk and then sometimes something will occur to me and I don't think about it as I thought something because I'm actually somewhat a follower of nickname. She's dictum, which is that the fact that you think is no approved, that the fact that you experienced thoughts is no proof that you thought it just appeared. While you don't think that you think that your dreams right, you have your dreams. There you are in band. They're the dreams. Are you having them? Well, it doesn't seem like it. It seems like you're experiencing this in some sense the same way you experienced the external world voluntarily creating them. Well, why do you think anything different about your thoughts?

Speaker 1:          00:52:43       And that's a very useful thing to realize by the way because otherwise you think your your thoughts and then if you have negative thoughts, well then you assume that they're true and they're not true just because you think that they are just thoughts and maybe they're true and maybe they're useful and maybe they're not. So stepping back from them a little bit is incredibly. It's like Buddhist detachment in a sense. It's an incredibly useful thing to do. I mean that's another thing that's really characteristic of modern people because especially if they're smart, they think they think first of all and second they think that the things they think are true and neither of those things are necessarily true and abandoning your belief in them. It makes you much less rigid and much more able to expand your preconceptions or even radically change them when the circumstances demand them. So the person has to be wanting to change in principal in a positive direction. They have to be willing to tell the truth. Then the next element of Rogerian psychotherapy is something that he called unconditional positive regard and unconditional positive regard, and the Rogerian tradition is something like radical acceptance. It's actually a hallmark of modern child rearing techniques. You should wholeheartedly accept all aspects of the person's being. Now Rogers believed that are positive, that partly because he also believed in

Speaker 2:          00:54:34       what was it called,

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       conditions of worth.

Speaker 1:          00:54:43       Here's the condition of worth. I don't like you when you act like that, so you imagine you might tell a child that I don't like you when you act like that and maybe you tell them that about a bunch of things that they do, but maybe those are integral parts of the child's being and by making your lack of acceptance, no, you make it impossible for the child to incorporate. Those aspects of his organism. Organism will experience into a self concept. You can see echoes of the Super Ego Eagle idea there and so rogers would say, well, if someone comes into psychotherapy and experiences unconditional positive regard, that means that they'll be able to reveal those elements up their organismic experience that have been rejected and say by the social world and themselves experienced them and then potentially incorporate them within the self concept and that that's going to be a good thing because rogers is a great believer in the natural inevitability of positive transformation. If if you set that up as your your goal, he also believes that that should be your goal and that it's actually your natural goal. If, for example, you haven't been subjected to arbitrary conditions of worth,

Speaker 1:          00:56:19       now I'm going to read you something that Rodger's road, which is quite interesting and I think I found it extremely effective. Oh yes. That's another thing I should mention. There is one other important assumption in the idea of self actualization. The other thing that Roger tried to ensure that his clients develop was autonomy and independence. Now for Rogers, there was very little difference between the move towards autonomy and in any and personal independence and the process of self actualization.

Speaker 2:          00:57:19       Now,

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       given that we're looking back at Roger's work, 50 years later, you might ask yourself is if autonomy and independence is a necessary precondition for psychological health because you could make the case that productive interdependence and more communal orientation is equally healthy, but that's not a Rogerian presupposition,

Speaker 2:          00:57:57       so

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       his ideal is the fully functioning individual.

Speaker 1:          00:58:10       So here's his hypothesis with regards to psychotherapy, assuming a minimal mutual willingness to be in contact and to receive communications, we may say that the greater the communicated congruence of experience, awareness and behavior on the part of one individual, the more the ensuing relationship will involve a tendency towards reciprocal communication with the same qualities, mutually accurate understanding of the communication's improved, psychological adjustment and functioning in both parties and mutual satisfaction in the relationship. Okay, so let's unpack that. Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to be in contact and to receive communication well, the first thing you might say is that it's pretty much thought the hallmark of a relationship, right? Because if you're not in contact, well clearly you don't have a relationship and if you are in contact but you're not communicating, you probably don't have a relationship.

Speaker 2:          00:59:08       Alright, so

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       and you know, that also begs the question of exactly what a relationship is for and that's something that's very much worth considering because people don't really usually know what a relationship is for. They certainly know that as a general rule they're going to pursue them, but they don't really have any idea in some sense what the optimal state is or what the desired final state should be. Now, of course the desired final state 50 years ago was marriage,

Speaker 2:          00:59:39       but I don't.

Speaker 1:          00:59:43       It's certainly the case now that most people who are couples aren't married. Now you might ask yourself, well, what's the utility of a relationship and what's the utility of a long term relationship? Well, the Rogerian answer to that would be the more based on trust the relationship is the more likely that you're going to be in contact and to receive communications and then as a consequence of that, you're going to become better and better at representing your organismal experience within your self concept, and that's going to facilitate your movement towards self awareness and self actualization.

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       It's a two. Brains are better than one idea. So we say, well, we established a relationship. Okay, and the goal of our relationship is to make things better, and we we make a presupposition that the way you make things better is by telling the truth as you see it. So remember, this is a phenomenological theory, and so the truth that Rogers is talking about isn't objective truth. And I suspect that at least in part because establishing objective truth within the confines of a relationship is I think it's technically impossible and we talked about that before because each interaction between the members of a couple or people in any relationship is contaminated in a sense by all of the other interactions they've ever had. Plus everything they bring to bear on the situation and there's just no untangling that objectively know. What did you mean when you said that

Speaker 2:          01:01:34       that well, God, you know, you can argue about that for

Speaker 1:          01:01:41       to the point of divorce and for 10 years afterwards, you know, without ever coming to a satisfactory conclusion. All right? The greatest greater the communicated congruence of experience, awareness and behavior on the part of one individual. The more the ensuing relationship will involve a tendency towards reciprocal communication with the same qualities. Okay, so here's the idea. You go see a psychotherapist, a registered psychotherapist, at least in principle. This is someone who's mastered or is it tempting to master these basic modes of being? So what they're going to do is they'll tell you, I'm going to tell you the truth as I see it. And so the way I see that happening in psychotherapy is that when someone comes to see me, I listened to them and that means that I'm not distracted by anything else. I'm not thinking about anything else. I'm not thinking about what I'm going to say next.

Speaker 1:          01:02:34       I'm not thinking about the things I have to do today. I'm not thinking about the last time I saw this person. I'm not allowing my attention to wander away from the person and then I'm watching them and listening to them at the same time and those are the same things because to really listen to someone, you also have to watch them because then you succeed perhaps or perceive of the nonverbal elements of communication that go along with, well, partly with voice tone, but apparently with direction and partly with very subtle transformations of facial gesture. So sometimes, for example, I see on my clients that they'll all of a sudden turn into a child. It's very interesting. It's like there'll be recounting some experience. It's like fixation from a Freudian perspective. They'll be in, there'll be describing some experience from the from the distant past and for a second there expression will approximate who they were when they were six years old. It's really, it's really something remarkable to see and you can see these things if you really pay attention and then as they talk,

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       I'm watching what's happening inside me as I listened to their words and all sorts of things will happen. Sometimes I'll get an image or sometimes I'll get a memory of something we talked about before or sometimes I'll notice that what they're saying right now is different than something they said five minutes ago and so then I'll say, wait a sec. No, I'm trying to understand what you're telling me and I noticed that you just said this and it seems to imply this, but then, you know, a couple of minutes ago when we were talking about that, then you said this and I don't see how those two things are the same and I'm not doing that because I want them to rectify the paradox. I'm doing that because I want to understand what they are saying and if someone says to you and then they say be.

Speaker 1:          01:04:24       You don't know what they're saying. And so the question is for clarification. There's no other direction than that. And then maybe you know, I'll have a little image, like the sort of a fragment of a dream and I'll say, wait a second, what, what you just said when you said what you just said, this is what I experienced and then maybe we'll talk for awhile about what that might mean and, and I'll, I can say to them what. So for example, sometimes sometimes people will come to my office and they do all sorts of strange things. Like I had one client who had psychosomatic epilepsy and one of the first times I saw her, she had a seizure in my office and uh, I was watching her and it didn't really matter to me that she was having a seizure. And I thought that's pretty weird because normally when someone's having a seizure, it's like you get affected

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       by it, right? I mean there's, there's sensations that emerge in your midsection and there's thoughts of emergency and, and you know, because your body in some sense is mimicking their body, which is what your body does all the time when you're talking to people. And that produces a sense of urgency. And I just sort of watched her have the seizure and I thought, oh, it's not real, it's not real seizures, but she was very good at it and you know, as far as she was concerned, she couldn't tell if the seizures were real or not and sometimes if you have cycle genic epilepsy, you've had an epileptic seizure at one point that was genuine. Well, it's exceptionally complicated and it's not easy to develop a psychogenic epilepsy, but she had developed it and part of the reason was

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       that she thought that she was toying with the idea that existence as a psychiatric patient would require less effort and responsibility and so she got tangled up at one point with one of the mental hospitals and they diagnosed her with paranoid schizophrenia, which is not something I would recommend it, especially if you don't actually have it. Because once you've got the diagnosis, well are you really going to know that you. What's going to happen? Hey, you do something like that. You have a psychogenic epileptic seizure in a variety of other symptoms there. The consequence of a very complex complex in union terms, there is a secondary motivation and Freud in terms you go through with the whole routine anyway, end up in a psych hospital and you see for experts and they tell you a paranoid schizophrenia. Do you really think you're going to not believe that or at least 10 percent of you is going to believe it. You're going to wonder after that and if another 20 people tell you that and you're put on medication, which you could easily be that a year later while you might still not have paranoid schizophrenia, but you are not going to be doing very well. So

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       well. That's a good example of what happens when your self concept and you're organismic valuing systems aren't working carefully in tandem anyways. So someone might be telling me a story that's, you know, like a story about something terrible that happened to them and like I'll just be sitting there like a brick wall. It's like you're not effecting me. And sometimes I'll tell people that. It's like, I don't know why, but you know, that's a pretty terrible story, but I'm having no emotional response to it at all. Do you have any reason? You have any idea why that might be while then maybe look, you know, often people are very happy when you tell them that and that's fine. They can be unhappy with that. That's perfectly okay, but the thing is now they know that there's at least one person that they've communicated with who's actually telling them the truth, who is actually not affected by their story because look, if someone sits down beside you and they tell you a terrible story, the probability that you're going to tell them that that had no effect on you is basically zero because really rude not to be negatively affected by someone who's telling you a very sad story, but if you're negatively effected by it, I just not true.

Speaker 1:          01:08:24       You're not doing them any good at all. You're doing is providing them with evidence to maintain what could easily become a delusion if they worked on it long enough. By contrast, sometimes people will come into my office and they'll tell me something that just seems trivial and it made me tear up so which means I can actually feel emotions. It would make me tear up, but it's just something they just barely. They barely alluded to. You know, I got a client a while back told me that we had had a session family session where I had suggested to some of the members of this person's family that things might go better for them and their child who was one of my clients, if for the next two weeks what they practice doing was watching each other's behavior during the day and finding one thing that they could make a positive comment about.

Speaker 1:          01:09:21       Now, and this isn't a game like if you play it as a game, then it isn't going to work. If you're going to do this properly, what you do is you watch and then you notice when the person does something that actually makes you feel positively towards them and then you tell them you did this. It has to be specific. It can't be at the end of the day. Well, you were pretty good today. It's like, no, that's not gonna work, man. You have to notice something. They actually did. It's usually something trivial. Like, um, I really appreciate the fact that you took your dirty dinner plate off the table and rinsed it off and put it in the dishwasher. It's like, you think that's so damn trivial. It's hardly worth commenting on. It's like, no, no, no. It's not at all. That's exactly the sort of specific thing that you comment on.

Speaker 1:          01:10:05       If it did in fact make you happy, you know, when you can think about that in behavioral terms, you could say, well if you, if, if you want someone to do something that you like, you should tell them when they do things that you like, so that they know what you like. But of course that means that you're putting yourself on the line too, right? Because if the person knows what you like, then they can withhold it from you. And so you're not going to do that unless you trust them. You're really not. So you know, you might be in a relationship, you might be in a marriage where never once during the whole bloody marriage do you ever tell the other person what actually makes you happy? It's like, that's stupid by the way. So like if you want to have a really miserable time of it, that's an excellent way to start.

Speaker 1:          01:10:46       You could also add to that the presumption that if they really loved you, they know what you liked, which is also what your partners no smarter than you generally speaking and you don't have a clue what it's going to make them happy. So I don't know why you'd expect them to, especially if they're male, why you'd expect them to return the favor. So then you teach them, you know, like probably take four years. It's like I like when you do this and then of course they won't. So you might have to mention it again in a month. You might think, well it's going to take 18 months to train this person. At least. I mean they're smart, they're smarter than a dog, but not much smarter. So you have to be, you have to use repetition and you have to be judicious about it and if you do that, another person is also doing that to you and you both know that you're doing that and you're both trying to make things better than you're going to communicate about it. And then with any luck things will get better. But that means you actually have to want things to get better.

Speaker 1:          01:11:45       And that's part of the problem of course, because not everybody wants things to get better and there's a part of everyone that would be just as happy if they didn't get better. So anyways,

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       Roger's idea is that if you communicate properly with the person that you're in the relationship with, that you can model proper being in some sense and that at least you could attempt tomorrow and then as you attempted, you'll get better and better at it and as you get better at it, the other person will get better at it. And that works too. So I had a client who was very anxious person. So when the person first came to see me, they couldn't even talk on the phone and now they're doing, they're acting publicly, they're acting in public. And that's been the consequence of about seven years of, I would say Rogerian conversations were almost all that I did was listen now the UNCW, I don't quite get the unconditional positive regard thing, although I know why Roger is set it and his idea that arbitrary conditions of worth can make someone pathological or true, but

Speaker 1:          01:12:57       I think a more nuanced sense of unconditional positive regard is what happens when you watch the person and they tell you something and as they're telling it to you, you can see a little part of them sort of come alive and that often happens when their face loses a fair bit of its rigidity and you can see more of what they were like when they were a child sort of peeping through. So their face sort of opens up. You can they a hot. That was really good for that person. Whatever they been telling me that they'd be doing that was right on the right track. And then you can say, look, I noticed that when you talk about this, you know your, your face redox, you didn't look as anxious, you were smiling, you know, and it was a genuine smile. And for like a second or two there you look like you were doing well and you were happy. It's like, let's do a bunch more of that because you know, if you see in someone that they're capable of experiencing that, then you could help them experience that more. And that's the purpose of a longterm relationship

Speaker 2:          01:13:53       is that

Speaker 1:          01:13:54       you have your weaknesses and inadequacies and you can't think them, think yourself out of them by yourself, partly because they colored the way that you think. And so you need somebody else to bang yourself up against, to contend with so that all the knots in your soul can get ironed out and hypothetical. You're doing the same thing for the other person. And then both of you are on an upward spiral. And then in some sense that's the core theory of Rogerian psychotherapy. It's like genuine, honest communication can heal people and genuinely dishonest communication can make them pathological. And in some sense, I think Roger's got closer to the truth. If you invert Rogers presupposition, that's as close to the truth as any psychotherapists has gone to see, makes people pathological. And that's true. A lot of, and you'll notice this as well. A lot of what you're doing in psychotherapy and in any genuine relationship is a moral endeavor. You're trying to make things better. And if the other person is deceiving themselves or lying or failing to become aware of things that they should become aware of, they're going to get bent and twisted out of shape and then they're not going to be congruent, congruent with their body or with the broader world. And then they're going to suffer. And then that will cascade. Then all sorts of things will start to happen. And you know, that's the path to perdition and an involuntary trip to the underworld.

Speaker 1:          01:15:26       When we meet again, I think I'll show you a little clip of Rogerian psychotherapy because a woman in the 19 fifties agreed to be filmed, which had a dramatic effect on her life by the way. But, um, it, it presented, provides a nice real world illustration of what Rogers is doing when he's trying to listen.
