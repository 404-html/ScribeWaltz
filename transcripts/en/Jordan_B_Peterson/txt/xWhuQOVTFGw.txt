Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       All right, well I'm talking today with Dr. James Lindsey, Dr Peter Boghossian, and Dr Helen pluck roads and they're all famous or infamous depending on your perspective as the authors of a series of hoax articles that were published in what purport to be academic journals in the last year following up work done by socal back. How long ago was that? Now it's gotta be like 25 years now. Right, right. So we've all assumed or you've all assumed that the situation hasn't improved. So the first thing I'm going to do, we're going to have an extended discussion about these articles and about the motivation for producing them and then the necessity for that, the morality of that at the aftermath and all of that in. The first thing I'm going to do is have each of you introduce yourself and then we'll launch right into a discussion of, let's call it the scandal. Dr. Lindsey.

Speaker 3:          00:01:19       Yeah. Good to be here. So I have a background in mathematics and physics. My Phds in math. I left academia in 2010 and had been studying, uh, mostly religious and moral philosophy and psychology since, and then got wrapped up in this idea. I kind of was the, I guess, epicenter of the project. I did all the submissions and managed all the emails and all of that. And then Peter and Ellen, uh, filled in all of my weaknesses. And so we spent, you know, an 18, about 18 months working on this a year, really 10 months writing papers. Then there was the getting ready to go public. So, um, that's kind of who I am and how I got into this. I just, uh, uh, lapsed mathematician who gives a lot of concern to how we produce knowledge and what academic standards are and should be. So what, why did you leave academia? I wish I could say that it was like this Prussian thing. I saw the writing on the wall that it was going mad and I wanted out, but really it was just a number of personal responsibilities and commitments that led me to not want to pursue, um, employment where I didn't know where I would be placed from one post doc to the next. It was family commitments primarily.

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       But you were still interested enough to continue with this project? Interested enough in the academic world? Yeah. I never really

Speaker 3:          00:02:48       need to stop researching or reading and thinking and coming up with new ideas. Uh, it's very difficult to do mathematics without some institutional backing. Uh, math is hard as some people have noticed. So I didn't have the resources necessary really to pursue mathematical research independently, but I found that I could dig into philosophy and I could dig into a psychology kind of on my own, not professionally of course, but, um, that's enough to get an idea of what I was, was looking at in a philosophical sense to answer questions that I was really deeply interested in. Mostly the question that drove me probably from about 2011 forward was, you know, what do people really mean? What are they talking about when they say the word God? And so I really got involved in talking about they're thinking about religion. That's what led me to religious and moral psychology, trying to understand why people, uh, believe things that they do and why they, why they manifest their beliefs in certain ways.

Speaker 3:          00:03:46       And ultimately because I was, you know, that kind of a guy, I just wanted to find out what I figure. I live in the southeast us, so really religious area. People talk to me about their belief in God all the time. I hear it constantly at different levels from the, you know, yeah, there's, I, I kind of believe level all the way to the borderline insane level of conviction to very implausible propositions level. And I wanted to understand, I know the people talking about ideas like God means something when they saved the term. It's something very, not just do they mean something. They need something very important to themselves. And I wanted to figure out from a perspective that didn't rely upon the religious, the theology or the religious mythology or narrative, what they were speaking to as articles within, in the material world. And so I became very interested in that and spent a number of years reading and writing about it.

Speaker 3:          00:04:45       And by the way, the kind of culture war, if you want to call it that progressed. It's seeing what was happening to people I was interested in. I'm Sam Harris for example, was, was certainly one of these people. You see these people get called racist or sexist for what seemed to be nothing. And you try to dig into it again with the interest in meaning of words, kept seeing these references back to these, you know, power dynamics and um, sociological definitions that that only see racism or sexism is structural entities that allow basically people of people to be considered racist or sexist just because of their identity by just by virtue of being, say, a white male, you could be racist and sexist inevitably are. That's exactly, exactly. So that's what led me to get curious about the grievance studies. Can. And ultimately, Peter, let's hear, let's hear from you and tell everybody who you are and what you're up to.

Speaker 4:          00:05:41       I'm currently teaching philosophy at Portland State University in the philosophy department and I am up to James Lindsey and I just finished a book how to have impossible conversations that will come out probably in 2019 decapo press

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       and I don't know what I'm up to now because I made be looking at a career change very soon. So, um, we go get into that later. But the university filed charges against me. They found me guilty of not seeking irb approval and that

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       investigation is ongoing for the falsifications. We better have quite a conversation as well about IRB approval. That's another rabbit hole we can punch down because that's another catastrophic catastrophe that the University of has inflicted upon itself over the last two decades. So that's something that's becoming increasingly politicized. So it's very difficult to understand how you could get irb approval for a satire

Speaker 5:          00:06:39       or why you might need it. Okay. Okay, good. Hello, let's hear from you. But I have a background in literature and early, late medieval, early modern studies. I'm interested in how women use the Christian narrative to, um, to get all 30 and autonomy for themselves, sort of 1300 to 1700 things. So I'm looking at how this change before and after the reformation, how the narratives changed. But I, um, I left at the end of my masters. I was intending to go back and do my phd in medieval manuscripts. Um, but it's just got, I keep going earlier and earlier because it is so difficult to get away from the ideology. I'm, I'm interested in medieval manuscripts, but not overwhelmingly. I want to look at social history, but it's so difficult to do that because there is a pressure now to do so anachronistically to read it through gender ideology of today.

Speaker 5:          00:07:48       So I have to accept that the reason I was going to do medieval manuscripts is because I can translate and transcribe and this is something objective that I can do. I can produce an edition of texts which aren't readily available and explain them. And that's the only real way that I'm able to look at religious writing by and about women, men and the objective way. And it isn't really I want to do. So I stepped away for a year and in that year I started writing about about postmodernism, about feminism, about liberalism and ideology. And then it just got to be so much to do with that. But I, I haven't gone back at all so involved in, in writing about what's going on right now. And so that is,

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       I see, well it's interesting because you, you talked about

Speaker 5:          00:08:43       your, your belief that women in the

Speaker 2:          00:08:48       mid stages of development of the Christian Church we're using, the idea is to actually liberate themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:08:54       And too, the examples from margery Kempe to Emilia Lania and we're looking at very different ways in which you know it within the Catholic narrative, for example, women would say, well God speaks directly to me. He is the patriarch. It gives me a certain or sovereignty to disagree with a patriarchal if I'm with my husband. And then later after the reformation, there was a slightly different emphasis in which women, you know, everyone can interpret the Bible and that includes women. So there was a different kind of authority there too. So that, that's generally been what I've been interested in, slightly different ways that women have approached biblical texts, biblical narratives and um, and, and yes, and use them to, to challenge sort of mainstream interpretations. And um, I make some, make some pretty good arguments. Well, I mean the Alanya certainly did not recant, mostly sweetened.

Speaker 3:          00:09:58       Okay. So why don't we start by why are you guys telling us what the genesis of this project was? Let's outline the project itself that the sequence of papers that you wrote and let's talk about the genesis of that as well. So take that one. It's really kind of kind of interesting. I don't know if your audience would know this, Jordan or not, but all three of us, you know, we're writing a bit within what might've been considered the new atheist vein and working within that. And then I was working on a book trying to answer my big kind of early 2010 his research question, what do people mean when they say, God? I was writing a book called that I eventually titled Everybody is wrong about God. And I, Peter called me one day while I was working on either the book itself or the research for it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:47       I don't recall the specifics at the time, but he called me one day and said, you know, dude, dude, I think I'm going crazy. I keep trying to tell people something that's as obvious as can be to me. And somebody has to believe I'm not crazy. Everybody thinks I'm nuts. Please tell me I'm not crazy. And so I said, you know, what is it? And he said, um, I look at the way people in gender studies use their scholarly can and the way they produce that, the way that they refer to it, the fact that it seems disconnected, uh, in a literal sense from what's going on in reality. And it feels like it's their Bible. It feels like it's a holy scripture for something like a religion. Am I going nuts? And as it turned out, the reason I started writing the book, everybody's wrong about God, was partly to answer my big research question, but it was also because I noticed that the community built up around new atheist activism, which called a Selfie.

Speaker 3:          00:11:44       Atheism community showed almost all of the symptoms of qualifying as a religion at least from like Durkheim's perspective and maybe even from some others. So I immediately latched onto what Pete said and I said, no, you're not crazy. I think you're probably right. I think you are absolutely right that the scholarly Canon in gender studies and so on is operating like of book of faith for something. But I don't know exactly what this is. And so we got curious about that scholarly cannon kind of from that point. It wasn't long after that that the infamous feminist glaciology paper came out, uh, where the, uh, few four or five researchers published a very well funded study showing or claiming to show that that glaciology is inherently sexist all the way back to its roots. Um, back to, you know, the intrepid explorers of mountains and polar regions.

Speaker 3:          00:12:44       And all this. So it is justified by being a big, tough guy in the 19th century or whatever. And that apparently somehow this masculinist bias hangs over. And so the answer to this is to put feminist art projects as part of place for science. And it just apologies as part of glacier science or else it's racist and sexist. And I, I mean I remember reading the paper lightly at the time and thinking there's no way this is real. And Peter and I had a phone call, we started looking at new peer review on the twitter at the same time. Oh, you should never look at that. Oh my God. So

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       we've, we've actually got two issues here. Then let's say no all of a sudden because yeah, there's a, there's the, there's the issue of what's going on in the social justice oriented academic disciplines and then there's a deeper issue of how people view the world individually and collectively. Yes. Through the lens of a belief system and the probability that that belief system will take on something approximating the trappings of a religious movement. Yes. So that's a deeper question. I mean, one of the things that I discussed continually with Sam Harris when we have our series of debates was the question of the inescapable realty of something approximating a religious framework to orient people in relationship to action in the world. Cause I like, I happen to believe that a framework like that is inescapable. The question is not whether you're going to have one, it's which one you're going to have and what is it going to be rooted in. And I mean, one of the things I think that both meet you and Dostoyevsky warn people about in the late 19th century was that, um, what, what, this isn't a quote from either of them, but it's something approximating someone else whose name I don't remember. Um, he who believes in nothing will end up believing in anything. And there's something, there's something in that that's extraordinarily deep as far as I'm concerned. All right, so you were interested in religious phenomenology and then you guys started to see that, um, as

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       far as you were concerned, a variety of different causes. I academic or academic movements were taking on the trappings of a religious, they were starting to look religious in their approach and in their application of their beliefs right on the, on the social justice end of it. Right. Community for example, was definitely engaging in of course they had kind of their uh, their unique vocabulary that they speak to one another end and identify one another by, uh, which is kind of like an ecclesiastical vocabulary, but if social justice and then they were definitely involved, what, what they call political correctness is in practice, virtually identical to what you see with people crying. Blasphemy. Um, so these parallels started to stick out at the same time, the way that we started looking at the real peer review twitter account and the way that they seem to be producing their knowledge that they could then refer to virtually replicates special revelation, the, they came up with their ideas, they believe that they came from some morally backed source of, uh, of goodness and then put them forth.

Speaker 3:          00:16:07       And then were they were, were morally vetted and given an epistemological status they didn't deserve. As a result can, why do you think the sources, the sources at the time I had no idea, but now after having done the project, I think the source is actually what I've come to call a postmodern mythology. That our social reality is conditioned upon use of language and representation and it's all done in service to power dynamics that underlie how society works. Those power dynamics are trapped up in identity and um, mediated primarily through language in, in media identified the sources of that. And not only me obviously, but I've identified the sources of that beliefs with the French postmodernist movement. Fundamentally, other people trust some of it back farther to what's essentially something approximating a Marxist doctrine, which is the doctrine of which is the doctrine of power relations, I would say. Sure. We'll have any criticisms or further comments on that. Let's call it genealogy genealogy or Lynn or Helen. Helen. Helen. Good.

Speaker 5:          00:17:14       Yeah, no, I, I largely agree with the idea that we had, uh, uh, quite a profound epistemic shift in the late sixties with the rise of the postmodernists. I disagree with people who crying kind of relate this closely to Marxism. I, I think it's clear that they, they have a common ancestor and that they have certain ideas in common. But if we conflate Marxism and postmodernism too close to the, on more than those yeah. That, that sort of oppressor and oppressed group, that surge of them. Um, false consciousness, these sort of key ideas which really worth floating around at the same time and they've come up in the same place. If we conflate those two closely and we are not looking at the really profound differences in epidemiology in which Marxism was really trying to continue and modernist project, it was totalitarian, it was objective, this most of the, and it went sort of in a straight line and the, if there was a word for the extremes of Marxism, it, this totalitarianism, if there's a word for the extremes of postmodernism, its disintegration. It's fragmentation. So we're looking now at something very different, something very intangible that is coming in and, and it's saying we cannot access and objective truth. Everything is created in discourses, empowers us in systems of power and privilege.

Speaker 2:          00:18:40       So why in the world is power privilege then like, I mean it still seems that the postmodernists are willing to assume that the pursuit of power is, first of all, it's obvious that everyone's pursuing it, but it's also okay for those who don't have it to pursue it. So it's not as if they've abandoned the idea as far as I can tell of a, of a linear narrative towards some end, the end seems to me to be power. And so why is that justifiable from the postmodern perspective, given that linear movement and Mehta narratives aren't justifiable

Speaker 5:          00:19:17       because of the change that happened in the late eighties so when socal for example, he, he did his hopes. What he was looking at was this collect sort of pure postmodernism. This I'm very sort of intangible idea that an objective reality context is that we can't grasp anything, that everything is a construct. But what happened in the 80s gradually was that this just after prolific amounts of writing, it just kind of fizzled because once you disintegrated and dismantled absolutely everything and it's all in a mess on the floor, you have got no where to go with this. So we started seeing then the rising materialist feminism, first of all, um, and then within sort of critical race approaches, intersectionality in queer theory in post-colonialism particularly, we started seeing a change towards, okay, so everything is a cultural construct, but we can't address anything if we don't accept that a certain group of people in a certain place at a certain time experience certain things. So what we're looking at now is an objective reality that oppression and systems of power exist. But hmm,

Speaker 2:          00:20:29       everything else is socially constructed. So the fundamental power,

Speaker 5:          00:20:35       but that construct has power. Yes, it is objective. It true that power is benefiting straight white men and disadvantages women of color, trans women, et Cetera. So this, this was the change that happened then. So now it's politically actionable. And this, I mean, it couldn't Kimberle crenshaw put this most explicitly when she said it's politics applied to postmodern theory.

Speaker 2:          00:20:56       Okay, so we want to get this straight because it's very, very important. So you just, you distinguish the postmodern movement from the Marxist movement because the Marxism Marxists, we're still moving in a single direction. And you considered that still a part of the modernist project, you acquainted Marxism and postmodernism in so far as they both adult, let's say an oppressor, oppression, oppression, narrative. Yes. Although many other things do to, and often that that's quite warranted. I mean the, the American revolution for example, was an oppressor, oppressed revelations. There was no doubt, there's no doubt that power and power differentials exists. The issue is not, there are other realities that might be considered truly yes wallet and whether it's reasonable to reduce everything to a single dimension of motivation. So the postmodern project collapses into its own nihilism and something emerges out of the ashes. And that's the assumption that a transcendent reality does in fact exist, but they only defining feature of that transcendent reality is the existence of power in the existence of power differential. And that's associated with identity. But then then the question becomes, there's, there's a question that goes underneath that even, which is, well, why is it, why is it that that is accepted as the fundamental reality? Because there's no rationale for that. And postmodernism itself, in fact, auditors should criticize them.

Speaker 5:          00:22:29       Did they, do they do it very much? And then this is the argument that goes on repeatedly with the old style postmodernist saying this isn't postmodernism. And so are we. We've tended to call it applied postmodernism, John Nurse to build it, the poem wage cluster because it's just a set of ideas about identity, about power, about privilege, about language, the importance of language and um, and, and hierarchies and things which have come from postmodernism, which have got politicized. And then within activism have got condensed into kind of user friendly chunks and further bastardized. So we can't, we can't take this away from postmodernism. It didn't come from anywhere else. But neither is it the, the, the pure sort of deconstructive or poststructuralist or any of that at that whole sort of massive range of theory that that existed from the late sixties into the mid eighties that that died. It sits, gone. It's fragmented itself as it was always bound to do.

Speaker 2:          00:23:34       So to drive to your question about why or how they justified this change, um, I'll just say we called this,

Speaker 5:          00:23:44       this set of disciplines

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       or approaches, grievance studies for a reason. It's about grievances. It's the politics of grievance. So they feel aggrieved, therefore they feel justified in trying to disrupt power. They see that exists and declined power for themselves. It's social revenge. That's what they're, that's what they're animus is. That's their moral justification for, for continuing to fragment and to chase. The very thing they say is, you know, the great corruptor of man, which has power.

Speaker 2:          00:24:17       Okay, so it doesn't, so it doesn't really matter if this is true, and I do, I have some sympathy with that claim. It doesn't matter that there are philosophical incoherencies within the structure, within the intellectual structure at all. What matters is that there's an animus and a motive, and the motive is fundamentally something approximating revenge. Why? Why would you say, look, why would you say revenge and not justice? Like, and, and this, this goes to another issue, which is all the Asley, all three of you oppose this movement. And we've already decided in this discussion that it's something like the revenge of the mar marginalized, but the marginalized could well object. Well, this isn't revenge. You only see it that way because you're part of the privileged power group and it's actually a search or a search for, it's a search. It's genuine search for justice, social justice orientated that that's what we have to remember.

Speaker 2:          00:25:14       This is speaking on behalf of women and racial and sexual minorities. Most members of every group did, do not ascribe to it. They're, they're politically diverse. So it's, um, that's a good point. That's a good point. So that's one of the reasons that, that the claim for the pursuit of justice is invalidated. It's that there's no evidence whatsoever that the activist types who dominate these disciplines are valid representatives of the communities that they purport to Stanford. In fact, if you surveyed the communities themselves in any reasonable manner, then the communities indicate their lack of agreement with, with this way of looking at the world.

Speaker 3:          00:25:54       Yeah. Yes, of course. There is also the, the, the complicating element that nearly always appears that you do have kernels of truth on both sides of that discussion. There are legitimate questions of justice that are being tied up into this. And then there are legitimate reasons to see it as being motivated primarily by something approximating revenge or grievance or reparations or something like that. And they get intertwined. And as you were mentioning with anytime you're working with postmodern epistemologies, there's no reason to expect consistency. They reject consistency as, as, as a bug in the system. Uh, they're unrepentant that unrepentant about being inconsistent.

Speaker 2:          00:26:35       That's no small point. And, and I think people watching that, that point needs to be punched hole. So Jim, could you speak to a little about that? Well, yeah, it's um, the, the idea that you would be consistent is

Speaker 3:          00:26:51       one of the ideas that would be caught up in the western philosophical tradition, as they would phrase it. It's caught up in the exact tradition that was bred of white and male power. And so that needs to be disrupted because that power inherently from the perspective of this Worldview, that power inherently corrupt, but more importantly in inherently always asked to preserve and maintain and legitimize itself. So the demand for consistency becomes itself an act of oppression against people.

Speaker 2:          00:27:21       Exactly. That all seems reasonable to me. So, so look, so, so here's a peculiar thing and it's an observation of something approximating, let's say it's Friday, a notion of projection. The people who are pushing this viewpoint, art, legitimate representatives of their communities in any real sense of the matter. And they push a particular viewpoint that has very little academic credibility as far as I'm concerned. And, and is primarily concerned with political activism and with the obtaining or the justification of obtaining power. Now we could assume that this is being done on behalf of the people who are putting forward the doctrine. And so to me, see, I've come to understand that part of the reason that people claim to their belief systems is because they have, the reason they have the moral authority to occupy the hierarchical position that society has granted them is because they're regarded as experts in a, in a belief structure.

Speaker 2:          00:28:25       And if the year that their claim to that expertise is questioned in their moral justification for occupying their position is eradicate it and it's their position gives them purpose in life and that protects them from uncertainty and anxiety. It's not the belief structure itself. You see it's for factor there experts in the belief system and that justifies their position in the hierarchy. So they put forward this claim to continue justifying the fact that they occupied very perversely. And this is the fruit of the projection is so very perversely, the very positions of power whose existence a credit sucks. This would be a university professor types in particular that seems reasonable to you or, or is there something wrong with that?

Speaker 3:          00:29:09       Oh, the courts actually with what I've drawn from reading John Height for example, who talks about psychosocial, a psycho social evaluation and the way that human beings do that with one another. How we identify where we stand in our social and moral hierarchies, uh, and how we, where we position ourselves and others each other in relation to one another. And that one of those three dimensions he named divinity. And so that would be the part you're speaking to. So we gain, we gained status in the hierarchy through our closeness of kin. So if you and I are friends, you rank me higher than I probably deserve because that's how humans do. And we gain status by reputation and that's why we care what Michael Jordan thinks about politics. And we gain status by, um, our moral standing, which is what John Height called divinity. And of course he explored it primarily in the happiness hypothesis with regard to his trips, I think the India and seeing a traditional religion and then comparing that directly against the so called weird societies in Western democracies.

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       And, uh, I think that what we're actually seeing in a lot of these cases as we're seeing partly at least people are acting out. Um, what, what often gets conflated with religion in fact is that they're acting out the need to fulfill or participate in that third dimension of psychosocial evaluation. Although in secular societies we throw out the, the explicit religious structure for it and we have to find it in other ways. So that's what you're actually talking about. They, they occupy a Mo, a moral expertise, not more likes for TC gives them standing within the prevailing moral and Social Maloo. And then that defines their place in the community as in both in terms of prestige and in terms of hierarchy

Speaker 2:          00:30:53       standard. They're basically acting out precisely what they're accusing all other disciplines of doing control, irony and the differences to see. The thing is, the difference as far as I'm concerned, is that if you look at a discipline like engineering, which I think is perhaps as close to the polar opposite of this, this might be managed. One of the things that engineers do is look at the world in a certain way. But another thing they do is build bridges. Exactly right. That's right. There's an objective real world, uh, direction to their, to their philosophizing and their beliefs that results in something of tangible and university recognize benefit to the community at March and something that can fail. Yes. Right, right, right. Also, that's very important. Okay. Now, okay, next issue. So now the first issue, first of the next two issues saying is why is it that you three found herself in a position where you decided to take this on as a critical project and why is it that so few other academics are doing so I don't have good answers for why so few academics are doing so. Cause I don't want to just blatantly call people cowards that I don't know. But you don't get treated well for fighting. Let's dig into that a bit. Okay. Because I think, I think cowardice is one or fear. And let's, let's start here. Let's call it fear. And let's also note that the fear is well justified, very justice. Yeah, that's correct. Right. Well Peter, you're in a great position to speak to that because look what's happening to you.

Speaker 4:          00:32:29       Yeah, so I don't know if you want to go down the path and what's happened to me yet, but I, I think you're right. Our mutual friend, Bret Weinstein said to me that academia where we had a conversation about academia self selecting for cowardice, and I think it's a process that people go through it before they have tenure, where they're afraid to buck the system, afraid to challenge ideas. They're afraid to question because who they won't get tenure and then once they do get tenure, then they won't make you a bit more climate. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:32:57       That's the same thing happens in corporations at the middle manager level. Like it's not a disease that is endemic to academia.

Speaker 4:          00:33:03       No, no, it's not. But it's one variable in a suite of variables that we have to take a look at. The other one is the culture in which the cultural milieu that Jim spoke about in which people are terrified to be called sexist, racist, bigot. So they don't challenge those. I'm even hesitant to say the things that don't challenge, but I'll say it like race and Iq or trans issues, trans bathroom issues. If you teach an ethics class, people won't really dig into those issues in a substantive way. But I think that there are many factors, but not just one, but it's just showing that people will come up to Jim and myself and I haven't spoken explicitly to Helen about this and they'll thank me. Yup. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, great. Can you do that publicly? No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          00:33:48       The same thing happened to me. I think we should talk about what's happening to you because we talk about fear. We can talk about cowardice, we can talk about justifiable cause there's no, there's no pleasure in being isolated and moms and undermine and fired. Right. So the apprehension of that is not merely coward, it's, it's, it's, it's realistic. And I'm not underestimating the potential role, the additional role of cowardice. But then there's another issue too here and I'd be thinking about, it's like, to me, many of these postmodern activist propositions are so fundamentally absurd and so academically weak that most serious social scientists and pretty much all serious stem types, the stem researchers have just ignored them. They thought they were beneath contempt and right seriously mean that because I look at an idea, you know, a brilliant postmodern activist idea like intersectionality where like patriarchy theory or like white privilege, all you have to do is spend an hour thinking through those things critically and you realize that there's out solutely nothing whatsoever to the methodologically or conceptually

Speaker 5:          00:35:03       as jen was saying, you know that that can be a kernel of Chris in things. But when they are theoretically built, I mean obviously there, there, there, there are societies in which white people are regarded more positively on average, but this is something that can be measured in three which can be looked at, which can be talked about. And we don't actually have that way. We have imaginary knapsacks and talk of complicity and I'm an epistemological environments in which white people literally can't understand what's going on. So we it, we get a big mess

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       and it's, it's, there's a kernel of truth in that and so that gives them the opportunity to kind of retreat to this sensible space where they'll say, but there is racism and that there is sexism. Well, yes of course there is. But what you're doing here with these theoretical concepts is, is not looking realistically and reasonably at that adoption. Right? It's like, okay well racism is a problem in sexism is a problem we'll say. And any form of discrimination that isn't associated with the hypothetical outcome of the project is a problem. But there are methods that everyone who's a decent social scientist knows to measure those and to estimate the proportion of the variance in the outcome problem that those issues are accounting for. And the postmodern and activist types to absolutely none of that.

Speaker 4:          00:36:30       Yeah. I mean why would they? Because they don't care about their agenda driven in their truth oriented. So there's going to be no point to even think like that.

Speaker 2:          00:36:41       Well they also can't, they don't have the methods training. Exactly. So, so that also provides additional impetus for being motivated to criticize those that do because it's a lot easier than say, seeing the reality and the consequences of your own ignorance. Let's talk about what's happening to you because I want to know about the cost that you're buried for this and then we'll go back to why you guys decided to do what you did.

Speaker 4:          00:37:04       So psu, like many college campuses has become an ideological community and I've demonstrated that I don't fit that mold and I suspect that they're going to go to great lengths to get rid of me. So what's happened is I've been found guilty of Nazi he and Irb approval. And

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       can you tell the viewers what that means and and provide some background detail.

Speaker 4:          00:37:27       Okay. Okay. So our be approval is there's a, it's to call the IRB Institutional Review Board. And whenever you do a, an experiment on human subjects, human beings or animals, by the way, you need to go through the irb and you need to get permission and you detail exactly what it is that you're going to do. And they say to you, well, you have to change this. You have to do this, don't do this, etc. And then they give you permission.

Speaker 2:          00:37:56       Okay. These systems, just a little more background, these systems were originally set up fundamentally to monitor relatively or potentially dangerous medical experimentation, but they've expanded their per view so that now it's impossible for anybody who's an academic in any institution to even interview people without seeking permission from a very vast and rigid bureaucratic structure that's easily politicized.

Speaker 4:          00:38:23       Yeah. They came out of, and they do exist for good reasons. The Nuremberg trials may lay, et Cetera, et cetera. And people were in that envelope has, has, uh, the number of experiments or the number of things are calling, are under that umbrella continues to increase. We can talk about the ethics of the RV more generally, but in our case are particularly mind that the IRB has no, Jim and James and Helen don't fall under the off season pses rv so they can't be sanctioned. I however, allegedly can can be sanctioned, so I'd been found guilty on that first charge, which,

Speaker 2:          00:38:59       well now look, let's, let's tell everybody what is published. A sequence of papers, how many papers in journals is it?

Speaker 3:          00:39:08       We wrote 27 of them were accepted and four were published on the cusp of publication, for example.

Speaker 2:          00:39:16       Okay, let's get it straight here. These are satirical publications that were published in hypothetically serious academic journals and now Peter, you're being gone after for not seeking institutional review board permission to publish studies that didn't exist.

Speaker 4:          00:39:34       Yeah, two, two things. That's the first thing I'd been found guilty of that and it's escalated to the provost and the president of the university and I believe that the provost is a former gender studies scholar and I'll just, I'll let that sit there. I do, I do. I can't pronounce the president's name to be blunt with you. And the provost is new provost. I'm not avoiding the question. I just don't,

Speaker 2:          00:39:58       that's fine. We can always put that in the description of the video. So, so what are you guilty of exactly? Because these studies didn't exist. You didn't undertake research on any human subjects.

Speaker 3:          00:40:09       They've decided that the journal editors and peer reviewers are the human subjects that we were studying. So not the studies themselves, but go up one level of Metta to the fact that we were studying the culture of um, Journal, Journal Review and publication. So the editors who are not anonymous and then the anonymous peer reviewers are considered to be the human subjects of our,

Speaker 2:          00:40:33       that's supposed to be, I suppose. I see. So that's supposed to be distinguishable from you thinking and writing about the things that you encounter in your own life, for example, which is also what now it's supposed to be subject to irb approval.

Speaker 4:          00:40:46       So, so okay. So there's a lot of moving parts to this. So we need to break it down. I wonder, I want to continue with the, excuse me, guilty of not seeking irb approval. That can include turn up to termination from my current position. And uh, I just want to speak to that before I talk about the data fabrication charges. So I don't agree with the decision, but I definitely understand the pressures that they have on them to do something. Who knows what's happening.

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       Pressures from a hope. These activist types are a very tiny proportion of the population. So, and when we're talking about pressure, what exactly do we mean?

Speaker 4:          00:41:27       Well, there was an anonymous hid piece by 12 or 11 of my colleagues published in the student newspaper, the Portland Vanguard, and they may be a small representation. I, it's unclear to me in academia, I don't think there are a small proportion of the pie. They are a large and I think that they wield institutionalized power and have weaponized things like title line against people they don't like. Um, so there's that. But I do want to say, I don't really know what's happening behind the scenes. I, my guess is these, this group is extraordinarily vocal, but what they're faced with now is a decision for what kind of university they want to be. Is it one that uses power to support freedom of inquiry and pursuit of the truth or do they want to protect social justice at all costs? And the fabrication of data thing is interesting because that's an ongoing, it's currently ongoing investigation. And again, those are very, very serious charges.

Speaker 2:          00:42:26       Let's look at it here too. There was a very big difference. Let's get this very clear between a self admitted satire, which had historical precedent and which has ethical justification, even if you don't agree with the justification data fabrication data fabrication occurs when you put Devin and you claim that it's truthful representation of a real world situation. Yeah. Obviously that's distinct from satire and comedy. Everyone understands that distinction.

Speaker 4:          00:42:56       Well, the guy, the idea is that those rules were put in there for very good reasons and that is people wouldn't use that to advance their careers, which, uh, and they wanted to hide the results so they don't, didn't want anybody to see what it was. So the problem with that is that it would, as socal wrote, that it would contaminate the, uh, research lines in perpetuity. So what the success of our project dependent upon it being revealed so that no longer applies and the idea that we would somehow, not only am I not benefited from this, but this is coming a tremendous cost to me. So it's, in my opinion, it is, uh, a grow task abuse of what it means to fabricate data. And, uh, I mean it means be interesting to see. It'll be interesting to see what happens and be in as you see when it goes to court.

Speaker 2:          00:43:52       Okay. And so, so yeah, tell me about the proceedings when it goes to court. What kind of card is it going to?

Speaker 4:          00:44:00       I don't know. I mean, first let me even take a step back from there. So if you look at the timeline of events when this occurred, and I don't have that off the top of my head, but, uh, the, the, the, when I was falling guilty from the Irb, it's been a series of, uh, of Nazi need, irb approval. There was a series of a time when the university president could just end this just like that. You can say, well, we're going to put a, a letter of reprimand in Europe. Uh, we're going to make it and it will

Speaker 3:          00:44:37       guilty of who found you guilty. That was the IRB was December 14th. I see. So the IRB is policing its own it's own policies here. Yeah. So that was for the irb charge, the open data falsification charges open and still being investigated. Uh, and that actually started I think like two or three days after we went public. He got an email and said, you've been summoned to a meeting. And we were all in Portland together at the time in October. The IRB, which purports to be an ethics committee, doesn't have any problem with the ethics of policing themselves. You might want to point that out very strongly because they're not in a position to be policing accordance with their own policies. Conflict of interest. Clearly there's something appalling about that. And it's not surprising because there's plenty of hauling about the institutional review boards.

Speaker 4:          00:45:32       Guilty, guilty. It's been escalated to the president. And again, the president could just decide just like that, you know, we're just going to put a letter in his file of reprimand and we're going to move on. And I think that the whole problem would be, uh, ended, except my guess is that there are a lot of people crying for vengeance right now against me.

Speaker 3:          00:45:53       Right? So they want to hang you out to dry as an object lesson to people who would dare to do the things that you three have done.

Speaker 4:          00:45:59       Because I'm a heretic and I'm a blast femur and I have attack their cannons and there has to be some price that's paid for this. That's my guests when they're thinking. And then the fabrication of data charge, again, that's a very serious charge of okay data and those rules are put in, put in place for a reason. I don't think a court would find, I mean it would be interesting to see when this goes to quarter or if it does even go to court. The idea that this was fabricated either for personal gain or that would have to not be revealed at some time and that the future lines of literature would be contaminated and polluted. It's just, it's just not true and I think that,

Speaker 3:          00:46:41       well also a clear, it's a career ended in charge, so that's partly why it's being brought against you, right? Data fabrication, there isn't anything, well, there isn't any same thing worse within the domain of science, then you can do that. You can do that. That that's really unfortunate and preposterous because the data fabrication occurred intentionally in the sense that we wanted to find out if they could detect, because we suspected from the very beginning as we were kind of discussing earlier, that these people who largely work in the humanities are not equipped to do social science, but that's ultimately what they're basically doing. And so we wanted to see if they could detect utterly ridiculous data or data that were clearly cherry picked or data or conclusions I should say, that were drawn from data that aren't warranted. And so we wrote papers that included, in this case, for example, a dog park paper, just transparently ridiculous data.

Speaker 3:          00:47:34       And in fact, the first draft of that paper, even we knew the data were so bad that they were probably going to ask to see it. We thought that's the end of the road, the papers then. So we'll talk about the dog park paper. Why don't you go through the papers that have been published just briefly and tell us why they're transparently ridiculous because that's also tension, right? Yeah. Yeah. The dog park paper, um, was the first one we had accepted in February. And it chronicles a, it's a feminist scholar putatively that's chronicling dog rape culture by examining dog humping in Portland dog parks. And, uh, then draws conclusions from that using black feminist criminology as a tool to conclude that it would be appropriate to train men as we train dogs if only it were politically feasible. So we have to come up with a metaphorical equivalent.

Speaker 3:          00:48:33       And that concludes that oppression of dogs based on perceived gender is real. And the reason that that was allegedly concluded was we claimed that, um, humans intervened in, broke up a gay dog rate much more frequently in vigorously, then they broke up straight dog rate. And the paper, I mean it's already a bit weird about these things. The paper, the paper included, for instance, the detail that the scholar sat in the dog park for a thousand hours over the course of a year, but never in the heavy rain and observed, uh, and then examined personally closely examined the genitals of just short of 10,000 dogs, which if you've been to a dog park, you've probably realized the same people bring their dogs almost every day. It's, there's not 10,000 dogs in any dog park in a year, but never mind to develop a reputation for looking at dogs genitals.

Speaker 3:          00:49:34       Yeah, I think so. And then immediately turning to ask their owners, excuse me sir, could you tell me your sexual orientation? Because that's what the paper says. Wait, 10,000 dogs, Jen Genitals, a 10,000 dogs and then interrogated their owners as to their sexual orientations. It includes details that are irrelevant, like weather dogs use the bathroom and the other dogs are in the food bowl. The water bowl, it talks about, you know, the way people would break up dog fights, like doing jumping jacks and singing. We thought this data was so absurd that we put in the first draft, which the journal saw align that said that we took the data and put it in a recycle bin so that they couldn't possibly ask us to produce it because we thought, oh man, if they asked for this data, which is so stupid, it's over. So we said that we recycled the data, which has already its own research, ms practice and no problem.

Speaker 3:          00:50:29       Write it up. Okay. I can't believe we're having this conversation and listen, the more we talk about this, the more ridiculous it gets. Okay, so let's go on to another paper that's just on unbearable. But there was the paper where we argued that if straight white straight man, I'm sorry, it doesn't matter what their racist, if straight men were to ainslie penetrate themselves with sex toys, they'd become less transphobic and more feminist. Um, which apparently got picked up the slack. They may not want to have that conversation, but this data was this, this conclusion, which was called a truly marvelous paper and an important contribution to knowledge by one of its reviewers. Uh, this paper was published, this paper was based on interviews with 13 men, only eight of whom were straight. And of course it was all interview data and it was just people saying the most ridiculous things about their experience of sticking things in their own butts and then their feelings about feminism and a concern for rape culture and their attitudes about trans people and so on, including one so-called social conservative who was quoted saying he didn't want to take part in some stupid liberal study about sticking things up as, but I mean, it's almost impossible to have looked at this and not thought, you know, something's going on here.

Speaker 3:          00:51:55       But instead they thought, truly marvelous paper knowledge. It's that, that's a second paper. A third paper, um, was an ethnography allegedly of a 70 some odd year old man who went to hooters with his Brazilian Jujitsu class after workouts and sat there and basically just womanized for hours upon hours recorded something like 10,000 hours or sorry, 10,000 minutes of conversation at the table, which could all be summarized. And this was an example of clear cherry picking of data. The only features of the conversation that were relevant were the way that the guys hit on the surfers are talked about the servers, you know, various body parts or most importantly how much they enjoyed the fact that hooters provides them a place that they can go and tell young, attractive women what to do in a situation in which they are contractually obligated to fulfill those, those orders.

Speaker 3:          00:52:51       Like literally double entendre on the work order. Like please, I would like some beer that's an order. So, um, that was an example of clear cherry picking and of course deriving ridiculous conclusions. Uh, did you guys know while you were doing this that you are going to get yourself in like a boatload of trouble? I mean, and now I see when you're talking about it, you laugh. And so you still got a sense of humor, which is quite a remarkable thing. You, you did this for a long time and like, yeah, it's hard to believe actually that you did manage, do it. I have some, some moments especially where, uh, I mean we were always aware that there would be a backlash and then when I started actually signing the transfer of copyright, the documents to have the papers actually published, I started to feel a little like, you know, we might really get in some trouble for this, but at this point we're kind of in deep and uh, might as well carry on and try to finish the experiment we had intended to, to try to write papers for 12 months and then spend six to eight months kind of, you know, following up.

Speaker 3:          00:53:55       The academic publishing process is slow. They do the review, you get it back a couple months later, you have to do edits. It takes maybe another month or two before they accept or whatever. Then publication may be another couple of months later. So it all, it's slow. So we wanted to do a lot, you know, six, eight months after 12 months of writing and that was the intended duration that we should be wrapping up the project now if we didn't get busted. But about late summer, the dog park paper got picked up, um, by some journalists and the real peer review and got made fun of it and we realized we were probably not going to make it to the end of our intended at year and a half ish time span. So we ended up writing for 10 total months, which is a bit of time and

Speaker 4:          00:54:38       still under review, which was really ashamed because I'm fairly sure, but I do want to speak to that Jordan because somebody had to do this.

Speaker 3:          00:54:47       Yeah. Why?

Speaker 4:          00:54:52       Because the ideology, because these professors are looking at their classrooms as an ideology mill and they're attempting to indoctrinate people into things about reality that have nothing to do with reality. They've placed an agenda ahead of the truth and it's corroding our institutions in it's eroding trust in those universities and institutions. And you identified the problem. Many people identified the problem, but something had to be done about it beyond identification and calling these people out. We needed to show that needs to de legitimize these cannons because there the way that they were coming to knowledges, just epistemologically to to say it's not rigorous as chow is, is charitable.

Speaker 3:          00:55:41       So they're kind of a few pieces to that. Right. So you mentioned a little bit earlier, we touched upon, um, is now familiar with the idea that racism and sexism don't seem to mean the same thing they meant 10 years ago you used to be able to say racist and sexist and amend discrimination based on race or sex. And it could go in any direction. But now it's got this power, dynamic, privileged plus power stuff. Everybody's talking about privilege. So that's everywhere. But if that's one dimension and it's impossible to avoid that, the sociological or grievance studies definitions for concepts are, are everywhere. But there are also two other pieces of evidence. One that we saw before we started that would be a paper that was done by Charlotte, a stern who, how insular gender studies is. How they literally took the years since Steven pinker published the blank slate 2003 until 2015 or 16 she looked at a bunch of papers, got us a sample of those papers and determined whether or not they incorporated or ignored the, uh, information that pinker had shared as a, as a, as a test and found that there was an overwhelming amount of just putting the blinkers on and pretending that biology still doesn't exist and that human nature is totally social.

Speaker 3:          00:56:56       Part of that's not a pretense either. Is that a pretense here? I mean, the reason it's not a pretense is because as far as I can tell, the people who are in these disciplines, no, absolutely nothing whatsoever about biology, biology. The more you don't want to know, that you need to know because it's a daunting task.

Speaker 4:          00:57:21       Yeah. I want to speak to that for a moment. If I may. So at my university, a course offered on the philosophy of race, and it would seem to me that a minimum qualification one would need to teach that is that one would have to have some kind of degree in evolutionary biology. But that does not seem to be the case. And I think, again, we're seeing consistently, you know, race is such an explosive, explosive topic, but when you start with the idea that you have the truth and then you work backward and Cherry pick the literature, and in this case it's extraordinarily easy because you just go to these, the journals and the canons of literature and then you start teaching them. So what happens then is the kind of the self fulfillment of the postmodern condition is that they then manufacturer pieces of information that people take as knowledge. We see that happening in our institutions now and it's, nobody's calling them out on it. So it's again, I say that because it speaks to your point of why didn't we do this? Because the public trust in these institutions as being eroded and we're teaching our kids things that are just not true. They're just totally untethered to reality. Even though some of these people may be very well meaning

Speaker 3:          00:58:38       and there's always a citation and we learned, there's always a cycle with the citation. You want to find something that says anything ridiculous about sex, toys and anal taking care of, there's questions, power dynamics using that already. There's always this like that that maybe is the, is the important thing to sort of realize it about what we did. I mean, all of that ridiculous stuff that, that Jim was saying earlier, we were able to say that because there was already something out there which led to it or set it itself. And so if you're actually looking at what our project is, something that's very important is our references because to me, some of it really, yeah, it's,

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       there's this humorous, it's a very humorous element in it, but on a deeper level, what it is, is just gathering so much of this nonsense together, citing it, putting it in there and then kind of making it do whatever it, whatever we wanted it to do that that was, was the project. Um, and it's your point is that you have to embed yourself tire within a preexistent literature or it couldn't float and like they really, I mean a lot of the, some of the academics have said, well we haven't been fooled because we still stand by the papers. What you wrote was reasonable because they are indistinguishable and that really was kind of the point we wanted to have. We, we've ended up with a really good resource for anyone who wants to know what is out there. They can look at our references, they can look at the arguments that they enabled us to make.

Speaker 2:          01:00:20       They can look at how the reviewers, what they rejected us for, what they accepted us for, what they pushed us to do. There's a very clear pattern, but because it is so complicated with so few people have taken the time it would take to read all of our papers to read all of the comments to follow up our rem at references. It's not always clear that what we're doing is putting it right in the Canon. That is why this has to do with the motivation of other academics. Not to be bothered with this. The stuff that I'm most familiar with is that about 80% of humanities papers get cited zero times and the problem is that even to go after very bad ideas in an academically rigorous way is actually an extraordinarily daunting task and it might be daunting in direct proportion to the, to the appalling this of the ideas.

Speaker 2:          01:01:14       So for example, if you're creating a very bad undergraduate essay, it's way more difficult to grade a d paper than it is to grade a b d paper has so many errors in it. You don't even know where to start, right? The words are wrong, the sentences are wrong, the sentences aren't organized in the paragraphs. The paragraphs are chaotic and disjointed and the whole thing makes no sense and you actually have to do, there isn't a level of criticism that can't be applied to a very bad paper and so it's an absolutely exhausting intellectually apart from the danger that it poses personally before we assume that it's mirror lack of character on the part of our fellow academics that is stopping them from taking a stand against such things. Although I do buy the sort of entrenched power, this idea that emerges as perhaps an inevitable consequence of participating in a structured hierarchy.

Speaker 2:          01:02:14       It's there are, there are many more reasons why this is forged, including the inappropriate, what would you call it, subsidization of these viewpoints for the last 50 years. Yeah, yeah. I think that's right. It's really, really painstaking to pour through these papers. And as a, as a person, you know, with a commitment to science and a background in science, it wasn't just even painstaking. I actually went into some pretty dark places, psychological places. I remember reading the, so I mentioned reading the glaciology paper earlier, the feminists physiology, but I didn't read it in depth when we first found it. But when we started to do this project, I wanted to emulate it and write one about feminists astronomy.

Speaker 2:          01:02:56       And I read the thing in tremendous depth and with great care, taking notes all the way through and you know, preparing so I could could write effect similarly. And I shut down. I mean, I just almost locked myself in a room by myself for three days in a dark depression that quoting the same thing how to be when I was writing 12 rules for life, I wrote a chapter called don't bother children when they're skateboarding and it's about the discouragement, let's say of primarily of young men as a direct consequence of this. The kind of rhetoric that we're discussing and like that made me unbearable for my family for about three months because the more I studied it, the more it has a really fragmented and chaotic effect going on. You psychologically, and I've also seen this manifested in my students, you know who undergo this kind of act of this indoctrination. It's, it's such a, it's such a corrosive and cynical view of the world that all we're, we're all in it in our groups and then all the groups are fighting one another for power and that that's the fundamental transcendent reality. It's just,

Speaker 4:          01:04:12       yeah. Now imagine, imagine the sort of person who looks at that as an epistomological and moral virtue and who teaches that to their students, who attempts to indoctrinate their students into these, not even, they don't even arrive. So level of being false in terms of these morally dangerous ideas. And then they think that they're better people as a result. And then they think that if somebody calls them out on it, they're evil.

Speaker 2:          01:04:39       Okay, so let's look and look at this too. So when high he, Ted Lukey Nofx wrote the cognitive, the American mind, one point they pointed out as the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association should have that all of the safe space and doctrines and trigger warning doctrines and, and, and that sort of thing. Um, and the speech codes for example, that are increasingly forbidding, even sarcasm are exactly the opposite of the approach that you would take if you were a trained psychologist trying to produce people who are more resilient. You actually make them weaker and more anxiety provoking and more anxiety prone, more depressed, and more hopeless. And I think the evidence for that, it's absolutely clear and I think it's appalling that it wasn't clinical psychologists or psychiatrists who pointed it out and so it is that the, these doctrines are being put forth for the benefit of those who formulate the doctrines and that the students are sacrificial victims in that, in that process.

Speaker 4:          01:05:38       Yeah. There's one more piece that I think is important that goes back to what, excuse me, what Jim said about not seeing that a contradiction is problematic because the whole idea of contradiction is white science or western science and that's problematic is that we found that these folks don't really value discourse and dialogue and so they don't really value having ideas challenged and questioned. That's not there. Their reason for teaching these ideas in the first place and if I may give you a quick example, excuse me. Well in State University wants to include or has included at this point a, a course on native American philosophy, which, which I think is a great idea. And well, somebody in the audience asked the question and the question was, I went to a presentation and the question is individual asked was, well, what do we do as settlers, as colonialists when we want to question or challenge these ideas and native American philosophy.

Speaker 4:          01:06:40       And the presenter said, you know, I've struggled with this. It's very difficult for me, but the bottom line was it shouldn't, it should be exempt from traditional tools that we have used for other disciplines. You know, the dialectic challenging. And so that first of all, that places me in an almost impossible position. What am, what am I supposed to do? Say, you know, why is it exempt? It should play by the rules that every other philosophy because then I become the guy who hates western, who hates, um, uh, indigenous people who hates indigenous philosophy. And then I'm the tool of the patriarchy, which gets back to what you were questioning or asking before is why do we have this violence in academia and what's the problem with it? So I think part of the problem is that these folks don't value discourse. They don't value dialog, they don't value open expression, they don't, well, they view that. And again, there's a paper for this, they view that as a type of violence. Words are a type of mine, so type of verbal violence. And so then their students develop brutal epistemologies because they've never heard the other side of the story.

Speaker 2:          01:07:45       Right. And they develop them just when they should be developing resilient, resilient

Speaker 4:          01:07:49       be correct. And yeah, and as a litmus test, I always, I always ask folks why, who are gender studies in my class or study in the, in the grievance studies fields, what, why is it Martha Nussbaum is criticism of Judith Butler taught hair, single single students as, yes, I've learned about that in my class. Well, they don't, they don't teach that because they have a prevailing orthodoxy and they want to indoctrinate with it and

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       they've kind of hijack the administration. And as I said before, they've weaponized offices of diversity, inclusion, etc. To punish people who are heretics and who questioned or challenged.

Speaker 2:          01:08:26       Okay. So we're going to run out of time. We're running down to about 10 minutes here. So I want to, here's a question that I want to race to all three of you have to, I think one is why in the world should anybody outside of academia care about this? That's the first thing and very careful answer that. And the second is, um, for each of you, what's been the personal consequence of this and would you have repeated it if you knew what the consequences were going to be? So let's, let's start with the first one. Why in the world should they, why in the world should anyone care that some half did? Academic Journal published an insane paper by three renegade, uh, academics about what, about dorm rate of all the absurd, uh, of, of, of, of the observed observed topics. It's so surreal that it seems virtually in comprehensible sensible people should avoid it. So what's the answer to that? Well, go ahead Helen.

Speaker 5:          01:09:32       The university.

Speaker 2:          01:09:34       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:09:35       It, it is our source of knowledge production. If we look back through history, when our cultures were Christian, the new knowledge about this was coming from the universities. When we had the scientific revolution, when we went into the enlightenment, this was coming from the universities. These things don't stay in the universities. We have seen it is coming out in what is essentially happened with the kind of identity studies that we're looking at is that it has been made directly actionable by activists, has been tagged onto the end of the civil rights movements and liberal feminism and gay pride. When those movements have started to see diminishing returns and people wanted to continue, then it's, it's tacked onto the end of that to a society which has just seeing the end of empire, the end of Jim Crow and is geared towards towards social justice and it is it, is it a c did here

Speaker 2:          01:10:31       it's also a warning to the corporations because it's permeating the HR departments don't. Yes, it's going to stay in the universities and don't be thinking that you can import 2% of it without importing the other 98% will.

Speaker 5:          01:10:44       Yeah. People Leave University and they join these industries. Also, there's pressure on corporations to comply with the reigning moral orthodoxy. I mean, I don't think that the average business owner or the average person in the street knows anything about Sukkot or crenshaw or even thinks much about this, but it is in the air now and it is. It is affecting, it is affecting everything and we do need to take it seriously without sort of having a moral, we need to

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       look at it calmly and empirically and address it as it actually is. And what should we do about it? That's the next issue because the podcast, no. Okay, fine. That's another point. Then the final question for all three of you is and maybe one at a time. Um, when you do it again, I would, yeah, I would definitely do it again. Um, okay. So we know that you're an unrepentant troublemaker in trouble. I've also found like my one great talent in the world and I feel like I've made my own life obsolete now. Okay. Wonderful. Bullshit artist. If anybody's looking for one, um, yeah, I would definitely do it again. It's worth the risk. I think it needed to be done. Helen, let's ask you next and then we'll get let, Peter has the last word because he's the one that's got the most on the line at the moment.

Speaker 3:          01:12:09       I was imagining all sorts of things from being arrested under sort of hate speech acts to being physically attacked because I have an uncommon name. I've had an awful lot online abuse. I've got some persistent store because that has a sentiment that I probably won't get into a phd program in my own country. They, somebody in Germany, it's been, um, it's been, it's been quite nice. Okay. Peter had to be done. There's a crisis in the universities. Does a crisis with knowledge production is a crisis of confidence and a heavy price to me. And I have had to weigh out my family obligations, helping put my son through school, you know, being a part of being in a relationship in which I economically contribute to the house. But this had to be done. And if I am a consequence of this, then so be it.

Speaker 3:          01:13:11       It had to be done. Yeah. Well, Peter Work, there's a bunch of us who are not particularly inclined to let you be a sole sacrificial victim. So if you're a university wants to get too stupid with you, then um, let's, let's assume that they're going to be consequences. I sincerely appreciate your support from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Yeah, well enough is enough. So, well look guys, it was really good talking to you. All of them. I think that you're quite the surreal bunch of troublemakers and perhaps exactly what this crazy situation requires and well, and I hope that, I hope Peter, that that things work out for you properly over the next few years. It's going to be a tough haul for a while. There's no doubt. Are you getting any student support at your university? Getting a lot of students support the university, but you know, I have to be, people would threaten to attack me a few weeks ago. Someone spit at me, my colleagues literally while walked on the card or they'll turn

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       their heads. It's, it's uh, but then you know, the uncomfortable things,

Speaker 2:          01:14:16       not much different from the typical university.

Speaker 4:          01:14:20       Yeah, it's, it has seem to be. I am. I mean, I, I want to be blunt with you. It is a concern for my safety in Portland when I leave the house now. Yeah. And I've now been Trenton on more than one occasion by people and I'm concerned.

Speaker 2:          01:14:43       Do you find the threats credible? I mean, I know every, every threat is upsetting, but like are you actually in a situation where you have some apprehension about leaving your house

Speaker 4:          01:14:53       or, I won't have any apprehension. Uh, look, I, you know, I wake up in the morning and I get emails and tweets, people telling me how stupid I am and wouldn't, you know, bad person I am and how I'm a homophobe and racist, et Cetera. I then, it doesn't do anything to me. But when I walk out in the street, so the bar a few weeks ago, or maybe a few months ago, I don't even know mine for timelines, but you know, someone, someone came up to me and he started harassing me as fortunately as with my Jujitsu coach, John Davis, a black belt in Jujitsu. And he immediately pulled up the chair beside us and I kept saying, let's talk. Let's have a conversation. No, he followed me in the bathroom. I came out of the bathroom. Finally, I said, look, I don't know what's happening. I don't know why you're so upset and I'm happy to talk to you. And he said, I don't want to talk to Peter. I want to hurt. And it,

Speaker 2:          01:15:47       oh, that's pretty, that's pretty serious.

Speaker 4:          01:15:49       Yeah. And then it happened again on the street when I was surrounded about we can half ago by people, I assume they're anti for people or something clearly wanted to hurt me. Uh, so, you know, I am, I am concerned. I am concerned about

Speaker 2:          01:16:07       those for people who haven't been through it. It's very hard for people who haven't been through that sort of thing to understand just exactly how distressing that kind of occurrence is. Not only because it happens, but because it could happen again and it could become more serious. So I'm really sorry to hear that. I didn't realize it didn't come to that. That's, that's no laughing matter.

Speaker 4:          01:16:25       I appreciate that. It's got anything to do with you. And there's, there's this will stick because there's insults, leaflets and notices and yeah, that kind of stuff doesn't bother me. It's when it's in the physical world where I feel, I feel someone, I mean if someone tells you they're going to hurt you, you should take their word for it. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:16:50       definitely. When, when it's that direct and when it started in your face, those threats are credible. That that's, that's a real, that's a real danger. So, well look, I'm really sorry to hear that and I'm, I'm also sorry to hear that you're paying a substantial, I'm sorry to hear a general that you're paying a substantial price for that. Um, I'm going to do what I can for what that's worth to try to make sure that people hear about this and that you're not in it alone. Because I think you guys are like comedians. You know, your canaries in the coal mine and whatever happens to you is going to happen to a lot of other people if, if it's allowed to happen to you so it can't be allowed to happen to you. That's what it looks like to me. So thank you for your support.

Speaker 2:          01:17:32       All right guys. Well, thanks a lot for talking to me all. Uh, it was, it was a stupidly interesting talking with you, but I just did not believe it's come to this. You know, it's so ridiculous. If you can't, you couldn't invent this in a bad piece of fiction. And it's, it's so sad that, that this is the sort of thing that we have to occupy ourselves when there's serious work to be done. All right, well, happy new year, I suppose. Hopefully this'll be a watershed year and things will get more intelligent from here on end. Again, I'm, I'm sure, hoping that'll be the case me to. Thank you. All Right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your time and I'll let you know when this is all coming online. Okay,

Speaker 6:          01:18:24       bye. Bye.
