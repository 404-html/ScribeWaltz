Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. So there's this, there's this spirit of good, let's say, and what the spirit of good does is act in the world on the potential of the world to generate the actuality of the world. And the Judeo Christian proposition is, is that if you confront the potential of the world with good in mind, using truth, truthful communication, then the order that you extract is good. And then that's echoed in genesis when God is using the word and he creates cosmos out of potential. And every time he does that, he says, and it was good. Which is, I think it's so interesting because there's a proposition there and the proposition there is that if you encounter potential with truth, the cosmos you create is actually good. Well, that's, that's just an absolutely overwhelming idea. It's like if it's true, and if it's true, it's the greatest idea there ever was.
