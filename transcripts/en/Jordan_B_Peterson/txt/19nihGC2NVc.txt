Speaker 1:          00:14          Hi there. So I released, this is the third of three videos that I'm releasing this morning. And the first one deep, I just read the letter from the university administration requesting my silence. And then in the second one I detailed out my response and said that I was going to meet with the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, David Cameron. And I had gone to meet with David on Friday to discuss what had happened and to discuss the letter. And we had a good meeting, we had a good meeting and he's a reasonable person. And, uh, so I suggested because I thought before the meeting and I talked to my family, I thought, well, what's the best possible way this could move forward so that it would be in everyone's best interest, mine and the universities and the broader public and the students and, and everyone. And so we thought that the best thing to happen would be that the university could agree to host a, um, a debate, a public debate about the issue about bill see 16 and about legislation like it and that, that, that would be officially hosted by the university and I could present my case and whoever wanted to present their case contrary to what I've been stating would be invited to.

Speaker 1:          01:28          And so the Dean, David Cameron said that he had to talk to some people and that he would get back to me as soon as possible. And so over the weekend he talked to mark Gertler, who's the president of the university and the provost, sheryl red air and the vp of hr, Kelly, Hannah Moffitt. And they agreed to go forward with it. And so I was thrilled and I still am thrilled and, and so good because that means, you know, one of the things we talked about was that we could talk about this, like civilized human beings and we could discuss the real issues here. And maybe as well we could use the University of Toronto as a model to all universities who've been dealing with this sort of thing too, about how to actually deal with it. Like, like people who are rational and intelligent and careful and thoughtful in all of that.

Speaker 1:          02:16          And so they agreed to the public debate and we talked about two other issues. One was they were concerned during the meeting about the possibility of security violations, you know, demonstrations and that sort of thing. And so they thought for a while about only holding it online, but they decided not to do that, to do it as, as a university function live, which is exactly right. And we talked about security concerns and, and agreed at least tentatively that the rule would be that unwarranted disruptions will be stopped. So that because both sides are going to be represented in this debate and, and I hope they can find someone articulate and intelligent to make a case for the other side because that's what we want. So anyways, look, this is unbelievably good news. It's unbelievably good news because it means that the university has decided to uphold its position as an investigator into complex intellectual matters.

Speaker 1:          03:11          And that we can discuss this like with like civilized human beings. And so my Kudos to the University of Toronto, and you know, I've said from the beginning that this is an institute that I've respected and admired and I'm grateful to for, for providing me with the position that I have. And I am so absolutely thrilled that they decided to do the right thing. And not only that, and I got to tell you, and this is God's honest truth, David thanked me for bringing the issues to their attention. And he meant it. So hurray. It's so good. So strike one. You know, Mark went up on the wall for free speech and for the University of Toronto. So, and I'd like to thank all the people that have been supporting me. It's been very helpful and your letters were very useful. And you know, we can talk, we can talk, we can talk these things through. So let's do it. Excellent. Bye.

Speaker 2:          04:08          Okay.
