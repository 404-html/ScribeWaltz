Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       that's a hell of a welcome for someone who's going to talk about the Bible. So I thought I would get farther than through genesis by the, by this point, but I'm, I'm not unhappy about the pace either. I've learned a tremendous amount and so hopefully what we'll do today is finish genesis completely. And then I think I'll try to start up with exodus in me depending on what happens next year. I have a busy travel schedule, but I would really like to do it. I really liked the exodus story and I understand it very well. A lot of the stories in genesis, especially after the first few stories say up to the Tower of Babel, I had to do a tremendous amount of learning about, which is really good, but I do know the exodus story, so I'm really looking forward to that. So. So let's dive right into it and see how far we can get today.

Speaker 2:          00:01:21       So we'll review first. So Joseph's father is Jacob and Jacob is the patriarch of Israel essentially that the father of the 12 tribes. And, um, we, we, you might remember that, uh, he had a very morally ambivalent pathway through life and it's one of the things that I think so interesting about the stories in the, in the Old Testament is that these so called patriarchal figures are very realistic and it's something that I was over being struck by that counts in the new testament that way. There's lots of things that Christ does that you'd think would have been edited out over time and sanitized, but they're not. The Old Testament is definitely not a book that's been sanitized. And that's, it's quite interesting that that's the case. So you sort of see people with all their flaws and I've been trying to also derive some general conclusions about the moral of the story of the genesis stories and because these stories are fundamentally moral and moral as far as I'm concerned, has to do with action, right?

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       Because moral decisions are the decisions that you make when you're structuring action. When you decide to do one thing or another, generally want to do things that are the best things that you can think of to do. And hence good, but sometimes you also want to do things that are the worst things you can do, you know, because you're, or resentful or bitter. And so the moral decisions that you make that govern your actions are really the most important decisions that you make in your life. And it's not that easy to figure out how to make moral decisions. We don't have an unerring technology for that the same way as we do for say, making decisions about empirical reality, which in some ways seem a lot simpler, um, partly because we can work collectively at it partly because we have a rigorous methodology for deciding what's true and what's not.

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       So one of the things that's really struck me, like it's an overarching theme, I would say that emerges out of genesis, especially after the really ancient stories say, especially after the stories of Cain and Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel. When you get to the accounts of the historically for historically real people, one injunction seems to be get the hell out there and do something. You know what? One of the major themes for all of the Patriarchs that we've talked about, Abraham, say Jacob and Joseph is move out into the world regardless of the circumstances at hand. Now that's in, in, in the Old Testament stories that's basically portrayed as hearkening to the voice of God. Something like that. Maybe you could think about that as destiny or psychological calling. Um, and the funny thing too is, is that it's not that these people have an easy time of it when they heed that call.

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       So what's, what's fascinating is that they often run into extreme difficulties right away. And I think that's very interesting. First of all, because life is obviously full of extreme difficulties. And second, it's another example of the failure to sugarcoat things, which is one of the things I think makes a mockery of antireligious theories that are even quite sophisticated say, like Freud, because Freud thought of religion as a, as a wish fulfillment essentially. And, and also marks who thought about religion is the opiate of the masses. It's if those were true. It seems to me that there'd be a lot more wish and a lot less reality, a lot less stark, harsh reality. No, I mean the first thing that Abraham encounters is a famine and then he has to hide his wife and then he. He basically journeys into a tyranny, so that's about as bad as it gets in some ways, and those themes recur continually and no one ever lives where they're supposed to live. They leave and live in Canaan and not the promised land, and so it's a pretty rough. It's pretty rough series of stories, but the fundamental idea is something like

Speaker 3:          00:05:57       there's no time for sitting around. There's time to go out into the world and engage, and then there's. There's hints about the proper and improper ways of engaging right? So clearly the improper way to engage is, I think, most clearly delineated in the Cain and Abel Story and with Kane exemplifying the inappropriate way to engage with the world and that's to engage with the world in a bitter, jealous and resentful manner. Now, one of the things that I really liked about Cain and Abel story and that theme recurs continually with the, with the duality of the brothers, right? There's, there's constant conflict between a perspective that's essentially like canes and uh, and the, and the opposite perspective, which all, which I'll get to in a minute, but Cain sees that the world is a very tragic place and that the rewards are distributed unfairly and that there are people who do better and people who do worse, and as a consequence of that, he becomes bitter and resentful and curses God and then he becomes homicidal.

Speaker 3:          00:07:05       Fratricidal which is even worse than he destroys his own ideal than his descendants basically become genocidal, something like that. So that seems to be the wrong way to go about things, you know, unless your goal is to make things worse. Like it's not like it has a limited number of things, has nothing to object to. He's got plenty to object to. His situation actually is bad. He's overshadowed terribly by his brother who everyone loves, who does extraordinarily well and who's good at everything. And the story is a bit ambivalent about the reasons for keynes failure, although a fair bit of it's laid out his own feet, but he's definitely failing and so you can understand why he would have this terrible attitude. But the problem is all it does is make it worse. So it doesn't seem to be one of the things I've also learned as a psychologist, sort of pondering these sorts of things.

Speaker 3:          00:07:59       It's often a lot easier to identify what you shouldn't do then what you should do. Like it's. I think evil is easier to identify than good. I think good is trickier, but evil stands out to some degree and then at least you can say if you're trying to get as far away from that as possible, we could even say just for practical reasons so your life doesn't become hell and your family life doesn't become hell. At least you could get as far away from that as possible. Even if you weren't able to conjure up what would constitute the good as an Ame, you could at least avoid those sorts of pitfalls. And I do also think that it's pitfalls like that that really threatened our society right now. You know, that I see a tremendous rise in resentment fueling almost all of the political polarization that's taking place seems unfortunate given that by and large, everyone on the planet is richer than they've ever been. Now, that doesn't mean there's no disparity. There's, but there's always disparity. Anyways, Jacob,

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       of course, Jacob and Rebecca, the deceiver, Esau and Jacob ends up with, with, uh, with Isaac's blessing. And so that's, that's a moral catastrophe. And then he has to run because his brother wants to kill him. And so that's the fratricidal motif. Again. I liked that too. I think that's really realistic. You know, one of the things that Freud noted constantly, and this is where Freud really is a genius, is that the most intense hatreds and also sometimes the most intense love is within families. You know, when in the Freudian world of psychopathology, it's all, it's all inside the family. And in fact, the pathology in the Freudian world is actually the fact that it's all inside the family because people who get tangled up in the Freudian familial nightmare, which is roughly to in structure, can only conceptualize the world in terms of their familial relationships that they've been so damaged by the enmeshment and the trauma and the deceit and the betrayal and the blurred lines and all of that, that they just can't expand past the family and go out in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       So the idea that brothers can be at each other's throats, I think is out. It's a very powerful idea and it's not something that people like to think about. So, so Jacob has to leave and it's not surprising because mean what he did was pretty reprehensible. He betrayed his brother, but nonetheless, he's the person who dreams of the ladder that Unites Heaven and earth. And that's a very perverse thing. You know what? One of the things I think it does is give. In some sense, it gives hope to everyone because it isn't, you know, if only the good guys when we're really in trouble, right? Because it's not that easy to be a good guy, it's, it's, it's really not that easy and most people are pretty keenly aware of all the ways that they fall short, even have their own ideals, and so if there was no hope except for the good guys, almost all of us would be lost.

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       And so that's one of the things I really liked and was more surprised about with the old testament stories is that these people are very complex lives and they make very major moral errors by anyone's standard and yet and yet the overall message is still hopeful and the message that runs contrary to the message of evil say that message of good is something like, well, there's a lot of emphasis on faith. Right? And that's a tough one because cynics, people who are cynical about religious structures like to think of faith as the willingness to demolish your intellect in the service of superstition and well, there's something to be said for that perspective, but not a lot

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       because the reality is much more sophisticated. Part of the faith that's, that is being insisted upon in the old testament is something like, and I'm speaking psychologically here again, that it's useful to pause it. A hi. Hi. Good to aim at. So, and I, I really think that's practically useful to the research we've done with the future authoring program, for example, indicates pretty clearly that if you get people to conceptualize an ideal and a balanced ideal, you know, so what do you want for your family? What do you want for your career? What do you want for your education? What do you want for your character development? How are you going to use your time outside of work? Um, how are you going to structure your use of drugs and alcohol and places where you might get impulsive? How can you avoid falling into a horrible path?

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       If you really think that through and you come up with an integrated ideal and you, you put it above us, something to reach for, then you're more committed to the world in a positive way and you're less tormented by anxiety and uncertainty. And so. And that makes sense, right? Because here you are alive and everything, and so unless you were Cape, if you're not capable of manifesting some positive relationship with the fact of your being, then how could that be anything other than hellish because it would just be anxiety provoking and terrible because you're vulnerable and there'd be nothing useful or worthwhile to do. Well, that's just not. I just can't see that as a winning strategy for anyone. You can make a rational case for adopting that strategy in that you know, you can say, well, there's no evidence for for a transcendent morality or for an ultimate meaning.

Speaker 3:          00:13:36       There's no hard empirical evidence, but it seems to me that there's existential evidence as well that has to be taken into account. And of course psychologists have talked about this a lot. I'm Carl Rogers, for example, in human for that matter. Freud, for that matter, most of the great psychologists have pointed out that, you know, you can derive reasonable information that's solid from your own experience, especially if you also talked to other people and you can kind of see in your own life when you're on a productive path. It sort of ennobles and enlightens you or a destructive path and I think it's kind of useful to think that maybe the dichotomy between those two paths might be real, you know, and, and because that also allows you to give credence to your intuitions about that sort of thing. But I don't anyways, I don't think it's unreasonable to pause it, that since you're alive adopting the highest possible regard for the fact that you're alive and that you're surrounded by other creatures that are alive.

Speaker 3:          00:14:39       I just can't see how that can possibly be construed as a losing strategy. And so that's the first. So that's something like faith, right? It's faith, it's not, it's not only faith in your being but it's faith in being such. And the faith would be something like if you could orient your being properly, then maybe that would orient you with being as such. And you never know. Like, I mean it might be true. There's no reason to assume that it wouldn't be true. I mean, even if you just take a strict biological perspective on this and think about us as the product of three and a half billion years of evolution, I mean we have struggled over all those billions of years to be alive and to match ourselves with reality. And so because one of the things I've often wondered is, you know, life is definitely difficult.

Speaker 3:          00:15:28       There's no doubt about that and it's unfair and there's inequality and all of those things and people are subject to all sorts of terrible things. But I also wonder if you weren't actively striving to make things worse, just how much better could they be? You know, because people are very. They're like houses that are divided amongst themselves. They're pointing in different directions at the same time. They're working at cross purposes to themselves because of bitterness and resentment and an unprocessed memories and childhood hatreds and unexamined assumptions, all sorts of things. And you just gotTa wonder if you could push that aside and orient yourself properly. And then the other thing that of course is stressed very heavily in the old testament and of course that goes through the entire biblical corpus is that it's not only enough to establish a positive relationship with being, which I think is the essential, it's a good description of faith.

Speaker 3:          00:16:30       You have to make that decision, right? Because being is very ambivalent and you can make the case that maybe it's something that should have never happened, but that doesn't seem to be productive to me. And faith seems to be, I'm going to act as if being is ultimately justifiable and that if I partake in it properly, I will improve it rather than making it worse. So I think that's the statement of faith. And then what seems to go along with that is something like truth in conception, inaction. You know, even people like Jacob who are pretty damn morally ambivalent to begin with, get hammered a lot by what they go through. And what seems to happen is that they're hammered into some sort of ethical shape, right? So by the mid point of their life's journey, there are people who are solidly planted who you can trust and who don't be trey being or themselves or their fellow man. And so it's an interesting. I mean it seems reasonable to me to first assume that you have to establish a relationship with something that's transcendent. It might even be just the future version of you and then second that you have to align yourself with reality in a truthful manner and that that's your best bet and

Speaker 3:          00:17:52       the biblical stories are actually quite realistic about that too because they don't really say that if you do that, you're going to be instantly transported to the promised land. Like even Moses, as we'll find out in the accident stories. He never makes it to the promised land. And so it's not like you're offered instantaneous, final redemption. If you move out forthrightly into the world, establish a faithful relationship with being an attempt to conduct yourself with integrity, but it's your best bat and it might be good enough, and even if it's not good enough, it's really preferable to the alternative, which seems to be something closely akin to hell, both personal and social.

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       So Joseph's father is Jacob later Israel. He who wrestles with God and we've talked about that a little bit. It's sort of implicit in what I've been saying is that I think we all do that to some degree. We wrestle with reality itself. That's for sure not only the reality we understand, but the reality we don't understand, which is sort of a transcendent reality and then maybe whatever reality is outside of that, you know, because the classic Judeo Christian conception of God is that there's time and space and of course there's lots of things about what exists in time and space that were completely ignorant to oven that's transcendent in that sense. But then there's an idea that there is a realm outside of that which is a. well, it's an interesting idea. It's very sophisticated idea, I think rather than a simple idea and it's.

Speaker 3:          00:19:26       It's difficult to know what to make of it, but it doesn't really matter because I think regardless of what your attitude is towards those sorts of things, intellectually, you still end up in the same position as Jacob for all intents and purposes, practically speaking, because I don't think that there's anyone who at some point in their life or perhaps even everyday doesn't at some level wrestle with God and you could just call it well the nature of reality, I suppose if you want to be, say reductionistic about it, but I don't think it makes any difference. It's still something you're stuck with and it's not only the nature of reality itself that you have to struggle with, but it's also the nature of your moral relationship to it, your behavior in relationship to it. So that's how you should perceive it and how you should conduct yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:20:15       And then whether or not the, the advantages of doing it properly are worth the difficulty and the disadvantages. So that seems to me just a straight existential statement. Then you know, Jacob gets damaged by his wrestling, which is also very realistic. So anyways, he also ends up as father of Joseph, who's the favorite son, son who's born in his old age, to his favorite wife, and that's who we're going to talk about two today. So you remember. So Jacob is the for father of the 12 tribes of Israel and there's his, his wives and the son and the offspring that resulted. Those are all the sons. There's a daughter named Diana as well, and Rachel is the woman he really loved and the first son he had with Rachel was Joseph, and that was when he was older. And so that's in some sense why Joseph is his favorite. So

Speaker 3:          00:21:12       this is the beginning of the story of Joseph. Now Israel. Jacob loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and there's a lot packed into those two sentences. You know, the first is that now Israel loved Joseph more than all his other children. That's probably not so good. One of the things we've seen in the stories that have preceded this is that whenever there's marked preference on the part of parents for one child over the other, with, with, with, with Jacob, and Esau was Rachel was, uh, Jacob was Rachel's favorite and Isa was, um,

Speaker 3:          00:21:55       Isaac's favorite that didn't work out so well that put a real twist in the entire structure of the family. And so there's a warning there right off the bat you might say, well, you can't help having a preference for one child or another, but I don't know if that's true. And it's certainly something that you should be very cautious about because it doesn't seem to work out very well because he was the son of his old age fair enough. And he made him a coat of many colors. That's a very interesting image, that coat of many colors they have that idea. And so I'm going to delve into that idea because it sets the stage, like it says what sort of person Joseph is. He's favored, he's younger, he's favored. But he also has this particular garment that characterizes him, you know, and one of the things I've really learned from analyzing women's dreams in particular is that women very frequently, in my experience, very frequently dream of clothing as role.

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       And so if you're interpreting women's dreams, then if they put on the shoes of their grandmother for example, then you understand very rapidly that that dream is trying to make an association between their own behavior and something that's characteristic of either the state of being a grandmother or the particular grandmother. And it makes sense, right? Because clothing protects. But it also signifies a role. And uh, it's interesting in the old testament stories, often if someone is going to act deceitfully they changed their, they changed their outfit. And that's Kinda what you do when you act deceitfully, right? You dress up like someone else, you present yourself like someone else. So anyways, back to the coat of many colors. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:23:34       for something to be many colored, it sort of spans the entire gamut of possibility. And so there's a hint there that if you want to be a full fledged person that you have to manifest a very large number of traits. And so I want to go into that idea a bit. The first thing I want to talk about is some of the things that we've learned about what happens to you when you go to a new environment. You know, there's this idea in very deep idea and clinical psychology, a fundamental idea, which is that if someone's anxious about something, what you do is you. And it's getting in their way. You take what they're anxious about, new define it because that already delimits it, right? Because one of the problems with being anxious about something as you won't speak of it, it's like voldemort. And then if you don't speak of it you, it's way bigger than it should be.

Speaker 3:          00:24:27       As soon as you start talking about it, you cut it down to size. And so, and it, it's for a bunch of reasons. It's because you're not as. You're not as afraid of as many things as you think. And you're braver than, you know. And more and more capable, so as soon as you're brave enough to start talking about what you're afraid of, then you see that there's more to you than you thought and that there's less to the problem than you thought, and then you can decompose it further into smaller problems and then you can figure out how to approach those smaller problems and so and then it doesn't seem to meet to be that you get less frightened. It seems to be that you get more courageous, which is way better than being less frightened because there's lots of things to be frightened about. So if you're courageous that, that really does the trick.

Speaker 3:          00:25:08       Now the question is what happens if you like, let's say that you're a very socially inept and you don't know how to introduce yourself or to make any, were established the initial parts of a relationship with anyone. And so then you start putting yourself in situations where you're required to do that. And so then the question is how is it technically that you transform? You say, well, you learn. Well, we want to be more specific about that. What does it mean that you learn? Well if you're dealing with someone who's particularly socially inept and you're doing psychotherapy with them, you might teach them how to shake someone's hand properly and say their name and remember the other person's name, and so you just practice that with them so that they have the motoric routine down so that form of knowledge is built right into your body.

Speaker 3:          00:25:54       It's like, look at the person, put out your hand, shake it. Don't not like a dead Halibut, but you know with a reasonable grip. Say Your name. Don't mumble it. Look, look at them so that they can hear you, and then when they say their name, try to remember it and that's meant so you can practice that with people and so then they develop something that's Metorik, right? It's embedded right in their body and so and then you can say to them, well, the other thing you can do is when you start a conversation is don't sit there thinking about what you're going to say next because then you won't be paying attention to the person and you'll make a fool out of yourself. Because you'll manifest nonsequitors, right, because you'll get out of. It's like if you're dancing and all you're paying attention to is where your feet are, then you're going to step on the other person all the time, so you want to pay attention to the other person and then whatever automatized social knowledge you have will come to the forefront.

Speaker 3:          00:26:48       So it's a good thing to know if you're socially anxious, right? If you're socially anxious, one of the things you should do is pay way more attention to the person you're talking to rather than less. And you should pay as little attention as possible to yourself. So if you feel yourself falling in because you're anxious, then what you do is you push your attention out and pay attention to the person because to the degree that you've been socialized, then all your automatic responses will kick it. So. But anyway, so you go out into the social world and you learn to shake someone's hand and you learn how to listen to them and ask them questions because that's the next thing. Because people love. You can't just ask them random questions obviously, but if they start talking to you and you don't understand something about what they're saying or maybe something they said is interesting in you ask them a question, they're pretty damn happy about that because it means you're actually paying attention to them and people actually love to be paid attention to because it hardly ever happens.

Speaker 3:          00:27:41       So they really, really like it. And so, okay, so, so what's happening? Well first of all, you're mastering the automated motor movements, right? Where to point your eyes, where to put your hands, how to move your lips, like really embodied knowledge. It's a special kind of memory and you're practicing that and so that's building new skills for you. And then by listening to the person and watching yourself interact, you're also generating new new abstract information that enables you to conceptualize the world in a different way. So if you go out to can you go talk to 10 different people or 50 different people? Then you get to listen to what those 50 people said. You get to watch how they're, how they express themselves, and you gather a corpus of knowledge that changes the way you perceive. That broadens you as a social agent. Okay, so that's two forms of knowledge, but then there's a third one which is really interesting, which is that you know you have a lot of biological potential and it's hard to know what potentially is, but part of it is that you're capable of generating proteins that you haven't been generating.

Speaker 3:          00:28:49       So you should get right on that by the way. So, but what the way that works in part is that if you put yourself in a radically new situation, then your brain that there are genetic switches that turn on because of the demands of the new situation that code for new proteins. So it's as if you have latent software. That would be one way of thinking about that will only be turned on if you go into this situation where that's necessary. And so then you might think, well, if that's the case, how much have you could be turned on if you went a whole bunch of different places. And that's a really, really, that's a profound question because one of the deep answers to how you should get your life together is you should go a very large number of places and turn yourself on.

Speaker 3:          00:29:39       And I want to walk through that a little because there's a very rich symbolic world that expresses that. So now the idea about having a coat of many colors would be that the person who is the appropriate leader, because remember, or the proper person, which would be the same thing. One of the things that these old stories are trying to express and to figure out is how is it that you should act which is the same as what constitutes the ideal. Those are the same question. And the hand here with Joseph is while you should wear a coat of many colors, which means that you should be able to go have a drink in the pub with the guys who were, you know, dry walling, your, your house. And you should be able to have a sophisticated conversation with someone who's more educated in an abstract way.

Speaker 3:          00:30:28       And that maybe you should be equally comfortable in both situations, right? Because you might think, well there's more, one of the indications that there's more to you is that you can be put more places and function properly and that would be a good thing to aim at because here's the other issue is that you know perfectly well that the fundamental tragedies of life and your exposure to malevolence in the course of that life. So those being the worst things, there's not a lot you can do to, to alter that fundamentally because their conditions of existence, you're going to be subject to your vulnerability and your going to be subject to malevolence. That's that. And you can't hide from it because it actually makes it worse. So you're stuck with it. So then the question is, well, what are your options? And one option is to curse the structure of being for being malevolent and tragic and fair enough.

Speaker 3:          00:31:21       And the other is to make yourself so damn differentiated and dynamic and able that you're more than a match for that. Now that's not an easy thing, but it doesn't matter. Because like what? What's the alternative? There's no good alternative and that's also worth knowing. So you see these ideas expressed in the strangest places and so we've talked a little bit, I think in this, in this series about Pinocchio, but if we haven't, it doesn't matter. You see, there's Jimminy cricket at the opening of the Pinocchio Movie, pointing to a star, which is roughly the Nativity Star for all intents and purposes, and it's a. it's a symbolic indicator of a of something diamond like and pure right glimmering in the darkness that's transcendent, that above the horizon upon which to fix your eyes, and so that's the thing is you need that technically and the reason you need that is because we know enough about psychology now to know that almost all of the positive emotion that you're going to experience in your life and positive emotion is analgesic by the way, right?

Speaker 3:          00:32:35       It actually quells paint, so it's not just positive and also gets rid of negative, which is a big plus. Almost all of the positive emotion that you're going to feel. You're going to feel in relationship to a goal because you feel positive emotion as you approach a goal, and so if you want to feel positive emotion, then you need a goal and then you might think, well, if you want to maximize that positive emotion, which is enthusiasm, and also what pulls you out into the world as well as feeling good, then you need the best possible goal. Well that because that's going to engage the largest segments of your being, like if your goals too narrow, then a bunch of you isn't going to be on board for it. You know? If the goal is well developed and multifaceted, then all of you can partake in that.

Speaker 3:          00:33:21       Even your negative elements, even your anger and your fear can get onboard with that. Let's say so you need a goal, man, that's worthy. You got us. Thank you. Good. You need a goal that justifies the tragedy and malevolence of life. That seems to be the bottom line. Now maybe you think, well, there's no goal that can do that. It's like, well, there are still better and worse schools, so and I, I'm not convinced that there are no goals that can do that. I think that's an open question. You'd never know that until you pursued the proper goal long enough to find out who you would be as a consequence of pursuing it. So that's also your destiny or your existential voyage, right? It's also not something that anyone else can do for you. Someone can say, get your act together for Christ's sake and get it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:09       Get good at it. That's, that'll make the world unfold best for you. But there's no way you can know that without doing it. So, and unless you think you've done a particularly stellar job of that, then you have no reason to doubt its potential validity. So plus, like crickets are telling you this. And so you know, there are a very reliable source. Okay, so you see the star, The star recurs as a Motif in Pinocchio. And one of the more interesting elements of it here is that when Japan wants to transform his puppet Marionette, whose being played by forces that operate behind the scenes, which is really good definition of the persona from a union perspective, right? And also something indicative of something like an ideological or conceptual possession. Japan who's a good guy is positive father figure read lifts his even though he is a patriarchal figure, right?

Speaker 3:          00:35:09       And a very competent one. He's still even lifts his eyes up to something that transcends his mode of being positive as it is and wishes that his creation would undertake the kind of transformation that would make it autonomous and fully functional as a moral agent. No strings. Right? So that's very interesting. I think soldier hits and said the salvation of mankind lies only in making everything that concern of all. That's a pretty decent star, like goal I would say. And so what happens in the story is that because, and I think this is a symbolic representative of what I just described you, that happens at a genetic level, if you put yourself in new situations. So Japan is roughly culture in the Pinocchio Story, right? He's, he's a craftsman. He's, he's, uh, and he makes Pinocchio. So He's, he's who's his son. He's the socializing agent and he aims for something above mere socialization, which is, I think, part of the mysterious element of human beings.

Speaker 3:          00:36:17       You know, when our scientific models, we basically have socialization and biology, but there's always a third element and mythological stories, which is whatever you might construe as the spontaneous action of consciousness that's associated with freewill. And you know, that's just basically being conceptualized in religious terms as something akin to the soul. Now we don't have a category for that scientifically because what we try to do scientifically is to reduce everything either to socialization or to biology. But it isn't clear to me that that's. It's perfectly reasonable from the perspective of practicality at a scientific level. You don't want to multiply explanatory principles beyond necessity, but there's many things that that doesn't come to terms with, such as the fact that we all treat each other as autonomous beings with free will and that that seems to work. And that if we stopped doing that, then things go to hell very, very rapidly.

Speaker 3:          00:37:09       So, and the mere fact that we have been able to conceptualize what that conscious freewill might be, metaphysically or physically, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it just means that we don't understand it. I mean what it was only in the last 15 years that we discovered that 95 percent of the universe was made out of some kind of matter that we can't even whose properties we can't even imagine except that it seems to have mass. So anyways, what happens is when Japan Eto reach lifts his eyes up to the star, he, so it's society aligning itself with the proper goal with regards to individual development, right? So, so there instead of society being at odds with the individual, they line up and then what happens is nature comes on board and that's the blue fairy in the, in the Pinocchio Story. And that's seems to me to be a symbolic representation of what happens biologically when when you set the goal properly, get your culture behind you and move into the world, is that there's a biological transformation that occurs as a consequence of that, which means that a bunch of you that hasn't been turned on turns on.

Speaker 3:          00:38:19       And I guess one question would be is what would you be like if you turned on everything inside of you that could be turned on? Well, that's a good goal. That's a good thing to find out. So now I'm going to introduce a couple of other ideas. There's this idea in union psychology called the circumambulation and young had this idea that you had a potential future self which would be in potential everything that you could be and that it manifests itself moment to moment in your present life by making you interested in things and the things that you're interested in are the things that would guide you along the path that would lead you to maximal development. Now it sounds like a metaphysical idea or a or a mystical idea even, but, but it's not. It's not, it's a really profoundly biological idea. The idea is something like, well, your setup so that you're automatically interested in those things that was fully expand you as a well adapted creature.

Speaker 3:          00:39:21       Well like there's nothing radical about that idea. How well what else could possibly be the case unless there's something fundamentally flawed about you that is what the situation would be. It's kind of interesting to think about how that would be manifest moment to moment, but the idea is something like, well, your interest is captured by those things that lead you down. The path of development will have better be the case. Okay, so that's fine, and so there's some utility in pursuing those things that you're interested in. That's the call to adventure, let's say so and the call to adventure takes you all sorts of places. Now the problem with the call to adventure is like, what the hell do you know? You might be interested in things that are kind of warped and bent, and often it's the case that when new parts of people manifest themselves and grip their interest, say they do it very badly and shoddily and so you stumble around like an idiot.

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       When you try to do something new. That's where the fool is the precursor to the savior from the, from the symbolic perspectives, because you have to be a fool before you can be a master and if you're not willing to be a fool and you can't be a master, so, so you're going to. It's an error error ridden process and that's also laid out the old testament stories because the first thing that happens to all these patriarchal figures when God kicks them out of their father's house when they're like 84, is that they. They run into all sorts of trouble. And some of it's social too. Some of it's natural. Some of it's a consequence of their own moral inadequacy. So they're fools and. But, but the thing that's so interesting is that despite the fact that they're fools, they're still supposed to go on the adventure and that they're capable of learning enough as a consequence of moving forward on the adventure so that they straightened themselves out across time.

Speaker 3:          00:41:07       And so it's something like this and this circumambulation that young talked about was this continual, we'll return to this, this continual circling in some sense of who you could be. You might notice, for example, that there are themes in your life. You know, when you go back across your experiences, you see, you kind of have your typical experience that sort of repeats itself and there might be variation on it, like a musical theme, but it's like you're circling yourself and getting closer to yourself as you move across time. That's the circumambulation. Now you remember that for a sec because we'll go back to it. Okay? So imagine that something glimmers before you. It's an an interest that's dawning and you decide, well, first of all, you're paralyzed. You think, well, how do I know if I should pursue that? It's probably a stupid idea, and the proper response to that is, you're right, it probably is a stupid idea because almost all the, all ideas are stupid and so the probability that as you move forward on your adventure, that you're going to get it right the first time is zero.

Speaker 3:          00:42:07       It's just not going to happen. And so then you might think, well, maybe I'll just wait around until I get the right idea and which people do, right? So they're like 40 year old, 13 year olds, which is not a good idea. And so they wait around until it's waiting for Godot until they finally got it right. But the problem is you're too stupid to know when you've got it right. So waiting around isn't going to help because even if it's the perfect opportunity manifested itself to you in your incomplete form, the probability that you would recognize it as the perfect opportunity is zero. You might even think it's the worst possible idea that you've ever heard of anywhere, highly likely, highly likely. So, so you ha, there's a niche nature called that, uh, will, will to stupidity, which I really liked. So because he thought of stupidity as being, you know, it's, it's, you have to take it into account fundamentally and work with it and so and so you can take these tentative steps on your pathway to destiny and you can assume that you're going to do it badly and that's really useful because you don't have to beat yourself up.

Speaker 3:          00:43:13       It's pretty easy to do it badly. But the thing is it's way better to do it badly than not to do it at all. And that's the continual message that echoes through these historical stories in genesis. It's like these are flawed people. They should have got the hell out of their house way before they did and they go out and they stumble around in tyranny and feminine self betrayal and, and violence. And, but it's a hell of a lot better than just rotting away at home. And that's the, that's great. So that's good. And so why is that? Well, okay, so you, you start your path and you think that you're heading towards your star and so you go in that direction and then because you're here, the world looks a particular way, but then when you move here, the world looks different and you're different as a consequence of having made that voyage and so what that means is that now that thing that glimmers in front of you is going to have shifted its location because you weren't very good at specifying it to begin with and now that you're a little sharper and more focused than you were, it's going to reveal itself with more accuracy to you.

Speaker 3:          00:44:23       And so then you have to take a, you know, it's almost like 180 degree reversal, but it because you know, you've.

Speaker 3:          00:44:34       I mean you've gone this far and that's a long ways to get that far. But that's a lot farther than you would be if you just stayed where you were waiting. And so it doesn't matter that you overshoot continually because as you overshoot, even if you don't learn what you should have done, you're going to continually learn what you shouldn't keep doing. And if you learn enough about what you shouldn't keep doing, then that's tantamount at some point to learning at the same time what you should be doing. So it's okay. So it's like this. Now what's cool about it though, I think is that as you progress, the degree of overshooting starts to decline, right? And that we know that there was nothing hypothetical about that. As you learn a new skill, like even to play it, play a song on the piano, for example, you overshoot madly making all sorts of mistakes to begin with. And then the mistakes

Speaker 3:          00:45:37       they disappear. There's a great ted talk, I think it was about sky, a setup, a really advanced computational recording system in his home and recorded every single utterance his young child made while learning to speak. And then he put together the child's attempts to say certain phonemes and put them in the list. And you can hear the child deviating madly to begin with, and then after hundreds and hundreds of repetitions, just zeroing in on the exact phoneme so you know you might not know this, but when kids babble, because they start babbling when they're quite young, they babble every human phoneme including all sorts of phonemes that adults can't say, and then they they die into their language so that after they learn, say English, then there's all sorts of phonemes they can no longer here or pronounced, but to begin with, it's all there, which is really quite interesting, but so they zip as they learn a particular language, they zero in on the proper way to pronounce that in their errors minimize.

Speaker 3:          00:46:40       And every time you learn something, now it's how it is. And that's really useful to know too, because it means that it's okay to wander around stupidly before you fix your destination. Now you see that echoed in exodus, right? Because what happens is that the Egyptians or the Hebrews escape a tyranny, which is kind of whatever you do personally and psychologically. When you escape from your previous set of stupidly held and ignorant and stubborn axioms, it's like away from that tyranny. It's like, great. I freed myself from that. Well then what? Well you think, well now I'm on the way. It's no, you're not. Now you're in the desert where you wonder around stupidly, you know and worship the wrong things until you finally organize yourself morally again and had in the proper direction. So that's worth knowing too because you think, well, I got rid of a lot of things, baggage, excess baggage that I didn't need in my life, and now everything's okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:36       It's like, no, it's not. You've got rid of a whole set of scaffolds that were keeping you in place even though they were pathological. Now you have nothing and nothing actually turns out to be better than something pathological, but you're still stuck with the problem of nothing. And that's. Well, that's exactly why exodus is structured the way that it is. It's that you escaped from maturity. It's hooray. We're no longer slaves. Yeah, well now you're nihilistic and lost. It's not necessarily an improvement, but it is, but it is the pre. See. It's also useful to know that because you can also be diluted into the idea that imagine that you're trying to become enlightened, which might mean to turn all those parts of you on that could be turned on. You think, well, that's just a linear pathway uphill. You know, it's just from one success to another.

Speaker 3:          00:48:23       It's no, it's not. It's like here you are and you're not doing too badly in the first step is a complete bloody catastrophe. It's worse and then maybe you can pull yourself together and you hit a new plateau and then that crumbles and shakes and bang. It's worse again and so because part of the reason that people don't become enlightened is because it's punctuated by intermittent deserts essentially by intermittent catastrophes and if you don't know that well then you're basically screwed because you go ahead on your movement forward and you collapse and you think, well, that didn't work. I collapsed. It's like, no, that's par for the course. It's not indication that you failed. It's just indication that it's really hard and that when you learn something, you also unlearn something and the thing you unlearned is probably useful and unlearning it actually is painful.

Speaker 3:          00:49:10       You know, let's say if you have to get out of a bad relationship, it's like not every, not any real. There isn't any relationship that's a hundred percent bad, and so when you jump out of it, well maybe you're in better shape, but you're still lonesome and disoriented and you don't know what your past was and you don't know what your president is and you don't want to know what your future is. It's that's not. That's why people stay with the devil they know instead of, you know, looking for the devil they don't know so, so anyways, the fact that you're full of faults doesn't mean you have to stop and thank God for that. That's a really useful thing and the fact that you're full of faults doesn't mean that you can't learn and so you can pause it and an ideal and you're going to be wrong about it, but it doesn't matter because what you're right about his positing, the ideal moving towards it, if the actual ideal isn't conceptualized perfectly well first surprise, surprise, because like what are you going to do?

Speaker 3:          00:50:07       That's perfect. So it doesn't matter that it's imperfect, imperfect, it just matters that you do it and that you move forward. So that's really, that's really positive news as far as I'm concerned because you could actually do that, right? You can do it badly. Anyone can do that. So that's, that's useful. Okay. So like if you were an efficient person, you would have just done that but you're not. But who cares? You know, you still end up in the, in the same place and maybe the trip is even more interesting. Who knows? Probably two interesting young. I began to understand that the goal of psychic development by which he means psychological development or spiritual development is the self. There is no linear evolution. There's only a circumambulation of the self are getting closer. It's like it's like you're spiraling into something, something like that and the thing that you're spiraling into recedes as you move towards it and gets more and more sophisticated and well developed as you move towards it because you're not going to run out of goals, right? No matter how much you have your act together, there's probably undoubtedly 30 dimensions along which you could get your act together a lot more so, and some of those aren't even conceivable to you when you're in your initial on carved state, let's say uniform development exists at most at the beginning. Later, everything points towards the center. This insight gave me stability and gradually my inner peace returned.

Speaker 3:          00:51:41       So this is fun. On the left there. That's the sharp cathedral. That's the one that has the maze in it that I told you about. They actually light that up with lasers now and so that's it lit up with lasers and so. So they're turning it into a cathedral of light, which I think is really fascinating and it's. It's a continuation of the same idea, right? Because the stained glass windows were obviously, I wouldn't call them primitive attempts to do that. I mean stained glass windows are pretty impressive, you know, but it's an elaboration of the same thing. So now you can go to that Cathedral. They light up the whole town like that, which is really something. And so they're. And there's how the cathedral is built. It's across. Um, and do you remember the cross is an ex that marks the center of the world and the cross is the place where each individual is.

Speaker 3:          00:52:26       And I think that's the fundamental message of Christianity is the cross marks the place where every single individual is. And it's a tragic place that consists of suffering and exposure to malevolence and that the only way to come to terms with it is to accept it. And that seems to me, I don't see anything metaphysical about that statement whatsoever. It's like, well, x marks the spot. Fair enough. You're in a spot, you're right in the center of your world. It's right in the center of the world as far as you're concerned. And the same with the rest of us. It's characterized by suffering and exposure to malevolence. There's no doubt about that. What are you going to do about that bitter, resentful, hateful. All that does is make it worse. So you have to accept it. Now, that's not an easy thing because that's actually, I would say, a heroic task to voluntarily accept the conditions of your own existence. And that happens at the cross. So that's fine. And that's associated with light. Well, that's good that that's associated with light. You wouldn't want that to be associated with darkness. That would be a bad thing. So,

Speaker 3:          00:53:35       and so there's the, there's the, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:53:41       the labyrinth that was built in 1200 add. And so the idea is you walk in here, it's the same idea as that star sequence of slides that I just showed you. So here's the idea, is that north, south, west and east. So that's the whole world laid out in two dimensions. And so the question is, how do you get to the center? Now we already know what the center is. The center is the center of the Cross and that's the place of maximal suffering. You could save maximal malevolence as well, but it's also the place where that's transcended, so how do you get there while the answer is, well, you don't just stand on the outside looking in, that's not gonna help, so and you can't just run right to the center even if you're in California and so you have to walk in here and then you see you go like this and you go to every single place, every single place on that, on that little cosmos, and then once you've gone to every single place and expanded yourself as a consequence of going north and west and east and south, then there's enough of you so that you're at so that you can tolerate being first of all that you can figure out where the center is, but also that you can tolerate being at the center.

Speaker 3:          00:54:59       And so that's what that represents. And that's pretty. And look, I mean let's make no mistake about it. Hey, people were pretty damn serious about those ideas. Like that's, that's quite the piece of work for people in the twelfth century in all of those. Some of those damn cathedrals took 300 years to build. We don't build anything that takes 300 years, you know, and people were putting a lot of effort into whatever these things meant, you know, and if you think they meant bearded man in the sky, then you know, it's hard to. It's hard to account for the kind of motivation that would produce these buildings with that kind of paucity of conceptualization, you know, the towns. And it was certainly the case in charter that they groaned under the tax burden that was required to produce these. Now you might think, well that's partly tyrannical and no doubt that's the case, but, but that's not the whole story. The whole story is that the people who produce those buildings, they thought about every bit of it. Nothing's accidental and they're trying to portray something just like that window is trying to portray something that's the same thing as this. It's the center from which all things manifest themselves. You see that's Christ there and being portrayed as, as that center or the center within him, something like that. Very much like the shockers and in, in um,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       in a yogic practice, same basic idea. It's the opening up of the internal structure and its proper realization. So there are people walking the labyrinth, so that's the coat of many colors, right? That's this differentiated motive being that enables you to be competent at home in the widest possible number of places and that that's a real differentiation of your personality to breaking through the boundaries of your personality, including the ones that you impose on yourself to become someone who is useful wherever they're put. And that's really relevant to this story of Joseph too because one of the things that happens to Joseph is that, well, a lot of bad things happen to him because he's the favorite of his father. His brothers hated him, and so the first they're going to throw him in a pit. I think they do throw them in a pit.

Speaker 2:          00:57:28       Then they sell them to be a slave. Then he ends up in, well, we'll go through the story. He ends up some places where you probably wouldn't want to go prison being one of them, but it doesn't matter because even when they put them in prison, he's actually not in prison. He just figures out how to make the prison work way better. Then he's in control of the prison and it's a really. It's an interesting. I had this friend, you know, and he was very smart but very cynical and he wasn't employed very well and he got a little older than he should have given his level of intelligence and employability and so he had to take jobs that weren't very intellectually challenging. You know, on. One of the things I tried to convince him of was that even if he worked, he wanted to work behind the parts department in an automotive store because he liked cars, but it was beneath them, you know, because it was sort of a.

Speaker 2:          00:58:24       As far as he was concerned, it was a, he was too smart for a job like that, which actually turned out not to be true. He wasn't smart enough for a job like that or it wasn't wise enough. But you know, I, one of the things I tried to tell them was that you're looking at the situation wrong because even in a simple job, so called simple job, like let's say dishwashing in a restaurant, which I did an awful lot of. It's not that simple. You're dealing with a lot of other people, very fast staff changeover. You're feeding people, you're helping them have a celebration, you're helping them take a break, like you can do it really well and then the kitchen can operate properly and then people can come out to the restaurant. It's not a bloody catastrophe and like you're even when you're doing something that's a menial job, so to speak, like dishwashing, there are ways of doing it really badly, resentfully and horribly and doing it really well. And as soon as you do it really well, it's not a menial job anymore. It, it immediately transformed. Now, I mean

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       you can be around people who won't let that happen and you should go get another job if that's the case, but if you do it properly, then it's not meaningful at all. And that's also a good way out of resentment, you think, well, I've just got this, you know, two bit job. It's like, yeah, what if you did it as well as you possibly could, you know what would happen? Well, the first thing that would happen is you'd get a lot smarter, that's for sure. And that's hardly a negative thing. Okay. So that's the coat of many colors. So it's an estimation of what Joseph is like and what we're seeing with all of these patriarchal figures is the continual realization of the ideal person. Right? You could think about it as success of approximations of the ideal person. And the story is exploring all sorts of different possibilities, including ones that are very violent and catastrophic and malevolent.

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       It's trying to cover the entire territory and to focus in on what the proper way through the maze, the maze of life, the labyrinth. And the hint here is that while you should be multidimensional, these are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being 17 years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers and the lad was with his sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and Joseph brought unto his father. They're evil report. Well, we already know that Joseph has Jacob's favorite, and so that doesn't make him very popular among his brothers. He's younger and now we also find out that he's been set up more or less, as you might say, a snitch because that's what this phrase means is that he goes out and watches his older brothers and if they do something they shouldn't do that. He comes trotting back to Jacob and reports, well, that's not going to make you popular. So. And you would say, well, is that Joseph's problem?

Speaker 3:          01:01:16       Or Jacob's problem? And I would say, and this is something I learned from reading too, is that that's a conspiratorial problem, right? Is it's the parents that fault, but so is the child who agrees to do that. They've got a little cabal going and you might say, well, it's only the parents' fault, but the sun will be taking advantage of every advantage that offers him because he could say no to. I won't do that. So anyways, so Joseph is the favorite. He's a bit of a teacher's pet. That's what it looks like now. Israel loved Joseph more than all his colors because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors. And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him. So let's say you have a child or number of children and one of them is your favorite.

Speaker 3:          01:02:08       How should you treat that child? Well, it isn't obvious that you do them any favors by overtly making them be your favorite, right? I mean, first of all, maybe you don't them as much as you should. And second of all, you definitely set up a Cain and Abel like scenario in the household and that. Or maybe it's new situation too, because you happen to love your child more than you love your spouse, which is, that's not a recipe for familial harmony. So it's, it seems to be a bad idea. Okay, so now we have two reasons that Joseph is not liked by his brothers is. One is, well he's a bit of a rat fink and the other is that he's the, he's the favorite and he's playing that to the hill by the looks of things. And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren and all his brothers and they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him.

Speaker 3:          01:03:03       And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brethren and they hated him. The more he said unto them, here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed for. Behold we were binding. We chiefs in the field and Lo my sheaf arose. And behold, your sheaves stood round about and bowed to my sheaf and his. And remember he's the young one, right? And, and also the daughter of the favorite wife, which is another thing that's, or the son of the favorite wife, which is another thing, not really working in his favor. And his brethren said to him, Shalt Thou indeed reign over us or shall thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him, yet the more for his dreams and for his words, while there there's a shock, you know, that makes perfect sense. So when it gets worse, so you see here, well there's the wheat sheaves bowing there and uh, and then you see this, what's going on here?

Speaker 3:          01:03:56       Well, that's not the end of his, let's call it grandiosity. And there's an idea to and in the Old Testament, especially in the stories of Joseph, that if God sends you a dream twice, he really means it. And so I don't know if that's true, although I do know that people have repeating dreams. It might be true that that a dream you have twice is really trying to punch something home. You know, it's certainly the case that recurrent nightmares are meaningful and that recurrent nightmares are associated quite tightly with decreased states of mental health and that if you can treat the nightmare, which is often quite easy by the way, then the some of the mental health problems will decrease, so repeated dreams seem to be important. Anyways. He dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brethren and said, behold, I've had another dream, and be and behold the sun and the moon and the 11 stars bowed to me and he told it to his father and to his brothers and his father rebuked him and said unto unto him, what is this dream that though history of I in my and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to the to the earth, and his brothers envied him, but his father observed to say, well, what the hell do you make of something like that, right?

Speaker 3:          01:05:12       If someone tells you that it's like, are they responsible for their dreams? We don't really seem. We don't really hold ourselves responsible for our, for the dreams we have at night, and what do you make of a dream is like one of the things that [inaudible] pointed out, this is where he differed from Freud's substantially is Freud tended to think that the dream head, its meaning because it's contents weren't acceptable to the conscious mind and young said, no, no, you don't understand. That's not what happens. What happens is the dream is doing the best it can to express something that the person doesn't yet really know and young thought about the dream as a manifestation of nature. It wasn't associated with the ego at all. It was just like you have a dream and there were things happening in it. The same way that when you walk into a dinner party, there are things happening there.

Speaker 3:          01:06:00       You know it's not. The dream isn't something that's subject to your capacity for manipulation. It's something that happens to you, not something that you do. And so, so if someone has a dream like that, well you've got three options. You can just discount dreams altogether, which is what people in the modern world tend to do, which is a very bad idea because there are thoughts and you shouldn't discount them. You know what I mean? And they're hardly random as some neuroscientists claim. That's absolutely cockeyed theory. That random like television, snow on a TV set, if it was random. So, so one is while you just discount dreams. The other is that you consider the person a liar and a braggart and a narcissist. And the third is, well, what's the third? It's like he dreamt that the sun and the moon and the stars bowed down to him.

Speaker 3:          01:06:51       You might think about that two or three times so, but it's not necessarily something that's going to make you happy. And his brother and went to feed their father's flock and check him. So they took off and Israel said unto Joseph, you're not thy brethren, feed the flock and check him calm and I will send thee unto him. And he said him and he said to him, here, here tomorrow. And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near onto them, they conspired against him to slay him. Rough people act then, right? This is, this sort of thing is happening quite frequently. Um, and they said to one another, behold, the dreamer cometh. Come now, therefore let us slay him, cast him into some pit, and we will say some evil beast has devoured him and we shall see what becomes of his dreams. So there's an echo of the Cain and Abel story there. Obviously, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:07:46       It's not quite as clear because it indicate enables store able is clearly just doing well. And here you can't quite get a handle on Joseph's character. You can't tell if he is actually the elect or if he's just a spoiled Brat with delusions of grandeur. But it doesn't matter because his brothers, they're so irritated at his. The fact that he's favored and perhaps even the fact that he might be someone destined for something, that they find it perfectly reasonable to destroy that. And it's so hard. It's so interesting how often that motif of pulling down an ideal manifest itself in these old stories, right? It's the pattern is established in the Cain and Abel Story. It just repeats and repeats and repeats and I. I think that's dead true. I think it just repeats all the time so that people are annoyed about how tragic their lives are.

Speaker 3:          01:08:40       They're annoyed that they're subject to malevolence and they're annoyed that they're not doing as well as other people are doing and that makes them up, puts them exactly into this state of mind. Now, maybe with modern people, if you're going to kill someone because you're resentful as a modern person, you don't generally slay them and throw them into a pit. You know what you do is you just killed them slowly over a few decades and it isn't obvious to me that that's any better. So I've seen plenty of married couples who were in that situation. It's like, it's like there is this Mitch Hedberg he used to complain about Turtleneck, said it was like being strangled by a really weak midget, probably really politically incorrect jokes, but it's a funny joke. So, uh, and then you see, you see relationships that are like that. It's like each person has their hands around the neck of the other person, but they don't have enough courage to actually to squeeze it, just put enough pressure on to cut the circulation off a tiny bit. So the person just gets like a die over a 30 year period, something like that. So yeah, and you all laugh because, you know, it's true. That's why.

Speaker 3:          01:10:01       And we will say some evil beast has devoured him, which would be true actually. It would be the evil beast that's inside the brothers and we shall see what will become of his dreams. Huh. That's uh, that's interesting too because. So they want to spite themselves because maybe Joseph is something special and then they want to spite their farther, which is probably not the wisest idea because they owe him some gratitude. I mean, maybe he's acting like a pain in the neck. There's some evidence for that, but this is a little bit harsh, but they also want to spite God just like Cain did because that's what it means. We shall see what will become of his dreams, right? Because then as soon as you're, in some sense trying to fight against the intuition of someone, the natural intuition, if someone, you've set yourself up against the structure of being itself and so pretty bad, and Reuben heard it and he delivered them out of their hands and said, no, let us not kill them. And Ruben said unto them, shed no blood but cast him into this pit that's in the wilderness. It's like Reuben's the good guy in this story. And uh, and there's no water in the pit by the way, lay no hand upon him that he might read him out of their hands

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       to deliver him to his father again. So Robin was actually trying to save him steady, might read him out of their hands to deliver them to his father again. And it came to pass when Joseph came unto his brethren that they stripped him of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him, and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty and there was no water in it.

Speaker 2:          01:11:41       And then they sat down to eat bread and lifted up their eyes and looked and behold, a company of ishmaelites come came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and bomb and murmur going to carry it down to Egypt. And Judah said unto his brother, how does it profit us if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? So He's, he's the practical guy here. What? Why would we kill them when we can sell them? It's like, come let us sell him to the ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brother and we're content. Then they're passed by the midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver to amount that echoes through into the future. And they brought Joseph into Egypt. I've never really sure how these slavery stories work. It's like, so it's two 2,500, 3000 years ago, and I decided I'm going to sell you to the Israelites and that just works out. They I get the money, you get to be a slave and they take you away. I don't really understand how that works. I can't figure out how people were just selling each other all the time. But maybe if you're a family you can do it.

Speaker 2:          01:12:53       So there are. They sold him and Rubin returned to the pit. And behold Joseph was not there and Rubin rant is close. So Rubin's very upset about this. And he returned unto his brothers and said, the child is not in our. Where shall I go? And they conspired. They took Joseph's coat and killed a kid of the goats and dip the code in the blood. That's interesting too, because blood is actually another color, right? So he's got this coat of many colors and blood is definitely a color. And so this is the addition in some sense of the color of blood to Joseph's coat. And I would say it's probably a necessary color because I don't think that you're serious enough till your code has been dipped in blood. Now it can happen in many ways. And they sent the coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and said, so they lied to him.

Speaker 2:          01:13:44       It's very, very nasty business. This they. They sell his son to slavery. They claim that he's dead. They lie to them, they put them into an extreme state of grief. There's a lot of hatred underneath that write a tremendous amount of hatred for Joseph and also for Jacob. This we have found no. Now whether it be thy son's coat or not, and he knew it, he said, it's my son's coat and evil beast, has him. Joseph is without doubt, rent in pieces and Jacob Torres clothes and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for many days. And all his sons and daughters rose up to comfort them, either refused to be comforted. And he said, I'll go down into my grave. Morning, my son does. His father wept for. So that's Jacob collapsing at the news and the midianites sold Joseph into Egypt, onto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaohs and captain of the guard, and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, and the Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither. So now he's a slave.

Speaker 2:          01:14:59       So now you'd think, well that would be, this is a man who has a lot of reason to be irritated out the structure of reality, right? He's gone from being the favorite to being betrayed by all of his brothers. That's pretty rough. And then he's been transformed into a slave and now he's being. He's being sold to work as a slave. So you'd think that that would corrupt his character because you know, one of the things, I think this is the case anyways, I think people are always looking for an excuse to have their character corrupted. Because if your character is corrupted, then you get to lie and you get to cheat and you get to steal and you get to be trained. You get to act resentfully and he get to do nothing and that's all easy. It's easier to lie than to tell the truth.

Speaker 2:          01:15:39       It's easier to do nothing than to do something. So there's always part of you thinking, well, I need a justification for being useless and horrible because that. That'd be a lot less work. And so then if something terrible comes along, you think a high. That's just exactly the excuse that I was waiting for. And then out all that comes, you know, soldier should Ipsen when he was in the concentration camps in Russia watching how people behaved, you know, he said that there were people that were put in the camps who immediately became trustees are guards and they were even more vicious than the people who had been hired as guards. And his idea was that they had collected all that. He called it fallenness, if I remember correctly around them in normal life, but they didn't have the opportunity to express it. But as soon as you gave them the opportunity, it was like there. It was right away. And so, so one of the messages that seems to echo through these old testament stories is that just because something terrible happens to you doesn't mean that you get to be,

Speaker 2:          01:16:47       that you get to wander off the path and make things worse. And maybe it doesn't matter how terrible it is that what happens to you, that's a tough call, you know, because you see people now and then in life who they've really got it rough man, like 50 bad things are happening to them at the same time. And you think, oh, it's no wonder if you are bitter and resentful and hostile and be like, yeah, no wonder. But then you meet people and socialize again, talked about this in the Gulag archipelago. He said he met lots of people in not lot. He met enough people to impress him in the concentration camp system who didn't allow their misfortunes to corrupt them. And that's something man, because maybe the only real misfortune is to become corrupted. That's a really useful thing to think, you know, maybe the rest of it, maybe the rest of it is trivial in comparison.

Speaker 2:          01:17:35       I know that's a rough thing because you can be in very harsh circumstances, but I do think there's something to that and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master. The Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand. So that's an echo of the idea that we encountered earlier about walking with God. Right. So Adam walked with God before he ate the fruit with eve and then he wouldn't walk with God and they had noah walked with God and Abraham walked with God. And so the idea is, well, that's that alignment with the highest ideal. I think it's something like that. And you know, we could think about that as a metaphysical claim as well, but I don't think it is.

Speaker 2:          01:18:16       I mean, I've got thousands of letters now in the last year from people who have told me that they were in a pit. That's exactly right, and that they decided that they were going to try to put their lives together and that it worked, and so that's really something, you know, and they write surprised. It's like, well, I decided that I was going to work hard at what I was doing and I wasn't going to lie any more than absolutely necessary. I thought I'd give it a try for a few months, you know, and all sorts of good things started to happen. To me, it's like maybe that's how the world works now. Obviously it doesn't work like that all the time. Right. Because you can get sliced off at the knees. I mean there's an arbitrary element to existence that's that you can't wish away, but that doesn't mean that there are.

Speaker 2:          01:19:08       It doesn't mean that there aren't bad strategies and good strategies and so I do think that one of the most fundamental existential questions is like, if things aren't going well for you in your life is, are you absolutely certain that you're doing absolutely everything you can to put things in order? Because if you're not, then you shouldn't complain because you don't know to what degree you're actually contributing or even causing the circumstance. Now, that's a very annoying thing to think and I'm not trying to blame the victim. You know, I know that people end up with lung cancer because they were exposed to asbestos, you know, I'm not trying to. Although I also know too that if you have lung cancer because you've been exposed to asbestos, that can be a tragedy or it can be hell. And to some degree that depends on how you conduct yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:19:51       So I mean, I know that's pretty gloomy possibilities, right? But so anyways, so Joseph as a slave, but it turns out that he's a, he hasn't sacrifice the integrity of his character. And so it turns out that being it out, that he's not asleep, it's just that everyone around him thinks he's a slave, but he's not. So that's pretty interesting. He was a goodly person and well favored. Well, so he's a good guy and he's an impressive specimen as well. This is pretty interesting given the current political climate, I would say, and it came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said, lie with me. That means that actually has two meanings, right? But he refused and said unto his master's wife, behold, my master does not know what's with me in the house and he's committed all that he has to my hand. There is no one greater in this house than I. Neither has he kept back anything from me but you because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, wickedness, and sin against God.

Speaker 2:          01:21:10       And it came to pass that she speak to Joseph Day by day that he harkened not unto her to lie by her or be with her being sexually harassed. Joseph, and it came to pass. Well, it's, it's right. I mean, look, look at the painting and it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house they're within. And she caught him by his garment saying lie with me, and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out. So that's kind of embarrassing for poor Joseph, I would say, and a bit on the suspicious side. And it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth, that she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them, see, see he hath brought into Hebrew democracy.

Speaker 2:          01:22:01       He came in unto me, lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. So what is it Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. That's the proper commentary on that. And it came to pass when he heard that, I lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got himself out. And it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife. So that's the Faro, which he spake unto him, saying, after this manner did thy servant to me, his wrath was kindled. And Joseph's master took him and put him in prison. A place where the king's prisoners were was, were bound and he was there in the prison. Well, that sort of socks. It's like first his brothers betray him and throw him in a pit and then he gets made a slave, which is probably better than being in the pit and then he becomes sort of like king slave.

Speaker 2:          01:22:49       So that's working out pretty well and now someone lies about him. He gets betrayed again and now it's into the prison with them and so it's this. It's this again, right? It's the same thing. It's sisyphus up with the Rock and then down and its order, chaos, order chaos, and then you have to think, well, are you the order? Are you the chaos or you the thing that's moving between them because that's the right thing to be because otherwise you're just ordering. That's a really bad idea or you're just chaos and that's a really bad idea. You can be the thing that's dynamically mediating between them and that's what he's doing, but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. That's no easy thing to do. I would think, you know, it's like you're thrown in prison and now the jailer likes you.

Speaker 2:          01:23:38       How exactly are you going to manage that much good thing to think about because you might think, well, if you are really in dire straits, how is it that you should conduct yourself so that you have the highest probability of having things work out and it's not saying, well, Joseph took over the thumb screw, you know, and started using that on the other prisoners that that's not the indication here at all. It's that he's doing something. He's acting like a person who isn't a prisoner even though he's in the prison, just like he was acting like someone who wasn't a slave when he was a slave, and so it makes you wonder who you can be despite the fact that other people think that you're whatever you appear to be. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand. All the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it. The keeper of the prison look not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that which he did. The Lord made it to prosper.

Speaker 2:          01:24:39       So it's a repeat. It's a repeat of exactly what happened when he was the slave of the pharaoh, except it's one rung deeper into hell, so to speak. Right? So it's slave pharaoh, adherence, prisoner, jail, master. But it doesn't matter. The same thing happens. So now Joseph has imprisoned and the Pharaoh has a fit one day of peak and throws the chief of his Butler's into prison. And the chief of his bakers and they have a dream. Each of them. And, uh, Joseph interprets the dreams, seems to be something that he can do. And he tells the Butler that history means that the fair was going to forgive him and put him back in his position. And he tells the baker that the Pharaoh isn't going to forgive him and that he's going to take off his head and hang them in a tree, which is rather rough dream. But that is what, that's what happens. So anyways, that the baker or the Butler goes free and Joseph says, look, you know, maybe you could just keep in mind the fact that I did do a bit of a favor here and told you something that was accurate, but the chief didn't really remember once. He. Once he was freed interpreting dreams in prison,

Speaker 2:          01:25:54       and so now the pharaoh has a dream and he actually asked to dreams. So it's another one of those doubled motifs. So the idea is these are really important dreams because they came in a pair and behold there came out of the river seven well favored kind and fat flesh. So cattle and they fed in the meadow. Meadow and behold, seven other cattle came up after the motor of the river ill favored and lean, fleshed, starving and stood by the other cows on the brink of the river. And the ill favored and lean fleshed kind did eat up the seven well favored and fat. So feral it woke fair enough. It's pretty nasty dream. And then he has another dream to two headed home and he slept and dreamt the second time. And behold, seven years of corn came up upon one stock rank and good and behold, seven thin years and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them and the seventh thin yours devoured the seven rank and full years and pharaoh woke and beheld it was a dream and then it says a little later and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice.

Speaker 2:          01:27:02       It is because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it to pass. It's interesting because one of the better theories about dreams is that they're part of the way that the right and left hemisphere communicate, or maybe the nonverbal part of the brain communicates with the verbal brand, verbal part of the brain, and so the nonverbal part of the brain which is less differentiated and things more globally, is looking for patterns and anomalies in the world. Things that don't fit well with the current way of conceptualizing the world. Things that make you anxious and uncertain, and those are things you haven't mastered, right? So they don't fit well into your conception of realization of the world by definition. Because if you had mastered them, they wouldn't make you anxious, nervous, and so the the nonverbal parts of your brain or like an alarm system, they're looking around for places where you're probably wrong and then they put those in images and try to conceptualize them so that you can update your model of reality to take them into account, but that also produces a fair bit of negative emotion, especially at night and so, so we know that we know if you deprive people of dreams that they go insane very rapidly.

Speaker 2:          01:28:15       Animals as well, necessary part of mental equilibrium. The way you do that with rats in case you want to know is that you've got rats that you want to drive and saying this is how you do it. So you put the rat on a like a pedestal. It's pretty small. And then when he fall, that's surrounded by water and then when he falls asleep, his nose hits the water. Then he wakes up and so you can deprive the route of sleep and that doesn't. The rats don't respond to that very well after some period of time. So that's one of the ways that that's been discovered, but anyways, the dream does seem to be an update mechanism and so if, if, if you have a very powerful dream, like a nightmare, especially if it's repeating, it's like something is trying to hammer on the door that needs to be let in and often you don't know how to let it in and that's, that's a problem.

Speaker 2:          01:29:04       So then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph because he had talked to his, his butler, and they brought them hastily out of the dungeon and Joseph shaved himself and changed his clothes and came in unto Pharaoh. I guess he didn't want to shock pharaoh with how people dressed in a prison. And Pharaoh said Unto Joseph, I've dreamed a dream and there's none that can interpret it. I've heard safety that you can understand a dream to interpret it. And Joseph said, it's not me. God will give Pharaoh announcer of peace. It's so Jacob isn't taking credit for his ability to interpret dreams, which also indicates quite interestingly, there's, there's nothing to, despite the fact that he's successful and competent, he's not narcissistic. If he happens to have this gift, he regards it as a gift and not as something that you. He renounced his favorites, just something that he happens to be able to do, and so that's, that's a hallmark of someone who's got a pretty well put together personality as far as I'm concerned because you know people have gifts that they didn't really earn. Those will be your talents, your intelligence, your good looks if you happen to have good looks, etc. And they're not. There's no sense being All puffed up about that because it's. It's great. It's luck of the draw though, and the proper attitude is to note that it's luck of the draw and to be grateful for it.

Speaker 2:          01:30:30       It's quite a fine painting that one hold there. Come seven years of great, plenty throughout the island of Egypt and then there shall arise after seven years of famine and all the plenti shall be forgotten and the famine shall consume the land and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievous.

Speaker 2:          01:30:54       So now we see to that jacob. Well, he can interpret dreams, but he's also the sort of person who can look into the future and think this is sort of what adam was called on to do when he got kicked out of the garden of paradise is you're going to be able to conceptualize that even if things are going well now that that doesn't mean that they're going to go well into the future. And so he's The ant and the grasshopper, right in the grasshopper and the ants story. It's like everything's good, but you should wake the hell up and you should test to see how things can go wrong and you can see if your systems can survive them. Things going wrong and which is something that I think we could all harken tube because I think we do a very bad job in the modern world of testing to see if our systems can go wrong. Okay. So the pharaoh was pretty impressed by this dream interpretation and pretty worried about it and I guess he's a reasonable person, despite the fact that he put joseph in jail, uh, gifts. He didn't have much choice. Now therefore, let pharaoh look for a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of Egypt. Let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land. This is what joseph was saying, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years

Speaker 2:          01:32:10       and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities

Speaker 2:          01:32:18       and just like that joseph has restored to his position. So pharaoh said unto joseph, I am pharaoh, and without these shall no man lifted up his hand or foot in all of the land of Egypt, and so he comes out of the prison and he really, in some sense, as far as I'm concerned, he actually occupies a position that's higher than the position of the pharaoh. It depends on how you look at it because the pharaoh is relegated himself to ceremonial status, right? Joseph has all the responsibility, makes all the decisions. So defacto, he's the pharaoh. He doesn't get the glory precisely, although he's not doing too bad for himself. Now there's a lesson in that too. I wrote these rules for corp a long time ago and one of them, I have written them into this, some of them into this book you guys got a pamphlet about today.

Speaker 2:          01:33:06       One of the rules that I didn't write about was, um, note that responsive it note that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated, which is really interesting. I think. I mean, I've seen people in their jobs, they say things like, well, my guy worked with doesn't do any work. It's like, well, you could do it. I mean, I know there's limits to that, but one of their things you can do at work is make yourself indispensable. I mean, you might get the cane types against you if you do that, but there's something to be said for being indispensable because when people start to be dispensed with you probably won't be one of them. Or even If you are, then the fact that you're indispensable just means you can go somewhere else and be indispensable there. Now it's just as useful. So it's very, very difficult to permanently put down someone who's really good at doing things because they can just go off and do them somewhere else. And one of the ways that you get like that is to take responsibility when someone else is failing to do so and you think, well, I shouldn't have to do that. That's one way of thinking about it. Another way of thinking about it is, oh good, I get to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:34:17       And the seven years of plenty isness that was in the land of Egypt were ended in the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph has said. And the dearth was in all the lands. Well, that's an archetypal story, right? The archetypal story. It's the business cycle story. It's a little harsher when you're starving, obviously, but that's not the point. The point is, is that sometimes things are getting good and sometimes things are getting bad and that's you can be sure that that's the case that's going to happen to you. And so the wise person takes stock of the fact that things are going to get bad. Is this is the same thing that happens with noah? It's like assume the flood because it's going to happen and you think, well, it's a hell of a world that has floods. It's not if you have a boat, right? It helps a lot. If if there's a flood and you have a boat, it's like you can float on the flood and then it's not such a problem, and so if you refuse to look out the fact that things are going to be going downhill badly and that you're going to be in a pit at some point, you and your family perhaps then when it happens, it will be as bad as it possibly can be, but if you're awake and alert to that possibility, then you can mitigate it.

Speaker 2:          01:35:44       And the dearth was in all the lands. But in the land of Egypt there was bread and when the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto the egyptians, go to joseph. What? He says to you too, do you do that? And the fireman was all over the face of the earth. And joe boo, joseph opened up the store houses and sold to the egyptians, and the feminine waxed sore in the land of Egypt and all the countries came into Egypt to buy to joseph to buy corn because the famine was soaring all the lands. Now, when jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, jacob said unto his sons, why are you standing around looking at each other? He said, I've heard that there's corn in Egypt. Get down there and I from a buyer for us so that we may live and not die.

Speaker 2:          01:36:30       It's pretty straightforward advice that. And joseph's 10 brothers went down to buy corn in Egypt, but benjamin, joseph's brother. So that's the youngest one, right? The only one left. That's the one that was younger than joseph. The only youngest one, and also rachel's other son. But Jeff Benjamin, joseph's brother jacob didn't send because he was worried that something bad would happen to him, which kind of indicates to me that maybe jacob was a bit suspicious about what had happened to joseph the last time he sent all the brothers on a adventure. Joseph was the governor over all the land and and he, It was that sold to all the people of the land in joseph's brothers came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth. While there's the dream. Now the thing is too, is that one question you have in your life is who should you bow down to?

Speaker 2:          01:37:25       And you might say no one, but that's not exactly the right answer because that means that you don't have an ideal because you bow down to your ideal. That's what makes it an ideal. And if you don't have an ideal, then what the hell are you going to do? So you have to bow down to something. And so what happens here as well, the brothers are bowing down to the person who is so bloody resilient and competent that they can take themselves out of a prison and become the ruler of the land that happened to vaclav havel, right in czechoslovakia. It also happened to, um, mandela, South Africa, like these things actually happened. It's really something. So you'd, god only knows what you might learn in prison. So, so they bow down to joseph and properly so you know he's, he is even without his coat, he's still the person with a coat of many colors and joseph saw his brothers and he knew them, but he made themselves strange onto them. It's a number of years have passed and he spoke roughly onto the mini, said down to them, where do you Come from? And they said, from the land of canaan to buy food. And joseph knew whose brothers were but they didn't know who he was

Speaker 2:          01:38:34       and they came back to jacob their father and told him all that and said, the man who is lord of the country spoke roughly to us and took us for spies. And we said to him, we're, we're true, man. Honest man were not spies. We be 12 brothers, sons of our fathers. One is not. And the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan. And the man said, here's how I'll know that you're honest, man. Leave one of the brothers here with me and take some food for the famine of your households and be gone. And then bring your youngest brother to me.

Speaker 2:          01:39:09       Then I'll know that you're not spies, but that you're honest, man, and I'll deliver the other brother and you shall trade in the lounge so you don't have to starve to death. And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every man's bundle of money in his sock. And when both say in their fathers, saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. So they had bought food from joseph and he gave them the food and then he put all their money back in their socks, which I can imagine would worry them to some degree. and jacob said, me, you have already bereaved of my childrEn. Joseph is not as is. Not now. You'll take benjamin, benjamin away. All these things are against me. And ruben spake unto his father, saying, slay my two sons. If I bring him not to the, deliver them into my hand and I will bring them to the again

Speaker 2:          01:39:55       and he. And he said, nope. My son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead. And he's left alone. If mischief befall him by the way in which you shall go, then you shall bring down my greer or gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. Now there's a hand. See what happens in the last part of the jacob storage. The joseph story is, and this is associated with the idea of putting your house in order your individual house in order, and then putting your family's house in order. Let's say it's reversed a little bit, this story because joseph puts himself together and then he puts the state of of Egypt in order, which is really quite interesting because Egypt is the canonical tyranny right in the old testament. And so the idea is very, very clear here that the person who wears the coat of many colors can put the tyranny right, and then the next extension as well, he has to put his family right now.

Speaker 2:          01:40:45       You know, generally the progression would be put yourself right. Then put your family right, then put the state right, something like that. It doesn't really. If you can do it in a different order, that's probably okay too. But so, so that's what happens at the end of the story is that, you know, joseph is doing pretty damn well and so is the state that he serves, but that isn't good enough for him. He wants his family to be functional and put together properly even though they did terrible things to him. And that's very interesting because once someone does terrible things to you, then the logical thing or a logical thing to think as well go to hell in a hand basket. You know, like you, you deserve exactly what you get, but

Speaker 2:          01:41:31       it's not a very productive attitude, especially if you're around people that you have to be around, you know. So like if it's your family and you go have a family dinner and one of you punches the other and then the other punches you back, and then that's like the family dinner for the next 30 years. It doesn't seem to be very productive. Even if you're the person who happened to get into the last blow because you're going to have to put up with them at minimum. It might be nice to just let what you can go go and work to make towards making things better. You have to get rid of the idea of revenge and resentment and all those things that you carry along, but,

Speaker 2:          01:42:12       but it's probably better to think about how your family could be if it was really functioning well and then just aim unerringly of that. I know that's not easy. I mean people are very screwy and there's no end to the depths of pathology within families, but of course this story states that very clearly. I mean they tried to kill them. They sold him into slavery. It's, it's a pathological family, let's put it that way. And, but joseph's attitude is, well, we got to set this right, not least because of his father, but it isn't only because of his father. As you see, as the story unfolds and the famine was sore in the land and it came to pass when they had eaten up the court in which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, go again and bias a little food.

Speaker 2:          01:43:00       And judah spake unto him, saying, the man did solidly protest on you, not you will not see my face except your brother be with you. They can't go back to Egypt without benjamin. And they said, the man asked is straightly of our eight other kindred saying, is your father yet alive? Have you another brother? And we told them according to the tenor of those words, could we know that he would say, bring your brother down? and judas said unto Israel, his father, send the lab with me and will arise and go, that we may live and not die. Both we and vowel and also our little ones, I will be surety for him. My hand shell, they'll require him if I bring them onto the inset them before the lesson. Let me bear the blame forever.

Speaker 2:          01:43:44       Well, so judah who played a pretty dismal role in the original selling joseph into seems to obviously have learned something by this point since he's willing to put himself on the line, you know, to take responsibility for the situation and to put himself on the line and to stand in for benjamin. So he's making himself into a sacrificial object of sorts, and so the game that joseph's playing, because he sort of teasing his brothers, but he's also testing them. The game that he's playing is twofold. One is have you bloody well learned anything or are you just as corrupt and useless as you were before? That's game number one. Then game number two is maybe if I poke and prod you and put you into a relatively difficult and mysterious situation, I can get you to clue the hell in and adopt some responsibility and we can move this whole mess forward.

Speaker 2:          01:44:37       And so that seems to be happening. So judah is taking responsibility. And ruben did that as well and the men took presence and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin Rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before joseph. When joseph saw benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, bring these men home and slay and make ready food for these men shall dine with me at noon. And the men mandate is joseph bade in the man brought them in into joseph's house. And when joseph came home, they brought them the presence which was in their hand and bowed themselves again to him, to the earth, and he asked them of their welfare and said, is your father well, the old man of whom you speak is whom he spake as a yet alive. And they answered thy servant, our father is in good health. He's yet alive. And they bow down their heads and made obeisance.

Speaker 2:          01:45:29       And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin, his mother's son, and said, is this your younger brother, of whom you speak unto me? And he said, god, be gracious unto thee. My son and joseph made haste for his bowels, did urine upon his brother, and he sought were to weep. And he entered into his chamber and wept there. And he washed his face and went out and reframed himself and said, set on the bread. And they sat before them. Now he plays another trick on his brother. So he has them all sit at the table, but he lines them up according to age. And so he started to. What is he trying to do? Sort of freaked them out fundamentally and so at an imanage is that because they have no idea how in the world they could possibly he could possibly pull something like that or if they think it's magic and the men marveled at one another and he took and sent messages unto them from before him, but benjamin's mess was five times as much as any of theirs.

Speaker 2:          01:46:24       So what's he doing? Well, he's testing his brothers again. The fact that when he was the child joseph, that he got more meant that his brothers got terribly Jealous and then murderous. Right? And so now he's doing the same thing with benjamin. He's thinking, okay, well I'll give this kid more than his share and a watch how these reprobates and see if they've learned anything and so and he commanded the steward of his house saying, fill the men sock with food as much as they can carry and put every man's money in the sock as well. And put my cup, the silver cup in the sax mouth of the youngest and his corn money. And the steWard did according to the word that joseph had spoken. As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away along with their transportation. The big cup is found in benjamin sack. Well, so benjamin's kinda young. And

Speaker 2:          01:47:26       joseph sends out people to find out where the company's going and they find it in benjamin's, in benjamin sock. And they're very upset about this. They said that a harsh punishment would be fall. Whoever had the cop in his sack, they rent their clothes and late at every man his ass and returned to this city and judah and his brothers came to joseph's house for he was out there and they fell before I'm on the ground, very unhappy and apologetic. And joseph said unto them, what need is this that you have done? I don't you know that a man like I can certainly divine. I know what's going on. And she would've said, what shall we say? What shall we speak? Or how could we possibly clear ourselves? God found out the iniquity of thy servants. Behold we are your servants, both we and also he with whom the cup is found and he said, god forbid that I should do so, but the man in whose cup and whose hand the companies found he shall be my servant. And as for you, get you up in peace to your father. It's the discovery of the cup.

Speaker 2:          01:48:39       Judah says, now, therefore, when I come to this servant, my father, my father and the loud be not with us and seeing that his life is bound up in the clouds. Life. It shall come to pass. When he sees that the loud is not with us, that he will die and the servant shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant. Our father with sorrow to the grave, for thy servant became security for the latin to my father saying, if I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame too. My father forever. Now therefore I pray thee. Let me stay instead of the lab and let the lord go with his brothers for how shall I go up to my brother and allowed to be not with me. Let's pair adventure. I shall see the evil that will come on my father.

Speaker 2:          01:49:21       Okay, so what's happened? Well, they learned their lesson. So now judah again is willing to stand in the place of benjamin and become a slave himself. And so now joseph has determined that his brothers have developed their character to the point where reconciliation might be possible. You know, it says you should forgive and forget, but the conditions for that are quite, are quite specific. You know, if you're, if you have a dispute with someone, they've wronged you in some sense and they apologize. The question is, well, what's the apology? Well, it's a layout of a rationale. It's something like, as far as I can tell, here's the reasons I did this horrible thing and here's what I've learned from it and here's what I'm going to do to try not to do it again. And would you give me another crack at it? That's the proper repentance, right?

Speaker 2:          01:50:19       And then you forgive because you're an idiot too, and you'll probably do something stupid and maybe you'd like the same kind of break at some point. And and besides, if we all held each other completely to Account at all possible times for everything, then it just be hopeless because there'd be no room for error. So if forgiveness, which joseph is showing is why is forgiveness, he's not going to put himself out on the line for people who haven't learned so that the same stupid thing can happen again so that they can continue to spread misery wherever they go. He's going to find out if they've clued in a little bit and then if so, then they can move on with putting a family together. And so that breaks them up. He says, joseph could not refrain. Refrain himself before all of them that stood by him and he cried. And then he said, get every man away from me.

Speaker 2:          01:51:10       So all the people except for joseph's brother left and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brothers. Joseph said, I'm joseph is my father is still alive. And his brothers could not answer for they were troubled at his presence. It's like, yeah, understatement of the decade there. And joseph said unto his brothers, come near to me. I pray you. And they came near and he said, I am joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt, but don't be grieved or angry with yourself that you sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life. So now it was not you that sent me here but god, and he's made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house in a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. Hurry and go to my father and say unto him, thus say they son joseph, god has made me lord of all Egypt.

Speaker 2:          01:52:07       Come down onto me and terry naught and thou shall dwell in the land of goshen and now shall be near unto me, thou and thy children and their children's children and their flocks and herds and all that thou hast. And either I will nourish you for yet there are five years of famine, less dow and I household and all that. Thou has come to poverty, so that's the other thing that another bit of a hint that the bread hint here, who's the what's the most reliable source of bread? Well, it isn't bread itself. It's whatever it is that gives rise to bread and what joseph is in this story. He's the force that gives ride rise to nourishment. That's an joseph is often considered a type of christ, which means like a precursor in some sense that's. That's one way of thinking about it and you can see that echoed right there.

Speaker 2:          01:53:00       It's like, well, what do you store up for? Famine. You store up character. That's the best way through. Now that doesn't mean you don't also store up bread and they went out of egyPt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob and told him joseph is still alive and he's governor and jacob's heart fainted for he didn't believe them and they told him all the words of joseph, which he said to them, and when he saw the wagons, which joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of jacob, their father revived and Israel said, it has enough. Joseph, my son is he had live. I will go and see him before I die, and Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father, isaac and god spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said, jacob, and he said, here am I.

Speaker 2:          01:53:48       He said, I am god, the god of my father. Don't fear to go to each down into Egypt for I will make you a great nation there. And so that's how the israelites ended up in Egypt. I will go down with the into Egypt and I will also surely bring the up again and jacob shall put his hand upon his dies and Jacob Rose up from beersheba and the sons of Israel carry jacob their father and the little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry. So the families now all united in the proper state of being that joseph has raged and they took their cattle and their goods. It's so interesting too because of course joseph isn't even. He's a foreigner as well as being a former slave and prisoner, foreigner, slave and prisoner, and yet he ends up ruling Egypt sheer sheerly because of the force of his character and competence and that's really something to think about and they took their cattle because that story there is that there isn't anything stronger than that.

Speaker 2:          01:54:45       Doesn't matter what the circumstances are that there isn't a forest that's more powerful not, and I don't think that that's naive. In fact, I think it's the exact opposite of naive. No matter where you are, you can generally make things better if that's what you want to do and unless you're in some place that's really hell itself, not usually is something that elevates you and elevates the people around you and you can do that wherever you are because there isn't a place that's so small that you can't do that. That's the message of the prison and they took their cattle and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into Egypt. Jacob and all his seed with him and he sent judah before a month to joseph to direct his face onto gosh, and then they came into the land of goshen and joseph made ready his chariot and went to meet Israel, his father and presented himself to them and fell on his neck and wept on his neck.

Speaker 2:          01:55:43       A good while and Israel said, I can now die because I've seen your face because you're still alive, and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying that father and thy brethren, they're coming to the land of Egypt is before the in the best of the land. Your father and brothers can dwell in the land of gosh and let them do well, and if the now know any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle. It gives them a job. And joseph brought in jacob his father and set up before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh. That's a very interesting little turn of events because you'd expect the opposite under those circumstances. So it appears that jacob was a man of relatively great self-possession because that's not a. You wouldn't blast queen elizabeth. In all likelihood, as you had a lot of gall and pharaoh said unto jacob, how old are you?

Speaker 2:          01:56:37       And jacob said, I'm 130 years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life and I've not attained into the days of the years of my life, of my father's, in the days of their pilgrimage. And jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh and the Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of gosh, and and grew and multiplied exceedingly. And jacob lived in the land of Egypt. Seventeen years. So the whole age of jacob was 147 years. And the time drew nigh that Israel must die. And he called his son. Joseph said unto him, if I have now found grace in thy sight, put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me, bury me. Not I pray thee in Egypt, but I will lie with my father's. now shall carry me out of Egypt and burnaby.

Speaker 2:          01:57:26       And they're burying place. And joseph said, I will do, as you've said. And it came to pass after these things that one told joseph, behold I father is sick, and he took with him his two sons, madison ephram and one told jacob and said, behold thy son, and one told jacob and said, behold thy son, joseph cometh unto thee, and Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed. And he Israel said unto joseph, I'd not thought to see your face and low. god has also showed me your children. And joseph brought them out from between his knees and out himself with his face to the earth. And joseph took them both a in his right hand towards israel's lefthand and madison is lefthand toward Israel, his right hand and brought them near unto him. And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon eh firms had who was the younger and his left upon madness's had guiding his hands purposefully for madison was the first born.

Speaker 2:          01:58:21       And when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of ephraim, it displeased him. And he held up his father's hand to remove it from him. Firms had under my head and joseph said unto his father, not, not so my father for this is the first board put the right hand upon his head, head at his father, refused and said, I know it my son. I know it. he shall also be my people and he shall also be great, but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. Another repeat of the same thing that happens continually. It's. It's when, when god wants to intervene in human affairs, what he does is invert tradition at something like that, and so that's a sign that there's something new and special going on and that gives precedence to the younger child rather than the older child precedent to what is new rather than what's traditional.

Speaker 2:          01:59:10       Of course, sometimes that's necessary because tradition is insufficient and sometimes something new has to come into being in order to update it. And jacob called together his sons and said, gathered together so that I can tell you that which shall befall you in the last days, gather yourself together and here you sons of jacob and hearkened unto Israel your father, ruben. I'm not going to go through all 12 of these rubin, thou art, my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power. Now the story's quite interesting here because jacob blesses joseph's sons before he blesses his own sons, and so what he's doing is placing the rights of the firstborn into the sons of his favorite son. And then he goes to his sons. And so that has implications for the way the biblical stories laid themselves out from thence forward the excellent of dignity in the excellency of power, unstable as water.

Speaker 2:          02:00:13       Thou shalt not excel because that went has stopped to thy father's bed. Then defiled it. He went up to my couch. You may remember that ruben slept with his fathers, cucumber, ca, concubine. Simeon and levi are brethren. Instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. So that painting there, what happened with simeon and levi was that somebody lay with her sister diana, and then offered to marry her and then had and then became circumcised because that was part of the deal and then how to older men circumcised. And then simeon and levi went in when they were recovering and killed them all. And then jacob and all his people had to leave because all that irritated their relatives. So see me. Simeon and levi are brethren, instruments of cruelty or in their habitations oh my soul. Come out now into their secret. Until their assembly might honor, be not thou united.

Speaker 2:          02:01:15       For in their anger they slew a man and in their self self will they dig down a wall, cursed be their anger, for it was fierce and their route for it was cruel. I will divide them in jacob and scattered them in Israel. Judah, thou art, he who? My brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of dynamics that father's children shall bow down before the judah is alliance help from the prey. My son art gone up. He stooped down. He couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rosa bump the sceptre shall not depart from judah, nor a law giver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well whose branches run over the wall. The archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him, but his bowl abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of jacob.

Speaker 2:          02:02:11       For then since the shepherd, the stone of Israel, even by the god of my father who shall help the and by the almighty who shall bless thee with the blessings of heavens above blessings of the deep that a thunder blessings of the beasts. Breasts in the womb, the blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting health. They shall be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brother and all. These are the 12 tribes of Israel. And this is it that they're farther spake unto them and blessed them. Everyone according to his blessing, he blessed them so that what we see here is an echo in some sense of what happens in the mesopotamian creation story. When the mesopotamian creation story is the dragon of chaos tie matt and her consort appsu freshwater and saltwater respectively in they're mingled together.

Speaker 2:          02:03:11       and, and that combination of chaos and order, it gives rise to the first assembly of the ancient gods. And then the ancient gods kill appsu casually and foolishly and enraged, tie a mat with their foolishness and ignorance. And she comes back with a vengeance in the meantime. And then she produces this huge army of monsters and puts king knew the worst of the monsters out its head and that decides she's going to take out her creation. And so that's a little warning from 3000 years ago about foolishly undermining your tradition. so anyways, the gods in their friends and go out and try to fight against high mountain. They come back with their tails between their legs continually. But then a new god appears on the scene. And that's marduk and he's got eyes all the way around his head and he can speak words of magic and they know that there's something new about this newest god.

Speaker 2:          02:04:10       It's his capacity for vision in this capacity for articulate speech. And so they say, well, why don't you go out and try to deal with the chaos? And mark says, yeah, okay, no problem, but here's the deal. You elect me, top god, and now I determine the destiny of the world. And so they're desperate because like thai, matt is coming to get them. That's chaos with the worst of all possible bonsers. They're probably thinking he's not going to win anyways. And so they agree and how he goes and he confronts timeout. He was the goddess of chaos and he cuts her into pieces and he makes the world out of her pieces. And one of his names is he who makes ingenious things out of the combat with tire math, which is so interesting. That's such a remarkable. That's a remarkable bit of nomenclature. So who's should be at the pinnacle, the forest that sees and speaks and goes out to confront chaos voluntarily.

Speaker 2:          02:05:06       You know how many years it took people to figure that out. That's like the pinnacle discovery of humanity. That's what that is. And it's echoed here. You know, you see simeon and levi are too angry. The other brothers, they all have flaws and faults of various sorts and so they're not elevated to the highest place, but joseph, because he has his coat of many colors and because he lands on his feet, no matter where he goes and because he's not resentful and bitter and malevolent and genocidal and, and he's not shaking his fist at the sky or yelling at god because of trump, let's say. Then he's the, he's the right, he's the right representative of the 12 tribes. And so that's brilliant. It's a brilliant story.

Speaker 2:          02:05:53       All these are the 12 tribes of Israel and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them. Everyone according To his blessing, he blessed them when jacob had made an end of commanding his son. So it's the last thing he does to state. He knows that these are the 12 tribes that will progress into the future of this people and now he's trying it. The last thing he does is to try to hierarchically organize their relative virtues as an indication of what has been learned and when jacob has made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered unto his people. And joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him. And joseph commanded his servants to the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed Israel.

Speaker 2:          02:06:43       When the days of his morning we're past joseph's spake unto the house of pharaoh sayIng, if now I have found grace in your eyes speak, I pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying, my father made me swear of saying low. I die in my grave, which I have digged for me in the land of canaan. There shalt thou burry me now, therefore, let me go up. I pray thee and bury my father and I will come again. And pharaoh said, go up and bury thy father according as he made these swear for his son's, carried them into the land of canaan and bury them in the cave of the field of mac pella, which abraham bought with the field for a possession of, of burying place of effort on the hittite before mammary and joseph returned into Egypt. He and his brother and all that went up to him and that all and all that went up with him to bury his father after he is brewed, after he had buried his father.

Speaker 2:          02:07:32       And when joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, joseph will now hate us and will certainly pay back to us all the evil which we did unto him. And they sent a messenger saying, my father did command before he died, saying four shall say unto joseph, forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin pretty sniffily. Really for tHey did unto thee evil. and now we pray thee. Forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father. And joseph wept when they spake unto him, and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said, behold, we be thy servants. And joseph said unto them, fear not for am I in the place of god, but as for you, you thought evil against me, but god meant it unto good to bring, to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. Now, therefore fear not I will nourish you and your little ones. And he comforted them and spake kIndly unto them. So the the idea there is that there is no evil, so evil that good cannot triumph over it.

Speaker 2:          02:08:54       And joseph dwelt in Egypt. He and his father's house and joseph lived 110 years. And joseph saw frms children of the third generation. The children also have makir the son of menace that were brought up upon joseph's knees. And joseph said unto his brethren, I die and god will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land where he swore to abraham, to isaac and jacob and joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying, god will surely visit you and she'll end you shall carry my bones from hence. So joseph died being 110 years old and they embalmed him and he was put into a coffin in Egypt. And that's genesis. So

Speaker 1:          02:09:40       thank you.

Speaker 2:          02:09:53       So thank you all for persevering.

Speaker 1:          02:09:55       Thank you.

Speaker 2:          02:10:25       Thank you. Thank you. This has been very worthwhile. As far as I'm concerned, I learned an awful lot and so I'm very much looking forward to continuing it and thank you all very much for your support and your rapt attention and your seriousness in this endeavor and your care and all of that. It's really been a privilege to be able to do this. It's a completely surreal thing to manage. And uh, so far, you know, I think about 5 million people have watched it. So that's seems to be a very good thing. So

Speaker 1:          02:10:58       thank you.

Speaker 2:          02:11:07       I'm going to ask the question, if you've asked a question in the last three sessions, please don't ask a question today because I never get through everyone and so I'd like to have some questions from people that I haven't answered questions from before, if that's okay.

Speaker 4:          02:11:25       I professor peterson, just a two second. Thank you very much for my community and the jewish community. So many people who have been inspired by you to be better people and I wouldn't be able to speak to without saying that. So thank you very much. A couple of things. The first thing I wanted to do is make a quick comment that you might find interesting that in the jewish astrological calendar, um, we read the yearly cycle of the five books of moses and it just so happens that we are reading this, a part of the, of the twitter story that very interesting. that's cool. And synchronistic, which brings me into a question that I wanted to ask you about, which is one question with two parts about your knowledge of, of, of hebrew, um, because if you look at the torah scrolls that you find in a synagogue, there are no vowels, there are no sentences. There. It is a, it is chaos, chaos and order is trying to be bought into it. I'm wondering how knowledge of you knowledgeable are you of the hebrew which has many layers of, of, of dimensional,

Speaker 2:          02:12:19       staggeringly ignorant of it. So, you know, I, I read a lot of commentaries, right? I'm trying to zero in on the, like with each of the phrases that we went through today, I probably looked at 10 different commentaries and so, and then I have this underlying psychoanalytic knowledge that it's sort of like if you have a bunch of different templates to look at things through and then something shines through all those templates at the same time, that's very unlikely. And sO then you can know a coincidence is one thing, but five coincidence is that's no longer a coincidence. That's something else. And so I think I'm hoping that despite the fact that there's many, many things that I don't know that there's enough things that I do know to kind of weave my way through this with some degree of utility, if not certainty.

Speaker 4:          02:13:13       Yeah. BecauSe I just was just the second part, which I guess maybe you don't know that the, the jewish oral stories that date back almost as long as these stories which fill in a lot of mindblowingly crazy random and so many details about these stories. And I was just wondering if you had encountered any of them before.

Speaker 2:          02:13:28       I've encountered some of them, but again, it's a, it's well as you know, it's a very, very rich tradition. And so I haven't encountered enough of it. Were you thinking of anything in sPecific specifically in relationship to this story?

Speaker 4:          02:13:43       Not in particular. I actually forgot it. I was, I was intending to bring you a, a book of majestic store. That's a hell of a thing to say now. Well, it just, I dunno, I, I felt like I had to say that. Um, but yeah, maybe for the exodus version I'll bring you back.

Speaker 2:          02:13:59       All right. That would be good. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:14:04       Hi, Dr. Peterson, I would just like to ask you to please talk about what you called a psychic death, also known as an ego death.

Speaker 2:          02:14:13       Okay. Sorry. Say that again.

Speaker 5:          02:14:14       Would you please talk about what young refer to as a psychic death also called an ego death.

Speaker 2:          02:14:22       That's what happens when someone who loves you betrays you. Right? So imagine that. Like the world is complicated beyond comprehension, right? When you only see a very little bit of it and the way you structured your understanding is you make assumptions about things and they're simplifying assumptions. So if you trust someone, you reduce their complexity massively, right? Because like, let's say we were married, then there's a whole bunch of ways that you're going to act that are going to be simpler. Okay. So then I can tolerate being around you in some sense because you're not everything at once.

Speaker 2:          02:15:03       Now those simplifying structures are hierarchically assembled and some of them are far more important than others. Trust is one of them, especially trust in loved ones, family members, which is why I'd be trailed by a family member, is really catastrophic because it destabilizes your past, right? All the memories you have, it destabilizes your present. It destabilizes your future is shakes your faith in human beings including yourself and everything collapses and that's an ego death and so now underneath the ego as far as young was concerned, was another structure that he called the self and the self is this thing that remains constant across ego deaths, but it's. It's deeper and less personal. It's architectural and it's the thing that the eagle collapses into when it collapses and then rebuIlds the ego, something like that across time, but that's when an ego death is now. There's variants of that because you can have a voluntary or involuntary ego death and a voluntary ego.

Speaker 2:          02:16:08       Death is when you learn a bunch and you're willing to let go, so that would be your own emulation. It's like your lighting, your, your a phoenix, and your lighting yourself on fire. That's a much better idea even though it can still be really harsh. The involuntary ego deaths, they're really hard on people. People will do almost anything to stop that from happening, which is partly, they fight to maintain their group fostered axiomatic simplifications. It's not surprising because it's very. You lose your like that ego death is a journey into the underworld or it's a collapse into chaos. And that's not so bad if you do it purposefully. But in the pinocchio story, for example, that's exemplified by pinocchio going down to the depths to rescue his father from the whale. Now he does that voluntarily, but it damn near killed him right in. First of all, he hardly gets out of the whale. Second, he actually drowns in dies, but he comes back to life. So even if you do it voluntarily, it's still well think it's just better than doing it in voluntarily, which is the other alternative. So that's what it is.

Speaker 2:          02:17:14       You bet.

Speaker 2:          02:17:21       Hello, Dr. Peterson. Uh, so I've been listening to bach to all of these biblical lectures for the second time now. and um, I wanted to show you an observation I came upon because I was trying to find a question that you haven't been asked before, which is harder than doing my ryerson exams, that's for sure. So, so I've noticed, I think you're getting funnier. Oh yes. Oh no. I think michael koren said that this week I think. But the word he used was bizarre. I think actually I'm feeling better, so that's, I actually have a sense of humor. It's, it's hard to believe that. So it sort of comes back when I'm not feeling like I'm going to die at any moment. So yeah, I basically noticed one, you're making more attempts at jokes, so that's great.

Speaker 1:          02:18:12       Oh,

Speaker 2:          02:18:14       thank you. thank you to those Jokes are landing more often. But then there's this third element which I think was what steve martin quit because of, which is that I think the audience is anticipating jokes more and they're actually, you know, I've noticed people laughing more at things that aren't intending to be jokes. So I was just wondering what you make of that and um, their intended. I'm hoping they're intended, just because I keep a straight face doesn't mean they're not intended to be jokes, so yeah, no, it's good. look, one of the things is like it's, and I've tried to keep this, I learned a while ago, probably about five years ago, that even when you're dealing with really serious matters that if you're not handling it with a light touch, you're not an expert at it. You're not a master at it, and you'd think while there are some things that are so deep and dark that you can't handle it with a light touch, and that's actually not true. You can. That doesn't mean you make light of them. It doesn't mean anything like that. It's tHat you don't. It's minimal necessary force, something like that. You don't hit it any harder than you have to, and it's a. It's an art when you're discussing serious matters and so

Speaker 2:          02:19:22       well, one of the upshots of that is that because we're discussing serious matters and serious matters are being discussed in the ultra large right now, it would be really good if everybody could keep their sense of humor. You know, when I see positive signs of that, like there's a lot of satirical activity on the net, you know, and that could easily catalyze into horror mob, but it isn't, it is, it is, you know that that's happening to some degree, but a lot of it's satire and comedy and as long as we can keep a sense of humor about this, then I think, well we're not as close to disaster as we might be. ANd so one, one of the things that I have found rather ominous is that there are comedians, first of all, being persecuted for under free speech restriction legislation, which I think is absolutely appalling.

Speaker 2:          02:20:07       But also that there were comedians now who won't perform on university campuses. John cleese won't seinfeld. That's like, well, you know how offensive he is. It's no wonder that. I mean he's like the straightest nicest comedian you could Possibly imagine. he won't perform on college campuses. I think louis ck won't perform an or or anywhere else, but it's a bad sign. But no humor. Humor is good. And it's interesting because I've been kind of watching how I'm represented on the web weirdly enough, and there's all these memes that have emerged, I don't know, thousands of the bloody things and most of them are comical and that's good. Like people are, are, are there, whatever it is that they're doing, I don't know what the hell it is, but it's being done with a relatively light touch and that's really, really good. that's how it should be. You got to have a sense of humor. I mean, it's one of the things that makes life bearable, so, or maybe even better than bearable. So you bet.

Speaker 1:          02:21:13       Dr.

Speaker 6:          02:21:17       So I want to say what a great lecture series and uh, this is the last one this year. So a merry christmas to you and your family. Thank you. Thank you. I just want to say this, this, don't gEt too enthusiastic about that. I wrote you an essay of a question and then I use the, uh, the lecture or the essay writing guide on site to 30 to narrow it down to just a few pages, a few lines. And then during this, uh, this particular lecture, like the zigzag slide manifest again and I thought, ah, basically just had all my questions answered. So, um, basicaLly I just, I, I want to ask, um, the idea of a, your, you've made a lecture that was, um, on youtube many years ago and uh, you keeP referring to cain and abel and the, uh, the death of abel by cain and the curse in it. and I think that that was the, um, that was the single brother, two brothers conflict. Um, but, but here we have in the sense of jacob the 12. There was one who was one who's good, one who was enable archetype and there are 1211 that came after him. so that, I don't know, maybe there was something about the division or a.

Speaker 2:          02:22:43       No, that's a good observation. I hadn't thought about that. Yeah. Well, I mean there's a bit of variability because ruben and ruben isn't quite as bad as the rest, but yeah, I would say it's probably easier for the cane side, the multiply. Luckily it's not as powerful because it doesn't do anything like it. Yes, yes. And you know, you'll, there's young was often included, accused of manichaean isn't not pronouncing that properly, but there was a, there was a variant of christian dogma that held that good and evil. We're separate metaphysical realities and that they were battling for the, for governance of the cosmos, something like that. But they both had an independent existence and the classical christian idea which won out over that was the no, that good was real, but evil was the absence of good now that produced all sorts of the absence of good produces all sorts of consequences and it is interesting to read young because he does get kinda manichaean in his discussions and I think it was partly because he was so concerned about what happened in nazi Germany and then with a cold war afterwards, you know, because evil seem to be a palpable force.

Speaker 2:          02:23:54       BuT I don't think that it's as powerful as good. But I do think it's easier for it to multiply because it's what's easier path. It's easy to be resentful and hostile and bitter and do nothing. That's easy. It's horrible and it's hard on people, but it doesn't require a tremendous amount of faith or effort. So maybe that is why it's multiplied in the final story in genesis.

Speaker 6:          02:24:19       Yeah, and I, I've been reading ahead and for my own, based on the interest of the present presented stories and I keyed in on a few other books and chapters in the bible, first corinthians 13, which is the love chapter, and that cycles through the idea of I can have all things in life, uh, knowledge, power, but it's all passing and uh, the law now and forever. Faith, hope and love. And then of course love trumps overall.

Speaker 2:          02:24:51       Yeah. Well the love the issue. See I've, I've been, I've, I thought a lot about the relationship between love and truth because I've thought and talked a lot more about truth and I think partly that's because love is a word that you can hardly even say because it's been so. It's like it's being dragged behind a car through mud puddles. It's something like that. But let's, let me Just finish it. Liberating this idea, but I think that the, the, the love idea is associated with w for me at least with what I discussed at the beginning of this lecture with regards to faith. Think you have to make a decision about what your attitude towards being is going to be and the proper attitude in my estimation is that you're working for its betterment, you know, and so maybe maybe you have the same attitude towards being as you do towards someone that you love, like a son or a daughter or wife, that you want things to be better and that. So that's your aim. So the aim is basically the aim is motivated by love. You want things to be better because I think that's a good definition of law. Like if you really care for someone you can tell because you want things to be better for them. And then I think truth is nested inside that because I think that truth is the best servant of love, something like that.

Speaker 7:          02:26:14       So I've been struggling with an idea recently that I was thinking maybe you'd be able to help me out with. Basically in a recent interview you talked about how myth is meant to reconcile inherent contradictions in reality. Right? But, but I'm sort of stuck between two mythological or psychoanalytic ideas that I think are both really important, but they seem to have a inherent contradiction within them that I've been trying to figure out. So on one hand you have this idea that there's times in your life where you have to identify things in yourself that are insufficient or there's a problem somehow that you have to kind of have a controlled burn. Or like a phoenix like transformation where you discard part of yourself that doesn't fit or it's not working. But then on the other hand, you have talked about this, this union idea where as you become really.

Speaker 7:          02:27:08       When you get older, you mature by reincorporating. Things about yourself that you lost whEn you were younger or that you're trying to integrate your shadow or you're trying to find parts of your personality that. That maybe you've been rejecting and try and figure out how to bring them into, into the folder and whole. so he's got this quote that I really liked, which is I'd rather be holding good. Right, right. So, so on one hand you may identify something as a problem and you want to get rid of it or burn it off. But then on the other hand it seems like the path to being stronger is to figure out how to put everything together.

Speaker 2:          02:27:48       So there's the, there's the, one of the things you wrote about in his works on alchemy was an explanation of the prime l chemical dictum, which was solve a coagula which meant dissolve and integrate. Right? So, so imagine this, imagine that. Imagine you had a fairly hostile father who was not very well controlled and his aggression, decent person. Other than that, but let's say that. And so your reaction is I'm never going to be aggressive. And so you've built a, like a moral structure that's part of your personality and there's possibility floating around. Outside of that, did you, you've denied an ethical, you've denied any ethical. What would you say? You've stripped the idea of aggression of any ethical utility whatsoever? Okay, so what happens? This burns off and then that comes back up. Now you still have to integrate it. So it's associated in some sense with niches, ideas, morality as cowardice.

Speaker 2:          02:28:54       Because one of nature's most trenchant critiques of traditional morality, let's say, is that most of what passes for morality isn't reality. It's just cowardice. It's not that I'm a good person and I don't hurt you. It's that I'm afraid to hurt you and because I don't want to admit that I'm afraid to hurt you. Then I say I'm moral because then I can mask my essential fear and cowardice in a guise of morality. And that happens far more often than you would think because harmless and moral are by no means the same thing. So some of what you're burning off you can sit. And this is where freud was such a genius, I think is because he concentrated on aggression in sexuality, which are perhaps the two most difficult parts of a personality to integrate. So that, um, the, the hyper simplified morality stops you from tapping into deeper recesses of your psyche and it's partly because there are primal forces.

Speaker 2:          02:29:58       It's not surprising that you don't want to have anything to do with them, that you stay away from situations where they might make themselves manifest. But the problem is by denying the worst in yourself in that manner of suPpressing it, you preclude the possibility of the best because no one can be a good person without integrating their capacity for aggression. Because without that capacity, you have for aggression. You cannot say no because no means if you really say it, no means there isn't anything that you can do to me that will make me change my mind or, or conversely it means I will play for higher stakes than you will. And unless you've got your aggression integrated, there isn't a chance you can say that. And if you did, no one would take you seriously because they'd know it was just a show. So one of the most useful things that young did, I think was to work on this idea of the integration of the shadow because he was really interested in the idea of evil, right?

Speaker 2:          02:30:54       Especially working with trying to parcel out what happened in nazi Germany and during the second world war. What do you do with the part of you that's aggressive and potentially malevolent? You just crush it. That's the super ego response in some sense. do you just put it behind you so to speak? Is that a possibility or do you admit to its existence and bring it into the game and that's c for. For freud, in some sense, morality was super ego clamping down on the bed and there were fundamentally opposed. Both young and piaget had a different idea and I think they were right. It's like, no, no, you invite the bad guys out to play, and so you're an aggressive hockey player, but it's disciplined aggression that makes you, gives you access to a whole source of energy you wouldn't otherwise have. And then with regards to sexuality, it's like, well untrammeled promiscuity doesn't constitute a virtue, but neither does unavoidable virginity. Right. In fact, I think that's worse because it also masks itself with virtue, so like, well you should be able to. You should be able to do things that you wouldn't do. That's, that's like the definition of a genuinely moral person. They could do it, they don't. That's not cowardice. And so that's, you burn off the things that get in the way of that integration.

Speaker 7:          02:32:22       When you say dissolve and integrating, it'd be a good way to sort of bring the two ideas together that the burning off and the difficult processes necessary because the elements of yourself are structured together in a rigid way that is not working properly.

Speaker 2:          02:32:38       Yeah. That's what happens to Japan in the belly of the whale. He's so caught in his presuppositions that he can't escape. Right. And so pinocchio represents the new forest. So it's very interesting. So when you watch pinocchio, tried to rescue him. The first thing joe petta does this confuse pinocchio with a fish because he wants something to eat. But pinocchio is better than something to eat because he could rescue him so he doesn't need to eat. And then pinocchio wants to make a fire engine pedo objects because he's going to burn up all the furniture. So like we don't need the damn furniture if we're getting out of the whale, you know, and so, so Japan and he's old, so that, that, that's the, that's the rigid structure. That's the old gear that has to die off before the new year can be born. It's a forest fire that allows for new growth and that's how those things are put together and to see.

Speaker 2:          02:33:24       And it's useful to know too because if you burn something off, you might think, well, there's nothing left. It's like, that's not true. If it's dead wood, then you have room for new growth and you want to be doing that on a fairly regular basis. That's the, that's the snake that sheds its skin and transforms itself, right? That's, that's the death and resurrection from a psychological perspective, it's exactly the same idea. Now we don't know the upper limit to that, right? Because we don't know what a person would be like if they let everything that they could let go, let go and only let in what was seemingly, let's say. But you can See that it's funny, we don't know that to some degree you can see People very far. You can see people start to do that without. That's not an rare experience and people improve very rapidly.

Speaker 2:          02:34:16       It can improve their very rapidly. A lot of it's low hanging fruit, like if he just stopped doing really stupid things that you know are stupid, your life improves a lot so and it, it frees you up. It also means there's a, there's an element there that's also associated with pride because people tend to take pride in who they are and that's a bad idea because that stops you from becoming who you could be because if you're proud of who you are, you won't let that go when it's necessary. You won't step away from it, you know, and then you end up being your own parody. Something like that. That's also a very bad idea. You want to be continually stepping away from your previous self and so big and I guess part of that too is that you have to decide, you know, are you, are you order or chaos or you the process that mediates between them and if you're the process that mediates between them, you, you are the thing that transforms and that's the right attitude for a human being because that's what we are. We're the thing that voluntarily confronts chaos and transforms. That's what we are. And so for better or worse, you know, that's our deepest biological essence you might say, and so you can let things go if you know that there's more growth to come. So yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:35:39       thank you.

Speaker 6:          02:35:42       One more. Thank you for your time and thank you for spending your time with all of us. Hey, my pleasure. It's been a pleasure. So if I could, since we are at the end of genesis, I liked the opportunity to challenge or at least have you take another look at your position you've held with regards to reflection on the murder of evil. Uh, I bring this up because it's actually a part of genesis that has bothered me for awhile and it's not like because it's not as straightforward as it's presented, usually in straight. I've been wrestling with it. So in this series as well as in a couple of your maps of meaning lectures, you summarized it, something to the effect of cane coming to the conclusion that what he did leads to a punishment which is more than he believes he can face, which I believe to be born out of a natural reading, a specific translation choices incorrectly made entry innocently made by editors Just for readability sake.

Speaker 6:          02:36:37       So in genesis four, 13 cane does not say my punishment is greater than I can bear. He actually says they'll meat, so my sIn is greater than I can bear, which is this, which is to say it's not his past actions. We'll just say it's not as past sections. It's his future as consequences which a past actions not as feature consequences, which he regrets for him to say, oh, won't iniquity or sin. That is far too much for him to bear as a reflection on the reality of this corruPtion and not a plea of mercy to the dd despair him.

Speaker 2:          02:37:12       Okay, well that's, that seems to be a deeper interpretation I would say. And I think it's more that's the same line of reasoning that dusty see pursued in crime and punishment, right? Because in crime and punishment, skolnick of gets away with murder and then he cannot stand it. He cannot stand that he did it because he's no longer the same person, but even more he cannot stand that he got away with it. so that's more in keeping with the, with that interpretation. So, uh, this also is reflected in the following verses for 14 where he states the consequences of his actions, mainly that god's presence will be hidden from him and that he will be killed. The first opens with the word hain, which means indeed more or less. And to note the sense of acceptance and not a complaint, it is the difference between saying, oh no, well god, now hide his face from me and will I be hunted versus of course god will hide his face for me and I will be hunted and killed, which I've been wrestling lists and have taken away to possibly mean that there are sins that we can do that we'll just push us too far.

Speaker 2:          02:38:16       Well, okay, there, there, there are. Well, okay, so one of the. Well, one of the things that you see in posttraumatic posttraumatic stress disorder situations, for example, is that people view themselves doing something so terrible. They don't know how to put it right. So that. So you could say under those circumstances, the face of god is hidden from them because they cannot, they cannot atone for it. They count reconciled themselves to it. It's there all the time and they can't see anything good beyond it. It's hell essentially. And so in sometimes when you're working with people with posttraumatic stress disorder, you know, you, you kind of initiatE them into a philosophy of good and evil so that they can see when joseph talks to his brothers and they've got all this guilt, right? and, and he doesn't want them to have more guilt than necessary to fix themselves because it just burdens them.

Speaker 2:          02:39:12       otherwise he says, look, don't forget, yeah, yeah, it was you. But it's also god's doing. And I had a client once who, who had obsessive compulsive disorder. And um, he was a very smart guy. He also happened to work in a active lab that hug a lot of radioactive materials, which wasn't the best place for someone with ocd. And he was worried that he would make some mistake. This is very common with ocd that would result in someone's suffering, which you will, you, you'll do that. And it wasn't until I could get him to conceptualize himself and his life in part as a force of nature that he was able to reconcile himself to the possibility that an error on his part would produce catastrophic consequences. But people often find themselves in situations where they just cannot reconcile themselves to what they've done and that it makes sense to me that, that the interpretation that you're describing that that makes, that makes plenty of sense from a psychological perspective that will push us to like just beyond our limit that are too far, but there are also no consequences to our actions that are devoid of a truth we can accept and learn from.

Speaker 2:          02:40:24       And this is what I've kind of delved out of this a bit with cain and abel. So this is the case. Why then does it take us so long? And it was so much self to now before we accept personal responsibility, my face with tragedy, especially when it's self inflicted.

Speaker 2:          02:40:43       Well I don't think you want to underestimate the contribution of just sheer dIfficulty. Like you know, let's say you, you, you, you're grieving because someone close to you died. It's like, well it isn't just that you've lost them. Although that's a big part of it. It's that you have to rebuild yourself and it's really hard to do that. So it is sort of proportional to the significance of your errors, so if you commit an error and then you recognize that it's an error, if it's a sort of surface area it's like well you can just touch up the paint, but sometimes the whole under structure is just rotten and then you don't know what to do. And then. So that's one problem. Just sheer bloody difficulty. And I see this with people very often. It's like they're at a point in their divorce, let's say, and they don't know what to do.

Speaker 2:          02:41:39       They cannot solve the problem. It's too complicated. They just don't have the resources and maybe they've squandered some of their resources as well, but sometimes they just don't have the resources. And then if you add to that error and sin and malevolence and blindness and all those other things. people. There's a guy named thomas says, who wrote this really interesting article in the 19 sixties and book actually called the myth of mental illness. And it was classic reading for clinical psychologist when I was training. And the reason for that was, that sounds pointed out, and this is true, is that lots of times if you're a psychotherapist, people don't come to you because they have mental illnesses. They had come to you because they have insoluble problems in their life. You know, like maybe they've had a two year affair at work, their wife is alcoholic and they have a very and their father has alzheimer's disease.

Speaker 2:          02:42:35       It's like they just don't know what to do. It's too much now, you know, they shouldn't have had the affair. So there's a moral issue and maybe they should have intervened in the alcoholism in the family. Maybe they use their wives, alcoholism as an excuse to have the affair. You know, like these things get very tangled. It's just, it's so bloody complicated that people can't untangle it. So. And I would say that's in keeping with the interpretation that you laid forth with regards to cain is it sounds like it's one of the reasons why it's so useful to read multiple translations, right? Because nuances matter. it sounds to me from that descriPtion that he actually woke up at least briefly and noticed what he did and said, there's no coming back from this and and it is. You can easIly get places that you do not know how to come back from.

Speaker 2:          02:43:23       Now. You know, they say, well, all things are possible with god and there's always the possibility of redemption. No matter how serious the sin, but I'll tell you is sometimes people have no idea how to get back from where they went well, and you can understand often why people wouldn't do that, right? Yeah. Well, that's a funny thing because one of the things Carl Rogers said too about Psychotherapy is that you can't do psychotherapy with someone who hasn't recognized that they have a problem. so it's a massive thing to recognize that you have a problem and it does open the door perhaps to recovery, but it also means that you've recognized that you have a problem and that can be very, very. it's the desert, right? You're out of the tyranny, but you're in the desert and the sun's beating down on you and there's no necessary reason to presume that you're going to survive. So thank you. Have guidance. Thank you all.

Speaker 1:          02:44:19       Thank you.
