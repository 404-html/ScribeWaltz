Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Radio show radio show is brought to you by www dot astraea magazine. Don't come. Professor Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychologist, licensed in Massachusetts and Ontario. He's also a professor at the University of Toronto and has been so since 1998. Professor beaters in is currently interested in the formula assessment and theoretical nature of self deception, construing it as the voluntary failure of exploration rather than as repression. He's also doing experimental work on creativity, achievement, personality, narrative, and motivation. For the next hour,

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       we'll be Guy Lee.

Speaker 3:          00:01:09       Welcome to this edition of Astoria magazine and Web radio. We're delighted to have here with us clinical psychologist, professor Jordan Peterson. He's going to be telling us about his amazing book, maps of meaning. Now, first of all, Professor Peterson, welcome. How are you? Great. Could you please tell us a bit first of all about your background?

Speaker 4:          00:01:35       Well, I'm a clinical psychologist trained at mcgill university. I've been working as a professor. I taught at Harvard University in the psychology department for six years, and then I moved to Toronto. I also do consulting work for a variety of different companies.

Speaker 3:          00:02:04       Probably the most widely read book on psychology for the novice reader was young's masterpiece man and his symbols. Are you approaching a general audience with this book or your book maps of meaning, or is this more suited to the students of psychology?

Speaker 4:          00:02:24       Well, I think it's suited for people who would like assembled and even the ones that were written for a general audience, we're not particularly simple because they're so different in conception, but I would say maps of meaning is aimed at the same audience that those books were aimed at. Other similar to two books by Eric Norman, who was a very astute student of youngs and who took kills thought farther in some directions than young had. So I guess I see my work in part as an extension of a young's work and Norman's work. I'm partly into the domain of neuropsychology

Speaker 3:          00:03:14       luminaries such as when a philosophical investigations in 1953, for instance, where again, he attempted to layout the apparent structure of the mind and the conditioning with cultural and historical variables. Would that be true to say you've moved on from that and expanded it even more

Speaker 4:          00:03:36       contributions? Was the idea that was more like a a piece in a chess game than it was like a label for an object and perspective. Words were always to do things with rather than to label things with and a conception that I share because most of our concepts, scientists like to think that our concepts are very much like theories about object. But in reality our concepts are much more action oriented that not. I mean we know for example, that when you look at even our simple object like a cop, the brain areas that are involved in motor action are activated at the level of perception. So for example, when you look at a cup, the gripping action that your hand would make if you lifted up the cop is partially activated merely when your eyes a settle on the cup itself. So, and Vichtenstein was the first philosopher, although Nisha knew this to some degree to can spend, was the first philosopher to really point out the functional quality of our object categories. And, uh, my work overlaps with his ideas to some degree because one of my preconceptions that mythological ideals, ideas and concepts are functional. They're to do things with their, to act about. They're not to label, they're not descriptive. Like scientific concept is a. that's why religious mythology has to do with morality because morality is about action.

Speaker 3:          00:05:17       What is the relationship to human consciousness in say, the treatment of mental illness, for instance, of what we classify in the western concept as mental illness?

Speaker 4:          00:05:30       Well, let's, let's start with a question about dreams mean there's a lot of debate in the scientific literature about the meaning of dreams. And perhaps there's even debate about whether to have meaning. I think partly the debate exists because to do dream analysis properly as young in particular pointed out, uh, you need a vast body of knowledge in the dream interpreter about comparative mythology and ritual and symbol and, and art history and so forth. Because dreams of course, use images as their primary means of conceptualization. Now, in order to understand what what dreams mean and how they can be useful in therapy, apart from appreciating the fact that the interpreter needs a broad body of knowledge that scientists generally don't develop, it's also important to know what it is that scientists have discovered about dreams. So for example, we know that dreams occur during rapid eye movement sleep. You cycle into rapid eye movement, sleep about every 90 minutes when you're asleep, when you're in rapid eye movement, sleep, your motor centers, so your action centers are very much activated in your brain, but your body is paralyzed so that you can't move around.

Speaker 4:          00:07:02       Your eyes are moving because of course it doesn't really matter if your eyes move while you're asleep because they won't take you anywhere, but if your legs were moving while you were asleep, you run into walls while you were dreaming, and scientists have actually managed to damage the motor inhibition systems in cats so that they do move around when they're dreaming anyways. If you wake up when someone's dreaming, their brain is about as active as it is when they're awake. So there's a tremendous amount of neural processing going on in the dream state. If you wake someone up when they're dreaming, there's about an 80 percent chance that they'll report the emotion of anxiety. Dreams tend to focus on threat processing. Now, a threat is anything that might hurt you, but it's more than that to a threat is anything that doesn't fit into your current conceptual scheme, so imagine that you have a theory about the way the world is and then you act on that theory and sometimes things work out the way you'd like them to work out, but often they don't, and every time things work out in a way that isn't how you would like or how you predicted that indicates that there's some more about the world that you have to learn about and that fact first manifests itself in anxiety.

Speaker 4:          00:08:27       Now the dream focuses on anxiety and then it loosens up. It's the normal conceptual constraints that characterize waking thinking and it starts to a play in a sense or hypothesize about how your current categorical structure could be shifted around so that that threat could be accounted for. Okay, now that means the dream is dealing with things that you need to understand, but you don't yet understand, so when you wake up and you remember the dream, the dream doesn't really make sense because it's about something you don't understand. Now it's your brain's best guess at configuring or understanding the unknowable, but it's like it's like the first layer of a multilayered process which eventually would culminate in fully developed thought, maybe over months or maybe over years, or maybe you would never manage it at all. The unknown thing or the threat is just too great to really come to any terms with it whatsoever. Okay? Now imagine that you're dreaming about something and it produces enough emotion with the threat produces enough emotion, not only to produce a very vivid dream but to wake you up. When you wake up, you remember the dream and then you go tell someone about it. Well, the dream is about something you don't yet understand that it's upsetting and if you tell a bunch of people about it, they're going to give you all sorts of opinions on the dream and that's a way that you can gather more information about the threat,

Speaker 5:          00:10:03       which is known as a nightmare. Cynthia dream, which is I'm traveling all puzzling because it's so abstract. Could you differentiate?

Speaker 4:          00:10:14       I think it's clearer in the case of nightmares and often too, because nightmares tend to have archetipal themes. You know? People for example, are often threatened by monsters at night and a monster is a chi mirror that's made up of the different parts of different parts of frightening things. A dragon is a camera, for example, because it's made out of reptilian parts and it also includes the idea of fire and transformation, so a nightmare is that a dream that tends to use archetypal imagery to conceptualize a fairly powerful threat and if you recount a nightmare to a person with no specific training, they're going to have some opinion about it and their opinion might be useful in terms of information, Katherine, but if you recount a dream to someone who's psychologically trained and his also symbolically trained and who has great great depth of knowledge with regards to the structure of religious thinking and comparative literature, the light that they're going to shed on your dream is much brighter and more profound. And sometimes a, a dream interpretation can offer the person who's had the dream, a leap forward in knowledge that might have taken them five or six years to conceptualize by themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:11:36       You might say that they wouldn't ordinarily have had. Because the person who's the expert who's had the knows and says, Oh yes, I know of that place that had been to that experience. They've had that symbol and it's. And the bubble,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       what it feels like because of surely it is, um, some people say that me included, I'm that one way to interpret a dream when you wake up is just to just like you would taste a sip of wine, just hold the flavor and, and hold the feeling. What does it feel like? What does feel, what feels the same in your real life? And that's what the dreams trying to tell you with a collage of singles and memories as well that is drawn on in recent, I'm conscious experience to try and put it together. Hence the dream can be very abstract. Would you say that's the case sometimes?

Speaker 4:          00:12:34       Well, I think there's two things about your comments that are really worth highlighting in. The first is the category is that a dream uses are generally based on emotional similarity rather than logical similarity.

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:12:50       So a dream for example, might represent fear or the fear of something unknown by using a juxtaposition of a variety of images of frightening thing. So imagine that in the dream world the basic rule is all things that produced the same emotion are the same thing. And so you're a description of a dream interpretation process that relies on identifying similarities in emotional state, gets right to the core of how dream thought works. Now, secondarily, I also believe that if you are able to help someone or construct a dream interpretation that fits there, also able to feel that it fits, it clicks or it makes sense, or it's like the punchline of a joke in some way they can tell that the interpretation have, uh, put some missing pieces of the puzzle into place. And I think it's important to rely on that as an indicator of whether the interpretation is actually derived from the dream or sort of just a theoretical imposition on its structure.

Speaker 4:          00:14:01       Now we can go underneath that too. And I mentioned already that basic categories are more action oriented than object oriented. So basic categories, the basic categories of the human mind are categories to do things with. Well, by the same token, there also motivational and emotional categories. So the primordial mind, like the animal mind thinks sort of axiomatically, that all things that produces the same emotion are the same thing. So there's things that make you happy or there's things that make you sad or there's things that make you anxious and the fact that all those things share the capacity to evoke that emotion speaks of some essential identity between them. Now the identity is in relationship to the experiencer and not necessarily with regards to similarity between the objects, but it's still how we naturally think and it's certainly how mythologies thinks and it's how drama thinks and how religion things. And we've lost sight of that in part because we've become scientifically trained to some degree and we tend to believe that the real categories of the world or object and uh, that, that just strikes me as it's wrong. There's something about it that's wrong and it's wrong because we have to act

Speaker 5:          00:15:28       emotional reactions. People response. For instance, if you take the base emotions, she only one could go way, way back to the door. Navarra beginnings when we came down from the trees and move through the forest out onto the plains. Hunter gatherers and animals do share this with us because, uh, uh, the everyday dog and cat does have emotions. Our emotions born out of originally just pure instinct. Is this where the emotions came from, do you think? Uh, because instinct cools is a reaction. You have the old adage of a fight or flight for instance, depending on what you make a decision to do.

Speaker 4:          00:16:15       Okay. So let, let's make a conceptual definition here. We agree on the terminology. Let's say that motivations are states of being that indicated that are indicative of a goal. So for example, if you get hungry, I would say that's a motivational state rather than an emotional state. And it's a motivational state that sets the acquisition and ingestion of food as the goal. All right? And so there's a variety of motivational states, hunger, thirst, sexual desire, um, especially defensive aggression, predatory aggression, um, and the desire to eliminate essentially, uh, the desire to play. Those are all motivational states. And then there's emotional states and the primary emotional states or positive and negative and positive emotional states are experienced when you're moving towards a desired goal. And negative emotional states occur when the goal becomes uncertain or the pursuit is somehow frustrated or, or interfered with. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:17:29       Now you asked about instincts, well, I would say both motivations and emotions or instincts, they're very, very archaic if you think about the positive and negative emotions as being approach versus withdrawal. Um, animals going all the way back to single celled organisms have approach versus withdrawal systems. So they're unbelievably archaic. They go way back before, uh, we split evolutionarily from, um, our chimpanzee like ancestors. So they are instincts and they're very deep and they, the fact that those instincts exist has all sorts of strange and that their evolutionary based have, has all sorts of strange implications. So for example, you can understand the dog and communicate with the dog because the dog shares motivational and emotional structure with you to great degree. It's a pack animal, knows about dominance, it knows about dominant striving, it feels anxiety and pain and it knows how to play and he likes to play.

Speaker 4:          00:18:39       And there's a lot about a human being and the dog through the same, which is why we can live together. But you can go way down the evolutionary chain. So say if you go all the way down to lobsters, lobsters know about dominance hierarchies and they have approach and withdraw systems and the lobster nervous system, which is very primitive compared to the human nervous system is so similar to ours that you can give lobsters, antidepressants and it stops them from feeling hurt after that been defeated in a physical dominance dispute. Yeah, it's absolutely amazing. So typically if two lobsters are in a dominance dispute and one loses, it will withdraw and then it'll, it kind of folds its body up, it, it, it goes into a depressed light crouch, whereas the winter will expand his body. It looked bigger. Okay. And when the harvesters defeated, it won't fight with any other lobster for at least 20 minutes, even one that it had defeated before.

Speaker 4:          00:19:44       But if you give it antidepressants in the aftermath of its defeat, it doesn't contract. Plus it'll fight right away. It just. Well, it just shows you the, the, the idea of, of evolutionarily determined instincts, in my opinion, is not a theory at all. It's an absolutely self evident fact. And it manifests itself in all sorts of strange ways. So for example, we know with chimpanzees, chimpanzees basically go to war. They're, they're wired up to regard chimpanzee conspecifics who aren't in their tribe as something to react against with fear and hostility. And if a wandering group of chimpanzees say numbering three or four at the periphery of their territory, comes across an isolated individual or two from another group, they'll tear them into shreds and that that primordial response to this stranger sheds substantial light on how it is that human beings demonize and then persecute their so called enemy

Speaker 3:          00:21:07       resentment. Hatred as well. And that can be demonization is, as you say, is that correct?

Speaker 4:          00:21:15       Well, you can break it up into two aspects. I think, and this is something I go into great detail about what the book is about. I was interested in territoriality and cruelty to animals are territorial. And if another animal trespasses onto a complex animals territory, there'll be a fight. And I think that's really understandable because animals need territory and human beings are clearly territorial, territorial about our actual physical space. And we're also territorial about our ideological or cultural space and it's because we need to inhabit the physical territory and we need to inhabit and the illogical territory and we react to challenges to the integrity of our territory with fear and with defensive aggression. And I think that can be understood, uh, quite appropriately using analogs from animal behavior and animal neurophysiology. But you talked about resentment and hatred. Well, those emotions I think are much more specifically human. There's lots of examples from 20th century history of the persecution of enemies going far beyond what was merely needed to ensure territorial integrity on examples of course have that sort of behavior abound in the Holocaust literature where the Nazis went out of their way not only to eradicate the Jews and the Gypsies and so forth, but to torment them and torture them and crushed them in ways that were even, that weren't even in the best interests of the persecutor. And that's a lot more difficult to understand.

Speaker 3:          00:23:19       Treat them as no better than animals as they called them, but not forgetting that they were earlier examples before when the Holocaust. In terms of numbers. Sure, uh, and its scale and its cold bloodiness, but if we go back to, um, times of say, one of the earlier ones, sirens that I thought were horrific

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       was, uh, vlad the impaler who used to enjoy sitting eating his breakfast and having his victims in paled before him. Uh, and that's psychopathic. Uh, really is there a difference between that and say, uh, the crimes or the Nazis.

Speaker 4:          00:24:05       I also think that kind of behavior is far more normative in, in, in modern times the Holocaust. It's sort of become archetipal of totalitarian, evil more than just brutality. But my sense after having researched this for, for a lengthy period of time, isn't that the whole behavior that characterize people who were involved in the Holocaust was essentially normative. And even in 20th century history, um, the numbers that the numbers involved in the Holocaust per se aren't, um, of any order of magnitude there. They're special. They're, they're not, they're not immense by any stretch of the imagination. Solzhenitsyn estimated that Stalin's brutality killed something in the neighborhood of $60 million people. And there's estimates from mile that he killed 100 million people. And in Cambodia, we know that at least 4 million people died like the Holocaust is, is that the prime exemplar of that kind of behavior, but it typified the 20th century and as you already pointed out, it's not like it arose in the 20th century. It's, it's part of our, it's part of our nature

Speaker 5:          00:25:48       victims into the gas chamber. Uh, the guy who press the release button on the first atomic bomb fell on that aircraft that he knew would school to thousands or hundreds of thousands of people because both those two people believed in something. Is this where it really boils down to the difference between good and evil,

Speaker 4:          00:26:13       their claim that they believe in something to protect what they believe in, using the same mechanisms that they'll protect territory. So for example, if you own your house and under English common law, you have the right to say, and then you have the right to say, leave. I have a gun, I have a gun and fire a warning shot. And then if they don't leave, you have the right to shoot them and you can't be prosecuted for that. Okay? And everyone would say, well, you are within your rights because you were protecting your territory. Okay? So I think people have a right to protect their territory and they have a right to protect their radiological territory. And there is rules of engagement that could, uh, govern disputes of that nature. But when you're, there's, there's other sorts of act and many of those characterized behavior in the concentration camps in the Nazi era that can't be explained by mere territoriality. And that's when it's necessary as far as I'm concerned, to bring in conceptions to rive from mythology, like the difference between good and evil. And I think that you can define evil and evil is an act that is designed to produce a negative outcome for everyone who's involved. That includes the victim and the perpetrator.

Speaker 4:          00:27:54       Because if you look at the first few chapters in genesis is a very clear story. So let me tell you one of the stories. It's really worth knowing as far as I'm concerned. When Adam and eve eat the fruit of the tree, of the knowledge of good and evil. And the first thing that happens is that they noticed that their naked, what does that mean? It means they're illuminated with regards to their own vulnerable nature. Because to be naked and to know your naked is to be exposed and vulnerable and to know it. And often people, for example, will dream that they've been stripped naked in front of a crowd. It means their material vulnerability is exposed for everyone to see. The first thing Adam and eve do, once they discovered that they're naked, is to close themselves. They cover themselves up and human beings are the only creatures that were clothes and clothes separate our vulnerability from the natural and social worlds.

Speaker 4:          00:29:01       They're protective in reality and they're protective symbolically. Alright? The next thing that happens is that God comes walking through the garden, see in the morning, and he looks for Adam and Adam is hiding behind a Bush and God says, Adam, where are you? I'm used to walking with you. And Adam says, I'm, I'm too afraid to come out because I found out that I'm naked. And God says, who told you that you were naked? And Adam blames the woman. Okay, so then you think, well, why would adam hide from God? All right, so imagine God, a God symbolizes a transcendent totality. And this story indicates that at some point in human history there was an unbroken relationship between the transcendent totality and the individual. But when the individual became self conscious, that totality was threatened. So why does Adam Hyde? Well, he knows he's naked and vulnerable, so we hide from.

Speaker 4:          00:30:12       He hides from the demands of of yesterday. He hides from what's best in himself because he looks at himself and thinks, I'm nothing. I'm weak. I'm, I can be easily hurt. And therefore, when God calls, if I have to hide, well, the next thing that happens is that Adam and eve are thrown out of paradise. And God says, well, you know, life is going to be difficult now. Okay? So that's, that's the issue up. The next chapter starts with the birth of Cain and Abel. Now cain and Abel are the first two humans born in history, right? Because everything that happens in the garden of Eden prehistorical human history starts with the fall of man. The rise of self consciousness and Cain and Abel are the first two humans and they're symbolic of two attitudes towards the revelation of vulnerability. Now, Abel is a shepherd and came raises vegetables, and they're both required to make sacrifices to God.

Speaker 4:          00:31:24       Okay? Now, why would you make a sacrifice? Well, it's an archaic idea. You burn something, smoke rises up to heaven, God's in heaven, and he can judge the quality of your sacrifice by evaluating the smoke. Let me think. Well, that's a very archaic idea. And what could a modern person do with that? Well, a modern person could give these archaic people some credit first. So let's say, why is God in heaven? Well, it's because when you look at the sky at night, it fills you with awe. You see an unlimited expanse of being and that's the closest you get to directly experiencing the unnameable totality. Okay? Why should you make sacrifices to God? Why would he be pleased with sacrifices? While I would say you already know that because if I asked you, well, what sacrifices have you made to make things better in your life?

Speaker 4:          00:32:25       No doubt. You could immediately tell me now are people had to act that out because they didn't really have the philosophical conceptions and verbalized bubble form, but they still had an intuition that it was necessary to make the right sacrifice in order to maintain an appropriate relationship with the totality of being okay, so able make some sacrifices and cane make some sacrifices. Now able takes the best things. He has an offers them to God, so they're the firstborn of his flock and the choices. Cuts of meat with ables called on to make a sacrifice. He doesn't hold anything back. He puts himself on the line and he sacrifices a courageously and clearly and cane. By contrast, he brings in some ratty little, you know, a wrinkly, old vegetables and sacrifices those. So God smiles on unable sacrifices and frowns on canes. So what does that mean?

Speaker 4:          00:33:26       Well, labels making the right sacrifices. So everyone likes him. Is this, his enterprises flourish? He has good intimate relationships. He, he, uh, produces a thriving family because he makes the right decisions and cane, on the other hand, everything goes wrong for him. So this makes them mad. It says in the Old Testament, his countenance falls. What does that mean? He gets bitter and resentful and angry and depressed. He's mad about how things are turning out. So it goes and he has a little chat with God and he says, look, oh, I don't know what's going on here. I'm working myself to the bone. I'm making sacrifices left, right, and center and everything is not turning out for me. Like what gifts? And God says, pay attention here. It's your problem that things aren't going well. Uh, the, the monster of sin crouches at your door and you welcome it in.

Speaker 4:          00:34:26       You could reject it. You could do things right. You know exactly what the right thing to do is, yet you refuse to do it. So all the trouble you're having is your fault. Don't come along and blame me. Just get yourself put together properly and do things right. And so that's the end of the conversation. Well, that isn't what cain wants to hear. He wants to hear that the world is a miserable place and that the reason that he's failing is, is because of the structure of reality. He doesn't want to hear that it's his problem, so this just makes them absolutely boiling map and the first thing he does is go and kill Abel. Well, that's the difference between territoriality and evil and he wants what April has. He even wants to be able, but instead he destroys them out of spite and resentment and revenge against the nature of reality.

Speaker 4:          00:35:17       Well then God gets wind of it and mark cane, he says, no one killed him, and you might think, well, why? Because it's God who says an eye for an eye. Well, the next little bit of the story, which is barely there anymore, it's, it's so edited out, explains exactly why cain wanders away and he gets married and he has a family. But if you mess around with any of Keynes family, if you annoy them or bother them or make them resentful or angry, they don't just kill one person. They killed seven and then those children have children and if you annoy them, they kill 70. And at the end of that acceleration of revenge oriented killing, God comes along and floods everything. And that's when the story of Noah and the Ark Kicks in, and the story is very clear. It says this, if you act in properly, and if you do the things that you know to be wrong, if you don't make the right sacrifices, your life will not turn out well. You'll be punished all the time for your foolishness and your weakness and that will make you resentful, twisted, bitter, and murderous. When you act on those, uh, motivations, because of spite and resentment, you'll, you'll initiate a cataclysm of revenge oriented killings. And if no stop is put to them, that will spread through the entire society and invite the apocalypse.

Speaker 4:          00:36:55       And that's the second, third major story in genesis. Exactly right.

Speaker 5:          00:37:05       Would you call it moral teaching there or was it more than that?

Speaker 4:          00:37:13       For sure. You know, I mean because it, it, but it's, it's, it's moral in a weird way. You know, it's, it's, it's more like a description of moral reality. Then a story that says, well, you should act like this because that would be good. If you imagine this story of Cain and Abel, this is a really old story. It's been around for we have no idea how long I'm in written form. It's been around for several thousand years. It's undoubtedly part of a larger oral tradition. It was edited by many, many people and told and retold and all that's left of that story is what's intensely memorable because otherwise it wouldn't have been forgotten and it just says something blatantly. It says that you can accept your. You can accept the need to make sacrifices in order to keep your life on the right track or you can fight against that and act improperly.

Speaker 4:          00:38:17       If you fight against that inactive properly, then you're going to compromise your relationship with the totality of big and as soon as you do that, you might as well essentially you're living in a hell if you, if you subject yourself chronically to a hellish existence that will make you turn your thoughts towards really towards revenge against existence itself. Well, you know, Stellan was setting himself up to blow up the entire planet and there's good evidence from the KGB archivist in the late 19 fifties, but he was gearing up with his multiple pre a pre apocalyptic genocidal practices. He was gearing up enough courage to turn the whole world into a conflagration. Well, this is no a trivial matter and the only stories that I know that have enough profundity to lay out the real seriousness of the issue are these archaic stories. Nothing in modern culture has the

Speaker 6:          00:39:29       requisite profundity

Speaker 6:          00:40:21       No, a trivial matter,

Speaker 4:          00:40:26       and the only stories that I know that have enough profundity to lay out the real seriousness of the issue are these archaic stories. Nothing in modern culture has the requisite profundity

Speaker 5:          00:40:43       we do have as you get out of life, what you put into it, and another one that comes to mind is he who lives by the sword dies by the sword in the east. They have the concept of a tradition of Karma.

Speaker 4:          00:40:59       Yeah, well, Karma Karma is. Karma is a really good example because the idea behind Karma, it's very interesting. I think from a neuropsychological perspective because Karma is predicated on the idea that it is fundamentally impossible for you to get away with anything and there's an idea in Christianity that's like that too. It's a little more archaic and more dramatic than the idea of Karma. Now idea in Christianity is that all of your actions and motivations are in some manner recorded and that you'll be brought to for them, but and modern people look at that, especially when it's represented metaphorically as say, a wise old man writing in a book. I may just discounted entirely, but I've certainly come to believe as a consequences of studying what I've studied that you you. It is absolutely impossible for you to get away with anything. Whenever you make a mistake and you know it's a mistake, you will eventually pay for it.

Speaker 4:          00:42:06       You might not notice that that's what you're paying for because often the punishment and the crime are so distant in time from one another that the causal connection is virtually impossible to identify, but that doesn't mean it isn't there. Now, one of the things I attempted to lay out in maps of meaning in some detail was soldier and instance insights into the processes that lead to the establishment of the Gulag archipelago. Prison camps in the Soviet Union were so many tens of millions of people were killed. It was Solzhenitsyn's a belief, and this is a belief that you share Sheridan and as well, Eric Norman, that it was the cumulative sins of the individuals that made up a population that culminated in these absolute totalitarian catastrophes. So just as keynes unwillingness to make the appropriate sacrifices in his individual day to day life culminated in the degeneration of his entire society and the, and the uh, uh, and the, and the bringing forth an apocalypse.

Speaker 4:          00:43:22       So in everyday life, each individual's moral errors accumulate and manifest themselves at a social level and play themselves out in this immense, in this immense, a forum. Now we don't like to think that way because no individual likes to feel that they're localized foolishness and weakness. Conscious foolishness and weakness reverberates through the entire social structure. But everything that I've ever read that was serious with regards to this subject indicated precisely that, I mean even Hannah run, she wrote the banality of evil. Well, you know, I think it's the evil of banality personally, but she, she, the, the, the architect of the, of the final solution was a meek, negligible, resentful, nonentity. And what that shows you is just how horrifying it is morally to be a week resentful, judgemental, non entity. It's, it's, it's so catastrophic that under the appropriate conditions it can endanger the structure of being.

Speaker 3:          00:44:55       You talk about the fact that we're comfortable with the known what is known around which we build all our cultural traditions and from which, uh, propagated, and then there's exploration of the new, if you like, and how we can act on that. Could you tell us a bit more about that? Because you're insinuating, I believe in your, your work that in your book that to do so I can make one some kind of a, some kind of heroic action. You, you've mapped out something whereby we can reach out for what is unknown to explore a potential and creativity. Is that correct?

Speaker 4:          00:45:39       That's a good summary. I mean, imagine. Imagine that in life you have, you have some one obvious thing to rely on and the obvious thing, you have to rely on it as the traditional knowledge and wealth of your culture. It contains most of the knowledge that you have and allows you to make your life as comfortable as it has been made within it. But there are other sources of strength too and they're more subtle. So your culture provides you with what's known and what's knowable, but culture is never mapped everything out perfectly. There's many things that remain to be to be known and many of the things that remain to be known are valuable. And what that means is that if you search after what is yet unknown, you can also derive strength from that because that's the domain in which new discoveries are made.

Speaker 4:          00:46:39       And so if I face you with evidence that you're wrong about something, which means there's something that you don't know that you're not taking into account that can frighten you because it shows you that the knowledge structures that you rely on are dangerously incomplete and that can make you very angry and that can make you very resentful or you can say, oh, isn't that so fascinating? The fact that something isn't known here means that I could go and discover that I could voluntarily encountered that and I could derive something new and valuable and I could use that. And the hero in methodology is the person who voluntarily encounters the unknown. And, and this is a unbelievably old concept, is the oldest concept we know that human beings have created it stems all the way back to the Enuma, the Mesopotamian creation myth, which is the oldest written document we have, and it's the Enuma elish is the story on which the first story in genesis is based.

Speaker 4:          00:47:40       Now here, here's a way of thinking about things and this is a mythological way and it's extremely useful. So forget for a minute the idea that the world is made out of matter and forget that it's made out of objects. Look at it from a different perspective. We'll say the world of experience, which is the world you inhabit, is made out of three things. It's made out of the fact that no matter how much you know, there are going to be phenomenon occurrences that exceed your capacity for comprehension, and that's always going to be the case. And so we're going to call that a category. That's the category of the unknown. And then there are always going to be things that you know and understand, and that's part of your tradition. We're going to call that the known, so wherever you go, wherever you are, there's a balance between the known and unknown and then the third thing is the fact of you.

Speaker 4:          00:48:40       There's a conscious observer there and the conscious observer is the place where the known and the unknown interact. That's the mythological actors, the known. That's the great father unknown. That's the great mother and the individual and the Taoists represent that as yin and Yang or chaos versus order. People think about that as masculine versus feminine. That gives us a bad interpretation or an insufficient interpretation of Dallas thought. The Dallas say, experiences made of chaos and order and the proper place to stand is right between them and you can tell when you're standing right between chaos and order because that's when you feel that things are meaningful and that means that meaning is the instinct that tells you that you're standing in the right place. Now people are vulnerable and they're afraid because of that and they can be challenged and hurt and they can be made angry and murderous, but I would say, well, if you stand between chaos and order properly, your life can become so meaningful that the meaning gives you confidence and power and the ability to overcome your sense of shameful vulnerability, and I would also say that's what religious stories or telling you to do.

Speaker 4:          00:50:04       Now we go back to genesis. In the beginning, God makes order out of chaos and that story is based on an older architecture derived from the Enuma Elish, the Enuma Elish, a god named Marduk cuts up the dragon of chaos and makes the world out of her pieces. While the dragon of chaos recurs as a mythological motifs, frequently, I'm generally in the guise of Leviathan say, and Yahuah is envisioned as the deity that derives order habitable order from chaos and immediately after. Yeah, what derives happened to Florida from chaos. He announces he makes human beings and then he announces that they are made in his image, male and female, made in his image. Well, we think that means that God is like a human being, but what it really means is that the human being is like God, isn't that the human being has the capacity to make order out of chaos, and when we say that there's something divine about a person that gives them intrinsic rights, what we mean is the fact that each human being can make order out of chaos means that every single person is deserving of a certain kind of respect. Even if they're murderous, even if they're criminals, even if they're prostitutes and tax collectors, they're still, they're still embodied with the kind of dignity that only identity with God can provide, and that identity is the capacity to make order out of chaos. And it's not just a metaphor.

Speaker 3:          00:52:00       What's happening with those sort of individuals is very suppressed or has it really died? Something in them died as spark gone out.

Speaker 4:          00:52:11       That's such a difficult question. You know, because we know, for example, that certain kinds of extreme brain damage, criminal behavior, if your prefrontal cortex is damaged, then that can make you impulsive and criminal. From a scientific perspective, I would say it's very difficult to judge the culpability of certain people because they've been damaged in some way. We don't really understand the limits on their capacity to choose are compromised and it's very, it's, it's, it's, it's a situation that has to be judged carefully in each individual case. But then mythologically I would say what Solzhenitsyn said and what he said was that in every person, no matter how good there is, a little corner of corruption and evil that still hasn't been overcome. And then in everyone, no matter how evil and corrupt, there's a little bit of a little corner of good, that's still a possibility that might be made manifest itself. And I don't exactly know how to reconcile those two viewpoints. No. And I think, I think each of them are right, even though they're juxtaposition makes them, makes a paradox.

Speaker 3:          00:53:37       So looking at

Speaker 4:          00:53:39       read about Ted Bundy in all about Ted Bundy.

Speaker 3:          00:53:43       What was that last?

Speaker 4:          00:53:45       I'm in the US. Very good looking young man and uh, he raped and murdered a number of young women and one of his tricks was to put on a fake cast and to elicit a sympathetic to stop someone, someone young and beautiful who was driving a vehicle to use their sympathy as a means of getting them compromised. He was a terrible person, but I read about his journey down hill, you know, and he said he first started to get involved in violent pornography and that as far as he was concerned, that was what opened the door. And I think that's a good metaphor. I mean, one of the things you've talked about continually when he was attempting to explain what had happened in Nazi Germany was the fact that a person moving, moving downhill to some horrific endpoint, like a concentration camp guards say, makes a little mistake, knows it's a mistake, makes a little mistake, little compromise and that puts them in a position where another compromise is more likely.

Speaker 4:          00:54:58       And then that puts them in a position where another compromise is more likely and 300 compromises later. He's, there's a great book called ordinary men. It's a study of a police battalion and pool, and these men started out as normal middle aged policemen, most of them adults before Hitler even came to power, so not victims of hitlarian propaganda in their maturing phase. They went from perfectly ordinary policeman to men who were taking naked pregnant women out into fields and shooting them behind the head and the book details their descent into this hellish place step by step. Well, I think that's how people defend, you know, it's step by step and I believe under most circumstances that every step is conscious. Even though the memory of making this step might fade into unconsciousness and the full cataclysmic consequences of each moral error aren't necessarily evident.

Speaker 3:          00:56:08       In the case of looking at the individual as to the very quickly when someone has. What's known as a nervous breakdown is that when they just can't make order out of anything, just can't cope. They just a withdrawal.

Speaker 4:          00:56:28       I mean what we could look at that neuropsychologically or we could look at it descriptively. So here's what happens. Neuropsychologically there is a little brain organ called the hippocampus and the hippocampus helps you know where you are and what you're doing, and it inhibits a whole array of more primordial emotional structures, particularly the Amygdala and the hypothalamus. Now, the Amygdala is responsible for anxiety and fear, and the hypothalamus is responsible for all different kinds of motivation. Now, as long as you know where you are and what you're doing, which means that when you act, the outcome you desire occurs because that sort of defines knowing where you were and what you're doing. Then the Amygdala and the hypothalamus remained inhibited. Now, as soon as things aren't turning out the way you expect them to, then the Amygdala is disinhibited and so as I elements and then the Hypo, then you get afraid and paralyzed and the hypothalamus starts to produce a stress hormone called Cortisol.

Speaker 4:          00:57:39       Now Cortisol is in some ways a stimulant. It'll stimulate exploratory behavior, and in small doses it's pretty good for you, but in large doses it hyperactivates your physiology, shuts off your immune system. It compromises your longterm cognitive ability and it's toxic. It starts to destroy the hippocampus and other destroys the hippocampus. The ability of the hippocampus to inhibit your negative emotional responses is increasingly compromised and that turns into a cycle and if the cycle gets instantiated with enough intensity than the entire negative emotional system can get this inhibit and the knowledge structures start start to become demolished. When people talk about a nervous breakdown, which is usually a post traumatic stress disorder, chronic repeating depression, that's basically what they're talking about.

Speaker 3:          00:58:43       If you have a conversation with someone who goes through the regular bouts of depression, the perception of reality is distorted. They just see everything negative about anything you can think about.

Speaker 4:          00:58:58       Yeah. Well, and, and what happens is you may imagine, imagine if you're doing some small task, oh, let's say you're cutting up a broccoli for dinner and you, um, you cut your finger and I say to you, what is, what is the fact that you cut your finger mean, here's some possibilities. It means you should be more careful when you're cutting broccoli.

Speaker 7:          00:59:26       Okay?

Speaker 4:          00:59:26       It means that you're actually not very careful. The fact that you're not very careful about cutting broccoli indicates you're probably not as careful as you should be about most things you do. The fact that your daughter is careful about most things you do as you should be, is an explanation for why all the things that have gone wrong in your life up to this point have actually gone wrong. People like you who have had lots of good things go wrong and who aren't sufficiently careful tend to go downhill over time. Plus they're very not very good people. Maybe they shouldn't even be around. Okay? That's how a depressed person thinks.

Speaker 4:          01:00:18       Well, what happens is that their ability to inhibit the spread of the meaning of the negative event is completely compromised because they're nervous. They're nervous system has its. They're supposed to be a threshold for the transmission of negative information across different levels of abstraction. You're supposed to be somewhat resistant to that spread. You know, it could easily be that. It could easily be true that the fact that you cut yourself is an indication that you're not living your life properly, but it isn't necessarily the first conclusion that you should leap too, but for a depressed person, you know, that's. That's often inevitable. They can't help it.

Speaker 5:          01:01:04       Slippery slope. They're overwhelmed by chaos

Speaker 4:          01:01:12       explanation.

Speaker 5:          01:01:13       No, you were just at a major conference on consciousness in Arizona, I gather now. What new ideas did you see presented in this field that you found interesting at that conference?

Speaker 4:          01:01:28       Well, I've been to that conference several times and directly relevant. So let me give you. Let me give you an example of who has been investigating the mechanism of action of hallucinogenic drugs. Hallucinogenic drugs have been used throughout history to produce mystical experiences of one form or another, and vollenweider actually provided an explanation of why that might be. And that was very interesting to me. So

Speaker 4:          01:02:12       when you're, your senses are each somewhat independent systems, but the, the content of your sensory experience is unified in a brain area called the Thalamus. Now, so imagine you're your site and your vision and your touch and your sense of your body in space are all integrated in the elements, but there's a lot of information coming in from all of your senses. Okay? Now imagine that your prefrontal Cortex, which is a relatively new part of the brain, it sets up a plan what you're going to do next, and it tells the hypothalamus only lead information relevant to the plan through into consciousness. So for example, if you walk into the kitchen and you're going to make yourself something to eat, you're not going to notice the floor and you're not going to notice the paint on the ceiling. You're going to notice the refrigerator and the stove and the few implements that you need to undertake the task related to eating. So the prefrontal cortex gates the Thalamus. Now there's a million things you could pay attention to in the kitchen because the kitchen is a very complex visual environment. Well, if you take a hallucinogenic drug, inhibits the prefrontal Cortex, has capacity to gate the Thalamus, and all sorts of sensory information flows through.

Speaker 4:          01:03:39       Now, most of the time when you look at the world, you hardly see any of it. Yes, exactly. You're your brain is exactly as Aldous Huxley proposed. Your brain is actually a sequence of extreme, extremely complex filtering mechanisms and most of what's out there is eliminated well following on vollenweider. I would say that the ground of mystical experience is the partial apprehension of the richness of potential experience beyond beyond what's expected. So when you look at the world, what you see is mostly relevant to your current plan and shape to a tremendous degree by your memory and if if those systems are inhibited or shut down in some way and you have the opportunity to apprehend what's actually there, what's the sensation it produces, which is the disinhibition of certain kinds of emotion is very much associated with what people describe as all.

Speaker 4:          01:04:47       No, I would say to her, here's something interesting in that regard. You know, people say, people ask themselves, for example, do you believe in God? And I would say that's actually a nonsensical question. I would say whether or not you believe in God, you're more or less stuck with him. He's there whether you believe it or not, and it has nothing to do with belief. And I'll tell you why. It's actually straightforward. Okay, so let's go back to the ancient Israelis Israel lights. Now they had some rules. They believed that there was a unity behind everything and that unity was unnameable, so it was against the rules to speak the name of God. Why? Well, because as soon as you speak the name of something, you categorize it, and as soon as it's categorizable and understandable, then it's not the totality. It's something you've parceled off and made into a concept.

Speaker 4:          01:05:56       The totality of being is beyond all conceptualization. Okay, so then you might ask yourself, well, is there a totality of being. While the answer to that is, well obviously, because everything there is sums up to one totality. Well, what's the nature of that totality? Well, it's an honorable. You can't say it's too complex. It's too rich. It's, it's not within human ability to grasp. Is it there? Well, it's there. Just like a room contains the objects in the room. It's there for sure. Okay, so there is a totality. That's unnameable. The next question would be, well, do you have a relationship with it? Well, the answer to that is, of course you have a relationship with it because every part has a relationship to the whole.

Speaker 4:          01:06:52       When you're inside the totality, then you might ask, well, what's the nature of your relationship with that totality? And I would say, well, you tell me. It's easy to know if your life rich and meaningful and worthy of sustaining and in your own. From your own perspective, do you believe that life is worthwhile? You live it in a manner that makes it worthwhile, and if the answer to that is yes, then I would say, well, you have the proper relationship with the totality and if the answer is no, you doubt the value of life. You're hostile and resentful, you're bored, you're afraid, you're hurt. Well then there's something wrong with your relationship with the totality. Well, what's what's so complicated about that? It's, it's, it's, it's self evident and it's stunning to me that it's the subject of so much constant dispute. Now you might object, well, you have a relationship with the totality, but it's not a personal relationship, which is what the ancient Israel Israel lights are claimed, and of course what the product Modern Protestants claim even more dramatically and I would say, well, you couldn't be right, but let's consider it an experiment.

Speaker 4:          01:08:09       Here's the experiment. Try to establish a personal relationship with this totality and here's, here's the criteria. I will say that whenever you're doing something that's intensely meaningful, then you've established a personal relationship with this totality and if all you ever did were things that were intensely personally meaningful, while you'd live in ideal life and you wouldn't be afraid of death and you wouldn't become bitter and resentful, and it's also doable. I think with every choice you make, you decide whether you're going to do that or not. It's difficult to do meaningful things. Everybody doesn't always agree with them. They're kind of idiosyncratic. There's no necessary reason that you'll be rewarded by the culture with material success if you do meaningful things. Um, so it's a shot in the dark, which is a leap of faith, but it's right within your grasp. You can, you can do it just by deciding to, well what I learned from writing maps of meaningless, that the fate of the world literally depends on the choice that each individual makes with regards to the relationship to the totality of being. And that's that. And that's what, that's the central message of profound religious system says there's more to you than you think a lot more. There's more that, more for evil, way more than you think, and there's way more for good and whether you know it or not, you're always choosing between those two. And whether you know it or not, the fate of being itself rests on your choice. Well, who the hell wants to believe that?

Speaker 4:          01:09:52       Wait, it's too weighty. I don't care if it's way too. You're not. When you're trying to investigate the reasons behind something like the Holocaust, things get weighty very rapidly.

Speaker 3:          01:10:13       No, that was a group experience. It wasn't an individual, a just purely individually experience. How do you think we handled that?

Speaker 4:          01:10:26       Well, I think you can think of two recent events. Nine slash 11 would be one and the flooding of New Orleans. So with regards to nine slash 11, the most interesting thing to note about people's responses to that catastrophe. Was there an unconscious need for repetition? I mean everyone I know watched the trade towers fall 50 times 100 times in shock, uh, unable not to watch. And I think the reason that that's so illuminating is because it shows you how complicated it is to see what you don't understand. So mythologically speaking, the fall of the towers was equivalent both to the death of the king and to the reemergence of chaos. And when the king dies and chaos reemergence, it's very difficult to see what's there. And I'm not speaking metaphorically precisely. People wouldn't have had to watch the towers fall over and over if they could see them fall and on a trivial level, a building collapsed.

Speaker 4:          01:11:43       But what the events that characterized nine slash 11 were far more than merely a building falling when the event happened. No one knew what fail. No one knew if the financial system fail, no one knew if the economic system fail. No one knew if the world order had collapsed. And everyone watching those buildings fall was trying to perceive all those others have levels of reality at the same time. Well, that's really, really complicated. Well, and then Bush offered people in easy out in a prepared way out. He said, well, the people who did this were evil and perhaps they were the people who did this. We're evil, we're good. There should be a war. Now, as far as I'm concerned, well, that's a mythological explanation and it's, it's, it's very easy for people to instantly put forth a mythological explanation when chaos makes itself manifest. Well, of course, the problem with our response to nine slash 11 was that almost every bit of it was a lie. Um, we know that the American government utilize the events of nine slash 11 to justify an invasion on Iraq that had been planned at least 10 years before that historical documentation of that is, is available from the people who did the planning. They're still part of bushes, government.

Speaker 4:          01:13:24       So you asked about our response. Well, you can't, I mean, I think when, when Bush went into Iraq, people, I had a legitimate debate about what should be done about tyrants like Sadam Hussein because he was obviously a horrible person and his sons were even worse. But the idea of that catastrophe consisting of the reemergence of chaos could be met by dissimulation and conscious lies and that, that would work out successfully. Well, that's, I would say that's willfully blind, a corrupt and naive all at the same time. And that's what characterized our response,

Speaker 5:          01:14:13       wasn't that response plan by a group who were disciples and followers of a philosopher called Strauss, is that correct?

Speaker 4:          01:14:21       Yes, that's right. That's right. And, and they had put a manifesto together back in the mid 19 nineties had written Clinton expressing their, their need to invade Iraq. Um, which, which I don't really think is the issue, like I said, because Saddam Hussein was a terrible person and it isn't clear that the international community exactly knows what to do with barbaric dictators. The problem wasn't necessarily the idea that going after Saddam Hussein was justified. The problem was that an event that had absolutely nothing to do with him was utilized in it absolutely deceitful manner by people who had a preexistent agenda to deceive their entire populous and to justify and to use that as justification for doing something that they had other reasons for doing it.

Speaker 5:          01:15:19       When the, when the justification for judging, it seems that you have to be in order to be able to judge as in Nuremberg, the victors judged, uh, the judge saying, you know, they put him on trial. But otherwise, as you said, the world community, you don't seem to know what to do otherwise with a, it seems complicated

Speaker 4:          01:15:43       problem, right? I mean, it's part of the problem we're talking about is what's the appropriate response to the manifestation of evil. Well, I would say generally speaking, evil is something best corralled in your own life. And once you more or less corralled in your own life, if you have in fact manage that because that is a very, very difficult thing to do. Well then maybe you have something to say about it on a social level. But, um, we, we con people, put the cart before the horse and many, many individuals who are unable to make peace in their own house are perfectly willing to go out and try to make peace in the world. Well, there's more Brisson ideology and that then there is intelligence. And, and, uh, and portia,

Speaker 5:          01:16:36       and this is something else you want to add about either Jordan or whether you want to talk more about you ideas you're working on.

Speaker 4:          01:16:47       Well, there's just a, just one thing I wanted to have. I mentioned nine slash 11 and New Orleans.

Speaker 5:          01:16:54       Yes. New Orleans

Speaker 4:          01:16:55       is another example of the death of the king and the reemergence of chaos being the same thing. The chaos in genesis is watery and it's watery chaos that causes flood. And the flood that God caused with regards to Noah was the reemergence of chaos because of a corrupt social order. On the same thing happened in New Orleans, on the one hand it was a storm, so the storm caused the flooding, but on the other hand, had the levies been four feet higher, there wouldn't have been a catastrophe. So the fact that there was a flood of New Orleans is as much evidence that order was insufficient to hold chaos back as it is evidenced that the chaotic hand of God is perfectly capable of causing natural disasters.

Speaker 5:          01:17:53       Exactly.

Speaker 4:          01:17:54       And it was not just disorder but corruption, right? So it's archaic cultural systems, the, the levies there were too old and starting to deteriorate. So there's, they deteriorate of their own accord. Plus the deterioration is sped along by the fact that the people who are punitively in charge of them aren't taking their responsibility seriously.

Speaker 5:          01:18:17       Metaphor. That reminds me in Australia, on the beaches that have been shark attacks where they have short sentences in the, um, in the sea which has not been repaired, and there are holes in the fences are getting through and attacking surface is the same. The same

Speaker 4:          01:18:44       example popped into your mind is because of the mythological equivalence you see, because the underwater creature, that terrible human devouring underwater creature is a prime, mythological, cool representation of chaos. So for example, a mat in the Enuma elish who's basically the model for the Leviathan is an underwater drag, an underwater devouring dragon, and she's the prime symbol of chaos. And so I would say your example was brought to mind by the mythological equivalent between the two, between the two occurrences

Speaker 5:          01:19:28       hearing you discuss your ideas and your work maps of meaning. Could you please tell us where this book is available?

Speaker 4:          01:19:35       Well, I would say the simplest place to find it at Amazon, if you go to my website, which is maps of meaning Dotcom,

Speaker 5:          01:19:45       right?

Speaker 4:          01:19:46       There are lectures on the book televised by Canadian Public Television and, uh, links to places the book can be purchased. So that's probably the simplest thing to do.

Speaker 5:          01:20:06       You'll your, your, um, lecturing,

Speaker 3:          01:20:09       or are you touring or what's happening now?

Speaker 4:          01:20:13       Well, I've written recently a few papers on the nature of self deception, which is a very paradoxical concept. Um, self deception implies that at least in its classical formulations that a person knows something and doesn't know something at the same time, which is a problematic conceptually for a variety of reasons. I've been trying to crack that problem. Um, I've also been attempting to recast our models of neuropsychological functioning. I'm starting from the presupposition that what the mind encounters is much more properly conceptualized as an information rich matrix of relationships than it is conceptualized as a place of material objects. And that's following to some degree the ideas of the physicist wheeler who was a student of nails for I believe, who, who has hypothesized that the fundamental elements of matter are more like bit more like computer bits of information than they are. Like something classically material.

Speaker 5:          01:21:40       The causes is the events that happen.

Speaker 4:          01:21:44       Well, it does seem related to that in some manner that I described earlier about the capacity of human consciousness to make order out of chaos. I personally believe, and this is partly because of what I've learned from reading religious mythology, that human consciousness realizes the world in some non metaphorical sense. I cry, I'm not a materialist, and I truly believe that if human consciousness did not exist, the idea that there would be existence is in some manner wrong. I think existence is dependent on consciousness and I've been trying to work out the implications of that idea in a scientifically rigorous manner and that constitutes partly what I've been writing about recently.

Speaker 5:          01:22:50       Granted, if you can sit here and talk about, let's talk about, for instance, think of the first world

Speaker 3:          01:22:57       war

Speaker 5:          01:23:00       and we think that this happened, that happened, et cetera. You can think about the great depression. Neither you nor I were alive at the time.

Speaker 8:          01:23:11       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:23:13       but we take it for granted that it happened. Now, if you go from now, today and you go forward 100 years, neither you nor I will be alive then, but that shouldn't worry us should it?

Speaker 4:          01:23:31       Well, I would say that the are being would still be embedded in the matrix of reality,

Speaker 5:          01:23:37       right?

Speaker 4:          01:23:39       Because the things fulled up in a way the past folds up and it's still present in the present and the future is not yet unfolded. Implicit in the present, and I would say just as none of your deeds do you just as you cannot escape from the consequences of any of your deeds, the record of your being and the and the nature of that being is embedded in the fabric of reality permanently,

Speaker 5:          01:24:17       possibly what we can of a manmade abstraction. Maybe there is no such thing as time.

Speaker 4:          01:24:27       Well there is for us and what that means in some ultimate sense is obviously not a conceptually accessible to us. I think that's part of the reason why it's possible to realize that the implications of your behavior and your conceptions reverberate far past you. Things are not necessarily precisely what they seem.
