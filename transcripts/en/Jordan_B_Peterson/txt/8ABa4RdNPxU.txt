Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       I guess since you started your videos and since you started having troubles with know with human rights tribunals or threats by u of t and I just think it's common sense that I said that I think that promoting critical thinking, helping people to be able to tolerate subjects that they may not feel comfortable about, but then they should be able to hear and process not based on emotions but based on an actual analysis of the facts, the evidence, the reality versus some agenda being shoved down their throat, whether it's media through the professors and anyone teaching in academia knows that there are professors who have no problem with basically teaching their truths as fact. And so I've been promoting this, promoting it within my own organization that are the Ontario Psychological Association. I got a lot of flack from other psychologists who thought, no, we can't allow this type of speech to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:01:04       That's a discussion that you're supposed to have had. The Travis didn't really, um, it was October I believe when you had those other professors coming in and talking about, you know, the issue somewhat. Some psychologists wrote pieces in, in national art, a media publication saying this kind of discussion should not happen. Yeah, okay. So and this from psychologists, the ones who are supposed to be best trained to be able to tolerate the discomfort that goes around. It goes along with, you know, discussing uncomfortable topics. So I was hoping for you to be able to share with, you know, the audience, your experience in the last few months in trying to promote this. I, you know, what you were basically trying to promote, which I think I'll let you describe in your own words.

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:01:50       So where do you think about those videos for a minute? Well, I think there were two things that. Oh, I should give you some background on the videos I guess. I mean I just made them in my office at home. I wasn't, I had no idea what the consequence would be. I was just trying to sort out my thoughts about pardoning both. Not so much bill [inaudible] as the background policies that surround it, especially on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website because the bill itself looks rather innocuous. It's only about two paragraphs long. The only part of it that isn't innocuous is the insistence that

Speaker 3:          00:02:28       the insistence on transforming the hate, the hate speech codes, including including harassment and discrimination based on gender. What was it? Gender identity and gender expression, right in the hate speech codes. I thought that's. That's weird that there's something out there. Anyways, I started digging more into the background on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website and the policies surrounding bill [inaudible] to call them appalling is barely scratched the surface there. They're unbelievably badly written and contract internally contradictory and over inclusive and dangerous and I mean they do things, for example, like make employer's responsible for all the speech acts of their employees whether they have intended or unintended consequences. That's completely the only reason you would write a law like that is to get as many employers in trouble as you could possibly manage because there's no other reason for formulating the legislation that way and I've also. A colleague of mine came in recently from at the university and he's starting to teach a little bit about the background for this sort of thing and one of his classes and he showed me the developmental progression of the policies surrounding bill c 16 and originally they were written in a much more in a tighter format, but then they were farmed out for what they call public consultation, which basically meant they ran them by a variety of people who I would say are very strongly on the activist end of the political spectrum and they basically, in order to not bother anyone who they had consulted with, they decided, for example, that gender identity should be nothing but subjective choice, which is.

Speaker 3:          00:04:01       I don't even know what to say about that. If you're a psychologist and you have any sense at all, that's a completely insane proposition. It's first of all predicated on the idea that your identity is your subjective choice and that's never been the case for any sort of identity. Anywhere you you take your identity is twofold. The first thing that your identity is a functional set of tools to help you operate in the world, meaning read Piaget, you know, we've just scratched the surface of piaget even and you find out that, you know, children start to construct their identities really when they're breastfeeding because that's when you first started your social interactions. You start integrating your re. Your basic biological reflex is from an agenda perspective into something resembling a social relationship because breastfeeding actually happens to be quite a complex act and then you expand your, your developing identity out into the small microcosmic social world of the family basically starting with your mother.

Speaker 3:          00:05:00       But then you have siblings and your father and your relatives, you know, conventionally speaking and your identity is a negotiating game and you're not the only one in charge of it by any stretch of the imagination at all. I mean, one of the things that Piaget pointed out was that between the ages of two and four, and I think later research has really hammered this home, that even kids who are hyper aggressive at two, if there's a small proportion of them that are like, that learn to integrate their subjective desires into a broader social game and become socially acceptable to other children and they do that through play, you know, what they're doing is playing their identity into being. And then once they're older than about four and they've become properly socialized. So other children actually want to play with them because that's the critical issue.

Speaker 3:          00:05:48       It's the fundamental issue. Then, um, then then the, the peer community of children helps bootstrap their identity up to something that will eventually approximate and adult identity. But that's functional. It has nothing to do with whim. It's, it's, it's, that's a, it's a crazy idea. And then so, so partly your identity is the set of tools with which you functioned in the actual world. And part of it is a negotiated agreement with the other people around you. And that's all being taken out of that. That's, that's all actually as far as I can tell, that's line of theorizing is technically illegal now in Ontario, and I'm not even talking about the potential biological basis of identity because of the idea that identity has no biological basis, that's just wrong it united factually wrong. So, and we've written a social constructionist, we've written a radical social constructionist view of identity into the law, but even worse than that, we've gone beyond social constructionism because piaget was a construction constructionist into just pure.

Speaker 3:          00:06:52       When your identity can be at any moment, what you assume that it's going to be, that's not a tenable solution. It's. There's nothing about that proposition that's reasonable. So I was looking into this and I thought this is just beyond comprehension that we've written that idea into the policies surrounding bill c 16. So that. So I made that video. I was trying to sort that out and to figure out even what it meant. The terminology is messy in the extreme. First of all, with regards to gender identity, gender identity is not a spectrum. It's a modified by modal distribution. And if you're making law, you don't get to muck around with the words, you have to use the right words. And so it's a modified by mode of distribution because almost everyone who has a biological identity of male or female identifies as male or female.

Speaker 3:          00:07:41       It's 99 point seven percent and you could argue that that's a little tighter than it would be if society was more accepting of gender variation, let's say. But even if it went down to 99 percent, which would be an increase of like what? Well, it would be almost an order of magnitude increase. You still have the overwhelming number of people whose gender identity matches their biological sex. And then you can match. You can stack on top of biological sex, gender identity, virtually perfect match. Then gender expression. Almost everyone who is biologically male or female who identifies as biologically male or female expresses themselves as male or female. And then the vast majority of them have a sexual orientation that's in keeping with their, you know, in traditional keeping with their biological sex, gender identity and gender expression. So now we have a laws that says those are independent guests. What? That's not the definition of independence and you can't just play much games with your legislative terminology. It gets, it gets people in trouble so it's not a spectrum and that's that. It's a modified by mobile distribution. If there are obviously exceptions and I never argued once in the videos

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       that I put out, despite what, how people reacted to them that there weren't exceptions. Of course there are exceptions and if you look at temperament, for example, you know the big differences between men and women are agreeableness and neuroticism. Fundamentally, women are about half a standard deviation, more agreeable, that's compassionate blindness, and they're about half a standard deviation, higher in negative emotion and that's cross cultural by the way, and it also accounts for the reasons why women are about three to four times more likely to suffer cross culturally from depression and anxiety. Whereas men are more likely to be aggressively in prison and to and to drink and low agreeableness is actually the best predictor of incarceration among manner. Those are solid biological differences, but if you try to segregate men and women using only those two dimensions, you want to get it right about 75 percent of the time.

Speaker 4:          00:09:43       So there's substantial overlap, but that still doesn't mean they're, that's not a spectrum. And the idea that there are no biological differences between men and women, it's such a preposterous claim that I can't even believe that we would ever have that discussion. I mean, there's, we have men have wider jaws, men are taller, they have broader shoulders, women have more endurance and endurance sports. Women have a subcutaneous layer of fat. The shape is different. The way the arms are placed is different, the voice is different. Um, and that's just gross morphology and not even talking about genitalium. And then you can look at microstructures. There's differences between men and women at every level of the human microstructure, from the cellular all the way up to the social. So like what in the world are we talking about? What's going on here? It's crazy. So that was video number one.

Speaker 4:          00:10:33       Video number two was a bloody a human resources department at the University of Toronto has adopted an equity position. Okay, so what equity means is that it doesn't mean equality of opportunity. It means equality of outcome, and that is a. So this is the idea. The idea is that you take as a social institution like a university, and then you look at the organization of that university at every single strategy from the executive level, all the way down to the student level. Then what you do is you do an analysis of each level by community demography, right? You get to define the demographic characteristics that you're going to discuss however, which is actually a big problem. Then you make the presupposition that unless that organization at every level matches the demographic representation of the people at every level, then it's corrupt, oppressive, and discriminatory and it needs to be changed.

Speaker 4:          00:11:31       Okay, so you think, well, what's wrong with that? Every level should have 50 slash 50 men and women, let's say. It's like you're really sure about that. Are you? You're so sure about that. You don't think there's any natural differences in interests between men and women? Well, if you don't think so then why are most psychology classes, 80 percent women and that and that and that differentiation is accelerating rapidly. Like I've seen it over the course of my career from maybe 60 percent men at the beginning of my career to like 80 percent women now and men occupy more of the positions in the stem, in the stem, a stem fields, at least for now. It's the same in bloody scandinavia. It's 20 to one nurses, 20 to one women to men, nurses in Scandinavia and 20 to one men to women in engineering and that's in Scandinavia and so what's happening in Scandinavia as they've made this site or egalitarian in terms of its legal and social structures is that the gender differences in personality between men and women have got bigger, not smaller.

Speaker 4:          00:12:32       So what that means is that social constructionism is wrong. That's what it means. Wrong disproved. It's exactly the opposite of what the theory would have predicted because the theory predicted and God only knew how it was going to sort itself out. It's like, not like people knew this to begin with. The idea was that as you equalize the social, the social, uh, uh, structure that the differences between men and women would disappear. Guess what, that didn't happen and it's not. Studies have just a few hundred people in a few locations, those are population wide studies and they'd be replicated multiple times. So, and the funny thing is, is that, so they're temperamental differences between men and women. It's and neuroticism and F and agreeableness are not the only temperamental differences. So if you fragment extroversion, it fragments into um, assertiveness and gregariousness women are more gregarious. Men are more assertive.

Speaker 4:          00:13:27       If you fragment conscientiousness into orderliness and industriousness ness, women are more orderly at men are more industrious if you fragment openness, which is the creativity dimension, into interest in ideas and interest in aesthetics. You find that women are more interested in aesthetics and men are more interested in ideas. So, so because you've been fractionated the big five into 10, you get gender differences across all of them and they're not trivial either. They make a difference. So. Okay. So anyways, back to the equity thing of all the preposterous and idiotic ideas, so first of all, to make gender equity across every dimension of a, of a, of an organization who have to assume that men and women have identical interests or and, and temperaments and that if they don't, the state should intervene to bloody well ensure that they do, which is something for all you women to figure out because now there's many, many what positions in society that women preferentially occupied.

Speaker 4:          00:14:28       So what are you going to do about that and what are you going to do about the Asians because they occupy preferential positions as well. You know, they're overrepresented in all sorts of professional institutions and the probability is that that's going to increase. What are you gonna do about that? What about the Jews but are going to do about them because they have, they're in the same position as they Asians going to put quotas on all those people. What kind of stupidity is bad? And then it's worse too because let's say you equalize women and just for the sake of argument across all these different dimensions of society. Well then what are you going to do and you get to equalize for black women and Latino women and Asian women. Are you going to sub type black women because it's not like they're all the same.

Speaker 4:          00:15:10       Are you going to ensure that women from lower classes are are represented just as much as women from upper classes and how many generations back are you going to go to check that? What about intelligence? What about attractiveness? How about height? How about weight? So the problem with the fractionation by group identity is that it's endless. There's no way of ensuring equality across groups because there's an infinite number of groups you can fragment group identity all the way down into the level of the individual, which is exactly what you should do, which is what we already did in the west. We figured, well, the ultimate diverse population, there's a population of individuals. So you let the individuals sorted out, no, no, we're going to replace that with group. Well, what that means for the bloody social activists is that they'll be able to play this game forever because you can continually functioning group identity ad nauseum and so the system will never be equal and you can bloody well be sure that as we implement social policy to make sure that all outcomes are equal, the amount of space that you personally are going to have to maneuver in is going to shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink.

Speaker 4:          00:16:15       We've already seen that happen in many societies. You think we would learn from the 20th century, so that's the equity issue, and then worse, even this is the HR and equity people there actually mucking about with people's unconscious biases. So this is what we want, right? We want your employers and the state to reeducate you so that your perceptions, because that's what we're talking about with regards to unconscious bias, so that your perceptions fall into in accordance with their demands and not even your voluntary perceptions. By the way, your, your involuntary unconscious perceptions have to be retrained. Okay? So maybe that's not so good, especially when you look at that bloody implicit association test mastering biology from Harvard and Anthony Greenwald from the University of Washington. So biology is an avowed Marxist and Greenwald and both bloody well know and have written that there are implicit association task has neither the reliability northern validity to be used as an individual diagnostic tests. They know it.

Speaker 2:          00:17:17       Sorry, just something like I've collected about that in my class that not everyone is aware of that. Do you want to just give up? I can bring up a powerpoint slide or do you want to. Why don't you do that? Do you want, do you want to do that? Yeah. So I'll let you take over when you do that. So despite the fact that. Sorry, this will take me a minute. So

Speaker 4:          00:17:38       yeah. Well despite this, okay. So the implicit association task, the principle is this word association game. It's actually predicated, I would say on psychoanalytic ideas, most particularly on union ideas because young develop the association test many, many, many years ago. But it purports to investigate whether you are unconsciously bias towards one group against another group. Could be gender, could be ethnicity, could be race, could be attractiveness, whatever. But the problem is, is that when you give the same person that damn I met twice, they don't get the same results. So there's a rule for diagnostic tasks. And the rule is the reliability test, retest reliability has to exceed something like point eight or point nine, point eight at least. So the big five does that, Iq tests do that, but there's a dam, uh, there's damn few tasks that passed that reliability criteria. And the, it is the only reliable, I don't remember precisely, but I think it's about point five, which isn't even, it's not even near close enough to be used as a diagnostic test.

Speaker 4:          00:18:40       Plus it's not valid. So what does that mean? Let's say I assess your unconscious bias and give you a diagnosis. Well, there's no evidence that it predicts your behavior. So. So what, what good is it? What good is it? Well, it's good if you want people to send you to retraining exercises so that you can have your perceptions adjusted in the direction that your organization in the state thinks is proper and that's happening everywhere. I got letters this week already for people at CBC. It's becoming mandatory there. St Mike's Hospital, same thing, and they've decided that all of their micro institutions within the hospital will be equitable. There'll be 50 percent women and 50 percent men at every single level of the organization or the organization is corrupt and oppressive. It's like it's and that it's spreading so fast. You can't believe that. I wrote Mazur and Banaji and Anthony Greenwald yesterday.

Speaker 4:          00:19:33       I hadn't set it off to some of my colleagues say, are you going to come out and make a public statement about the fact that your damn test is being used by pathological people for nefarious purposes? It's like, well, we'll see what they have to say about that. I was a bit more polite in my letters, but there's no excuse for it. There's absolutely no excuse for it and as far as I'm concerned, is part of the broader corruption of social psychology. You guys may know or may not. The social psychology has been rife with with a controversy and scandal over the last three or four years and a big part of the reason for that is it's damn corrupt. Discipline and that use of the iat for political reasons is a perfect example of that. There is no excuse for it and the people at St Mike's, you know, they say, well, this is scientifically validated.

Speaker 4:          00:20:20       It's like, no, it's not and worse. Let's say you do have unconscious bias just for the sake of argument and you could measure it reliably, which you can't, and then it was valid, which it isn't. Let's say all of those things were in case there's no evidence whatsoever that those damn unconscious bias training programs, retraining programs have the effect that they're supposed to have and there's some evidence that they actually have the reverse effect and maybe that's because people don't like being marched off to reeducation by their employers after they've been diagnosed as racist. Even if there's no evidence that they in fact are so, it's an absolute misuse of psychology and it's in. It's. It's politically motivated. It's politically motivated. It's an assault on freedom. Anyways, I made those two videos and I took, tried to take the HR and equity people at unt to task because they made that training mandatory for their hr people.

Speaker 4:          00:21:13       I thought, you don't have the right as an employer to invade the unconscious structures of your employee's minds and alter their political perspective. Even though you can't do it. You don't have the right to do that and to think about it as something you should do. As a matter of course, as part of your ethical duty is you really want that. You really want that. That's what you want your employers to be able to do. Figure out independently of your behavior whether or not you're like you're a racist or classist or or a misogynist or whatever that happens to be and you already think that the bureaucrats at the university, for example, or bureaucrats anywhere for that matter are actually capable and qualified of doing such a thing properly without doing far more damage than, than any possible. Good. Well, so anyways, I made those two videos trying to sort this out into investigated in them for whatever reason, you know the proverbial well, you know what happened by within two months there was 180 newspaper articles written about it and I don't know how many millions of people have watched these things online now, but it's plenty and so what that also means is I put my finger on something because who cares what it did when it professor from the University of Toronto does with his spare time at midnight.

Speaker 4:          00:22:28       No one should care. I should have had my 15 minutes of notoriety if that. But that isn't what happened. It was, it was major news in Canada for three months and I'm still talking to people all over the world about it. I get a hundred letters a day, at least I can't keep up with them about pete from people who are being cornered in all sorts of ways by their idiot employers and these safe space propositions at universities and the restrictions on their speech. They can. They tell me constantly, well, I really agree with you, but I'm afraid to say anything about it. So like, oh good. That's a wonderful position for us to be in where people are afraid. They're afraid to speak their minds, what the hell and it's not getting better and if we don't do something about, it's going to get a lot worse.

Speaker 4:          00:23:13       You saw what happened at Berkeley. That's just a taste of what's to come. You know, one day there's going to be an antifascist demonstration with a little bit of violence and the bad guys on the other side. You're going to come out and we're not gonna like that very much. So maybe we should get our acts together and stop that from happening before it actually happens, unless that's what you want and I wouldn't recommend it. We have a pretty sophisticated society and it wouldn't take much to put a spanner into the spokes and with everybody on their forehead. So wake up for Christ's sake. It's this is not good. And the fact that the fact that, you know, the bloody federal government has decided that they won't let people pick the judiciary or unless they take unconscious bias retraining. Right. What hail. It's crazy. So anyways, that's what happened

Speaker 2:          00:24:06       in addition to ideologically driven. Just to that, do you think of. I'm always quite cynical. Do you think it's also a make work project for a bunch of people that they figure, you know, we can create these tests that aren't valid, aren't reliable, but we've got an industry, you know, that that's going to keep going forever now. But you'd never expect social psychologists to be careerists with you? Yes. Yes, definitely. Well, I mean it got out of hand too. It's not, you know, people don't necessarily plan these things. I'm sure that the Ontario Human Rights Commission, when they were talking about preferred pronoun use, had no idea whatsoever that within four years of introducing the policies that there would be 71 different gender identity categories. No one saw that coming. How could you possibly see that coming? And I don't think Banerji and Greenwald had any idea that there tests would be transformed into an implement public policy so rapidly.

Speaker 2:          00:24:58       Right? So, okay. And just for those who are interested, the, uh, the implicit associations, their implicit attitudes test, um, my students, I always give a link to that. And if anyone's interested, I can give you a link where you can go to the test and actually do it yourself and find out. Because the assumption is that if you are implicitly racist, so explicitly racist. Say I hate blacks, I say implicitly racist. Oh No. Some of my best friends. But when you do this test, the idea is that if you're shown a black person's face, okay. Versus a white person's face, you're more likely to associate that black person with us a violence. So you're basically being primed unconsciously is when you see a black face, if you subsequently see a weapon and you're asked to decide whether this is a weapon or a tool there more quickly going to say weapon because you're already thinking dangerous violence weapons because you know, you have this negative association of blacks with weapons and you'll do that faster than when you see a white face, the white face to be more neutral.

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       So whether you see after the white face, a gun or a weapon in theory should be about equal, equal time to determine whether you know it is one or the other, things like that. This is the kind of test that they do and they've associated or they've done this test as Dr Peterson, same with countless other types of constructs. And again, the reliability, the validity is not just suspect, it's just, it's not existent. And um, as I said, if you'd like to try it out, if, if, um, if you're a student check out on the bright space page, if you're not, email me, facebook me and it'll give you the link and you could have done it too, like I think 50 different, at least you know, Democrat Democrats, Republican, the vanilla strawberry, that there's all these different things that you can do and see where your implicit or unconscious biases are.

Speaker 2:          00:26:40       And as Dr Peterson saying, it's getting out of hand and this whole idea of the gender pronouns, because during the debate that you had or whatever that was at the u of t, one of the people that I think she was a lawyer, very condescendingly ran across with. That's right. She's like, oh, this kind of thing would never happen. You don't know what you're talking about. What, first of all, the Human Ontario human rights tribunal page, they specifically say that Jen, you know, that, uh, you have to identify people by their preferred identity or expression, which includes pronoun usage. It's there on their page. It's not explicitly stated in Bill [inaudible], but the Ontario human rights tribunal who will in fact enact any type of action against somebody who's, you know, who's violated these policies. Okay. It's on there. Very page. And I know you spoke about your own experience.

Speaker 2:          00:27:27       I hope that because not everyone saw the debate. Can you just talk about that part where it's speaking to other professionals who don't seem to be ideologically driven like Kaufman? Uh, what they said about the, the risks. Oh, sexually, this is so important. It was interesting. I mean, she's, she's definitely not looking at this the same way that I knew. One of the things she said we're in a rather condescending manner was that I wouldn't be sent to jail even though I wanted to be. I'm paraphrasing, but that's roughly what she said, but that you know, that the human rights tribunal could take away my property in my wages and all of that, but that seemed to be okay for her as long as it didn't extend to jail. But that's also nonsense because if you're, if you're found guilty by the human rights started getting land, you don't pay, then that's contempt of court and that goes to a different court and then they put you in jail and that's already happened.

Speaker 2:          00:28:17       So it's, it's, it's crooked lawyer, hand waving fundamentally, and it's an attempt to play down the significance of the law. You go and read about you online and read about the powers of the human rights tribunal and then see how safe you feel. So here's one of the things they can do. This is section one, point six. It's in a document about powers of the powers of the tribunals. They call them social justice tribunals. In Ontario, they actually called the social justice tribunal. It's mind boggling. They can suspend precedent, lead normal legal precedent and jurisprudential tradition in the pursuit of their age. That's one of the. It's actually documented as one of their powers. Think about that. Like we live in a society that's essentially bound by the restrictions of English common law. English common law is one of the most remarkable developments of civilization ever, period. Because what? See, in the English system, basically the presupposition is that you have all the rights, there are, they're not enumerate, you just have all of them except when one of those rights imposes a restriction on someone else and then they get irritated you and take you to court and then the judge sorts out who's who has which micro, right and then that's laid out is precedent and so English common law is this tremendous body of evolved doctrine about how the infinite number

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       of human rights that each individual has interacts with everyone else's rights. And like back when Trudeau Trudeau brought the human rights code, the bill of rights, the Canadian bill of rights, there were lots of people who were upset by it because it's a different form of legal reasoning. The bill of rights says, here's the rights you have that the government is granting you. That's not how it works under the English code. The English code is you have all the rights there are, but they rub up against other people's. Right? So we have to sort that out. We do that with court and precedent and that's what the Human Rights Commission and tried people in Ontario can dispense with if they want, and the reason there, I know the reason that they put that line in there, it's because the social justice hypothesis is that the legal structures of Western civilization are oppressive.

Speaker 3:          00:30:31       Patriarchal, uh, are oppressive and patriarchal and so it's perfectly reasonable to toss them over. If you're in pursuit of something like social justice, it's like, that's fine. People, sure, go ahead and do that. But if you think that you can transform what we have already now into some kind of utopia, then you're dangerous because that isn't how the world works and Utopians it'd be more dangerous than any other people for the last hundred years. That's for sure. Like there's all sorts of things wrong with Western society always, and there always will be, but compared to 85 to 90 percent of the rest of the planet, this is bloody heaven. And that's why people want to move here. So you can say, well, it's corrupt compared to my imaginary utopia. It's like, yeah, that's for sure. It certainly is, but if your imaginary utopia was realized in in hardcore politics over a 30 year period, everyone would be out in the streets starving to death.

Speaker 3:          00:31:28       We already know that because it happened multiple times throughout the 20th century in societies that were. Well, they weren't as sophisticated as our society is now, but they were plenty sophisticated for their time and you'll hear the neo Marxist types. This is the most annoying argument ever anyone ever makes. They say, well, what happened in the Soviet Union that wasn't real communism? It's like first, Oh yes, it was. That's why it also happened in China, which was a very different society, but what they really mean when they say that as well. You know that stellan character, he wasn't such a good guy. He didn't really know how to implement the Marxist doctrines, but me, I'm pretty pure of heart and if you would have made me dictator for 20 years, then the utopia would have arrived as promised. It's like, first of all, if you think that there's something wrong with you, you're dangerous.

Speaker 3:          00:32:16       And second, let's just say for a minute that some saint did get ahold of the tools of power and try to implement from each according to his ability to each according to his knee and actually did that in a pure and safe manner. Here's what would happen. The next people in the revolutionary string, like Stalin would come along and stab them in their band in the middle of the night and that would be the end of that. So No. So there's absolutely no excuse whatsoever for that sort of thinking. And if you read Solzhenitsyn's school like archipelago, which you should do like everyone should because it's like the definitive document of this sort of thing emerged that emerged from the 20th century. Solzhenitsyn laid out with extraordinary clarity first in his writings on Lenin and then in his writings on the Soviet Union more broadly, exactly how the current dishes and pathological Marxist doctrines were transformed logically and systematically into the sorts of laws that killed millions of people. Millions of people. There were people starving so badly in the Soviet Union by the 19 twenties that they had posters telling them not to eat their children. So we've been down that road already. So what the hell are we doing? We're going down that road again under the guise of equity, right? And, and, and, and equality. Well, that was the doctrines that promoted those laws to begin with.

Speaker 5:          00:33:45       Not Good. Okay. So

Speaker 2:          00:33:49       when Dr said when you did, when you talk this way, some people are going to say either you're pulling things out of proportion or you know, you've made a huge leap from where we are now to where we should be. And so I think there's a lot of room for misunderstanding for people, especially if they have certain ideologies that they would like to protect. So one of the reasons I want to invite people over was to be able to ask questions. You've heard Song Dr Peterson's, uh, tenants that he's trying to convey. Um, and he said, you know, and I don't have any videos. Each person has watched, but you have an opportunity right now. That's okay. If someone, if someone has a specific question either from somebody talking to Peterson has said today or things you've heard, the videos will be negative. I really want to ask them face to face, straight up, what do you mean by this or what is your solution to that? Please? I'm opening up the floor. Just talk really loud. Please let Mike can pick it up and that everyone's going to hear. Does anybody have a specific question that you'd like to ask? Okay. Oh, sorry. I'll let Barbara K. okay.

Speaker 5:          00:34:45       It's a little bit of a Sidebar, but I've watched. I've watched your videos. They're resilient than some of your longer ones and explained and I. I'm intrigued by your. I know one of your heroes was a great man. I'm a little disturbed. I would love to know why was the anti Semitic,

Speaker 3:          00:35:04       you know, the book that he wrote in which he was accused of antisemitism has not been yet translated into English.

Speaker 5:          00:35:12       There's only one place.

Speaker 3:          00:35:13       Well, one of the things that he did, but he certainly. There's certainly no sign of Antisemitism in the Gulag archipelago. Not as far as I could tell and I don't think in the other books I've read, I haven't seen that either. He did write a book near the end of his wife on the role that Jewish intellectuals played in the establishment of the Soviet Union, but you can't get it in English, so I don't know what to say about that. I know that it's being criticized from both sides. I would say one side saying, well, this was a story that needed to be told and the other side saying, well, this sphere is it down anti anti Semitism. So. But you would ask that question. That's the question. Okay, so I'm going to venture out on a limb because I've been thinking about this for a while. Am I going to venture out on.

Speaker 3:          00:36:10       No, I've. No, I haven't gotten my thoughts formulated well enough. The leftest doctrines tend to be very attractive, the intellectuals and so any group that's overrepresented in intellectuals is likely going to be overrepresented on the left, the standard of the spectrum, and there are temperamental reasons for that. We know that if you lean left, it's because you're hiring openness and lower in orderliness and that seems to be associated with, with ICU at least in part, but I don't want to go into it any more than that because because I haven't thought it through sufficiently, but I also haven't been able to get a coffee and social mentors last book because you can't get an English hasn't been translated for one reason or another. So, but I don't think you'll see anything like that in the Gulag archipelago. There's another question before I'm going to ask. Have you asked the question but after we get back to this, because you mentioned a number of times, both the correlates between Iq and the left and that um, the, uh, people who believe in the support thought police are not actually, they're not left. Is there a whole other category of. Yeah, that's such an important distinction to turn to in a few minutes. But first this question please.

Speaker 5:          00:37:17       So the current proposition in regards to how you going.

Speaker 3:          00:37:30       I think we're doing a good job of that right now. I mean, how fast do you think things, how fast could you even hope for things to change? Look at what's happened to the situation and limits inspected with women since 1970 has changed so fast that people can't even keep up. It's not obvious by the way, are there that it's been particularly good for women now you could make a case that it was good for society. Maybe it's a tough one, a because the birth rate has plummeted and so maybe you don't care about that. Maybe you think there's too many people on the planet already, whatever, but if it isn't that easy to figure out when something is working property, one of the things we do know we seem to know is there to the degree that rights are extended to women economic prosperity follows.

Speaker 3:          00:38:13       So you can see worldwide that the societies that have extended the rights to women most extensively are also the societies that seem to be flourishing economically and there does seem to be a causal relationship, but women have paid a big price for that. So what's happened in part is first of all for for say a women who were middle class or lower their their lights if essentially fallen apart because marriage is now restricted to the ranch, which is also something to think about. For those of you who think marriage is oppressive, patriarchal institution. It's like, okay, then why are only the rich people getting married? They're oppressing themselves. I don't think so. And so the women who are in the lower socioeconomic stratus are suffering, Madelyn and so are their children and they have terrible jobs most of the time, like jobs in retail where you know, they're called in every day for the next day.

Speaker 3:          00:39:03       They don't have a schedule that it set out ahead of them. They get paid very badly. They've got kids to take care of and so they have no free time. It makes them really easy targets for useless predatory males and it's really hard on the kids and that's like 40 percent of the female population. Something like that. You guys, while I don't know about all of you, but you're in university, you're part of the privileged cognitive elite. You know, so these sorts of things don't really touch you the same way they touch other people and so women are much happier if you look at national polls than they were say in the late 19 fifties and early 19 sixties. And I think that's partly because freedom and happiness, those are not the same thing. They're not even close. And now I see young women all the time struggling to figure out what to do with their lives because they have no idea how to have a job slash career and a family.

Speaker 3:          00:39:53       So. And there's no answer to that. It's a really difficult problem, you know, and there's all sorts of ideas. Like I did a lot of consulting for law firms for a long time, about a decade and I had a lot of clients who were extremely high functioning female lawyers, younger ones trying to figure out how to balance their career with their desire to have a life. And you know, you hear all the time about women being denied access to positions of power and that that's uh, that's the consequences of prejudice and oppression. It's like, yeah, yeah, everything is caused by the same thing first, right? You have got one causal principle. Wonderful. Now you're a philosopher. You can figure out everything with it. It's like the law firms cannot keep their women in their thirties. They cannot keep them. The big law firms, they all leave. Why? Because the women hit 30. They're brilliant. Conscientious, intelligent. They were deadly in highschool, deadly, and university. They nailed law school. They whipped through their article. They made partner by the time they were 30 and it's like they're in a rocket to the top position. What do they find when they get their 80 hour work weeks? Right? Because that's one of the things you want to think about. You know, you think that the people who run things are sitting at home smoking big cigars and like

Speaker 4:          00:41:04       telling their minions what to do. It's like that is not. That's like the 19 twenties millionaire. That's on the cover of the monopoly game. Going sociological analysis. I know lots of people

Speaker 3:          00:41:15       or like that and they work all the time. All the time.

Speaker 4:          00:41:19       Second, they wake up until the second they go to sleep and they don't just casually work, you know, because I know some of you go to the library for six hours and you say, well I studied in the library for six hours. Like no you did you study for half an hour coffee

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       and you look through facebook and I went home and you said, well I studied for six hours and you're happy about it, but you don't bloody well you did part because you can't, you know, I can only read for about three and a half hours until I'm done and I'm pretty good at it. So these people who are running things, there's corrupt people obviously, but the vast majority of them first are self made. Its second. They're so bloody efficient and smart. You cannot believe it. And they work 80 hours a week at. Most of them happened to be mad. And why is that? Because there are a small number of insane men who will do nothing but work 80 hours a week and no matter where you put them, if you put them in the middle of a forest with an ax and all they would do is run around chopping down trees.

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       So the issue isn't why aren't there more women in positions of power? It's why are there any men insane enough ever to occupy those positions? You know, because we also know and the data on this, it's very clear what's the relationship between money. It will be once you have enough money to keep the bill collectors from your door. So once you have enough money to stave off misery, which is sort of lower middle class, something like that in our society, maybe a little little lower than that. Extra money does not help you. It does not improve your life. So why bother with it? Well, that's what the women in the law firms think. It's like most of them, by the time they're in their thirties, are married. Almost all of them are married to men who make as much money or more than they do because that's what women go for cross culturally four to five years older, equal or higher in socioeconomic status, so their.

Speaker 3:          00:43:12       Their husband's already made $350,000 a year. It's like they think, well, I don't need much more money. The man used money to keep track of the competition by the way, because all the male lawyers that I talked to, her usually real hard ass guys really low in agreeableness, really high in conscientiousness, like conservative types, low in openness as well and they want to win and the reason they care about your damn bonus at the end of the year isn't even so much because of the money. It's because they got a much bigger bonus than the other son of a bitch sitting beside them and they're happy about that. So there's a real, like a real brass knuckles competition that drives these sorts of things, but we get things backwards so often in, in, in psychology and in sociology. It's not why there aren't more women in positions of power.

Speaker 3:          00:43:56       It's whiting. Any men want those positions, you just have no idea the amount of responsibility that comes along with that. You just imagine for a minute trying to run a billion dollar corporation. You can't even bloody well balanced your checkbook and there's dust bunnies underneath your bed. How in the world would you ever run a billion dollar corporation? Those things are complicated and you have enemies and they're trying to take you out all the time. You look at apple and Samsung, man, they're just torturing each other in the courts nonstop. You know, you'll, if you're, if you're running a big corporation, you'll be. You'll be handling two or 300 lawsuits a time and that's just, that's just nothing compared to the complexity of what you actually have to do. Stay on top of the technology, constantly interact with your large customers. Travel all the time because you have to maintain the relationships.

Speaker 3:          00:44:46       You have to regulate the politics inside the business. You have, believe me, it's no picnic and you think, well, they get a lot of money. It's like, what makes you think that's such a good thing? You know, like if you're a half crazy and you have a lot of money, you're going to be crazy a lot faster, I can tell you that frees you from all sorts of constraints. You know, we know the data on lottery winners, they're no happier a year later and some of them are done, especially if they had like a bit of a cocaine problem to begin with because you know, being broke stops you from dying. If you're a cocaine addict, if you get enough money and the way you go and you think to yourself, you know, you've got all sorts of bad habits, weirdnesses. If somebody dumped an infinite amount of money on you, what makes you think you would unravel completely?

Speaker 3:          00:45:32       It's highly probable. So anyway, so back to these women, you know what they do in their thirties, they look around and they played hit partner so they hit the pinnacle of their profession. They think, what the hell am I doing this for? Why would anyone in their right mind want to be woken up at three in the morning, Sunday by they're irate Japanese client who wants them to work for the next five hours nonstop to fix this damn problem, which is going to cost them $100,000,000 right now, or we'll find someone else to pay $750 an hour or two to fix it right now. When you think, well, that's, you know, a masculine form of value that. Because that's one of the criticisms. If the law firms just adopted a more feminine structure of value, it's like what kind of bullshit is and the reason, the reason that you get up, it's three in the morning on Sunday to talk to your Japanese client was freaking out about their contract is because if you don't jump the hell up and do it right now, there's some starving associate who's unbelievably ambitious in New York will pick up the pieces and two tenths of a second and they're smart and aggressive and they'll take you out.

Speaker 3:          00:46:36       So it has nothing to do with masculine structures of values. All the foolish ideas. And you know, it's not just law where this happens, you know, we know for example, that female doctors were far fewer hours too. So the more female doctors you have, the more doctors you have to have. And I'm not complaining about women's priorities. I'm not saying that women are wrong. Not at all. It's like the older I get, the more I understand that marriage and family are a primary importance. And the more I see women in particular, no, they hit 35 or 40 and they're not married, they don't have kids and they are not happy because what the hell are you going to do from the time you're 40 till the time you're 80, you've got no family, you got no relationships. What are you going to do? Go Run your company.

Speaker 3:          00:47:23       Yeah. Well if you're one in a thousand that'll satisfy. So you well better make sure you're that one in a thousand and you're probably not because those people are rare. So. So, so then, uh, Dr Peterson one of the natural response to what you said, would it be okay? Well, the priorities are, it's a rigged game because only when there are the ones who are able to procreate. So what do we answer to that? Of course it's a rigged game. Obviously it's a rate game. Women have complicated lives and the pill has made them more complicated. Well that's not. I wouldn't say that exactly because you know, 100 years in 18, 95, the average person in the western world lived on $1 a day in today's money. Okay? So those people worked so hard at slaved away to such a degree that you can't even imagine it and all their kids die.

Speaker 3:          00:48:11       Right? So they, that the death rate among kids below five years beyond comprehension. And so like women have terrible time as well. So did men. They got to be coal miners and soldiers because now that wasn't exactly entertaining, you know? So life was very, very, very, very, very hard before we got rich and we're rich. Even those of you who are in this class, we think you're poor. It's like, no, you're not, you're in the top one 10th of one percent by historical standards. And probably there by world standards as well. Of course you can just compare yourself to the few people who Richard than you and feel sorry for yourself. But that's pretty pathetic in my estimation. So it's ended certainly historically uninformed. So yeah, women have it rough obviously. Now there's, there's other things to consider. You do live eight years longer, so that's not trivial.

Speaker 3:          00:49:02       Testosterone kills men. That's basically why men die earlier. You know, men are much more likely to be killed in dangerous jobs. They do almost all the dangerous jobs. They do almost all the outside work and there's lots of reasons that men get paid more than women that have nothing to do with the prejudice. It's because they take awful, horrible jobs like working in the oil rigs in northern Alberta, but it's bloody 40 below and come out of that after five years with two or three fingers missing and, and all warped up because you really want to wrestle pipe when it's 40 below and it's filthy with a bunch of ordinary man who are hung over beyond belief. It's like that's not very entertaining. So yeah, I mean each gender, each sex has its own unfairness to deal with, but to think of that as a consequence of the social structure, it's like, come on, really, what about nature itself?

Speaker 3:          00:49:54       And this is something, this is something that seems to be completely invisible on the left side of the political spectrum. It's like, of course you're bloody oppressed and your life is full of suffering obviously, but to think about that as a direct consequence of unjust social structures is just moronic. It's like that's part of the reason a small part, but look where you're sitting people, it's pretty warm in here and you're so privileged. You can come here at Saturday morning and listen to an intellectual lecture. It's like you should be happy about that because by historical standards you should be out lifting rocks in your skeletal form about five foot three with no teeth. Cougars, cougars alliance. Yeah, exactly. So you know, there's no gratitude. That's the thing. There's no gratitude for what our society is capable of doing. So a three.

Speaker 6:          00:50:46       Yeah, Dr Peterson. Tell them what do you think about that? Because I was thinking what happens when the forces of the gender identity, gender expression clash with the Marx, the capitalist market forces, for example, sports is a multibillion dollar industry and if some women start saying we express ourselves as bad because we're mad and the law is on their side. Do you think that this billion dollar industry is going to come out with some women wanting to be football teams on the Toronto Maple leafs? I don't think so. Sad. Whenever you do of the market forces will will clash with this and then some of these issues.

Speaker 3:          00:51:27       Well, market forces will be a constraining factor. Partly because the market tends to punish things that don't work in the market very, very rapidly. You know, and that's another thing with regards to thinking about say equality or equity in the workplace. If you believe that there is a equivalent distribution of talent across all the categories, that you have some reason to wait for the market to sort itself out because you know, even if you're a, an anticapitalist, you at least have to understand that the people that you despise are motivated by greed. And so they're going to try to find people who will make them the most money and they basically do that. It's a pretty stupid employer who won't take someone tell them to when they come along and you might say, well, they're prejudiced and they're not doing such a great job of, of like sorting out the applicants.

Speaker 3:          00:52:21       It's like, that's fine. There'll be stomped real good by people who are much better at it because like talent is unbelievably rare. I don't know if you guys have talked about the freedom distribution at all, but. Well, productivity is not normally distributed. You don't even learned psychology. That's everything is normally distributed. It's like, no, it's not random. Things are normally distributed, but productivity isn't random. And so what you see that productivity is actually governed by something called price's law, which is a variation of another principle called the preto principle, which was discovered back in the late 18 hundreds by deal Fredel Pareto who was an economist. What price showed he price actually studying scientific productivity. And so what he shows, it's quite cool. At the time when he did this, this was in 1960, the typical phd student had one publication on graduation, okay, half as many had two, half as many as that had three, half as many as that had a massive step down in productivity and you see this in beside in scientific productivity periods, so what happens that in any given scientific domain, there's a clump of people sort of on the left side of the distribution, the less productive side and there have an in that clump.

Speaker 3:          00:53:34       Men and women are equally productive, but then there's a tiny percentage of people who publish all the papers and they're all men and they're those insane man that I was telling you about before that do not work for 80, almost a week. And the thing is, if you want to rise to the top of a profession, do you think about it? What do you need to rise to the top of a competitive profession? You better be smart cars, smart makes you fast and you're not going to get to the next place faster than anyone else. Unless you're faster than them. You bloody well better be conscientious, industrious in particular, so it should make you feel horrible every second of your life you spent doing something that involves leisure and there's going to be some people in here that know that Mr hyperconscious branches, I can't stand sitting around doing nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:54:18       I got to find some art to it. You know, when you'll do whatever you have to that's work because you feel guilty and horrible if you're sitting around. So you need to be hyper conscientious and so maybe you need to be in the top one percent for intelligence and maybe the top five percent for industriousness. So that's one percent of five percent. So you're looking at it. I think that's one of that. What is that one percent? Five percent? Yeah. One in 100. One in 20. One in $2,000. I think that's right. Anyways, you're a rare bird if you're going to be in that position. And so, um, because because of the credo distribution and because of the concentration of productivity in a very small number of people, there's tremendous economic incentive to identify those people no matter where they're from. No matter who they are and employers who have any sense know that and they're hungry like these law firms, you know, you don't have no idea that knots, they tie themselves in trying to keep their qualified women because those women are worth a bloody fortune.

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       You know, they pay them a lot, but they bring in way more business than, than they bring in far more economic resources. Then they take the law. Firms want to keep them. Now that doesn't mean the man, all the men in the law firms don't have no problems with highly qualified women because they don't know what to do with them. You know, like if you're a guy and you're assertive and competitive, then you're going to be asserting yourself and competitive with other guys. But it's a lot harder to do that with a woman because you think, well, what am I? How am I going to be? Am I going to be like hyper aggressive around her because that just doesn't work out. And so the guys, we don't know what to do about that. And I would say there's some residual trouble in law firms and other high end industries because of that.

Speaker 3:          00:56:02       They just don't know how to sort it out. But mostly the employers are thinking, I don't care if you're green, if you're a smart and you can bring in business and you're reliable and you can solve problems like we don't have anybody like you, we need you, please stay. Doesn't happen. So yes, the market forces will. But the market forces I think are already going push things hard and then in the direction of maximizing the utility of television because you just have no idea how much more productive a productive person is. Then a nonproductive person. It's crazy. It's crazy. I just to that a publication which is to get your blood boiling. Yes. Somebody said to me, glaciers, gender and science, a feminist glaciology framework for global environmental change research. You want to talk about productivity. And then there's academia that degree all of academia.

Speaker 3:          00:56:55       But unfortunately, I mean this is a profession in which, uh, people have killed them truly in the trees for bullshit basically. So I just thought that would be ironic. Twist, yeah, well you know the postmodernists, they don't believe in. I don't know how much you know about postmodern philosophy. You're at Ryerson, so probably quite advanced, but not at the uft is any better because it's not, but the postmodern is don't believe it's science. There's lots of things they don't believe and they don't believe in logic and I'm not making this stuff up. Like you can go read it for yourself. In particular, they think that logic is part of the oppressive patriarchy and that there's no point in dialogue because all the reasons different power groups identified by their groups and they can't really talk. It's just a power struggle and that's why the radical leftist stop people from speaking on campus.

Speaker 3:          00:57:42       That's why I couldn't find anybody to debate me rough and speaking at the University of Toronto and I went to Queens University two weeks ago to the law school there because I was invited by a group called Runnymede Association and they asked six professors if they would debate me. It's like, no, why not? I'm not even a lawyer and lawyers can debate like they're. They're good at that. That's what they're trained to do. No, they wouldn't debate me, so they had to get somebody to play devil's advocate and he did a good job. You know, he did a very credible job, I thought, but you think, well, why would they come debate me? That's easy. They don't believe in dialogue, period. It's part of the philosophy because you have to believe in logic. First of all, to believe in dialogue. You have to believe that people can communicate as like as individuals fundamentally and not that you're just locked in your identity as a group member against all the other identity groups that are struggling for power in the Kinda hobsy and landscape that's all part of postmodernism. So and this, well, this is just an extension of that. It's like science is just a patriarchal, oppressive, patriarchal structure and so we need to reconstitute it from. It's from the bottom up. It's like they type on their computers while they say this. Not noticing that by the fact that they're using the damn computer, which wouldn't work. You know? People had to figure out quantum mechanics before they could make community computers. They use the computer science, doesn't. Science isn't real.

Speaker 3:          00:59:10       They do the same thing when they're in jet planes. Science isn't real 600 miles an hour typing on my computer so I could six. That's called a performative contradiction from a philosophical perspective and that's the same as a as a logical paradox. You don't get to say one thing and do another and say that you've got it while you do, if you're a postmodernist because you can do whatever you want if you're a postmodernist and the reason the damn postmodernists are Marxists as far as I can tell, because inevitably they are, is because the problem with postmodernism is it doesn't even leave postmodernists anything to do because postmodernists don't believe in overarching directional narratives. And the problem with that proposition is if you don't have an overarching directive narrative for your life, you don't know what to do and it's really important that you know what to do because you're alive, that you need to do things well. We'll just turn back to the original Marxism and we'll say, well, we'll just get. We'll just group ourselves up in oppressed groups and we'll have wars between the oppressed groups that'll give us a sufficient overarching narrative. Doesn't matter that it contradicts the postmodernist thesis because they don't care about contradictions so. Well. So hence this feminist glaciology. Okay. So I've got a few questions. Let me watch your hands pop up. So there's one back that first

Speaker 7:          01:00:30       you've been determined as women and gender choice or not choice?

Speaker 3:          01:01:05       It's a good. It's a good question. No, I don't think so. Even though I think your question is well formulated, that intelligent, I don't think it's that the economy is that straightforward because there's a tremendous amount of deterministic thinking on the social justice warrior in the distribution to because they regard you as the deterministic product of your environment. So it's more like the localization of determinism. So you might say that for the dialogue for the more biologically oriented people, there's more biological determinism but then so, so I think that the, the, the conflict between free will and determinism basically runs across the entire political spectrum. But then I would also say it's probably an ill formed argument because there isn't an absolute paradoxical contradiction between free will and determinism. Quite the contrary. You actually need elements of determinism, I think for a system to operate freely.

Speaker 3:          01:02:02       So for example, think about playing chess. You can do a lot of things when you're playing chess or think about composing music. You can do a lot of things when you're composing music, but there's an underlying rule structure that sets up the, the, uh, the environment within which all of those choices manifest themselves. The same with online video games, which, which, which are reading good example, I think because they are micro worlds and they're determined in some sense because they have an underlying rule structure that's the rules of the game, but they're free in many other ways. And so I don't think there's anybody pretty much on any side of the political spectrum who would regard people as entirely possessed a freewill. You know, we have constraints and limits and the, we're also pretty good at adjusting those on the fly. So for example, you'll be much less irritated if at three year old runs into you carelessly, well tryciclics than you will if a, you know, an adult man runs into with his scooter because you'll, you'll take, you'll take the constraints of the individual into account very, very rapidly. So I think so. Well, so that's, it's not as simple as free will versus determinism mount onto the political.

Speaker 7:          01:03:23       You mentioned that somebody thought that socialism was a, there's a, there's something wrong with that person and see what you're saying. I wonder. I asked her to say those are the video about compassion, about how people get their compassion, altruism and that you appeal to an individual. It seems that like attacking that, that's not your peer, but it seems that even get people on their heels sort of, you know, I see like some hatred for Americans or Muslims and, and I think that just makes people they naturally feel identified with like their land, their category. It'll just make them defend that stance even more reaching for the individual, like understanding compassionate.

Speaker 3:          01:04:21       Okay. So I take that apart a little bit because is a bunch of issues with the question,

Speaker 3:          01:04:28       how many people are in your psychology course or taking psychology or most of you taking psychology courses, how many people are taking psychology courses? Okay, so a goodly number. Well, one of the things you want to do with the conception, like compassionate as you actually want to start thinking about it like a psychologist or like a scientist, because compassion is actually definable and it. I think the easiest way to approach it is to think about it in big five terms because it. It maps onto agreeableness and especially you can break agreeableness down into compassion and politeness and the liberal types, especially the social justice types are way higher in compassion. It's actually their, their fundamental characteristic and you might think, well, compassion is, is a virtue. It's like, yes, it is average you, but any unit, dimensional virtue immediately becomes a vice because real is the intermingling of a number of virtues and their and their integration into a functional identity that can be expressed socially and compassion.

Speaker 3:          01:05:28       Passion is great if you happen to be the entity towards which it is directive, but compassion tends to divide the world into a crying children and predatory snakes. Right? And so if you're a crying child, hey, great man, but if you happen to be identified as one of the predatory snakes, you better look the hell out. And so, you know, compassionate is what the mother, grizzly bear feels for her cubs when she eats you because you got in the way, right? Exactly. So, nope, we don't want to be thinking for a second that compassion isn't a, uh, a virtue that could lead to violence because it certainly can. And the other problem with compassion, this is why we have conscientiousness, right? There's five canonical personality dimensions. Agreeableness is pretty good if you're dealing and getting akin system, you want to distribute resources equally, for example, among your children, because you want all of them to have not only the same chance you even walk them roughly to have the same outcome, a good one, but the problem is, is you can't extend that moral network to larger groups.

Speaker 3:          01:06:34       Not as far as I can tell you need conscientiousness, which is a much colder virtue and it's also a virtue that's much more concerned with larger structures over the longer period of time. So and you can take about conscientiousness is a form of compassion to. It's a strange form. It's like straighten the hell up and work hard and your life will go well. It's like I don't care how your feelings, how you feel about that right now. And and like someone who's cold low in agreeableness say and high in conscientiousness, that's what they'll tell you every time. Don't, don't come whining to me. I don't care about your feelings. Do Your Goddamn job. Are you going to be out on the street? Think, oh that person's being really hard on me. It's like not necessarily. They might have your long term best interest in mind and you're fortunate if you come across someone who's like not too radically disagreeable but moderately disagreeable and high in conscientiousness because the whip you into shape.

Speaker 3:          01:07:28       And that's really helpful. I mean you, you'll admire people like that. You won't be able to help it, you know? And you think, Oh wow, this person's actually giving me good information even though you know, you feel like a slug after you after they've taken you apart. So okay, so that's the compassion issue. It's like you can't just transform that into a political stance and I think part of what we're seeing is actually the rise of a form of female totalitarianism. So we have no idea what totalitarianism would be like if women read because that's never happened before in the history of the planet. And so we've introduced women into the political sphere radically over the last 50 years. We have no idea what the consequence of that is going to be, but we do know from our research, which is preliminary, that agreeableness really predicts political correctness, but female gender predicts over and above the personality trait.

Speaker 3:          01:08:22       And that's something we found very rarely in our research. Usually the sex differences are wiped out by the personality differences, but not in this particular case. And then, you know, women are getting married later and they're having children much later and they're having fewer of them. And so you also have to wonder what their feminine orientation is doing with itself in the interim, roughly speaking and lot of it's being expressed as political opinion, like in fair enough. You know, that's, that's fine, but it's not fine when it starts to shut down discussion. But also if you think about politics, politics from a temperamental perspective, if it gets to be extraordinarily useful. So if you have conservative, you're high in conscientiousness, particularly orderliness and you're low in openness. Okay, so what good are you? Well, you're not great. If you had to have a wonderful philosophical conversation about ideas and then go ahead and art movie.

Speaker 3:          01:09:17       It's like no conservatives, you're wrong. Wrong date for that particular bit of business. But if you want someone to run a company that's already been established or to make sure that algorithmize processes are being undertaken properly, you want conservatives, they're very good at managing and they're very good at administrative conscientiousness is the best predictor of those two domains part from Icu. Okay. So fine. What do you need the damn liberals for? Well, you don't want them running anything but you want them thinking up new things because the entrepreneurs and artists or are high in openness and low in conscientiousness, especially orderliness and they have to be because if you're starting something new, you don't want to have everything in the neat little boxes. You have to break rules, you have to take things apart and so that liberals need the conservatives to run enterprises and the conservatives need the liberals to start them and then you.

Speaker 3:          01:10:14       It makes sense from a temperamental perspective, if you think about it too, because there's five basic personality dimensions. They're all normally distributed and what that implies is that there's a niche for every personality type in proportion to the frequency of the of the occurrence within that normal distribution. There's some places for really extroverted people. There's more places for people who are moderately extroverted and moderately introvert, but there are places for everyone in that dimensional structure and there's utility for all of those people and so that's why you have to keep the dialogue going. It's like if you're hyper liberal, you have to talk to the damn conservatives because sometimes they're right, sometimes you're right, but sometimes they're right, and so if you don't talk then the system tilts off to the, to the, to the extreme that's represented by that temperament. And so what you'd have is a bunch of liberals talking about new things while the buildings were falling down around them.

Speaker 3:          01:11:12       So. So we need each other and that's part of what's happened in the West is we figured that out a long time ago. We figured out, oh well you haven't got to talk to those stupid people who don't think the way you do because sometimes despite the fact that they're annoying and nowhere near as smart as you, they're actually correct. And so here's another way of thinking about. Imagine the environment. Does this like a snake? It's always moving, right? You don't know where the damn thing's going and you want to be in the middle. It's like to cliffs that keeps shifting. You want to be in the middle of far from the cliffs. It keeps moving around and you're trying to walk forward. Well, sometimes it's over here, so the conservatives, they have to pull it back and sometimes it's over here, so the liberals, they have to pull it back and.

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       But because it keeps changing, you don't know who's right and so you have to keep talking and that's what a democratic society actually allows for exchange the opinions move the damn polity so that we can stay in the middle of the snake, roughly speaking. And so you got to have some respect for people who aren't like you. They're actually not like you. So I figured out recently I think that I couldn't figure out why openness and conscientiousness are the dimensions that are determining political belief because they're not even correlated. So why the hell do they clump for political belief? And I think I figured it out. I think it's because of a borders. I think the fundamental political issue is how open versus closed borders should be. And I don't just mean borders between states. I mean borders between states, I mean borders between the institutions, the borders between genders, borders between sexes, borders between ideas. The Conservatives say, keep everything where it belongs because it's working and the liberals say, yeah, it's working for now, but unless we make some adjustments, it's not going to keep working and they're both right, so we better have the dialogue because otherwise we wander off the cliff on the left or the right and we know where that goes. That goes. There's flames down at the bottom of those events and people die horribly down there and we've seen that on the right and the left with. We've had plenty of evidence for that. So

Speaker 7:          01:13:28       smart sort of friends and I have like. It feels like their compassion got twisted somehow and I have compassion for that. I don't like. I want to speak to to that. These are people that I love and stuff like this and I think that they are kind of ideologically twisted such

Speaker 3:          01:13:46       well. One of the things I've also spent a fair bit of time thinking about is the role of the resentment plays in political ideology and I have recommended in my lectures, but I'll recommend it here too. There's a great book by George Orwell called Road to Wigan pier, which I wouldn't Wyg in which I would highly recommend what orwell. He was a leftist. He went and fought with the on the communist side in the Spanish civil war against the fascists roughly. I mean, Orwell was a tough guy and very, very smart, super smart. And he went up to visit the coal miners in the 19 thirties and in, in, in northern, in northern Uk. I mean, those people bad. They had to crawl to work for two and a half miles in a tunnel. It was like three and a half feet high just to get to their shift.

Speaker 3:          01:14:31       And then, you know, that meant breaking rock for seven and a half hours. Then they had to crawl back and they didn't get paid for the commute, you know, so they had rough time and they have no teeth by the time they were 30 and you know, they were done in old by the time they were 40. It was rough. And so, you know, orwell went up there and said, Jesus, industrial nightmares, just killing these poor oppressed people. It's like, yeah, that's for sure, and he lays it out. You can read that without thinking a thank God I'm not a coal miner and be. Yeah, it's pretty rough at the bottom of the industrial revolution, like seriously rough, but in the second half of the book he did an analysis of socialist philosophy. One of the things he pointed out was that his observation was that the sort of middle class, ideologically bound socialists types didn't care for the poor at all.

Speaker 3:          01:15:19       They just hated the rich. It's like, yes, that's right. Not everyone. Not everyone. I worked for the MVP when I was young and I met a number of the leaders of the MDP, including grand oddly. I knew him quite well. He was Rachel Notley's father because we come from the same town and I had a lot of admiration for the leaders of the back then no, because they were really trying to give a voice to the working class. It's like, you better give a voice to the working class or you had never electing trump for example, but you know, the Socialists have abandoned the down working class. It's like, no, we'll go play identity politics and staff like that worked out really well for Hillary Clinton. I noticed so because it was identity politics. That's certainly shifted the election towards trump. She lost the working class people.

Speaker 3:          01:16:04       Well, someone has to give them a voice so there are genuine. Are People on the left were genuinely working to better. The lot of people who because of situation haven't had the opportunity. They might've, but so many people are resentful. It's like, no. If there's some people out there that have more than me, that's a terrible thing for North American to think. It's like we're so goddamn privileged that you know, we should spend at least one extra day in hell after we die for every time we complained about how poor we are. Right. Oh, there's some people who are richer than me. Yeah. That's pretty rough, man. That's, that's a rough break for you. You're still. It's the funny thing you hear about the one percent all the time in North America. It's like, oh, the one percent. First of all, that's a moving target. People in the one percent shift like crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:16:54       You have, I think about a 10 percent chance of being in the one percent at one point in your life and about a 40 percent chance of being in the top 10 percent for at least one year of your life. So there is a one percent, but it's moving, but you're the bloody one percent. Oh, you have to do is compare yourself with the rest of the world. So like what are you complaining about? These tiny proportion of people who have more than you, like what's up with you? How can you be so clueless that you would do that? How can you be so ungrateful and arrogant and blind? It's terrible. I mean, people have rough lives and the rest of the world, I mean, we're making people, Richard Very fast, you know, 300,000 people a day now get connected to the electrical grid and about 250,000 people lifted out of abject poverty.

Speaker 3:          01:17:42       We wiping out abject poverty faster than ever before in human history by a huge margin. So that's all for the good. It's really impressive. But, but a huge chunk of that twisted compassion is just resentment. So since there's a few people who are better off than me, maybe if I compare the two myself across one dimension, Jesus dismal. But that's what that was getting lost in the discussion today. It's all, it's so deflecting outward. It's all trying to, you know, it's say it's like, it's this resentment is this wanting and stuff like that. It's this lack of gratitude for just how lucky we really are. And it's just this complete lack of insight and reflection. I think that's a big problem. Well, it's partly lack of historical knowledge and it's like people, it's easy to take what we have for granted. Here we are, the lights are off.

Speaker 3:          01:18:29       It's like some stupid poor son of a bitches out there climbing some power line in the freezing rain, you know, with this damaged arm to make sure that we can all sit here and complain about how oppressed we are. You know, it's pretty pathetic, but it's no wonder we take it for granted. That's the funny thing because your minds are organized so that if something always works, you ignore it because well why would you pay attention to it? Right. It always works. You don't have to pay attention to it, so as soon as something is predictable, you zero it out and so then you think, well, in courses like this, this is just how it is. It's like, no, this is not how it is. It's a bloody miracle that this stuff works ever. It's crazily improbable and it always breaks, right? Everything is always breaking all the time and somebody out there dealing away trying to fix it. Yes, so we're ungrateful partly because we take things that work for granted. If our systems worked only 99 percent of the time, our society would probably be better because when the lights went off, everyone would go and the and the heat that, oh yeah, you can't see in the dark pool. Then there's no furnace and it comes back on and you think, Oh yes, that's much better, but it always works, so.

Speaker 7:          01:19:40       Okay. That's great. Yes. Speaking of envy and resentment, would you care to comment on the apparently well established numerous, this idea that men have a collective common collective interests and women have a separate common collective interests, class interest, and that these interests are becoming to conflict. There's a competition sometimes on a collective level. Well,

Speaker 3:          01:20:04       I think there is competition between men and women, but it's nested inside a broader arena of cooperation. You know, this is another thing that you learned from reading Psj if you're, if you're careful this, but because piaget was smart enough to understand that there is no dichotomous opposition between cooperation and competition. So you know, one of the sort of tenants of the kind of this Mumbo jumbo that I hate is that you should. Kids shouldn't play competitive games, right? It shouldn't be cooperative games. It's like, okay, let's take that apart. Let's take hockey. Is it competitive or cooperative or competitive? Well, wait a second. No one brings a basketball to the hockey game, right? No one brings a chessboard. Everyone that comes to the hockey game comes there to play hockey. That constitutes cooperation. We'll mutually define the aim or does piaget and cooperation. We'll mutually define the aim, will assign each other rules. We'll all agree to stick to the roles. Well, that's cooperation and if you break the rules, what happens? You get stuck in the penalty box. You're not playing hockey off you go. And people, people go off, they go sit in the penalty box, they don't go kill the referee with

Speaker 1:          01:21:18       go and sit in the penalty box, you know, six foot seven slash 300 pounds. So okay. And then you think, well what about within the team

Speaker 3:          01:21:27       that cooperation or competition? Well, each team member is trying to be the best player, but try not passing to your colleagues and see what happens. You know, even if you're a really good, they'll just, you're just a diva and no one's going to be happy with, you know, they'll put horrible things in your beer after the game. So it's cooperation there as well. And then there's a Meta level of cooperation which is that everybody's trying to improve their skills simultaneously and so that, that serves a higher order good. And everyone's trying to learn how to be a good player so that they can play many games. It's like, well, we shouldn't play competitive games. So like you must've been educated at noisey.

Speaker 3:          01:22:12       Sad. It's very sad and it's so, so ignorant for people who know something about child development to say something like that. It's just what is with you, where were you educated or where were you educated is the right response. So. And then so with men and women, well there is group competition for example, you're competing roughly speaking with all your classmates, right? And some of the women are going to outshine you. And so that's, that's tough for men. It's particularly tough for men because it isn't obvious how you compete full bore with women. It's not obvious and we don't know how to solve that problem. And then of course status in relationship to the male hierarchy is more important for men than it is for women because women pick their mates based on their position in the social hierarchy. And so that puts me in also in an awkward way.

Speaker 3:          01:23:05       It puts women in an awkward position too, like a lot of your women, let's say there's a fair number of you here who have an Iq of more than 130 puts you in like maybe the talk. You're one in 20, 95th percentile and then you know you've got pretty good career proposition, so like your pool of eligible mates is minuscule that the data shows that clearly $50, if I remember correctly, 50 point increase in icu for a woman decreases your probability of finding a partner by 40 percent. It's something like that. It has zero effect for men by the way, because men made across and down dominance hierarchies, one across the top. So if you're a smart woman and you're and you're attractive and you're young and you're hardworking and you have a good career, it's like you need a man who's smart, hardworking, young who has a good career, but he has to be a little better at those things than you.

Speaker 3:          01:23:54       It's like, good luck, good luck. It's going to be rough because there just aren't that many people like that. And so there's another problem that faces women too, which is you're not going to be smart card working with a good career till you're 30, then you have to compete with 25 year old women. And so that's also an insoluble problem because the thing about 25 year old women is they put less stress on men. Why? Why? Because they can have babies for an extra five years. So every guy pittance. Yeah. Y'All have kids sometime because he can think that he can have kids. He's 80. What the hell does he care women? No, no. Thirty 5:40. You better get it together by there. And so when you're 30 and you've got your act together, you've got those 25 year old women to compete with very.

Speaker 3:          01:24:39       And men don't care about your damn stamps. So it's rough. It's rough. So there is lots of competition between men and women, but it's nested inside a much broader domain of cooperation marriages. This fundamental solution to that. And I think the evidence for that is also clear. It's like it's better for women. It's you have a better sex life, you're healthier, your kids are better off, you're not nearly as likely to plummet into a lower socioeconomic category, which almost always happens to women who get divorced because it's, it's hard to one income, you got kids, good luck, like you're poor and if you're not, it's because you're working so often. The only time you have to have a date is with some psychopathic man. His schedule around yours. Yeah. Well, I've seen plenty of this man. I'm not talking through my hat. I know exactly what the hell happens when you, when you were a little older and a little poor and a little more desperate. It's not exactly fun, so I wouldn't, I wouldn't recommend that you end up there. So. Okay. On that. Happy Valentine's Day.

Speaker 5:          01:25:46       Um, it's two part question. You mentioned you were talking earlier about English common law. About 20 years ago, I read an article from a constitutional expert who, Lauren against he the negative repercussions can come from

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       the way we wrote the charter, really codifying, um, select the victim groups, um, and um, and, and, and, and, and that we turned our back on 800 years of English common law and, um, uh, and effectively stepped away from the rule of law. And the second, the second part to that question, the great granddaughter of a lack of stories which your, that was your question and how those two relate in my mind is my escape from a communist country. And, um, and I've had, you know, dinner time conversations for decades now with Michael other brother though about what that looked like and what that felt like. And, and I think we're, um, uh, well the Baldwin's great granddaughter's question was important, which we don't have the stories that would inform us. And you touched on that because some of the stories from your experience, horrible, horrible. And I know there's all kinds of Canadians, um, and they actually are fearful for where we are in society right now, but they're frightened to speak out. Um, and I think bringing that back around to the charter of rights and freedoms we've codified, um, preferred, but we've overlooked in that most, most, um, trauma and abuse happens within groups and also the case earlier we started overlooked and it someone because just because someone said it doesn't mean that they're also not a perpetrator. Um, and that doesn't get, um, a lot of press. So

Speaker 3:          01:27:55       yeah, whenever anyone claims victim status without simultaneously claiming perpetrator status, you should run away from that person. It's like I'm a saint and everyone's been hurting me. It's not. No, probably not. Sorry, you're a saint. Really? I don't think so. I doubt it. I've imagined you have your fair share of, of abstract blonde to one of your hands, just like everybody else. And so people need to take responsibility for that mean speed. Okay. So just one more

Speaker 6:          01:28:24       and I'm wondering if what you're talking just reading now is basically what I didn't know. She didn't you decades ago. Morning,

Speaker 3:          01:28:32       Oh yeah, that was a catastrophe to lay that bit of logical rationality on top of the English law. Common law system was a catastrophe. It was unnecessary and it is resulting in much of what we're seeing today. The problem with the codify bill of rights, the rights conflict right now, English common law dealt with it by just saying, forget we're not a new marine and you're damn right. So you have all of them. Okay, what problems are, is that going to solve it? We don't care. We'll solve them one by one as they emerge. Brilliant. It's an evolutionary approach to law. Essentially. English common law is phenomenal and we made a huge mistake codifying our rights I think, and that that is part of what's put us here and then building in the victim hood of, of groups, that's a hell of a thing to tell someone to your part of the victim group.

Speaker 3:          01:29:21       It's like, it's so clueless historically too, you know, um, that surfs in the Ussr who are pretty much all Caucasian. They weren't emancipated until the late 18 hundreds. Like you don't have to go very far back in anybody's racial history to find the equivalent of slavery. I mean, okay, surfs weren't slaves. It's. Yeah, yeah, they were. They were. They were sold with the property, you know, and so that's 150 years ago. Slavery was. Slavery was not some exception perpetrated on the world by the United States. Every damn society, virtually that ever existed up until we invented machines, ran on slave labor. So saying, well, you know, some groups have been affected more by slavery in the recent past than others. I think that's fair to say it, but the problem is as well, what exactly do you do about that, Dan? And who defines it to? It's a big mess and besides none of it is to be trusted anyways because all it is is postmodern deal marks sleight of hand. You know, Marxism got demolished in the seventies. Demolished, ruined was never to rise again. The postmodernists sneaky friendships and French intellectuals played a little slight of hand. Okay. It's not the working class against the wealthy. It's the victims against the oppressors. Great. All we did was move the goalposts slightly. Now we get to play the same game. Yeah. Well, it's a lot easier than thinking. So yeah, competence. That's what they thought.

Speaker 3:          01:31:02       Oh, that's a good question. I teach about the gulag. Archipelago is my personality class of hold the dopey places to teach it. It's like I, at the beginning of the class, I say, well, how many of you know that 30 million, uh, uh, Soviet citizens were destroyed through internal repression between 19, 19 in 1959. It's like four people put up their hands and they say, well, how do you know I watched your lectures on youtube? You know, that's not taught in school. Why? I know why. It's because the bloody intellectual leftists have never apologized for their complicity in the catastrophes of the 20th century for Germans, apologized. Sorry about the Nazis with the left wing intellectuals. They say, oh, well that was real. That wasn't real Marxism. So like, oh, okay. How many carbs is have to pile up around you before you're willing to question your beloved it?

Speaker 3:          01:31:53       Theological presuppositions and face your resentment and your narcissism and your desire for destruction. You don't like people anyways. The planet has too many of them, so like a nice warm. I cleared that up. Well then all the plants can grow again. You know the club of Rome and they talked about the population explosion that was going to wipe out the planet by the year 2000. They say outright that human beings were a cancer on the planet. Lots of people think that. It's like, oh boy, next put the atom bomb a phone in your hands. Human beings are a cancer on the planet. What a hell of a thing to say? You're saying that to a four year old, I saw bloody professor at Queen's University tell a whole room full of 18 year olds that if they had an ethical fiber in their body, they wouldn't have any kids or they'd only have one because all they're doing is going out there raping the planet.

Speaker 3:          01:32:46       It's like, what? You know? What the hell? What? I don't understand that. It's like human beings are hard on the planet, but it's pretty damn hard on us in return, you know? It's like we're just sort of trying not to die to miserably and we make a bit of a mess. Well, doing it. It's like, yeah, Chris, we've only known for 50 years that we were disrupting the oceans. How fast do you think we can learn? You know, 100 years ago, Thomas Huxley, who was a great biologist, said, the oceans are so plentiful. It was not a chance we could ever put a dam in them. So I was only 100 years ago. Fifty years ago we thought, Oh man, there's more of us and we're better at this than we thought. It's like, okay, how fast do you expect people to learn? You know, one generation, one year, we're trying to do our best.

Speaker 3:          01:33:32       Most. Most people are trying to do their best and some people are trying to do their worst, but most people are trying to do their best and so we should have a little compassion, little sympathy for human beings instead of considering ourselves like raping patriarchal, oppressive destroyers. Of the world, Jesus, you don't like that label. So cruel. It's so mean. It's, it's. It has no sympathy there. It's like most of the people I know are struggling hard to get fine. Usually. The other thing about people that's so interesting and you really learn this if you're a clinical psychologist, is that every single one of you in this room has at least one serious problem that you're laboring under, and that's why the whole handicap thing is a big problem as well. It's like, okay, you're not mentally ill this moment, but you will be. You'll be depressed or anxious or you'll hit some trauma in your life that'll take you out, and even if you happen to be in the small minority of people who are physically healthy their whole life and emotionally healthy, you're going to have a family member, a child, a parent, a parent with Alzheimer's, a child who's got some illness.

Speaker 3:          01:34:37       You know you're going to be carrying some vicious burden for most of your life and most of the time you're going to stumble off the work anyhow and do your damn job and contribute to society. It's like I can never, I can't even believe that our system works because you just have to talk to someone for five minutes and they tell you, well, here's the three horrible things that happened to me in the last year, and they're horrible things. Their mother died of like, you know, some degenerative neurological disease. Those are particularly entertaining. And their father was alcoholic and he used to beat them up and their sisters, schizophrenia can, it's like right away they go and do their minor hero wisdom for the day and the light stay on. It's like, you know, human beings were admirable creatures despite the fact that we're, you know, finite and useless and vicious and all of those things. So

Speaker 5:          01:35:29       it did incorporate physician suicide. Should I tell him what to do?

Speaker 3:          01:35:45       Well, you should pay very careful attention to their definitions of diversity. And then you have to pay careful attention to the criteria by which you choose people. You know, it's very, that's an extraordinarily difficult question because it's a personnel selection,

Speaker 5:          01:36:01       uh,

Speaker 3:          01:36:02       decision. But one of the things I would say is, well, if you're looking for managers and administrators, screenings for conscientiousness, you get about a point two, five point three correlation. You think, well that's nothing that's wrong. It switches your probability of hiring a, an above average employee from 50 slash 50 to 67 point five slash 32 point five. If it's a point three, three zero, let's see, sorry, 60 5:35 point three zero correlation. And because there's massive variability in the productivity of individuals tilting, your selection up to that degree will have massive, massive economic payoffs. I've done the calculation. There are crazy and there's no. There's no bias in a conscientiousness. Tests

Speaker 5:          01:36:48       test for hiring for that.

Speaker 3:          01:36:57       When the court says the board, the board during the diversity officer, one of the things you might do is track the shifting ratio of men versus women in the corporation. But that's the sort of thing that requires a micro analysis. Know like there's going to be an increasingly. There are many disciplines where women are overrepresented at every single level that's happening in university so fast. Don't be a damn man left in the Faculty of Arts and science at 10 years. It's like, so for all you women who are looking for mates, you better be thinking about that because when men of bailing out of university so fast, you cannot believe it. I'm like, I've watched the curves for 15 years, so linear up for women linear down for me, and so you can think, well that's really good for women. It's like that's so clueless is there can't be anything that's bad for men.

Speaker 3:          01:37:48       That's good for women and vice versa. I know another thing too. That's okay. So back to the board, you have to say, well, the what's the industry? How does that map onto the valid natural interests of men and women? Is there any evidence that we're hiring stupidly and the mere fact that you don't have as many women or as many men in one place versus another doesn't indicate therefore that your prejudice, you have to buy the equity argument to buy that. And if you buy the equity argument while you're done with anyway, so, so because you're going to fall down that spiral move, never get out of it, you'll never hit equity. Not a chance. Now a lot of these corporations are doing it out of guilt and fear. You don't. You said that people are afraid to speak up for Jesus. You just have no idea how afraid people are to speak up.

Speaker 3:          01:38:35       And it's actually no wonder. I mean, I've made those videos. It was like I got hit by a tidal wave. No, it freaked me right out and still does. I can't believe what happened. Like it's been. I would say overall it's been good, but it's not necessarily the kind of good you would wish on someone. I kind of would like to have my old life back, but whatever, you know, I knew what was coming. So it was only a matter of time. But people are so afraid to speak up. You just cannot believe it. Tenured professors, those are the most protected people in the universe and they're afraid to speak up. And that tells you a lot about what people are like, but I should tell you, you shouldn't be afraid to speak up, but I'll tell you something else. You should be more afraid not to speak up.

Speaker 3:          01:39:18       That's the thing. It's like you're screwed both ways. Pick your poison. You can either suffer the consequences of having a voice or you can suffer the consequences of not having a voice. And I would highly recommend that you don't pick the suffering that goes along with not having a voice that's dreadful. And so you might say, well, if I don't speak up, I'm safe. It's like, yeah, you are for for the next 15 minutes, but you sacrificed a bit of your soul. You might need that thing to get through life without getting all bitter and twisted and resentful. So if you've got something to say, maybe even to your board, you say it and you don't know what's going to happen, it might be bad. It might be good. Like silence has exactly the same consequences. So and Dr Peterson's hiring. So when they get rid of it or they're hiring to replace me there, not by the way the university is backed off completely and I'm sure that was a big part of because of the older public support, you know, not that I mean I'm not trying to paint them as evil villains because they're not.

Speaker 3:          01:40:25       But also the students were very welcoming to me when I came back to class, which was a big deal because I was very nervous when I came back to class, like very nervous. I didn't know what the hell was going to happen or even if I was going to come back. So. But there's one more question or two questions. And then Colorado. Okay. Difficult for you to say

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       you would not recommend that today's you attended university in the traditional sense. Um, so I to know what advice you would have for people as far into the clinical psychologist or want to pursue any further education.

Speaker 3:          01:41:15       Don't take any nonsense.

Speaker 3:          01:41:18       Read the damn classics. You don't know in clinical psychology programs here, you're reading that bloody waiting, derald sue or whatever his name. Is it a microaggression guy. You know, it's like, here's how you do cross cultural counseling, so I know that that's a bunch of things you don't do. Like, I mean, that's what the books are. Here's things that you shouldn't do if you're doing cross cultural constantly and that's helpful, but what are you going to do? Reading Freud, read young, read Adler, greed, Rogers, read mass up. These people knew what the hell they were talking about. The behaviors get, get yourself educated with regards to neuroscience. There's lots of great things out there to read and if your professors are too stupid to teach you what they should teach you with you, you got to educate yourself and university anyways, you know, so, so that's what I would recommend.

Speaker 3:          01:42:06       The institution is corrupt always. And so you know, you're lucky you're lucky if you're in graduate, graduate school, like one in five classes is really worth taking. You know, you can't get too cynical about that. Things don't necessarily work all that well, but there are great things to read. I mean, radio don't turn you inside out, you know, read nature. There's lots of great thinkers there and you know, you have to read them intelligently. People squawk about nature because he was slightly misogynistic, but I mean, God, he was sick. He could hardly even see. You can only write like one sentence at a time. He lived alone. He didn't get along with women. They were always rejecting them, you know, not the same thing to do with the women. And he didn't know if anyone ever was ever going to read what he wrote. He sold like 500 copies of beyond good and evil.

Speaker 3:          01:42:55       It's like, so now when they did go to Noida, didn't wrote something snippy. It's like Jesus gave the guy a break, you know? And so when you read Freud as well, you know, this stuff's dated so you have to adjust your reading for the context. But when someone comes across a slate of mysogeny mystic statement and says, Oh, well I'm not reading this person, all they're saying is they're too stupid to separate the wheat from the chaff or too lazy. It's like, well, I don't have to read nature. Well that's a relief, that's for sure. Really. So I was thinking more about parents who are trying to make a decision to send their kids to university. It's like

Speaker 3:          01:43:34       so much of it is corrupt social work and anthropology, social psychology, education, English literature. A huge chunk of the humanities, which is absolute catastrophe. The humanities school universities are done because they're the sole of the universities technical training. There's. You can be trained technically in all sorts of other ways. Incorporations are starting to figure this out fast. So we lose the humanities. The universities are gone and we're losing them fast because all they do is teach you identity politics. Jesus, you can learn the rules that came in one day, right? Divide the world into oppressed and oppressor. That's easy, man. That's a snap. Assume the old presses are the bad people in the oppressed or the good people that's easy.

Speaker 3:          01:44:26       Make noise about it and feel good. That's basically that. And you know, don't pay any attention to your role. So $2,000 while in the university is a for a big shakeup because they don't know what's going to hit them with, with youtube and online lectures. They've got no idea what's coming down the pipes, so because it, because online lectures are powerful beyond belief and someone who's going to sort out the accreditation for all in the next four or five years, a couple universities off at their knees, so certainly going to come within the next 10 years. My question

Speaker 6:          01:45:04       for is as a training therapist for her, how do you think that that might bags? That's the process of therapy.

Speaker 3:          01:45:15       Well, it puts you in there with all sorts of a priori axioms. Know one of the things I really liked Carl Rogers and one of the things Rogers does is listen to what you do as a therapist. The better you aren't listening to pastor, your clients will get better and you have to listen without prejudice and I don't mean that in the technical sense. It's like, okay, so I'm listening to you. It's like I don't know what you're going to say and I don't know if you're right and I'm not going to tell you what to do because I don't know what you should do. And that's something about being a therapist is like you do not want to tell people what to do because that's their life that you might screw it up. So what do you want to do is listen to them very, very carefully and let them unwind their story.

Speaker 3:          01:45:59       And most of them they'll take care of themselves, you know, because no one's listened to them so they don't even know what they think their head is full of jumbled mess of thoughts and experiences. It's like it's like a tangling of knots and maybe the person needs to talk for like three years to sort it all out. And what you should do is listen to them from a different culture, whatever, like there's going to be friction because of that, because you'll come out at least to some degree with different assumptions. But read the damn therapists. Those people were smart. They tell you things about. Each of them gives you a different toolbox. They're not scientific theories. Exactly, but as a clinician, you're not a scientist. You're a. you're an engineer of the soul. That's a better way of thinking about it because it's an applied.

Speaker 3:          01:46:45       It's like engineering, it's an applied science, so makes it not a science. Exactly. You can use scientific knowledge, but you're still aiming at the good, right? That's what you're doing as a therapist with the other person. You say, look, you already know that things aren't as good for you as they need to be. We're going to work on that and you're here to make things better and I'm here to help you figure out how to make things better. Then I'll listen to you and we'll move toward some place that's lighter and better and and then you have tools that you can use in that kind of analytical listening process and the great psychotherapists math. Most people have their 10,000 hours, you know, they all come at it from slightly different. Temperamental perspectives like young's work is really useful for dealing with people who are high in openness. So his whole philosophy is you have an open client, you'll works if you have a conservative clients, forget it. It's, it's a whole different thing.

Speaker 6:          01:47:43       What I'm hearing from you is that that postmodern stance is helpful for the therapy from off, from what you're saying is that listen and that you're, that you're not giving an absolute truth to these, to these clients.

Speaker 3:          01:47:55       Yeah, but the problem is the postmodern thing works out pretty well, but they keep asking it in Marxism. It's like, oh yeah, but their primary identity is, is is like sex or gender or ethnicity or race. It's like, no, sorry, we're not going there, so it's not exactly postmodernism because the postmodernists are misinformed about the nature of scientific theories. I think they don't really see them as tools, but I see the best tools and so you can have a diverse range of tools and they don't eat. Each one doesn't have to claim a pistol biological or ontological priority, but that means that you have to view those sorts of theories as tools that makes you a pragmatist post modernists. All right, and speaking of patients. Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:48:43       in an hour or so, a few things I want to wrap up now just to that point. I said this earlier today and first of all, one of the reasons I really wanted to have Dr Peterson comment, and first of all, Cirina, thank you very much for arranging that. Uh, she did. She said that she wants to go to have you come in and say, yeah, sure. And she did it until he really appreciate a serene. It'd be, especially Dr Peterson,

Speaker 2:          01:49:08       you know, I would have preferred to have broadcast as widely known what I want all the Peterson haters to come in. I want you to have a chance to be able to actually face to face, confront what you're afraid of. Don't be ignorant, don't just impose your own beliefs and your biases and everything onto what you were saying, but actually hear process and come to a reality and fact based conclusion about the things that you're trying to promote because in today's society, truly everything you've been talking about, I don't think it's like verbally. I think that we are going down a dangerous path. We're seeing the consequences of it. And I've been in all my students know this. I have been promoting this in therapy. Uh, anything like glasses and my family, this idea that you need to be able to expose yourself to things that make you uncomfortable, that you're not aware of.

Speaker 2:          01:49:52       And that's, yeah, that's kind of a ground rule of good. It might be psychotherapy speaking, I'm being honest, honest about yourself, honestly. What your biases, your, your ignorance and your fears, your, your flaws. You can't grow without that. So this to me was a metaphorical, a metaphoric of the, I guess, manifestation of that desire. I wanted to bring you here and I really do appreciate you taking the time. I know you've got many speaking engagements. I do appreciate that and I'm glad that some people have very pointed questions that you're able to address. What are they going to do with a video? What's the for that? Um, uh, being very low in conscientiousness. I haven't thought that far ahead. Going dropbox and you look. Well, I'll definitely give you the uh, lots of people will watch it. So great. It doesn't matter that that's the thing that's cool about youtube. We will have you have a stadium stadium now. Every time I talk, which is weird, man, it's going to be uploading it and send it to you and we'll make the arrangements. So thank you very much again for coming and thank you everybody for [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:51:00       Thank you.
