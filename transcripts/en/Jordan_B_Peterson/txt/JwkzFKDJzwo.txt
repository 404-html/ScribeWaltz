Speaker 1:          00:00:43       Hi there, I guess I'm on. My son isn't here tonight, so I'm doing this in my relatively technologically clueless manner.

Speaker 2:          00:00:57       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       here's one thing I've noticed about getting older. I have kept up with computer technology pretty well I would say, but I do find maybe because of the demands on me in the last year, maybe I'm not stupid or it's possible. So anyways. Hi everyone. Nice to see you here. It looks like I've got the chat working. Is Everything working?

Speaker 2:          00:01:23       Looks like it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       All right, so I'm going to start with some questions that people sent me. Anyways. Thank you for all beat, all of you for being here. By the way. It's very much appreciated.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       It's quite remarkable as far as I'm concerned that you tune in to listen to me talk with you. I definitely do appreciate it. So I'm going to start with some of the questions that people sent me earlier and I'll keep an eye on the chat youtube chat as well. So, um, hopefully the audio is good. What about that? How's the audio guys? So now Adam, w dot Patterson asked me a question that got 410 volts. He said, um, I am a web software developer. Are you hiring or can I volunteer for anything? I can build anything. I can automate things. I could simply be an assistant of sorts. Thank you for your time. Well, what I would like to say about that is first thank you out. It's much appreciated on a lot of people have volunteered their time to me and their and their technological expertise and as much as I'd like to make use of it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       That simple truth of the matter is that I'm sufficiently overwhelmed by the complexity of my life at the moment, that it's very difficult to undertake a new collaborative project with anyone mean generally speaking, before all this political, um, what would you call it before all these political events overtook my life. I was already scheduled probably about six months to a year out. You know, all my was already eaten up. And of course, the addition of everything that's happened in the last year or two that has occupied my time to a degree that is, was, is really somewhat unimaginable. And so I just can't take on additional help, which is so strange because you think that help is help and that it would save time, but, you know, it's very difficult to enter into a collaborative relationship with someone and especially if you want to give them credit and do things properly.

Speaker 1:          00:03:28       So, um, at the moment I'm afraid that I can't entertain any such offers even though I'd like to. And there may come a time in the future, especially when I'm hopefully starting to work more on this online university project. Um, I've got a few projects to finish up before that to the new personality tasks, which we've just about got all the bugs worked out of. And also the high school version of the future authoring program are all. We're all set up long before any of this happened. So I have to clear them out before I can concentrate on a new project that I finished a book over the last couple of years to called a 12 rules for life and antidote to chaos, which is now available by the way, if you're interested on Amazon for preorder. Um, and so anyways, this is my roundabout way of saying thank you very much, but I can't accept more help at the moment because my time is too restricted to make proper use of it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       So I'm clay's nor, and how to use the results in the new personality tests for progress in life. Try to compensate some sites that that received fewer points. Well, at the risk of sounding self serving. That's actually why we developed the self authoring suite was to help people improve their, let's say performance and mental health. Now we don't have direct evidence that will, that will improve personality, but I suspect that that evidence would take a very long time to accumulate. What we do know is that the self authoring suite, especially the future authoring suite, helps people, helps university students, for example, stay enrolled in university. It increases the probability of that by about 25 percent and increased his grade point average by about the same. And there's good theoretical reasons for assuming that writing is a good way of, of um, as writing about yourself and about your past and about your future is a good way of catalyzing personality transformation because it appears that personality, the human psyche is organized at the highest level of abstraction.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       Using something like self narrative and a well developed narrative makes a frame for your life and helps you stabilize your negative emotions and also experienced more positive emotion because you only experienced positive emotion in relationship to a goal. And that can make goal directed activity a lot more rewarding. So you know, it's a lot easier to engage in activities that aren't intrinsically rewarding if they're linked to something that you really find important. And so I would say if you want to work on your personality, well, the first thing you have to do is figure out who it is that you want to be. And then you have to make a plan and maybe you have to clean up your past as well. And the self authoring suite was designed quite carefully in order to help people do that with a relative minimum of effort. Not that it's easy because it's not, but a relative minimum minimum of effort compared to other technologies, let's say, and like, like longterm psychotherapy and to make it cost effective as well. So. Okay. So another question voted up 77 votes. Australia is holding a plebiscite on whether to legalize gay marriage. I'm against the yes campaign, but only because it's backed by Cultural Marxists. I'm curious to hear your views on gay marriage.

Speaker 1:          00:06:58       Well, I would be against, it was backed by Cultural Marxists because it isn't clear to me that, um, it will satisfy the ever increasing. What would you call a demand for an assault on traditional modes of being. Now with regards to gay marriage specifically, that's a really tough one for me because, you know, I can imagine I can't do anything really other than spout platitudes about it. I suppose unfortunately, you know, is if the marital vows are taken seriously, then it seems to me that it's a means whereby gay people can be integrated more thoroughly and to standard society and that's probably a good thing and maybe that would decrease promiscuity, which is a public health problem. Um, although obviously that's not limited to gay people. Um, although gay men tend to be more promiscuous than average, probably because there's no women to bind them with regards to their sexual activity. The problem is, is that it does seem to me to be part of a wedge and it isn't obvious to me that, that legalizing gay marriage has done anything to decrease the demands that the radical left neo marxists types are placing on traditional society. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       those are my views. I know they're confused, you know, because I'm in favor of extending the bounds of traditional relationships to people who wouldn't be involved in a traditional longterm relationship. But I'm concerned about the undermining of, of traditional modes of being, including marriage, which is technically and historically been a union between a man and a woman. Fundamentally, the purpose of raising children in a, in a stable and, and, uh, um, an optimal and stable environment. So, and marriage has already taken a fair bit of damage over the last few decades. You know, poor people are increasingly less likely to be married and that's really not good for them as far as I'm concerned. Hi, I'm currently going through a hard time as a first time mum with a nine month old. I feel depressed and anxious and I'm highly neurotic and volatile. Can you suggest anything to help me be a better mom?

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       Well, you know, lots of people have a hard time with. They're nine months old. I guess the first question would be, are you getting enough sleep? Do you have enough help? Are you eating enough? Especially in the morning, you know, and you're gonna feel highly neurotic and volatile to some degree because while you've been through quite a physiological trauma and it's very demanding to have a newborn baby. So the best thing I could say, not knowing you, is to make sure that you have people around that you can talk to about your baby and that you can and, and that you can take a break when you need to and have someone spell you. I mean that's often the role that a husband plays in the first year of, of a baby's life, is that he can, he's supposed to watch the mother to make sure that she doesn't get overwhelmed by the demands of the baby. And so I would hope that you're able to ask for support when you need it and not to be afraid of asking for support, especially to get a rest and to get something to eat because that's really important, especially in the morning.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       Other than that, I can't tell you anything really specific unfortunately, given that I don't know anything about the specifics of your situation. Um, if it gets out of hand, you know, you should go. The other thing I should say as if it gets out of hand, you should go speak with your, with your doctor, with a professional, because you might have postpartum depression. There's some dispute about whether that exists and as an independent diagnostic entity, but you can certainly be physiologically stressed and if you have a predisposition to depression then that kind of physiological stress and sleep disruption can bring it on. So I would say if it really gets out of hand, don't hesitate to go talk to someone professional. You know, it, it, it's, it may be necessary to do that because you don't want to fall too far down a whole, that's for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       So Emma Joe Lovano, vic says, Dr Peterson, I want to thank you. I guess this isn't a question for what you do. I'm a 22 year old girl and your videos are helping me so much with figuring my life out. You are alone are helping me be braver everyday. Well, I'm really happy about that. You know, and I like your emphasis on bravery, you know, because one of the things that we've learned as clinicians say is that when you help people overcome anxiety, it isn't that you make them less anxious necessarily. Although I think you could do that to some degree by having people confront some of the demons in their past, but instead of making them less anxious, you make them braver and that's not the same thing. Right? Because there's lots of reason to be anxious. The world's full of uncertainty and fear and reasons for fear and reasons for pain, but to be braver means to confront those voluntarily and that's really a good thing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       When will the next Bible lecture occurred? October 24th. They'll be three of them before the end of December and I want to keep them going into the future. They, they've been quite successful I would say, and I would like to go through the whole book, although that would probably take me the rest of my life, but I do really think it's necessary because it is the case that the. The specific narratives and the metanarrative that are, that are embedded in the biblical stories and its surrounding literature are at the fundament of Western culture and we need to reconnect with that in order to make sure that our, that our culture stays strong and I don't think it's particularly strong right now and that's a very bad. That's a very bad thing for everyone. It leads to nihilism and despair and and in an ability to plan for a meaningful future and cynicism and all of those things, and that's especially bad for young people because when you're young and your life is ahead of you, it's the last. It's the last time that you need to be nihilistic and cynical. It's definitely not good. So

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       Shark Pyre to says, how can you dispute the theory that Jesus is just a rewrite of the Sun God myth? Well, I wouldn't necessarily dispute that theory, although I would dispute the just. I mean the strange things about the biblical stories and let's say about the new testament stories, is that they echo across multiple levels of analysis and so there is an astrological element to the Christ. A story, um, that you wrote about a fair bit in a book called Ion, which is a very terrifying book and there are echoes of the myths of the sudden God. And, but the funny thing is, and this is one of the things I can't really understand about the biblical stories, is that they manifest themselves at multiple levels of interpretation simultaneously. And you could say that that's merely a consequence of continual historical reworking. And I suppose that could be the case, but the fact that they manifest themselves as a personal story and as a cosmic story and as a historical story and as a mythological story and that it all works at the same time strikes me as, as pointing to something that's really somewhat beyond our current level of understanding.

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       I can't elaborate on that a lot because it would take us into places that I really would rather not go. But I do believe that there's something synchronous using young's terminology about, uh, about a death and resurrection story. And the synchronous element is, is associated with the fact that the story echoes across so many levels of analysis. And my sense is that when something echoes across many levels of analysis, that means that it's approaching something like a very deep truth. So I know that isn't normally how we go about determining what constitutes truth, but we don't know everything about how to determine what constitutes truth yet. And there are many things that we have yet to figure out and that's certainly one of them as far as I'm concerned. So there is a Sungard myth element, certainly parallels between Christ and horace, for example. But that doesn't mean you can just say it's just a rewrite. I don't think that the, I don't think that that's historically or a psychologically accurate.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       Have you watched rick and morty? No, I haven't. Many people have told me to watch rick and Morty, although they said it's very dark and. Well that doesn't bother me so much I suppose, although I'm plenty dark perhaps without adding to it. So. But um, I would like to watch it and I probably will. So I would love for you to do come and do a talk in Montreal. Well, you never know that might happen. I've been talking to Gad Saad about that a fair bit, you know, he's coming to Toronto November 11th so we can do the talk. That was shut down by Ryerson back in August, so I'm looking forward to that. So what's the best way to stop drinking alcohol and start doing my best? In my psychology degree, it's affecting my study, but I can do very well if I stop. I'm 26.

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       Well, Paul, what I would say is I think you should do the future authoring program and you should really concentrate. There's a section in it that helps you determine what your positive view of your future would be, but another section that helps you determine what would happen in your life if you're negative habits got out of control and one of the things that can really help you control your alcohol intake is to really, really think through what you're giving up and where you could be in five years if you don't get it under control and proclivity to alcoholism can be a really vicious thing. You know, lots of people get dragged down into the mud by alcohol, excessive alcohol intake, especially if they're sensitive to the opiate response that alcohol can produce. And you can tell that if you, when you drink, you know, you get alert and, and, and, uh, let's say more enthusiastic and energetic and then you don't want to stop drinking.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       That's uh, that's definitely a bad sign with regards to developing alcoholism. So I would say you need to figure out something that's, that's more important to you that drinking and also think through very hard. The negative consequences of continuing your. You're at about the age 26 where you should stop. I mean guys who are going to stop generally start slow down pretty, pretty intensely around that age. Um, you know, get also treating your psychology, studying as a fulltime job can also be helpful. So, you know, get up at eight morning or 7:30 in the morning and start hitting the books by nine and put in a 68 hour day. And then even if you do keep drinking, at least you're moving forward. So that's what I say about that.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       Are you a science fiction fan? You referenced timelines, starship troopers in lecture, and your ideas often remind me of Harry Selden's plan from Asia mobs foundation series. Hey, well, when I was a kid, which is quite a long time ago now, um, I lived in this town called Fairview Alberta, which was a town of about 3000 people a way the hell north 350 miles northwest of Edmonton. And I have this neighbor across the street across the La actually. And he had a huge science fiction library. It must've been, I don't know, 5,000 books there, 19 seventies, 1960, 19 seventies classics like Heinlein then. And how's it Marvin? He would let me go over there and take like 20 books at a time and I was reading about a book a day at that point and I read science fiction like mad probably till I was about 19 or so and maybe a little younger than that. And then turn more to classic literature when I got to college. And, and, uh, also partly as a consequence of some lessons that the local librarian taught me about what to read. So I was a science fiction fan. I haven't read science fiction for a very long time, although I was pretty happy with it when I was a kid. So

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       Richard Vanc carpet and says, yes, I have, I phobia. And would love to hear about anxiety.

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       Well that's a, that's a rough thing to have agoraphobic. So agoraphobic, get increasingly isolated and afraid of things outside of their domain and familiarity. And often what happens with agora phobia is that people who develop it or afraid of two things, they're afraid that something is going to go dreadfully wrong with their health, especially with regards to their hearts. So they start to become afraid that maybe they'll have a heart attack and that they'll die in public, far from a hospital and that don't make a fool of themselves while they're doing it or well, they, well, they think they're done. So it's a combination of two fears and one is fear of mortality. And the other is fear of social judgement. And you might think about those as the two main categories of feared that possessed people because one is associated obviously with mortality and death and the other is associated with exclusion from the group, which of course can lead to mortality and death.

Speaker 1:          00:20:32       And so the agoraphobic skip the worst of both worlds. And it's often a disease of middle aged women, but not always. And there are often people who've been somewhat dependent in their previous lives and then undergo some traumatic event like a divorce or the death. Someone close and at the same time are perhaps experiencing heart palpitations that are associated with menopause that brings ideas of mortality to mind. And that can trigger a panic attack, which is a very, um, what would you call it, unpleasant experience to say the least. Um, and then that fear of panic attack starts making people avoid. And that's when Agora Phobia develops out of anxiety disorders with panic attacks. So you go out and maybe you go to a mall and maybe you're in a crowd and maybe you start thinking about, well, your heartbeat and about the fact that someone close to you has died and maybe then you become aware of your heartbeat and you start to panic because you feel that maybe it's the beat is irregular or or that or that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:32       You can't detect it as well as you usually can. And then that makes your heart accelerate because it makes you afraid. And then you get more more. What would you call sensitive to that and that makes your heart rate beat even faster. And then you panic. You want to get to the hospital to get checked out to make sure that you're all right and then you make your fatal mistake, which is that you avoid going back to the mall and then you go to a grocery store and the same thing happens and then you start to avoid going to the grocery store. Then you start to avoid avoiding the subway or taxis or crowds or anywhere you might get trapped and wouldn't be able to get to the hospital. Soon you end up avoiding everything and that's when your life really starts to become a living hell.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       So the basic way to treat or a phobia. There's two ways. One is to develop some control of breathing, to do progressive relaxation, and the way you do that is that you start with your start by concentrating on your toes and your feet and your ankles and your shins, your knees. You move all the way up your body and let the tension flow out of your muscles and regulate your breathing calmly and carefully so that you can learn to relax and then you go out. You go out voluntarily am start to confront the things you're afraid of. So for example, if you're afraid of the mall, maybe you go to the parking lot and you look at them all and then you walk close to the door and you look inside, you know, and then you go home because that's enough for one day. But you do progressive exposure.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       And that's the base, one of the basic rules of psychotherapy is that if you're afraid of something, you progressively and voluntarily expose yourself to it, and that generally it's the voluntary exposure that's curative, right? Accidental exposure could make you worse, but voluntary exposure can be curative and that's sort of associated with the myth of the hero and the Dragon. You know the hero is the person who goes out voluntarily to confront the dragon and overcome it and get the treasure. And so if you voluntarily expose yourself to things you're afraid of, like no more than you can tolerate, then you'll find that you get braver and you learned that you can tolerate the fear and that can chase the agora phobia back, but it's very important to do it on a regular basis. And if you agoraphobic full fledged, agoraphobic and should probably consult professional help because it's very tricky condition and it can be very, can really impair you badly. So that's what I would recommend.

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       Hi Jp. I'm wondering how the computer program that rates university courses as worthwhile or not is coming along well. It isn't rating them as worthwhile. It's rating the mess postmodern Neil Marxist or not and it's actually fully developed. I was going to launch it and I didn't. I didn't design it a, somebody volunteered to design it and presented it to me and it seems to work very well. Um, I was going to launch it at the end of August so that this year is university students could benefit from it, but there was the Charlottesville event and then I got busy and I also wasn't feeling great and so I just didn't hit the window of time properly. But I hope to be able to launch it for the January incoming class to do a video about what's wrong with the university system. That many things that are wrong with the university system and to launch the website. At the same time. I also had people suggest to me that maybe it wasn't a good idea that it would increase polarization, but I've thought about that for about a month and a half. And I think that the benefit to the consumer. So that would be the informed student outweighs any danger of polarization. And besides that, something has to be done because the situation in the universities is really ridiculous. So.

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       All right, so let's see what else we've got here in the chat room.

Speaker 1:          00:25:18       Dvs S, k e r three. That's quite a mouthful. Says I'm studying to be a teacher, but I'm also an introvert. Could this be a big problem? Can I still be a successful teacher? Actually, what seems to predict success at teaching best is intelligence and conscientiousness. That's the data so far. So if you're conscientious, then you'll probably be fine. I mean extra introverts have a harder time speaking in front of groups, but you can learn to do that. You know, an introvert can become a very successful public speaker. May Not enjoy it the same way that an extrovert might. But that doesn't mean that you can't learn the skills. And what I would recommend for an introvert is the same thing that I do when I'm lecturing is I never talked to the whole group. You know, it doesn't matter how big the crowd is, I'm always picking out individuals in the group and talking specifically to them.

Speaker 1:          00:26:09       So I'll make a point to an individual and I watched their face and see if they're nodding and understanding, right, because that way you make contact with the entire audience and then, you know, we'll all talk to someone for about 15 seconds or so. I don't want to put them on the spot too much and then I shift my attention to someone else and I sort of pin point around the room and that keeps everybody in the room focused on what I'm saying because each person reflects the entire crowd back to you. And so I would say if you're an introvert or if you want to speak in public in general, forget about the damn crowd. It doesn't exist. Speak to people one on one at a time and an introvert can do that just fine. So you know, that's where your strengths would be. I would say you're, you're much more likely to be unsuccessful as a teacher if you don't work hard at it. And if you're not interested in it. So if you're an introvert, I wouldn't worry about that. I don't think that that'll be the biggest problem that you'll face. So

Speaker 1:          00:27:16       sure. Nick's are overrated. Says ditch your barber, like my barber quite a bit to hit his haircuts a little shorter than I'm accustomed to and there's some reasons for that. But uh, um. Oh, what can I say? How hair grows back and it will be just as beautiful as I was before. No time. So I guess that's how that. See now Richard Van Copeland says my haircuts looking fresh. So who's that? Nick's are overrated. Take the APP. Yeah. So,

Speaker 2:          00:27:46       um,

Speaker 1:          00:27:56       would you consider having a discussion with Thomas Soul that Sam, dogen, dogen, dogen probably. Oh yeah, I definitely considered it. I'm thinking hard about reaching out to him. I have some discussions coming up that you might be interested in. So I'm going to talk on Jocko willink podcast and he was the leader of the Navy seals team in Ramadan and he's quite the tough character. I met him down in San Diego a while back, a month ago or so, and that was very interesting. I have a video already prepared that's an interview with our out in hers, the elite, um, it was done by skype and needs some editing and so that's been a bit delayed. I interviewed or discussed, I had a discussion with Nina Paley who was a great animator. You guys should look her up. That's Nina Paley. She animated a lot of the Old Testament and set it to music and I think your animations are unbelievably beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       And the meeting, she has great musical tastes. They're illegal videos. Basically she's making an illegal movie. Um, but anyways, I really liked your stuff. I also had a discussion with Claire Lehmann who runs quill at, which is a new newsmagazine online, which I think has got real promise and we had a good discussion and um, let's see. Is that helped? I think that's it on and you probably know or maybe you don't. Um, I just finished a discussion with Camille Paglia and we went down there. I took a film crew down there to Philadelphia and met her at her university and we talked for a couple of hours and that was really interesting. She's quite the fireball, that woman and unbelievably verbally fluent and sharp. And so I finally met someone who could more than me and, and uh, that's probably good. So, but I really enjoyed speaking with her and I think about 100,000 people have watched that now in a day, so that's pretty good.

Speaker 1:          00:29:51       So we talked about postmodernism and the malaise that confronts the modern university and all of those sorts of things. So Robin Deon says, do you ever Miss Montreal? Hey, I was just in Montreal. I went there to saw, saw a band called half moon run, which are abandoned. I would highly recommend they were playing with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and I got invited to meet one of the singers and also go in and see the concert, which was excellent. And Yeah, I'd Miss Montreal. Montreal is a great city for you. Americans who are listening should go visit Montreal. Man. It's a cool place and spend a week there in the summer. It's, it's a really good city in every way. So

Speaker 2:          00:30:31       yeah. So

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       it seems we are bound to repeat history and what his old becomes new again. Why is it that we can't seem to find equilibrium within a society? Ideas begin with good intentions, but lead towards the extreme. Yeah. Well, the reason we can't find equilibrium is because the environment that we live in isn't an equilibrium, and so I. I kind of imagine it this way. It's like we're, we're traversing the back of a giant. This is obviously a symbolic reference of the giant serpent and it's and it weaves back and forth and you don't know at any moment which way it's going to curve and turn. And so sometimes it turns to the right and sometimes it turns to the left. And what that means politically is that sometime we have to turn to the right and sometimes we have to turn to the left and we don't know exactly when those, what you call, we don't know exactly how to time that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       And so what we all have to do is keep our eyes open and tell the truth and discuss things with each other, especially with people who have political beliefs that are different than us so that we can ensure that we haven't tilted too far. One way or the other, and that's why I'm an advocate of free speech or one of the many reasons I'm an advocate of free speech is because it's the continual dialogue between people of different temperamental types that keeps us oriented as close as we can to the center of the serpents back. And so there is no permanent equilibrium. There's only the equilibrium that's produced by continual negotiation and a democracy is a formalized negotiation. And so, um, and, and, and it's free speech that keeps it healthy and alive. So there's no permanent equivalent equilibrium state except death. And it's always negotiation in relationships too, like if you have an intimate relationship or a familial relationship or even a friendship, there's no final equilibrium state.

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       You have to communicate with each other honestly all the time and keep the relationship moving to adjust the environment that the relationship is operating in. That's how it stays alive. And in an intimate, longterm intimate relationship like a, it's a continual, uh, it takes continual effort. I mean, it's worthwhile effort and that, but you have to be conscious and awake to keep your relationship alive and you have to be communicating all the time. Well, maybe not all the time because you can overcommunicate too, but I'm so well, so that's why we can't reach a state of permanent equilibrium.

Speaker 1:          00:33:06       Okay. Let's go back to the previously submitted questions. How can I overcome my fear of driving on freeways? Well, one of the things you could do, this is Ellis, is do a fair bit of imagining driving on freeways and try to make the imagining as realistic as possible, but then the other thing you can do is, again, it's graduated exposure. If you're afraid of driving, go drive with someone you trust in a parking lot on Sunday morning when there's no one there and then drive around the block and the street that isn't busy and then go to a slightly busier street and then go to the slightly busier street and then find a highway that's like a, just a two layer so that you know, you could practice merging and that sort of thing. And you've got to build a plan, say with 20 degrees of difficulty with the highest degree of difficulty, maybe being more merging onto a busy four lane highway and you can go at night and practice merging onto the busy highway because they won't be busy at night.

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       So I would say what you do is you break it down into small steps and then practice each step until you're bored with the step and when you're bored with it, that means you're no longer anxious about it and don't quit, you know, like stick at it because it's really useful to overcome a fear. And once you've identified it, fear, then you've identified something to overcome that can definitely make you stronger. So like good luck with it and get professional. Like take a driving course if you need to as well and find someone to work with. It isn't going to make you nervous and isn't going to harass you, but don't quit. It's really important to overcome a fear like that. No, I just picked something I shouldn't have clicked. Actually. I'm pretty happy with myself. My son isn't here. As I mentioned, I'm still not like destroying this completely, although I may have done it now. No.

Speaker 2:          00:34:59       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:35:19       See that's what happens when you brag because now all I've got is one question from pigeon hole and not all of them. Let's see. Got It. Back to chart

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       was the trick. So Hey, I'm, I'm actually managing this up too badly. So let's see here.

Speaker 1:          00:35:48       Some more questions from the, from the Youtube people,

Speaker 1:          00:35:58       Dr Peterson. I'm really hoping you can share your thoughts on the daigous shooting. Yeah. Well, what I would do is recommend the biblical lecture I did on Cain and Abel would say because I think that that's a good summary of the state of mind that somebody has to be in in order to do what was done at Los Vegas. So you have to be very, very embittered by lights in order to do that sort of thing and you have to be searching for revenge, I would say. And it's not, you know, you might think, well it's only revenge on other people because you've developed hatred for people, but it's deeper than that. It's not just hatred for people. I would say it's hatred for being itself and and the desire to take revenge on being for the outrage of the tragedy and suffering that's associated with being and maybe the tragedy and suffering that's been part and parcel of your own life and that makes you embittered and then past embittered becomes outraged and past outraged becomes well homicidal or even genocidal and that's terrible state of mind to be in.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       It's a hellish state. Well, I believe that the best way to conceptualize the state of mind that someone has to be in in order to do something like the columbine shootings for example, or what happened in Las Vegas is that you're really an now you have to speak about it. Religious languages, you're really out for revenge against God for the outrage of creation. That's what it looks like to me and that's a state of mind that's truly hellish and you could get there by broody long enough. Now it's also possible. I mean this guy didn't have any previous history, criminal history or anything like that and he's pretty old. So you know, there's also also also the possibility of some kind of neurological pathway log that that might be characteristic of him, you know, some degenerative neurological disease. There was a kid years ago at the University of Texas at Austin who climbed up on the tower there and shot a number of people with a high powered rifle and he had a fast growing tumor on his hypothalamus and had reported like these being overcome with extreme feelings of rage. And so that's another possibility. But I would say the embitterment hypothesis is the strongest one. I would also say too, I noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted this today, is that one of the ways of controlling this sort of thing would be for the press to agree not for there to be a blanket agreement, not to publicize the name or any other identity markers of the people who do the shooting. Because there's also this

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       really, what would you call it, arrogance. It's a kind of arrogance and pride last ditch, arrogance and pride that that is associated with the fantasies that drive this sort of behavior. And the fantasy is something like, well, after I do this, everyone will know the who, who the hell I was, you know, even though maybe I was ignored or unhappy when I was alive after I'm dead, everybody's going to know who I was and what I did and you know, so there's this underground desire for fame, I guess it's notoriety, but notoriety might be preferable to being ignored. And so, you know, there's a lot of talk about gun control and that's understandable, especially with regards to automatic rifles. Although I also understand why the people who are gun owners are afraid of, of, of allowing what they regard as one of their fundamental rights to be infringed upon. Um, but it would certainly be useful if we stopped giving people who do this sort of thing now, $100,000,000 worth of free publicity and all the notoriety they can manage. So, you know, that's another way of thinking about controlling it. So,

Speaker 3:          00:39:53       and Tony was. Sylvia says, you need a break, have a glass of wine. Relax. Yeah. Well, I was just up. I have this little cabin up north of Toronto, about three hours north that my wife bought with some money that her dad left her, gave her. Actually, he's still alive and I was up there this weekend and it was relaxing. I was working a bit on this new personality scale and on the video, but I did relax a bit and I'm actually feeling a lot better than it was for the last and a so the mornings are still rough, but by this time of night I'm feeling vaguely human, so thank God for that because it was pretty brutal. So anyhow,

Speaker 3:          00:40:37       Franklin says, fans are cancer for the authentic individual. Well, that's a tough one. You know, I mean, cancer know that. That's too, that's too dramatic. I mean, I guess that what you're pointing out is the danger of fame and I can certainly appreciate that. I can't say that I'm particularly comfortable with it, which might seem to be rather hypocritical as it isn't. Like I've shied away from exposing my views in public, but I felt that I was driven to that by necessity and also by my desire to educate people. Um, however, I would say despite the fact that I'm somewhat uncomfortable with it, I think that's mostly because of the responsibility, you know, what I've been terrified for a whole year that I say something, you know, unforgivably stupid and demolished myself in public and you don't feel guilty and horrible about

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       that for the rest of my life. And so far I'd be fortunate there's been some close calls, but I've been fortunate, but, you know, now when I go places, people often recognize me. Even at this little town we went up to this weekend, there were two people that came up to me in the parking lot and we're excited to meet the and you know, the vast majority of encounters, all of the encounters that I have with people in public and have been really wonderful. I have to say that the people have been extremely friendly and you know, sometimes they're a bit star struck, which I find strange. I can see the projection, you know, so it's, it's unsettling for me, although I'm not judging anybody for it. It's just a strange thing to observe. Um, but, you know, I can't complain about the fact that people are, are, uh, are, are positively predisposed to what I'm doing.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       I mean, it's such a privilege. I can't imagine what it would be like to be hated publicly. I think that would just kill me. I really think that. But um, so I mean it's, it's, I suppose there's the possibility of having that sort of thing go to your head and it's, it, I mean that happens to people, but I think I've said this before, maybe on the q and a's I have a pretty sensible family and I have a pretty. Um, what would you say? I have a pretty good sense of my limitations. I would say, um, let's, we could even call it an acute sense and so I'm not particularly worried that this is going to go to my head in some way that, that would

Speaker 2:          00:43:10       no

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       inflate my ego or something like that. Huh? I mean, I think one of the things I have noticed is that I might be a little less patient with people when I'm speaking. I'm because I'm more used to that, more used to that might be good for me to be listened to and so I have to watch that, but I'm pretty, I've always been pretty noisy and talkative and so that's probably something that's plagued me or being a characteristic of me ever since I was a little tiny kid. I mean, I used to talk all the time when I was a little little, little guy. I mean, I think my cousin Eric Bonus, he probably listens to this. He used to call me motor mouth and that was about exactly right. I was like a miniature Camille Paglia. So, um, anyways, I can't complain about having let's say, fans. So people have been unbelievably good to me and I'm really grateful for that. So

Speaker 1:          00:44:09       what is the best way to find a routine when you're diagnosed? Bipolar? Well, I would say a couple of things. The first is try to set your sleep wake cycle stabling, so pick a time in the morning to get up. That's the most important thing is get up at the same time every morning and that that might be difficult both when you're mad mannequin when you're depressed, but the closer you can stick to that, the better. And I would also say try to stabilize when you go to bed and maybe a little later rather than a little earlier because you don't want to be laying there flipping around like a, like a fish trying to go to sleep. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:44:50       you want to stabilize your sleep wake routines because bipolar disorder is in part a circadian rhythm disorder. And so anything that destabilizes your secret and rhythms is going to increase the probability that you'll have an episode. And that includes flying. I do believe that at Gatwick airport there's, in England, there's a special team that deals with people whose main mainly has been triggered by the overnight flight. So, and then the other thing I would say is stabilized the times you eat because these basic biological rhythms, eating and sleeping in particular are part of what stabilize your nervous system. And if you have bipolar disorder, then you're likely to be very susceptible to destabilize, destabilize routine, routinized activities, routinize your life to the degree that that's possible. And I would say the other thing you could do is use a calendar, you know, and like a Google calendar or whatever, whatever calendar.

Speaker 1:          00:45:46       And I would say that's a good thing for everyone who's listening to think about so one to plan out your days and your weeks and you don't plan to prison, right? You use the calendar to design the days that you would like to have. And so part of that is going to be responsibility obviously because you have to keep up with your responsibilities or they overwhelm you and they multiply like hydrus and. But you need to plan for things that you really want to do as well. And the calendar can really be your friend. And I would say of all the things that you can do to organize yourself and routinize yourself. Learning to use a calendar is probably among the foremost. And it doesn't matter if it takes you a year to get good at it. You know what I mean? You've got the rest of your life then to benefit from that. And you should make friends with the calendar. Like I said, I don't treat it like a prison, but it's really important to, to, um, stabilize yourself as much as possible. So periphery Pete says, I fell asleep listening to you. My battery died. I got to change it.

Speaker 3:          00:47:54       All right. It looks like everything is okay. Again, I use it a reflex camera my and um, it has a battery. No electrical plugins. So I'm afraid I'm at the mercy of its batteries, the very high quality camera though. So I think it's worth, worth the trouble. Anyways, periphery Pete said I fell asleep listening to you, which, you know, that doesn't sound so good. So that part's not so good. But this part is good. The next day my 60 filter less cigarettes a day habit disappeared. Not sure what you said, but thank you Claire X. Hey. Well, if you can figure out what you were listening to, um, maybe I can make a tape of things to listen to by Jordan Peterson while you're falling asleep to fix your cigarette habit. But anyways, I think that's great. Don't, don't start again. Or if you do, make sure you quit. Again. I'm really glad to hear that and I've never had that particular talent pointed out to me before. So that's pretty interesting and comical. So do you believe there's a strong undercurrent of gnosticism in our country? GNOSTICISM, by the way, is the doctrine heretical doctrine from a classical Christian perspective that you can attain religious insight through understanding that's an oversimplified view, but um, things like the sacred feminine and hatred of the created world.

Speaker 3:          00:49:24       God, that's a complicated question. I think there's an undercurrent of wanting to be gnosticism in our country. You know, I think that people believe they can come to religious enlightenment through understanding, but that they are generally less willing to do the work that would be necessary to do that. Then then is in fact necessary. It takes an awful lot of study, like it took me years of reading young to really start to understand what he was talking about. 10, you know, you could think about young as a gnostic, but most people who talk about young haven't read anything he wrote. While that's true, often of things that people talk about in general, but I mean I think there is a place for understanding and religious belief or other. Otherwise I wouldn't be doing this biblical lecture series, but I think it's pseudo gnosticism fundamentally and it's people putting forward ill considered opinions in the place of solid religious, symbolic doctrine and I think that's a big problem. I think it's part of what makes us weak and I think we are at the moment week in our foundations as a civilization, so I have trouble regulating my emotions. I have a suspicion it's to do with the fact that I'm 90 percentile and openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism and second percentile in agreeableness and extroversion. Any tips on dealing with that? Yeah, well,

Speaker 3:          00:50:55       if you're really high in openness and you're really high in neuroticism, that can be a rough combination. The conscientious news should actually help with that, although it might make you a bit perfectionistic. Um, the problem with being high in openness, which is creativity and interest in ideas and high in neuroticism, which is tendency towards anxiety and emotional pain, is that like open people like to break open boxes, conceptual boxes, and see what's inside, like Pandora's box, but people are high in neuroticism or are more likely to respond negatively to complexity and uncertainty. And if you're an open person and you're always thinking of new things, you, you tend to, um, saw off the branch that you're sitting on on a regular basis. And that can be pretty destabilizing. Any tips on dealing with that? Well, I would repeat what I said earlier. I think that one of the things that you do if you're high in anxiety, is to stabilize your sleep wake cycles.

Speaker 3:          00:51:53       So get up at the same time. Go to bed at the same time and eat at the same time. Make sure that you eat breakfast and a big breakfast too. That's heavy on fat and protein because if you're hungry and then you stress yourself, especially if you're high in neuroticism, you destabilize your, your insulin production system and it will restabilize till you go to sleep again. So I would say like two things. One is have a big breakfast and then also if you're feeling particularly anxious, try eating something, not carbohydrates and see if that helps because you, you might be somewhat permanently dysregulated in your insulin, stress-related insulin production. That would be worth trying. I would also say that you should shield yourself to some degree from news sources and sources of bad news, especially, um, catastrophic news because most of it isn't news. It's the repetition of things that we already know full well and there's reason to protect yourself from an onslaught of negative information, especially when it's not really necessary for you.

Speaker 3:          00:52:59       I mean, I don't think you should bury your head in the sand, but constant exposure to the catastrophes of the world, especially when there's nothing you can do about those catastrophes even hypothetically, is something that can really destabilize people. I often tell people in my clinical practice, um, which isn't operating right now by the way, to shield themselves from news reports because it's too much. If you're depressed and anxious, it's just not something that you need. It's not helpful to you second percentile in agreeableness and extroversion. Well, you know, one of the things that you can do if you're that low in agreeableness that shouldn't disregulate your emotions, but it might interfere with your relationships with other people you know, because you might be a little bit harder to. You might take other people's feelings into consideration less than might be good for you. One of the things that people who are low in agreeableness can do is to try to think of things they could do for other people and make that a practice.

Speaker 3:          00:54:02       You know, like maybe once a week you could consciously do someone a favor or give someone a gift, something like that. And practice being, um, what would you call it? Compassionate and polite, you know, that'll expand your personality rather than transforming it. So then maybe you could have the advantages of being disagreeable, which means you're tough minded. And skeptical and competitive and and those can all be really good things, but it would be nice to be able to leave it out a little bit with some with the ability to take other people's perspectives a bit more and to take them into account. And then you know, if your relationships improve, that can also improve your emotional stability because one of the ways that people regulate their anxiety is by having people around them that they get along with because you know, if you're upset people then they upset you and especially if you're high in neuroticism and that can increase your anxiety and your pain. So Mr David says, should I hide my antifeminist anti-feminism I presume as I studied university to become a nurse?

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       Well look,

Speaker 3:          00:55:15       you shouldn't make unnecessary enemies and you probably shouldn't mouth your opinion more than necessary, but I think you risk damaging your soul under certain circumstances when you don't say what you think. So I wouldn't hide it because I think it's dangerous to hide it. And you also won't find out, find the other people that you listened to, but I would say be prudent. You know, um, don't falsify your opinions when you're writing. That's a big mistake. Don't falsify your opinions when you're speaking. You can always choose not to speak, you know, but if you feel that you would be doing damage to your integrity, then you have to say what you have to say. Do it carefully and, and prepare for the consequences, you know, uh, probably prepare beforehand I would say. So I think the hiding is a bad idea, like I said, but don't make unnecessary enemies, you know, because there's just no utility in that.

Speaker 3:          00:56:15       How important do you believe the American right? Is the American right to bear arms and maintain malicious? Is it equivalent to the right to free speech? Well, I don't think anything is equivalent to the right to free speech or the responsibility for free speech. Um, how important do I believe that? That right is Jesus? That's a tough question. You know, my dad's a hunter, he has 200 rifles, something like that. They're all single shots because he believes the naming carefully. Um, the culture I come from, which is northwestern Canada, is a rural culture, a hunting culture. People take their guns seriously there and it is definitely part of their lifestyle. I mean, my dad hunted his whole life and we ate wild meat almost all the time I was growing up. Um, I think that the right to bear arms is one of the markers of a, of a free society. I don't think it's reasonable that only the police and the army should be allowed to be dangerous. I'm having said that. Well, I think I'll just leave it at that. I mean I feel obligated in some sense to go farther, especially with regards to what happened in Las Vegas, but it seems to me that mostly what happens after these mass shootings is that the event gets absolutely politicized and people take their standard positions and there's no moving either side and that's too bad. But, um,

Speaker 3:          00:57:49       I think that it's unfortunate to use an event like the Las Vegas event or the columbine shootings to make political capital. And I think that's usually what happens. And so I'm not going to do that. I think it's an important, right. I believe that the individual should be allowed or even encouraged to be dangerous, but controlled. No. So along with that, right is a responsibility and, and I guess maybe from the NRA, there should be more discussion of responsibility. Is that possible? Now? Seems to me to be reasonable. So

Speaker 3:          00:58:33       any advice for a person with intense chronic pain that wants to become. Who wants to become a uh. Oh, sorry. It switched on me. Oh, there we go. Crayola sheep says any advice for a person with intense chronic pain? Who wants to become a contributing member of society? Specifically having the self discipline to push through pain, to take care of responsibilities? Well, the first thing I would say is that if you have intense chronic pain, then my heart goes out to you because now it's really awful. And so I think that you can cut yourself a break. I think the fact that you want to become or continue being a contributing member to society, society is a testament to your fortitude. I guess the first thing I would ask you is if your pain has been reasonably managed, you probably know this and I'm not giving you any medical advice because I can't, but you might want to note that there are antidepressants that are quite effective as longterm pain medications and you may already know that, but if you don't, then you should check that out because they're not addictive and they can be a very effective adjunct.

Speaker 3:          00:59:37       I would also say that the literature on chronic pain tends to indicate that more activity is better than less and that and that's partly because when you get engaged in something that's meaningful, let's say, and important to you, that that activates the dopaminergic system, the same system that Takeda activates and that can produce a fairly pronounced analgesic effect. So I would say everything that you can do to get yourself occupied with things that you regard as important and worthwhile is actually probably going to help you manage your pain better. It looks like inactivity is a bad, is bad. Generally speaking for chronic pain, I mean obviously that's not the case. If the sort of activity that you're engaged in is of the type that will aggravate an underlying chronic physiological condition, but I would say make a plan, make a daily plan, make a weekly plan, um, make it, you know, push yourself a little bit farther than you can go comfortably on a weekly basis and see how far you can get any year.

Speaker 3:          01:00:42       That's because what's your choice? I mean, you're laying there. Suffering is not preferable to doing things and suffering, not generally. So I would say like more power to you for trying and, but, but also do keep in mind that activity, meaningful activity is a good analgesic. So I'm Eric Butler says sheesh. Canadians never get it. Well, I didn't know we get it sometimes. Eric, come on now, you know, give us a break. We're just. Canadians were freezing to death half the time. So you know, we do pretty well given the fact that every day here in the winter is the equivalent of a national catastrophe in the U. s. So anyways, I'm Betsy Kirkland. It says, if the second amendment is taken away, there will be nothing to protect your freedom of speech. That is how important. Yes. Yes. Well, that is certainly the argument that people who are motivated to protect the second amendment make, and I'm not going to oppose that. So

Speaker 3:          01:01:46       freedom of speech is not licensed to bully. Yes, actually it is. That is exactly what it is. That's clique zero. Two zero. Three. Freedom of speech is licensed to bullet. It's licensed to offend. It's licensed to disrupt. It's all sorts of things that are unpleasant and upsetting and um, that doesn't mean that you should go around bullying or being disruptive or upsetting. That isn't the same thing, but that is exactly what it is. So I'm afraid please zero to three are wrong. Now. Then you say use some discretion and thought, well yes, of course that's perfectly reasonable advice and that is what people should do. But you know, what constitutes discretion is often something that has to be discussed. And I would say that the threat to freedom of speech is being put forward very strongly by people who say things. While it's not as, it's not the same as the licensed to bullying and bullying, by the way generally speaking is it is a sequence of physical auctions. When it's verbal bullying, which also can occur, then that has to be put into somewhat different category. If you're interested in bullying, there's a great book and seriously interested in it. There's a great book by a guy named Dan always called bullying. I think that's what it's called, what we know and what we can do about it. Dan Always, and if you know, if you're actually concerned about that sort of thing, you could read that book and see if there are places that you could put what he advises in schools, for example, into practice. So,

Speaker 2:          01:03:12       um,

Speaker 3:          01:03:28       you look young, asked what moment triggered your obsession with the topics outlined in the biblical series and maps? Well, that's a good question. I actually don't know the answer though. I wouldn't say it was a moment. I know that from the time I was about 16 until the time that I was 24. So I had recurrent nightmares about nuclear war. And so that was certainly part of it and they were very vivid and very realistic and so and certainly my reading especially about the Holocaust, I'm also. And then later Solzhenitsyn's accounts of the Gulag archipelago, for example, the horrors there. That was also a major contributor. It was my concern about the Cold War. I would say that was really the trigger in general because I wanted to understand. I took a political science degree first and looked at it from a political perspective, but most of my professors by the time I was in my third or fourth year, insisted that the reason that people fought the reasons that people thought were economic and I never did believe that because, well people fight about the things they value, but it isn't the obvious why people value the things they value, you know, so it's a psychological issue as far as I'm concerned with and not an economic issue.

Speaker 3:          01:04:48       And so it was my discomfort, dissatisfaction with the standard political science view point directing team point combined with this strange obsession I had about the Cold War. Maybe that's associated to some degree with my proclivity to depression. I mean, who knows, you know, I don't know. I was obsessed with it and I, it isn't obvious why things grip you and shake you like a rat, you know, I guess some, there's something about that that seems to be associated with people used to call it destiny. So,

Speaker 2:          01:05:20       um,

Speaker 3:          01:05:22       but it certainly wasn't obsession when I was 23 or 24 when I started writing maps of meaning I was thinking about it 16 hours a day, like top speed, just nonstop. And the only relief I could get from it. Rudy was to go work out with weights, which I did for quite a long time. I gained about 35 pounds in about a year and a half working out with weights and I had to quit because I was eating so much. It was taking up like half my life. So, um, anyways, I don't know what it was, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:05:52       who knows, who knows what, what darkness lurks in the bottom of a soul. No one, why it's there. Maybe it was also the fact that I could see in myself the tendencies that might lead people to do terrible things and I was also very, very curious about that, so maybe that was an encounter with the union shot. It was something like that. Jeremy says, will you lecture in the Netherlands? Yes. As a matter of fact, I'm coming to the Netherlands in January to lecture there. I'll put the link to that up on my website at some point in the relatively near future. So

Speaker 3:          01:06:35       saga strike. I've heard depressed people who stopped antidepressant said they never helped in the first place. What do you say to that, Mr Peterson? Hey, that, that certainly possible. I'm antidepressants don't necessarily work for everyone. My personal opinion is that antidepressants work quite well for many people whose lives are in decent order, so they have friends, they have family that love them, they have a career, they're educated approximately to the level of their intelligence. They have things to look forward to, but for some reason their mood is extremely distorted. Him and and negative and I've seen antidepressants have miraculous effects or people like that. I think they're less likely to work when people have a plethora of life problems, which isn't exactly the same thing as being depressed, you know, like you think having a terrible life is not the same thing as being depressed. Although the two can overlap and it isn't obvious to me that people who, you know, maybe they have a drinking problem or a drug abuse problem, mender unemployed and they have a pathological family and their friends aren't good for them and um, you know, they, they, they have a string of failures behind them and they don't have much to look forward to in the future.

Speaker 3:          01:07:53       And all about it's, it's a lot for an antidepressant overcome. But under those circumstances, maybe the antidepressants can help stave off feelings of like suicidal feelings and that sort of thing. But antidepressants don't work for everyone, but some people they work really well for it. If you're depressed, they're definitely worth a try. You know, in a month if they're going to work. Also, there are a variety of different kinds of antidepressants and you have to figure out dose and you have to figure out when you should take them during the day and you and you have to figure out type, so they're, they're not a cure, they're a tool for helping control negative emotion and they can be very effective. So, but that doesn't mean that there aren't people that they didn't help. So that's what I would say about that.

Speaker 3:          01:08:44       What the player formerly known as most cops says. What do you think the role of psychedelics will be in the future? Marijuana will most likely be somewhat legal everywhere in the US and this may push someone to try stronger. PSYCHEDELICS is this bad? Let's start with the first one. I have no idea what the role of psychedelics will be in the future. I know that the FDA just cleared ecstasy for use for post traumatic stress disorder, so that's very interesting. I know there's some very interesting work being done at Johns Hopkins on silicide mushrooms, which seemed to be very effective, for example, in helping people stop smoking. I think that we don't know anything about psychedelics at all. I mean, we know that they seem to have an effect on the serotonin system, but that's a pretty broad brush stroke. Um, I think they are incalculably I'm peculiar and that they reveal things about the structure of the world that we are beyond ignorant about, beyond ignorant about.

Speaker 3:          01:09:41       I have no idea what role they'll play in the future. I don't know what to think about psychedelics at all. Um, marijuana will most likely be somewhat legal everywhere in the US and this may push some to try stronger. PSYCHEDELICS is this bad? I suppose it depends on how they're used, whether or not it's bad and what the intent is. I think they are very bad party drugs. Psychedelics aren't, aren't for fun. I don't think that that's the right way to use them at all. I think they need to be used seriously and they need to be used in a manner that's life affirming and they need to be used in a manner that's commensurate with genuine exploration and they need to be used carefully or they can cause a lot of trouble. So Carl Jung said beware of unearned wisdom and I think that's very wise. So, um, anyways, I hope that we continue investigating them scientifically because there's much to be learned there much more than we can imagine as far as I'm concerned. Ha [inaudible] says, what's up with all these frog occurrences? I've never seen such synchronicity, man. I don't know what to say about that. I had some frog synchronicity occurrences earlier this year that just about made me think so. I don't know. I have,

Speaker 3:          01:11:10       I have no idea what to make of it. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:11:16       it leaves me speechless. That's all I can say about that. You know, I, I do get Carl young had some strange ideas and, and one of them was synchronicity, you know, the fact that things could line up in a way that seemed meaningful and you know, much as I don't understand how that occurs. I've experienced it many, many times and it very convincing ways. And so it's, it's one of the things that leads me to think that the world isn't structured the way that we think it is. I think it's structured more like a symphony where where and there are times with dis, different parts of the world, different parts of being could come into harmony spontaneously and, and all pointed in the same direction and why that happens. I have no idea. All right. I don't understand it at all. So. All right, so let's go back to the preexisting questions. Semen. Eric says, apologies for the weird question. Have you ever performed a ritual sacrifice? No, I haven't and it is a weird question, although I can understand why you would ask it.

Speaker 3:          01:12:48       I have performed psychological sacrifices, you know, I suppose when I decided to give up something that I needed to give up so that I could move forward into the future. Right. That certainly happened when I quit smoking. When I more or less quit drinking. I still have a drink from time to time now, but I quit for 20 years and that was a sacrifice. I couldn't continue to drink again. I said I was from northern Alberta. It was pretty hard drinking culture and I really liked alcohol, but I couldn't drink and write and do my phd and manage my family responsibilities. It was too much and so I stopped and that was a good thing. So that was a sacrifice.

Speaker 3:          01:13:35       You are very critical of postmodernism, an egalitarianism wave of the sixties. Isn't there a danger of throwing the baby out with the bathwater? Are there positive things about these movements at the moment? No, not really. I don't think there's much positive about them at all. I think they've gone way too far. I think they dominate the humanities. The postmodernism mean the fact that the postmodernist point is that there is a very large number of ways to interpret any closed set of phenomena, something like that. Any limited set of phenomena, and that's true, but it's, it's shallow, it's very, very shallow doctrine. And uh, and if, if I'm throwing the baby out with the bathwater, then it's a baby that needs to be thrown out. Afraid are the positive things about these movements. Not at the moment. I can't see anything positive about it. I think it's, it's degenerated into ideological clap trap and I think it's destroying the universities.

Speaker 3:          01:14:30       So the egalitarian wave of the sixties, that's a different issue I would say. I mean at mean I don't think it's reasonable to deny the utility of the civil rights movement in the 19 sixties for example. And, or, and, and you know, there were movements before that, like the labor movement that had real justification for being. It isn't that everything that always happens on the left is bad. I don't think that at all. I think that the people who are, let's say on the lower end of the economic distribution, need a powerful voice in politics. Um, I think that's only fair and I mean there is room for an egalitarian oriented east folks, but that isn't what equity is. This has become completely ideological and there's just no, there's just no excuse for it as far as I'm concerned. So, um,

Speaker 3:          01:15:37       if you plan on doing meetups with more intellectuals like Camille and Sam Harris, who would be your pick? I'm, well, I'm going to meet Jonathan Heit. That'll be good. I really admire his work. I think he's a really good guy, so I'm looking forward to talking to him. I'd like to talk to Thomas Soul. I think it's. So I think that would be interesting. Um, the rest of it, I have to think more about that. I mean, but those are two that I would definitely like to talk to you. I'm going to speak with Jocko willink. I think I mentioned that. So that might be interesting. Will there be a third talk with Sam Harris? Maybe this time with Sam as your guests and you taking your gloves off? I don't have any plans for a third talk with Sam. I wouldn't be opposed to it, although I think we, I think we've probably got about as far as we were going to get in or a second discussion. I think the two discussions together actually worked quite well. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:16:34       so I think, I think, and this is no, I'm not saying this in any negative way, but I think the third discussion might be might be beating a dead horse. I'm like, I'm not interested in particularly in putting Sam on the spot and you know, and it's also possible that he would put me on the spot. It isn't necessarily, but I would come out Victoria, so to speak. I mean he's a very sharp guy and there's many compelling arguments to be made in favor of atheism even though I think that overall it's, it's, it's, it's a stance lacks. I don't think it contends with its opponent fairly because I don't think that the atheist community in general takes the thought of serious religious thinkers. Seriously. I think they tend to struggle

Speaker 2:          01:17:21       now, but you know. Well, okay.

Speaker 3:          01:17:31       Could you please offer advice for individuals with high intelligence but low extroversion and low agreeableness and making and maintaining social connections and friendships? Well, I would. That's Roger, Roger. I would say make a plan. Again,

Speaker 3:          01:17:50       spend some time on it weekly. Go to things like meetups. There's a site called meetup.com. That's a good place to meet people. Do whatever you have to meet people, take a course, strike up a conversation, you know, and, and ask questions and listen that that's particularly good. If you're low in agreeableness, um, people really like to be listened to, you know, you don't want to pester them with questions too badly, but you can get an awful long ways by listening to people and asking them questions people hardly ever get listened to and they're so damn help, happy when you do it,

Speaker 2:          01:18:22       that, that, that

Speaker 3:          01:18:25       they're likely to open themselves up to you very, very rapidly. So get them talking and when they say something you don't quite catch your understand and ask them about it. And, and, and that can help you move forward, but put some time into it like you need to be going out at least once a week, um, and find some social places that you can go to regularly. That's another thing you can do is pick a couple of hangouts, like a local bar or something like that or whatever, but go there regularly and say hi to the people who own it and run it. And you know, eventually you'll be a regular and then you can start to meet people by doing that. But you know, it might take you two or three years to get good at it. I've seen people go to go from being afraid to strike up a, to have a conversation with a friend in a, in a coffee shop, you know, like have a panic attack, thinking about that to actually doing stand up comedy. So you can really move yourself along ways if you, if you make a long time plan. So

Speaker 3:          01:19:26       okay, John Dam don't. I've only got three dogs after that says how should the manager used the preto principle in his favorite work? I find myself constantly focusing on the bottom five, 20 percent that causes 80, 95 percent of the team's poor performance. Oh, that's easy. Then managerial literature, the solid managerial literature is absolutely crystal clear on this. Spend all your time with your highest producers and put your lowest producers where they can do the least amount of damage. The probability that as a manager, you're going to be able to solve the problems of the poorest five to 20 percent of your work. A team is zero. You just don't have the time or the resources at your disposal. So what you should definitely do in order to increase performance is to concentrate on your top performers. I know that's not what managers do. They do exactly what you say.

Speaker 3:          01:20:19       They focus on the bottom five to 20 percent, but that's exactly the wrong thing to do as a manager. Focus on your best people. They're hyper productive as you already know. So, um, you know, maybe you need to reconceptualize the way that you're interacting with your people, but you should have regular conversations at least with those that you think are outstanding. Let them know that you really, um, what would you say that you're really happy with their performance and see what you can do to get obstacles the hell out of their way because as a manager, essentially what you should be doing is identifying the top performers and then doing everything you can to clear out the obstacles in their path. That's the right way to think about it. And also to give yourself enough time to develop a medium to longterm plan and start fighting fires on a day to day basis. You need at least 90 minutes a week to think about where you want things to be going into medium to long term. So, but I can't over emphasize the importance of dealing with your top productivity, your talk, your highest, your most productive people. That's where all the gains are. That's where all the games are.

Speaker 3:          01:21:30       How are you doing? Someone is asking you,

Speaker 2:          01:21:33       um,

Speaker 3:          01:21:35       you said some place that you felt like you were at times dancing on broken glass? No, I think I said that I was, I always felt like I was dancing on broken glass. Are you getting enough rest? And rnr is the food sensitivity getting worked out? I think maybe the food sensitivity thing is getting worked out. I think it's at the basis of, of this depression that's been plaguing my family for generations, but I haven't figured out exactly what it is yet. I'm working very hard on that with my daughter who also seems to have the same problem and it is absolutely brutal. It's absolutely brutal, so I'm, am I getting enough rest in rnr? That's hard to say because with the responses that I'd been having that ignoring my health back, it's, it's hard to discriminate between risks and R and r, the lack of that and just getting walloped by, by eating what appears to be the wrong thing. So it's so funny because you know, for years I was very skeptical of anyone who was concerned about gluten sensitivity and that sort of thing, but I sure learned that that was arrogant. So yeah. Well, I found many times in my life that you have to be aware of what you are judgmental about because many things come back to haunt you. So

Speaker 3:          01:23:00       Dr Peterson, do you have suggestions for how to make a schedule that doesn't make you a tyrant? I've watched your previous videos, but I'm struggling to make a weekly schedule that is productive. Hey Joshua, start by making a weekly schedule that you want really like, imagine that you're designing your schedule so that you can have the life you want. Just start with that, like be easy on yourself to begin with. You know, you'll get better at it, you can add more responsibilities as you, as you practice, so, so start by just scheduling and a few things that you'd like to do and then load it up over time, but remember like get, get your attitude, right. I'm using this schedule so that I can have the days and the weeks and the months that would make my life, that would optimize my life, right? Not so that I should do what I need to get done. I mean, obviously that's necessary, but that's not the right goal. So

Speaker 3:          01:23:58       what are your thoughts on students taking adderall? Are there any longterm effects? Um, there are long term studies of the utility of adderall for attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity, and the results are basically negative. There is no evidence that the medications help with academic performance over the long run. I think that adderall is an amphetamine. It is addictive. It can sensitize you to other dopamine agonists. So I would generally say it's something to be avoided. You also want to really watch it in combination with marijuana for example, or psychedelics because you can get unlucky and trigger a psychotic episode and that is not a good thing because once you have one psychotic episode, you're a bit on the broken side and it's hard to put yourself back together. So I would say use it sparingly if at all. It's not, it's not a good plan and especially not something good to be doing habitually. So,

Speaker 2:          01:24:58       um,

Speaker 3:          01:25:02       any reading tips for becoming teachers who don't want to be corrupted by the current teacher education at the universities? Well I would say, you know, you can, I have a reading list on my book, on my website, Jordan Peterson built column. You could go look there. I'm going to add some more books to read as much classic literature as you can read history, like going to the libraries and, and, and look at great books programs. That's what I would say. And you have to educate yourself at the university, you know, I mean, that's always been the case and it's even more the case now is, is a go back and go back and read great literature, Great Philosophy, great thinkers, and you will learn a tremendous amount that way. And I, I think otherwise there's no way you can avoid being corrupted by the current teacher education at universities. The education faculties are absolutely dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. So

Speaker 2:          01:26:11       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:26:12       George Gabriel on drugs says, Jordan, please help me. I'm 99th percentile and openness and zero with percentile and conscientiousness. Yeah. Well how old are you? That's the first thing. If you're, if you're young, that's because younger people are less conscientious. So that's one thing to keep in mind if you're very open like that, you need to be doing something creative, but you're going to have to learn how to discipline yourself. There's just no way around it. And I would say go do the future authoring program. That's a good start. And you'll have to learn how to schedule your time then and how to get up at the same time everyday. And it's going to be a real struggle, but you know, you, you can do it. I've had students who were very high in openness and low in conscientiousness as graduate students and they disciplined themselves. You need to find something that you're really interested in that you're willing to pursue and then you have to hit it hard. So that's what I would say. But do the future authoring program and get yourself a plan and start the implemented in every time you fall astray, then get back at it and you know, you may have to build up your conscientiousness over a number of years and, but it's worth doing. So

Speaker 3:          01:27:28       my favorite Tom, late song, I really like cold water. My son does a vicious version of cold water, but I really like cold water. Um, what else? I like hoists that rag and that's pretty decent song. I like dozens of Tom Waits songs are what else? I have this mental tick where when anyone asks me a question having to do with a name names immediately damaged from my mind anyways. So I really like cold water. I think that's a great song.

Speaker 3:          01:28:08       Is it wrong to turn down a promotion? Is withdrawing from overwhelming additional responsibility, the equivalent of ignoring God's called Abraham? Not necessarily. It depends on what it is that you're doing. Instead, like if you have a better option, then take the better option. If you're afraid, if it's just fear, then you might want to find somebody to talk to about that and, and walk through your fears and make a plan because you know it's possible that it's the equivalent of ignoring God's called Abraham. Um, you know, if it's, if it's pure fear, then I would take a look at that. But if you have a better option, well, you know, it's up to you to decide the course of your life. So I wouldn't say that necessarily. It's a bad thing, you know, not everyone wants overwhelming responsibility at work and people are interested in their private lives and they're interested in their friendships or their or what they do outside of work.

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       So. And I think that's all valid, but if it's just fear, then you need to find someone to talk to and talk it through to make sure that you're not throwing away an opportunity that hey, you know, the other thing too is that, you know, what's your mood like? Are you depressed? Like maybe you're underestimating your ability. Somebody thinks you're worthy of promotion. And you have to remember too that when you get promoted, like almost everybody feels like an imposter for the first year when they're promoted to a new position because you don't know what the hell you're doing. You know, so you're, you're kind of acting out the role before you're qualified to do it. But that's okay. You know, it's, it's, it takes awhile to fit into a new skin. So if you're a perfectionistic, that's another thing to take into account. So,

Speaker 2:          01:29:47       all right,

Speaker 3:          01:30:02       I'm not very religious, but your way of presenting the biblical stories have given me a respect for their function in society. How do I address those who actively oppose the wisdom on atheist principles?

Speaker 3:          01:30:14       Well, look, I think what you do is you say what you've found carefully and if they refuse to listen and just like put up an impenetrable wall, then you shut the hell up and go find someone else to talk to. You know, that's the doctrine behind norb casting pearls before swine. There's, there's a good rule, which is if you're not being listened to, then shut up because you're not where you think you are. There's something going on that you haven't put your finger on. You're not in the place that you think you're in. And so you could also turn from convincing to questioning, you know, if someone's very, very set in their views, instead of opposing them, you can ask them to elucidate their views and you can use that questioning process. It's like a socratic dialogue to dig into their fundamental principles. And sometime that's a good way of opening up a space for dialogue. So

Speaker 3:          01:31:13       what do you make of the gnostic gospels, for example, the Gospel of Thomas? Well, I've read the Gospel of Thomas and I think it's a remarkable document. There are things in it that are extraordinarily powerful. Uh, I closed maps of meaning, in fact, the book I wrote in Nineteen Ninety nine with a quotation from the gospel of Thomas, and it's really interesting too that the first person you go to, his hands on that Gospel was Carl Young, which I think is an amazing example of synchronicity, right? The first of the gnostic gospels that was released into the broader world ended up in Carl Jung's hands. Absolutely amazing historical fact. So they seem to be to be extraordinarily interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:31:56       Um,

Speaker 3:          01:31:57       and I read them, I suppose in some ways the same way that I read the Canonical Bible. I'm trying to extract out what wisdom there is in them or what wisdom I can understand anyways and utilize it to the degree that I can. So

Speaker 3:          01:32:13       in one of your videos, you mentioned about the power that creates order from chaos, but can also create chaos from pathological ordered. Can you expand and explaining the latter one? Well, the logo logos, that's the human capacity for consciousness and, and uh, and communication and awareness. And I think that it's, it's actually the, it's actually one of the fundamental prerequisites for being itself, right, which is one of the things that makes me different from a standard materialist I, I don't believe that there can be being without consciousness. And so I think of consciousness as a primary element of well of reality. It's irreducible element of reality, something like that, a prerequisite for reality. That's another way of thinking about. And that's the logo. So essentially, and it's respect for the logo. So I would say that's the deepest doctrine of the, of the biblical stories. Now, what is the logos do? Well, you can see this in Christ story most particularly. So Christ is often presented as a social revolutionary. All cast, I suppose, in the same mold as Moses, Moses, Moses opposed the Egyptian tyranny, like Christ opposed the tyranny of the Pharisees and the scribes.

Speaker 3:          01:33:31       And Moses produced tales as a consequence of opposing the tyranny, right? He first chaos was the crossing of the water and Moses was a master of water. And that's the same symbolically as being a master of chaos. But after he freed the Hebrews from the Egyptian tyranny, while they entered a period that was 40 years long, so the story goes of almost on almost complete chaos, right? Abandonment in a desert, tremendous moral confusion, lack of direction and purpose. And so sometimes the hero is the person who makes order out of chaos. But sometimes the hero is the person who makes intermediary chaos out of an order that's become too tyrannical. And so it's, it's best to think of the logo says the forest that keeps order and chaos in balance rather than transform rather than generating order out of chaos or chaos on the border because it did.

Speaker 3:          01:34:23       The logos operates to do one of those two things depending on the situation. And so it's frequently generating order out of chaos because there's plenty of chaos. But there's also plenty of tyranny, in which case the hero or the person who embodies the logos is, is, is struggling to destroy the tyrannical king and replace him with someone that's more, um, it's playing a more reciprocal and property negotiated game. So, all right, everyone, I'll answer like two more I would say. And then I have to stop because I'm getting fuzzy minded. So to what extent do you think your tips for young people clean your room, make a schedule, read great books are predicated on your own personality? Well, I think they're predicated on my personality to some degree. Um, I think that a lot of my conscientiousness such as it is, has been learned. I think I disciplined myself particularly in graduate school. So I don't think it was necessarily an intrinsic part of my personality. I think it's something that I learned to do because I felt that I had something that was worthwhile to do. So

Speaker 3:          01:35:39       it's very difficult to answer it beyond that because, you know, I am affected by my own personality obviously. Although I think that I give advice that's pretty balanced across all the dimensions, you know, like I think that you should be capable of speaking in public fluently and that you should be able to communicate with groups of people. I think that you should be able to be solitary and work on your own. So that covers extroversion and introversion. I think that working on control of negative emotion is important. Um, and so that's partly dealing with anxiety and stress and that's the neuroticism dimension. I think that you should be agreeable when it's necessary and disagreeable when it's necessary. And so that's a broadening alone. The agreeableness dimension. I think that discipline is really important in a complex society like ours. Discipline is extremely important and so I think that being able to be conscientious and reliable and orderly to some degree is necessary, but that you should be able to withdraw from that when necessary so that you can take a break and have some fun.

Speaker 3:          01:36:43       Um, I think you could risk becoming over committed to your work or two year endeavor. So I do think that that's something that I risk maybe I trained myself to be too industrious. It's certainly possible, um, openness. Well that might be a place where I have a personality predicated blind spot because I'm very, very high in openness and, but I do believe that there's utility in exposing yourself to the world of great ideas. And that's not for everyone, you know, I mean there are people who are fundamentally conservative in their orientation and more power to them I suppose. But um, if you're going to read then you should read great things and if you're interested in the life of the intellect, the philosophical life, then then there's much to be learned by reading great books. So. So I don't think that I'm overwhelmingly biased with regards to my own personality, but you never know. I mean, it's hard. It's hard for. It's hard for someone to judge that about themselves. So can one reason with a stalker. My Stalker is highly intelligent and rational. Making him scarier. I'm beginning to work with police and lawyers. But wondering if you have experienced in this realm, I would say

Speaker 3:          01:38:32       not knowing the specifics of your situation. No, you can't really reason with the stocker. The stocker is already gone beyond the realm of normal social behavior, you know, and I would say with most stockers, assuming that you're dealing with the genuine article, that they tend to be a little bit on the paranoid side or maybe a lot on the paranoid side. And the problem with people who are paranoid is that they have adopted a couple of axioms as absolutely fixed and there's no shifting them. So I would say, you know, I hate to give advice in a situation like that, but I wouldn't say that the probability of using reason is precluded by the fact of the stalking behavior. So good luck with it. That's very scary. It's hard. It's hard for people to be protected from someone who's intent on following them and perhaps making their life miserable. So

Speaker 3:          01:39:35       insights on how I would overcome or live with my fear of Nellis and disappointment in Matt, Mike, the novel. Well, here's something that you might consider. So when you're a child and you're naive, then you trust people because you're naive and you don't know any better and you don't know that people can hurt you unless you're a very unfortunate child. So your, your trust isn't a virtue. It's just a sign of your innocence, let's say. And that kind of innocence isn't a virtue, it's just lack of experience. But when you're older, Mike, courage or trust isn't, is a hallmark of courage. You extend your hand to people and you extend your trust to people knowing full well that you can be bit like you might be bitten by a Cobra, you can be betrayed and disappointed by people, but you extend your hand in trust because of courage, because you decide to take the risk and by taking that risk, you open the door to the best in people and, but you won't see that door open unless you first take the step to trust. And so I would say you have to practice trusting people. You know, you have to share things that are somewhat private. You have to ask people for small favors and trade small favors and you have to that knowing full well that you can get hurt. So think about it as an act of courage instead of, um, instead of naivety or,

Speaker 4:          01:41:02       or, or, or, or, or,

Speaker 3:          01:41:06       well, instead of naive t, let's leave it at that. So that's what I would recommend.

Speaker 3:          01:41:13       All right everyone, I'm going to stop. So once again, thank you very much for listening to me tonight. I hope that it went well. Um, I can never tell when I'm doing this, but they seem to be popular. I'm very pleased that you all spend so much time putting these questions together and, and watching my videos and listening to me, I, I'm genuinely and continually amazed and grateful about that. So, um, I hope you all have a good month and that you continue working as hard as you can on putting yourself together because the more together people there are, the better things are going to go for everyone. And it's very important, as I pointed out before, that you get your individual life in order. So good night everyone and uh, keep up the good work man. See Ya.
