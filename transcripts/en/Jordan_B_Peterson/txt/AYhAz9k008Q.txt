Speaker 1:          00:00:31       That's fine. I'm not going to hear about psychology as a career, a career for nine to five job where if someone else tells you what to do, and usually it's fairly similar to that is that someone else tells you what to do because if someone else is telling you what to do, then you don't have to figure it out. And if you work from nine to five at five, you're done. If you have a career, then you're never doubt. So one of the things that I want to give some consideration to when you were fighting for here is how we learn to tolerate never being done. I think I went to graduate school in 1985 and I think the first time I was caught out might be this year, but maybe it happened five years ago once or twice to talk to me 30 years to catch up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       So I was behind for 30 years. And that's um, it's hard on your nerves, so you have to accustom yourself to the fact of the matter how much you work, you're not enough. And maybe you're starting to accustom yourself to that in the universe. But the thing about university that's different from the rest of your life is that although you already are facing facing problem with that, there's way more to learn and you're ever going to be able to manage the won't be first and then you're responsible to at the moment is fundamentally apart from your parents to some limited degree is yourself. Whereas once you start developing your career, you're going to be responsible for a larger and larger and larger number of people. And some of them will depend on you for four actions that well if you're a clinical psychologist sometimes that their lives depend on, so your responsibility level continues to decline as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       That's a really good thing. People and the fate, that responsibilities of a burden, but, and I suppose that's true, but what the realize is that human beings are like sled dogs are pack mules were not happy generally seeking and the lettuce, unless we're shouldering the burden of carrying the load, I guess as part of being a social animal. So it's actually good. You have the opportunity to shoulder responsibility because it helps you tolerate and living with yourself. You have to be worth something in order to really tolerate the conditions of your existence. And so you've got to pick up something heavy and carry it because then that helps you develop some respect for yourself and also for the table and that's a big deal that's worth more than anything that you, anything else that will possibly be able to point. Now, how many of you are you in your first year?

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       Put up your hand from seat because I need to know what I'm talking second, third and fourth year. Most of you were in third and fourth year are so, so you're thinking pretty hard about what to do so well we'll start with the course supports your students for those that you want to apply it in. Graduate School, which is of course I suppose what you're going to do. Most of you, if you want to pursue psychology as a career, better have a's as if you don't have aids. It's going to be rough. It might be rough even if you do have a's, but it's unbelievably competitive, especially in clinical psychology and it's increasingly the case. And this isn't such good news for those of you in your third and fourth and your fifth admissions committees in universities are starting to look before your last two years.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       They're really only supposed to look at your last two years because everyone knows that the students, it's reasonable to allow incoming university students or a year or two the scream their heads on straight before you start determining whether their performance is actually an indication of their ability. So generally drives the committees are only supposed to look at the last two years, but it's getting competitive enough so that they're looking farther back. Anyways, clinical psychology requires aids. Um, and then of course all you have to take your driving record exam. Um, there's two of them. There's the standard grocery gripping examiners, the psychology specialty, drag aggression. Most many universities don't want required a psychology graduate record exam. I would strongly remember, I would strongly recommend that all of you take it, it's your friend. If you're a psychology student from the University of Toronto and have done reasonably well, the prob nick probability is high, but just ace it because it tests knowledge that you've acquired as a psychology student.

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       Whereas the gre, the general gre tests, more general knowledge, including mathematics or arithmetic and mathematical knowledge, and that's not as easy to acquire. But about site students at ut asis psychology garage was record exam fairly frequently. So even if the university or universities that you were applying to don't require it, you might as well take it and send it to them. Because if you have a stellar 97th percentile, then you know why don't want to include the information in your package. So if you score less than 80th percentile on the verbal portion of the General Gre, I would strongly recommend that you don't consider a psychology as a career because it's unbelievably writing intensive. And it'll go the into the variety into the ground. Some people are pretty smart mathematically and analytically, so when they write the gre, they do well, they do better on the nonverbal parts.

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       And I've had students like that who were really powerful intellectually, but more non verbally God, deeper, greatest statistics, and they can be really good analytical thinkers about the writing just killed them. You have to run all the time as an academic psychologist and you have to be very verbal as a clinical psychologist. And so if you're not up and up, I would say top 50 percentile of the people who are taking the Gres, it's going to be a real variety for you. You should think about that very seriously because it's the writing is the most difficult part of psychology as an academic career. And if you're not a fluid writer, you're going to have one miserable prime. You're going to drag your way through graduate school and you're not going to be productive because writing ability actually determines research productivity more than anything else. And if you're not productive, you won't do well on the job market.

Speaker 1:          00:08:30       And so it's to something else. There's no sense sending yourself off for, you know, a six year Brian and then a dismal outcomes. So students who aren't as, who are more intellectually powerful on the nonverbals sections of the gre are often pretty good at designing experiments and they can often learn how to analyze the data too. And that's great. Let's pause his graduate students to stumble this writing up the papers. And so I often have students too who baby, you know, completed 10 or 11 studies, which is not planting to finish their darker, didn't publish, you know, uh, several papers but they just cannot break them up. And so then they language because no one else is going to do it. So if you're, if you're verbally oriented, that's a good thing.

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       Don't be thinking that you get to pick where you're going to graduate school because you don't, and if you think that you get to pick where you're going to graduate school, unless you're a straight 4.0 students with 99% of the Uris, then you're setting yourself up for disappointment because it's so competitive that what you do is you apply to every bloody place. Love half a chance of getting into including prices. But you think you'd ever go? I think lake had, for example, has a clinical program now I've got nothing against weight yet, by the way. And a small universities have real advantages sometimes because you're, you're less anonymous at small universities, but you might think, oh, I'd never go late as well. And you might be also thinking then they will never go to the clinical graduate school because that could easily be the only place that you'll get in.

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       So what you do, especially if you want to go to clinical graduate school, is you apply every single place that you can in Korea. Whether you think you build, they're not can always say no if they accept you. But if it's one, you know, maybe maybe it'll turn out at one place accepts you and that's a place he didn't think you want to go. Well there's a big difference between being in clinical graduates who are not using it. It's the difference between zero and one. And so if you go off to lakehead and you come up with a clinical phd and you're a clinical psychologist, so who the hell cares if you have to spend five years, you know in somewhere that isn't a trend in urban setting, you're going to be sitting in a box most of the time anyway. It's made out of cinder blocks doing your experiments and most of your life fill fee, the social life of graduate students anyway, so it's not like you're going to be missing anything.

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       One of the things you might want to do if you're fortunate enough to get accepted and you're not sure where they would want to go, just to go talk to whoever's going to be your supervisor because more than anything else you ever do in your life. I would say if you go to Raji school, you're an apprentice to a supervisor, you're not a member of it department. So your relationship with your supervisor basically determines whether graduate school works for you or not. So you want to find out ahead of the time if possible, whether the person who wants to work with you as someone who then who is it, who you're, who you think you can get along with. What they're working on is less critical I think because it's not if you know what you want to do research or you might think you do but you don't know enough to, so I would also strongly suggest that when you write your applications for graduate school, you make the person tell people who you're writing to, who you are, but don't specify a research interest too closely because hardly anyone is doing half research.

Speaker 1:          00:12:12       And why give people an excuse not to take you. You're looking for an excuse not to take you 81 so if I'm looking for graduate students, I have a staff of a hundred applications or maybe 150 I get rid of 75 of those so fast that they might've, well, might as well have not even apply. They're just gone. Usually what I do is I make a spreadsheet. I put in grades and the gre scores and I called the lenders have breakfast and I some across the rank order them, I knock off the bar and everyone else does that too. Even though they might not do it in such a quantitative way, they should because that's the most efficient and accurate way of doing it. But everyone else looks at that pile of resumes. It's more to do the same thing. So,

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       so you're already 50% of the people who applied, they weren't going to get in it like anyways, that's already cop caught. He don't want off of this type of statement of interest. It says, well I just want to, you know, look at the left hemisphere where hey, you have specialization for second language learners who are children, but there's probably one person in North America studying. And so anyone else who might be interested in your application because of your qualifications could still look at that and say, well he didn't want to work with me. And then you're out deal. You can say what you work on or be interested in, but what you should do. And I'm not asking you to falsify your letter if at 10 because that's foolish. But what I would take you to consider is that you don't know that much about psychology and

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       why did you do it? When did you specialize as a graduate student is you started to go, it's in a sexy, narrow as you start off with without a lot of knowledge about one specific topic as you narrowed, it comes a time when you start to broaden out again cause you get into the seal talking deeply enough. So you started acting starting to tech, you start to have to consider the contextual issues that surround that coffee. So for example, if you are a saint richards neuroscience, but you ended up studying language development as well. At some point you're going to run into the brain, right? Because language development depends on, so psychology and since it's an amorphous feel and there's an entry points, all the entry points are narrow. But once you pass through the narrow your point, you're in the field. So it doesn't matter that much specifically what you'd be doing your work on for your master's degree in particular, cause you don't do enough to specify that at all.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       And you'll be, if you're fortunate, your supervisor will basically tell him what to do for your master's degree. It always takes a year, right? Well it takes you two months just to clue in when you first started a new program and then you're already a quarter of the way through the first semester somebody hurting us. That pretty much has to hand you a project and you have to walk through it. And so what it's about is important as the fact that it's at hand and you've done it. I'm not saying this well, but what you're interested in doesn't matter. It matters an awful lot, but you don't want to prematurely and narrow. We specify you're building an interest when what you're relying on is information that's not all that reliable and you're not an expert enough in psychology where it needs to make that have determined the decision about what it is that you're going to study.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       I didn't have enough 70 all sorts of things I never thought I would study. Things I didn't think were were studying that turned out to be wrong. We were plenty. We're studying an intern up to the necessary. So um, learn your bloody stats. You should be a wizard with spss or some others, some of the computer program. From an economic perspective, there's nothing that you'll learn as a psychology graduate students that's more valuable than statistics. If you use statistics, the all sorts of things open up to you don't know the experimental work and you have to be a statistical expert really could be a good scientist. But Cross disciplinary collaboration because most other social sciences stoke half here, this statistical expertise that psychologists do consulting for businesses. There's, there's all sorts of value in doing statistics and understanding. So for those of you who are in your earlier years, don't shy away from statistics, especially the more practical end of it, which would be the computer, you know, the pc or Mac programs.

Speaker 1:          00:16:37       I wouldn't say pc, generally pc programs that enable you to do statistics. You should get good at that part in someone who will teach you how to do statistics. Statistics is actually extremely interesting once you start looking at your own data because it's a lot more and I mean that technically at all. If you pull a slot machines arm, there isn't much of a chance that you're going to get a good outcome. But for some channels and so it's exciting. A off is variable reinforcement and research is like that and statistics are exactly like that because maybe you've spent six months putting together a data set and you are raising the variables to ask ess statistical machine so to speak and you both handle it. Now you just learned ways or you wasted your drive for six months or you hit the Jackpot. So it's actually pretty exciting.

Speaker 1:          00:17:24       It's different when you're doing in class or working on someone else's data set because what they know you care, but when you've got, when you've got something in the game, it's an entirely different process. Should also tell you that statistics is not arithmetic and it's not. Mathematics is more like surgery and it's a moral endeavor, which is funny. You wouldn't think that was one statistic, but it is a moral endeavor because there aren't any real rules for doing. A data is an amorphous and vague entity and there might be information in it and your job is to carve off the garbage and to keep down, to pull up the information that reporters doesn't require. The automatic application of a set of statistical rules that just won't work at all. Your job is to figure out where the truth is embedded in this messy thing that you just produced, this vertical study because most studies, they're complete disasters you've never been or how to do that, right until you've already done it and so there are, there are mass and whether or not you're going to be able to pull something on that mastic constitutes genuine information.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       Depends on how skillful you aren't using the statistical tools and how carefully you make your decisions ethically while you were, you're attacking the data. Because for example, there would be a pretty damn highly motivated to come out with something where p is less than 0.05 right? Because otherwise it's not technically publishable even though that's a rather foolish criteria. But that's still the point. So if you put six months in the study and you know you have to decide where the outliers are and where the masses who to throw out concentrate on, there's the little career day, we'll let the doctor, your mind is going to be pushing pretty hard in the direction of money with the data in a way it makes what you want to come out of it. And you can bet that 40% of published studies, cited studies at least are absolutely no utility whatsoever because the way they were produced was biased by the fact that the person growth of wanting to publish the study.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       And so that's a terrible thing because it works the whole feel, but it's even worse if you have to be the person that's doing it because you know, fool yourself yourself into discovering something that isn't there, then you will convince yourself that it is there. Then just spend the next 15 years chasing something that doesn't exist and trying to prove to yourself and others that it's real. And that accounts for a big chunk of what passes for psychology and researches. It's a standard in some ways and the journals are changing the way they accept papers right now because this happens so frequently. So one of the way things want to do if you want to be paid an academic psychologist, but you want to be a scientist as a careers, you benefit your, your, your, your, you have to decide what it is that you're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       And what I'm saying that you might be doing is building a career which is a social enterprise. It's a proud name, dominance hierarchy into for us and it, it means that what you're focusing on is climbing up a private, a dominance hierarchy. That's not the same thing, is trying to pursue truth insights. Those are completely different things. If you pursue the truth in science, you might also January and career. If you generate a career, you might also pursue truth and science, but the probability is relatively low. Now, I would suggest that you pursue truth in science. And the reason for that is, well, first of all, you won't get corrupt and second, if you corrupt other people, but perhaps more importantly, from an existential perspective, 20 years down the road, you won't look back at your life and be disgusted by the whole thing and sinful and not even to teach or to talk to students or to be a good graduate advisor because you're sick and tired of the whole business. So, and that's exactly what happens to people who could do things in a crop. Man, I think it's cynical. And why did it go? It shouldn't be cynical because they're the sorts of people that you should be cynical about. So the other thing you should decide to, if you want to pursue experimental psychology as a career, duly you actually care about scientific truth. Does that matter to you? If the answer is no, I would say go into business.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       There's nothing wrong with going into business. I've got in, this is important. It's not easy, but if you want, if what you're after is this sort of status that comes along with a business career, don't get hit. Again, going to have to be, yeah, you might as well just go into business and do that. You're not going to make much money as it as an experimental psychologist. So if you're after status and the sort of status that comes along business and it sort of productivity and social relations that come along with fitness, just go into business. Don't, don't do it. Don't sidetrack yourself off into something that's in a sense of more in pursuit. So, okay, so do your stats and get good at it. And you know, you might be resentful about having to do it because a lot of people who are sort of oriented towards the humanistic psychology are pretty irritated folks, statistics.

Speaker 1:          00:22:25       So I was certainly one of those people because it didn't come naturally. But if you can't have to get a tutor and hit age and take more stats courses, then you think you need because you'll need them. So, and if you go onto graduate school and you're sort of crippled in terms of your ability to approach statistics, you'll pay the price for it. We'll get an understanding of papers, we'll go do your own analysis. Stab me. Okay. So I everywhere, I mean, you might say, well, I can't afford to apply everywhere because each application is under $50 riding on this. What is it now? $100 $150 that's silly. That's not a cost. It's an investment. And you need to distinguish between costs and investments. And if you get in, what are you thinking? What are you think of? Experiment a phd is worth, let's say you get an afternoon last work. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:23:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       Cool. Is it 100,000 for females? The doors? What do you think his work?

Speaker 2:          00:23:33       Pardon?

Speaker 1:          00:23:34       Ballpark.

Speaker 2:          00:23:36       Saturday.

Speaker 1:          00:23:38       Okay. That's good for how many years

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       maybe? Yeah. Okay, so that's hundred freaking on the doors, right? What's your tension word? Were other two and you were undressed to be, you underestimate the salary in the latter part of their career. So it was probably 7 million doors. Okay, so now you know what you're, you're in that, you get that APP, you get that acceptance letter in the mail, it's worth 7 million doors if you play it right. And if you're a clinical psychologist is probably worth twice that. So you're after a $14 million price, you ask, well why is it so competitive while now? You know? That's why it's so competitive. Lots of people would like to have $14 million. So it's hard to get it. So, so then if you're applying and it's $100 $150 let's say you've got a one in 10 chance or one in 20 chance of getting in and any given school. So let's see, what would you pay for a one in 20 chance of $14 million?

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       How would you calculate that? Right? 14 million divided by 20 so you pay about $700,000 something like that. So you pay $700,000 not a hundred so let's have that because you were skeptical about your chances of winning. Fine. So then you paid $350,000 well don't Balk at 200 it's a bargain. And don't get too irritated about the application process. It's annoying. They're trying to annoy you because if you get annoyed and quit, then they won't have to look. You've got an application and that's the end of you. So take a big amount of time, do your application because they're really important and do lots of many is the APP. If you can afford, you think about points, bdos throw some applications down there. That's especially true if you're a hot student and you're a hot student. If you've got a basically an a average and the gre of 90 percentile or above, people will be interested in you.

Speaker 1:          00:25:44       And that means it might get a scholarship to the American school or do you want to pay the tuition? So, and that might especially be the case. You don't. Maybe you want me to go back with you at Harvard, although little at night, but there's lots of state schools down there that are excellent. The big research schools, and maybe they'll paint it from down and study. So not only do you get your crap, 70 million or $14 million, but someone will give you some money to help you get it. So that's a pretty good deal. So don't lays out all over the bloody applications. It's really important.

Speaker 1:          00:26:17       All right, so now local back to more general things for a minute. So now we might want to talk about what makes people successful. Okay. And do you want also think about what success means, right? And what success means. I can give you a couple of rules of thumb of both. Dot. I mean, the first thing is if you want to be successful, let's, let's put that, let's use a different phrase. So we could say, well, let's say you want to have a good life. And I don't mean good in that it's happy and easy or any of those things I need sorta hood classic. If you want to have a platonic need. Good life. Okay, so how would one go about doing that? Well, the first thing I would say is do what other people do unless you have a really good reason not to. So what people, what human beings do, they have a good life. They have friends, they have a circle of friends, some of whom they can talk to.

Speaker 1:          00:27:16       Careful. You help the important things. So you need that. People have an intimate relationship with someone that is stable across time. Why? Well without that you're kind of chaotic and loss and plus new when we have half your brain because people are pair bonding animals and we're kind of communicative and if you have a partner that you can trust who's got your back that you can talk to and planning with, then you're twice as wise as the person that you're competing because it's just like, you know, why is there sexual reproduction instead of coal, coal, reproduction. Why is that you, you guys are taking biology courses. It's pretty fundamental question. What's the answer to that? Variations. That was part of it though, right? Yeah. I mean,

Speaker 1:          00:28:10       as a unit, you called yourself first of all the parasites to get again in no time flat. But apart from that, do you have a bunch of straight on to weaknesses and they're kind of random and then you'll pair up with someone that has to match the strengths and weaknesses. And Eric, you ran it and hopefully when you pair up, most of the places you're weak, that person will be strong and vice versa. So that makes you a much more, I'm more, it's more properly solidified unit. Sometimes a weakness is a match and that's where you will fight nonstop. And so you know, we'll have to be a promise. You're a lot better off with somebody. And that's especially true if you also want to have children. And if you're foolish enough to have children, I don't know you guys, most of the women in your most, you'd be under 25 so there's probably a fair number of people who think you're not going to have children.

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       Must have plenty of, I'll dispense with that foolish idea right now because all that means is that you just have your, you'd be more, that's one thing. It means, and second it means you don't know who the hell you are because my experience is feeding it virtually. I think this is virtually without exception. Every woman I'd ever met, whether they thought they wanted children at the age of 21 or 22 or 23 or 24 if they were basically mentally healthy, they were desperate for children by the time you were 30 and that kicks in about 28 and so expect it because it's going to happen and you might think, well, I know it's, it's not going to happen to me. Well, you can take that if you want, but I'm basically what I'm telling you. One, my work, I've done a lot of work with really high achieving.

Speaker 1:          00:29:44       Most of these were female partners. Senior partners is being offered and being a senior partner of a big law firm. That's as hard as being a successful clinical psychologist and you have to be at the top of your class as an undergraduate. Then you have to get into a really good law school and you have to be really good at that law school and you have to go off an article and you have to be kept as an article in student and generally you're not because the loss big law firms, you know, pulling Arctic new students, working with deaf and throw away all the ones that don't make it, so you make it well then you get to the associate and then they'll get it to bolster those two and then if you're really good at it, you'll be a senior partner and so that's tough and mode and make your email and you've done that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       Your blood will committed to your career. It doesn't matter. By the time you hit 28 to 30 and you're working 70 hours a week, you're going to be thinking, what the hell am I working? 70 hours a week four which is reviewed by the way. Good question and you're, your attention is going to turn happy children as it should and the way you solve that. If you're a female and you want a career as a, you have a partner who's got clue and can provide some support and be you outsource most of your domestic, most of the domestic responsibilities that go along with the household. Yap, Yap Anatomy. Maybe have to have a cook. You don't do any housework. She pay attention to your kids with a little bit of time that you have and that would work. Daycare care doesn't work. You're bloody law firm isn't going to take care of your children that are not going to set up the paid care in your firm.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       That does work anyways, but a nanny will work. And so you might as well be thinking things along that line because if you want to have a career and you're smart and you're hardworking and you showed how the career as you want to have children, then you have to set your life so that you can do those two difficult things without dragging yourself stark raving, mad or exhausting yourself or destroying your relationship. And that's about the only way that I've seen so far that it's possible to do that. Okay, so anyone's back to the back to career. Okay, so now we've already established that what you're after is worth a lot and it's hard to get and it's hard to get cause it's worth a lot and there's lots of people chasing it. Now the question is, what can you do to give yourself an edge?

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       Okay, well, what makes skew good perception from a career perspective? Well, one is I you, well, you're pretty much stuck with what you've got. You can maintain it by exercising. It turns out physical exercise is the best way you maintain your and thousands across time. It starts to plummet pretty precipitously after your voting did 24 and it's downhill the 70 and then we'll after that, things get worse. So you keep yourself in good physical condition that's going to make a big difference. I would also say if you want to play a sharp gauge, so if you're going to be on the edge of things competing with people who are in say in the top 1% top, you better get your drug and alcohol and you send control because that compromise you. You better make sure that you're sleeping as well regulated and you'd better make sure that you eat proper.

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       And those are there. They're not small and it's their big things cause you do the mammary day. And so I would say you can start to look at yourself now get up at the same time everyday. Start learning how to do that. I would say get up to eight or seven 30 because that's when civilized people get up and the people you're competing with from, you're really good. They're all already up at six and they're working by seven and they'll work you right into the ground because the people who are at the top and their discipline, and that's basically what you're talking about. If you're talking about doing something that requires phd level education as a career, they're not popping around. Okay. So here's the question. Think about this for a minute. So think about your typical day. Now think about this. How much time do you waste? And so you've been defined based any way you want the weight to define it. But I would say time is wasted. When is that what you plan to keep you? Right? You know what it feels like to waste time. You feel like a moron, right? It's, I didn't know it was a feeling that really for me it's like a feeling like that needs to take a shower. It's, I deviated from the appropriate path. I mean, you know, Youtube, the hail, some [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       That's not the good. Okay, so now you thought about that typical day. How much time do you waste? All right, so let's find out, um, how many people waste more than half an hour?

Speaker 3:          00:34:21       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       Is there anybody here who thinks they don't waste half an hour? Okay. And if you do take that, please do tell you, cause you know, maybe you're efficient. Some people learn to be efficient. Okay. How many ways? Two O's. All right. How bout, how bout three? Okay, how many think they waste less than three hours? Okay. One person. Okay, I'll come back to you. Four hours. Five hours. Jesus, you better wake up people. Let's say five hours. I won't embarrass you further.

Speaker 3:          00:35:04       What's your time?

Speaker 1:          00:35:08       No Matt, let's come on. Let's make him money that's told to use to, to, to evaluate. Value your time. No. Why is that wrong? That's minimum wage. No, no, no. We're going to have, we're going to play a capitalist here. It's normally valuable. I'm not going to pay you again for the amount of money to do it. Okay, so, so we're just, we're just talking about economic belt. That's all she has to be quantified. We're going to quantify, okay. It's not tended the port. Why? Because he have a future Janet quarters. What you're worth. If you're tired, if what you do, how is it contributing to who you're going to be in the future. So it's more than that. How much is,

Speaker 1:          00:35:58       okay? Well, let's look into this way. Let's say you managed your career goals in his head, you feeling then you're making the amount of money you should be paying. So we've got a whole, I'm here a lot back in the seventy five thousand seventy five thousand dollars a year. So that's about $6,000 a month or about 1500 bucks a week. And so we'll assume 40 hours, that's about $45 an hour. Okay, let's assume that you're worth 35 you can, if you're slow Haiti, you're, you're not worth that. But, but the time that you spend it now isn't invested, right? So even though you might not be, he paid for it this second, your banking one in sports. So we paid for later. So you can't be fake and it's 10 bucks. So we'll say we'll say 40 because it makes the math easier. So how much time you're wasting a day, five hours fast switch partners for it. 200 times 5,000 multiply it by seven because after all, we're wasting time on the weekends too. So that's 1400 week. How many weeks in a month? Four. What's four times 1400

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       5,600 so we'll say hi, this same argument, 5,000 a month. How many months in a year

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       you're wasting $60,000 a year, right? So maybe you should stop doing that. $60,000 and there are people that people, they give me competing with, they're going to be wasting my time. Or maybe you're going to be wasting $30,000 or 15,000 of it. But if you're wasting five hours a day, you better get your act together because you're going to pay for that. And the way is that foolish waste of time. Now Iq, there isn't much you can do about it. We already said that you could actually saw us and maybe you can read and you can read it as broadly as you possibly can until you should read every day. That would be helpful. And maybe you should read nonfiction, especially if you want to be a scientist, what maybe he couldn't work on to work hard. And one rule of thumb to that is how much time you waste.

Speaker 1:          00:38:04       Now you can do a little more in depth analysis and when you speak down, because I could also ask him, I assume he said, come and see me and they say, what else do you do it or you want the Scorps? If we said, well how much are you working on it? They said, well, I knew ivory six times today. And I think that's what I asked. I asked how much time you're spending working on because first of all, you should be in the library for six times a day. That's just insane. I don't know anyone at all except for a very small fraction of people who are extremely disciplined, well put together who could concentrate on difficult material for six hours in a row. You're lucky if you can manage three like real work. So the first thing you do is half of your time in the library and naming and double your discipline.

Speaker 1:          00:38:51       So, so let's say we could look at a typical hour that you're working and I might say, well, how hard are you working during that hour? You how hard you be working if someone pulled it out with a gun and said, look, if you don't work as hard as you can connect to around under to shoot, and then you might think, well, I'm not talking about one 10th as hard as I can [inaudible] actually that's a moat, right? I bet you that's about right. The reason I use that fingers, because I figured out a long time ago that if you have a given task to do and you sit for five or 10 minutes and you think Coppin, I do, this headline is faster. You can almost always figuring out how to do it 10 times faster and some kind of better and can kind of staff strep. And that's also something to really know because what you'll find as you mature in your career is that you'll be asked to do way more than is humanly possible.

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       And the way that you learn how to do that is you get way faster than you think you could be. And just using the 10 items, Margaret Little fountains, an excellent one, you, it's remarkable how much you can do in a very short period of time if you set yourself up with that expectation. So then when you remember what you're talking is worthwhile, then you might think about it. $40 it's an underestimated your time to actually work. One of them has to be physical. You're young again. So every hour that you have now, if you shape yourself, pays off through the old course of your life. You know a lot of what I do now, it wasn't a did when I was 20 but what you do now that you're 23 has been effecting when you're my age. So your time is actually worth more, even though you can't get any better, can pay for [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       So, so those might rethink what learning to do is to figure out how to get efficient. And you've got to be ruthless with yourself to be efficient and then to be efficient. Because if you were going to pursue a career efficient, people win and they don't just wait a little bit. I don't know. You know, you guys have probably learned that most things in life are normally distributed, right height. Well, you should have learned that if you're a psychology student and you haven't learned that, then there's really something wrong because that's like the basic, that's the basic premise of statistics. So of most statistics anyways, so all right, so you know, maybe the average span is five for 10 and then there's a standard deviation around that. If maybe, I know it's probably something like six inches and then 85% of men, 60 60%, 65% of men fall in that range. Okay. So and heights like that, weights like that. When intelligence is like that, most things are distributed according to the normal distribution, but lifeboat comes, they're distributed according to a frito distribution and that's a free of distribution. So, um, anybody know how much money Bill Gates House

Speaker 2:          00:41:47       about

Speaker 1:          00:41:49       or you don't get me out? So how much money did the top 10 richest man in the last half, 300 billion, something like that. So that's a thousand gallons for every single person in the United States. This is more than the average family hasn't savings. So the top 40 men in the United States have more money than all the rest of the Americans have put together and saying it's okay. So the talk hundred richest man in the world have more money than the bar and she would believe it, right? So this is a great distribution. It see the same thing with creative production. So let's say you're looking at Ph d students and you want to know how many publications they have. Well, the media now, there is one. The medium is the number that most people have for. It's not the means, it's if you cough up for typical phd student, do I have to call her and said publications can say one.

Speaker 1:          00:42:45       I say, well if you're not retired one cause one us, then it doesn't count. It's more than a zero, but it's only one more than zero. Okay. So then there's going to be the top 1% of the students way the hell over here and they're going to have 22% of the time they graduate, which is about as many as been typical associate professor has that tenure and north of the people you'll be competing on the job market. So they published the be in their phd for five years. You'll publish more papers a year and have promote and there'll be higher. And so just for the sake of comparison, the typical professor at a top rate research institution, according to North America polishes, it could be three to four papers a year. So the graduate students that are hot prospects on the job market, and that makes it likely that you'll get an academic job, although not certain are oh, producing technical associate and assistant professors at universities. And there's hardly any of these people and all of the science is done by these people, sort of the rest of them, they're just wanting to be, so all the people who aren't waiting on at that tail end, they're just keeping the institutions running. So what's the typical profit margin for a typical corporation year after year?

Speaker 2:          00:44:17       Awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:44:22       Well guess how much money do you get? How much interest do you get when you put your money in the bay? Matt? Do percentage. Okay, so obviously you've talked to you, what happened even with the 2% and no one would ever destined. Well, so it's gotta to be more than 2% okay, well it's around five, 5%. So I'm really efficient. Company runs on a 5% margin. That means it's been, is 95% of its fine just exist. Everything is that we'll stay stand mobile phones just existed. All of the power comes into how many of you put yourself in the coffin?

Speaker 2:          00:45:00       I'll let you guys sweat and go here.

Speaker 1:          00:45:45       Okay. So if you want to put yourself up at this end of the distribution,

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       you do it

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       well, I can give you an example. Differences in people's could.

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       Awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       Are you 65,000 pieces as far three 65 years. Okay. And the median number of pieces, parts for people produces zero, right? So that's a huge difference. But almost all of them. Fields of creative production. I'm like, almost everyone does nothing. And a few people do. Okay, so Bach Js, Bach, he wrote so much music. If you took all smeared districts and you just copied the 40 years and he was actually writing the music, not just popping up so people can get unbelievably productive and they're the ones who have to stomach premiers. Hey, so what do you need to do that wow can do much about your intelligence, but we can learn the word and work matters. Conscientiousness, it's just a trade is a big predictor of longterm life. Success and conscientious people are ordering, which isn't quite as relevant and industrious, industrious people. When they put their mind to something, they do it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:20       There's no wasting time. And the people I know who were really successful, and so they were up in the top one 10th of 1% which is only 1000 break. So you guys are already, he's probably one in a hundred if you look at your Iq and your work ethic. So one in 10 of you is one in a thousand or so. People like that. They don't waste any time. And I really mean that. Then they five minutes be productive, we'll be more than five minutes. And most people do that. And that's not an exaggeration because they've learned to be bloody efficiently, do not waste time. So they, how can I do things too fast? And they think, how can I do this one thing. So it does five things, similar pace. And also I kill five birds with one stone instead of two. And that way they maximal use of their current and they disciplined themselves and also the big rock in a cost of battle with themselves about doing what they should be doing.

Speaker 1:          00:48:19       They just bloody well do it. And that's why they can produce, they can produce at these levels reading almost beyond human imagination. So discipline really matters. So if you're wasting time and you want to pursue a different, most career, better learn how to get that under control. The best way to do that, as far as I can tell us, can pick something that's difficult. You know that, that, that you'd like to do. It's difficult. Something that's kind of beyond you and do it. Bang your head against him will probably that a couple of years of like really hard work to mold yourself into something that is utterly useless. And that's a, there's a big payoff associated with that and I think that's something you can do merely by warrantying it and attending to and that if you do that well, first of all, you get disciplined and that's really useful.

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       It's why it doesn't matter so much what you studied when you first go to graduate school. What really matters is that you started something and you really study at heart. Now when I went to graduate school, I went to Grad school and neal, we had a great time. I had a great social life. We be spent a lot of time going into restaurants and going to bars and play softball in a blacks. But all the people I went to graduate school with, they worked like 10 hours a day and they work like mad dogs. And so that was fine. When we're done their 10 hours, then they can go off and have fun with it. There was no lock in about during the work period and whether they were hung over or not, they go out and they enjoy their work. And so that's what you have learned to do and it makes your life more enjoyable and entertaining, not less.

Speaker 1:          00:49:58       I mean, if you really want to waste five hours a day, I just wanted to 30 or wasting time. If you live 90 years, he wasted 30 years and if you waste 30 years you'd be, and you wonder why you are attending Edwards slash come on. That's pretty easy to figure out if you always 30 years, you know? And why should because you're just wasting your time. So it's best to really learn how to stop doing that. It'd be a terrible battle, especially for those of you crossing, you lost. People are like, you really have to rewire it yourself and get that under control. So if you want to be successful at a high competition career and that's what happened.

Speaker 3:          00:50:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:40       Okay. I'm going to start from it and ask them questions and then I'll tell you a little bit about what options you have. If you choose psychology psychology's a career, what sort of things laying themselves open to so, so if you have any questions,

Speaker 3:          00:50:54       now's the time to as a pass from extracurricular activities per se, something outside of the career will help you get into Grad school there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:07       No for the Gres that slipped past. The rest of this law mean if you hit c. The thing is it's a multiple threshold cutoff system. So first of all, you have to get aids. If you don't, you're out. Then if you have a's, you have to have certain gre lows and if you don't, you're out give you have certain grades and certain gre was Dan. You're in vantage random factors that determine whether or not you're going to get shows, which is partly why you want to maximize your probability of success by applying to many any place. Because let's say that you're a threshold student. Okay, I'm going to look over your application. Well, what's going to determine when the right data do I need us to eat? Number one, do you want to have to find it? Do you have funding if you can get shirt or, or, or, or um, MRC funding as a graduate student, that helps a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       And if you're above threshold, can you sort of act two actual and then you got funding, it's really easy for a professor and say, yeah, you're not gonna eat up granite resources. So that's really helpful. So you can apply for Grad school, you have to still have the same level of attainment. Some extra curricular activities can help with that you have or don't have experience and you can write at a decent research proposal that increase the probability that you can get a fellowship. So laboratory experience and upstairs lobby sterns also helps when you get to Grad School, cause you know what the hell is her doing it. You can get a jump on it, but as long as you help them get in much. If I'm looking at two students who basically cross threshold the say way and one of them has extra lab experience and maybe know some computer program, you'd have some useful skills or it's good statistically, well men are all certainly prefer that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:01       But I won't even see the applications unless those first two things are matt and I promptly. And not even deciding that. Because usually what happens when you apply is said there's a committee of administrators that that was the first pass and they don't even let you through the your application through the door to see the professors unless you meet the minimum criteria. So you know, students desperate to give the extra experience that we get into graduate schools, like a publication you couldn't help but they're hard to get. So if you do a like an honors research project for example, and it works, you can write it up, but almost no one does that because by the time you're down, you're down project and you've written up your thesis, you're only one 10th the way to having it published. And that's something else to think about too. If you want to be an academic cycle,

Speaker 1:          00:53:53       everything ever do will be rejected. And not just the middle name, either your work for something once for six months we'll write your first research paper and you set it up, maybe not doing a very good journal and you'll get free reduced back. And they'll say, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen and you might as well quit. You know, and that's, and you'll get those letters throughout her whole career and you'll say, well this doesn't suck as much as it could. So to really work hard on it and use this part of yeah and he would dress these 30 concerns, then we'll be willing to look at it again. But don't get your hopes up. And that's when you go have, you know, a pint at the local bar because that's the best news you're going to hit this month. So that's another thing to think about too, when you're, when you're thinking about whether this tourney careers for you, because if you're rather high, you needed the motion, you're going to get punched in the stomach a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:54:48       And you've got to ask yourself whether or not you can learn to tolerate that. It's just, it's just a function of the, of the business because it's hard to get published, you know, the rejection rate to do the journalist's 95 to 99% which is worse than your application. You know, your chances of getting accepted to graduate school. So just looking for reasons not to promise your damn paper. And it can be, because there's a mistaken, I might give you guys, it's too good, you don't want, and it scares people and there were political reasons or whatever, but there's a lot of rejection and that's true for most of, so you have to get used to that. But in academia, I think in some ways it's works because you're always trying to publish in. The answer is always, we don't want your stupid paper. We've got $100 ones.

Speaker 3:          00:55:30       So I guess you could use research and teaching, um, uh, want to widen. The psychologist might choose to work faster rather than full time.

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       Well, okay, well, so one of the answers to that is why you would ever want to be a professor. Okay? So here's why you might want to be professor. One of the things you might watch at home yourself want to see when you're talking with other people does your, is your tendency to turn the conversation to ideas. That means you're open. That's a trait. Openness. If you tend to turn the conversation to ideas, then you're yearning. You're already, you're

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       old. That that's a good reason to be a professor. You don't know if your mom can you talk to your friends and want you use most of the time to talk about people are meaning what he did last night here. Those are fine. Those are cross probably needs more than you're extroverted or maybe you talk about relationships and that means more than that. You were agreeable. That's not really the kind of temperament that is suited for an intellectual pursuit because it's about ideas fundamentally. And then you also have to ask some, what would you like to teach? And teaching is teaching is brutal for people who don't want light. I mean, you know, you have professors like this, a standing in front of the board, they look down, they mumble, you're so bloody terrified at the students. They won't even look at them. And everyone there is like checking facebook.

Speaker 4:          00:57:11       It's all off. So you know, if you're, if you don't like to engage in audience, you're going to spend the most exhausting part of your career teaching because teaching, teaching writing is very exhausting. So there's three clinical work, but right up there it was teaching because I lectures of performance, it takes a tremendous amount of energy and who has to do with my role pins and it's boring. But otherwise it's like spontaneous jazz for 90 minutes. It's very tiring. And when I teach three courses in the spring, I'm just flooded by mark and I got a lot of energy. So you, you also have to decide if you want that and then you'd have to just start. Do you like mentoring students? Graduate Students. So I read it, I got training, I read it like I need a second. I really liked mentoring graduate students. So it would be university professors. Perfect for me. I got used to being rejected. The paper's being rejected. I learned how to deal with that in about three or four years. He used to just piss me off. I'd be naturally three months after or you don't have to get the envelope. I open it cause he know what it says. It says up here,

Speaker 4:          00:58:22       but you're learning off. Take that personally because it's not a person and just hate everybody. So if you learn to tolerate, that's good. Now you ask me why he would be a clinical psychologist as well as the professor. That depends to some degree on what kind of breadth of experience you were in corn towards. So

Speaker 2:          00:58:49       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:58:50       For me, life is better if I'm doing a lot of different things. And so being a clinician, I do, I'm a clinician, I do consulting with businesses. I'm a professor and I run a little testing company that evaluates employees. I have other, I am not been jobs. I think I have seven jobs. That's what I figured at one point it fluctuates between five and seven. And the reason I do that because I learned how to do flat out all the time, it turns out I'm kind of wired for that. So it's better for me. That's better. Um, I'm loved doing clinical work. It's sometimes people wonder too how you can do it because you say more people bring their problems to you all the time. Right. But it like that because social work is like that, I think. I think you're insane to be a social worker if they do with thinking about all the jobs that we'll just hammer you to death over a five year period that I'm teaching junior high school kids.

Speaker 4:          00:59:57       But see, the thing about being a clinical psychologist is the people who come to do you have problems. But they don't want to happen. That's why they're coming to see it when, so what you're doing isn't dealing with people who have promised. You're dealing with people who want you to get rid of their problems. And so the trajectory is up hill and it doesn't really matter how bad the curves situation because if there's hope in the future, right, because you're oriented toward the future. And so if you're working with your clients and they want to have better lives and you're helping them do that, that's it's a fine thing to do. It's a great thing to be able to do

Speaker 2:          01:00:37       pursue the professorships instead of full time clinician work because grab her, secure them that way.

Speaker 4:          01:00:47       It depends on the Grad program. So there's two kinds of, there's actually three kinds of clinical graduate programs, the graduate programs that are characteristic of large research institutions. So say like Miguel and Miguel is mostly a scientific institute institution with a side Bar of clinical training. And most research institutions are like that. And so most APA approved, that's how it used to be. Anyways, APA approved. American psychological association group of programs tend to be research oriented and they provide technical training. So what they expect of you if you're a student, there has to be a scientist and to be trained as a clinician. Now also Seidi programs, they're more common in the U s they'll charge about $40,000 a year annual training basically just as a clinician. And then there are clinical programs that are doing major research institutions but are still stealing public universities where most of the emphasis is on clinical training and classes on experimental work.

Speaker 4:          01:01:49       And they're usually not designed to Iran on geared out producing academics who could trade clinical psychologists, which is what the big research universities are for. And yeah, often when you go there, we deal, if you were a successful clinical student, he became a professor. It was the unsuccessful clinic as students who became a clinical psychologist and you know, you could say, well that's because that was all they can do. Now. That's a cynical way of looking at it. In some ways it's true because to be a professor, a research institute like the Ot and the clinical psychologist, you have to be able to be a scientist and, and, and to do everything that's associated with that. So it's, so it's, it's a good option if you can pull it off because you have all the stability that he was alone with my in there in university plus you have old undergraduates and you know, if you'd like them to graduates, if you don't like undergraduates here, you don't like people, you know, cause I mean undergraduate, they're all shiny and clean and you know, they're all happy about their futures and they're all probably going to be reasonably successful.

Speaker 4:          01:02:52       It cannot be able to undergraduates, you might as well go big old crime until you, because that's about as good as it gets among human beings, you know? So anyway, so if you're a professor, you get to stay in the happy meal. You and then, you know, I do my clinical work in my consulting work as well. So it's sort of like the best of both worlds. But there's a lot of, there's a lot of preparation that goes into doing all those things. So for example, you have to do, I think I had been 2000 hours of supervised practice when I came back to Ontario after I was in Massachusetts, even though I was licensed in Massachusetts. So there's, if it takes quite a bit of work to keep your, cause just after you get your clinical phd, you, you don't have a psychologist yet, you have to do another 2000 hours of supervised practice. And to do that as well as to do what you need to do in order to pursue an academic career means, you know, you're, you better be efficient. So other questions?

Speaker 2:          01:03:59       Yup.

Speaker 4:          01:03:59       Is that a good play everyone? Basically. Um, I've heard from a lot of people that you should look for supervisors who are working on areas that Uri and the cat straight a's in 98% do whatever you want. If you don't apply everywhere. And I would say even if you do apply everywhere, can almost say no. You know what a delightful deal you applied 40 places, let's say, or 30 places for it realistically. And four people give you an offer and you fly out there and they try to tell you how wonderful you are and try to get you to come in. You get to say no to three of them and pick the best one that's deal. So that's what you want to set yourself up. So, and you know if you, if you really know what you want, which is doubtful, but maybe you do because sometimes people do and you can specify who you'd like to work with and they're interested in. You can target it that carefully. Hey, more power to you. But that's very rare and for most people is, it's not a good strategy. Look, I've had lots of students

Speaker 4:          01:05:03       asking you about how to get into, well let's say specifically clinicals, graduate school, and I say applied in lots of places. Then they don't they, why do you wait for places and their threshold students and they don't get here? Well that's pretty rough. You know, they languished a year, sometimes

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       two years as they try again. Usually by the second year of not giving him, then they listen and apply. It's 30 places and then they get it and then they think juicing will fire them. That the first year I would have been, you know, waiting at the local bar for two years while I was trying to get into graduate school. So if if, if you're 100% credible and you've got the inside track, you know there's normal rules don't apply to you, then that's fine. But it's a numbers game. And with most things that are low profitability, the way you maximize your chances of success has to do with the law. As you know, if you have a one in 10 chance of getting into somewhere and you apply to 20 places, you know you're probably going to get into to. But if you play eight places, you might get unlucky and get it. They're not

Speaker 2:          01:06:09       so

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       not here, not at St George Scarborough, possibly they're working on, but it's hard to set up a clinical program. You need a lot of medical faculty and you need to be tied in with hospitals. It's a multi year process. So not this foreseeable future, but your classical clinical program, Ryerson hasn't been program.

Speaker 2:          01:06:29       No.

Speaker 1:          01:06:32       Is there a clinical program or noisy or counseling is plentiful. Yeah. Other questions? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:06:44       Change from advising students for quite a psychology,

Speaker 1:          01:06:49       it's easier to like if you're, it's easier to get into graduate school if it's not clinically. How does that mean? It's easy. It's still hard, but it's not an impossible like it is with clinical. Um, the problem with that is that although it's, you know, it's moderately difficult we'll say, or even extremely difficult to get him into an experimental program period. The problem is is that when the difficulty comes a little later, the difficulty then becomes getting a job because it's just as hard to get a job as a social psychologist as it is to get a job as any other, I mean an academic job as any other kinds of psychologists. So the entry barrier for graduate school is less at the entrance barrier into the job market might even be higher. So and so what you have to do is all you're doing and group, we've got it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:44       This is something to remember. You are not going to graduate school for the classes. What do you want to do is barely packs because otherwise you're working too much on the classes because the classes are useless there. You're not going to learn a damn thing and all they do is take you away from what you should be doing. And what you shouldn't be doing is publishing papers cause that's all that matters. If you publish it on papers, you'll get a job assuming that you know you're not flawed in some remark, obvious other way. So, so that you've got to remember that when you go to graduate school. So if you pass and graduate course you get a name. That's how graduate courses work. Anything other than the name is that failure. So there's a bunch of complicated reasons for that. To pass the graduate class, you'd have to do a decent job there.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       They're easier than undergraduate costs, but they don't matter. You have to pass them because if you don't know picky on the program, but if you passed them, it's irrelevant. No one cares. No one's ever going to look at your planning graduate transcript for grades except for maybe the grant. You know the, the fellowship granting agency, so that's the money exception, but if you pass the course, you get an a anyways. The reason you get a's if you passed the courses, because if you don't get a, let's say I give 30% of my graduate students these, then they don't get graduate fellowships because the graduate fellowship programs will only get a graduate fellowships to students who have aids. So the way the university is to to that is you get a's if you pass, otherwise you fail. So you have to work hard enough to get ready for the course to pass.

Speaker 1:          01:09:26       Have you done that? Then you have to work really hard to get your down publications zone because that's, that's what will be them, how hot a prospect you are when you graduate and you want to be in social psychology. Each year was going to be five or six strategies in North America. Everyone wants, so there the guys on the tail here and then there's everyone else and everyone else has a hell of a time. It was top five students or six students. They have their pick of jobs. That's where you want to be. And to do that you need to publish. The bar keeps going up because he gets, even though it's hard to publish because people tell, you know computers have made the process more straightforward, right? It's the journals are right at your fingertips. You don't have to spend a day looking for each journal like you did when I was a graduate student and then the journal wouldn't be there anyways cause you can get them instantly and you can do your stats on your lap car.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       Whereas I had to use a mainframe in 1985 and I tell you manage for that nate name for it. And I used a computer, you know anything about statistics. The manual was as long as this table was one book on metal rods, that law, so like to do an a Nova was a nightmare having just done so. So some of the barriers to publication number of followup, but the consequences of that as the talk students published form says learning easier. You just, you have to spend the exactly the same amount of times you would have before except now even though it's hard, but you're going to, you're going to need 10 to 12 publications and a couple of book chapters. Most of those should be first offer. You should be the first offer on five or six of those papers and two of them should be in picture and then you're set.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       But I'll tell you, hit that you better do you run it because it's, it's, it's not yet by and the students and the problem with graduate school, and this is something else to understand it, people will leave you alone in Grad school. And what that means is you can float around vacating for five years, graduate with one publication and disappeared. So it's dangerous graduate schools dangerous that way because no one would be on your case to make sure that you're one of the top students. So you have lots of freedom, but you are also ask yourself, you know, do you want for him and Ken and tolerate. So do you want, well people float drift if they have too much freedom, can you tolerate the questionnaires? Can you discipline yourself enough to be successful without someone? Basically, you know, I'm watching you a big hey you in the back of the hip.

Speaker 1:          01:12:05       And, and that's a tough question because it's not easy to become that future oriented and that discipline. So, so that's the social sector. The other thing I also mentioned about social psychologist, learn of your psychometrics, cause most of the social psychology is nonsense. And there's a reason for that. The reason is is that social psychologists don't do all this and that very well and they're starting to clamp down. Like all the journalists have adopted the new code of ethics for publications and reasonably done it because so much of what particular this polished and social psychology is simply not true. So learner, psychometrics, and third year statistics and that will redo your website and social psych. There's lots of things to be discovered in social psychology, but you have to be hard headed and not eat after your career.

Speaker 3:          01:12:57       So I don't necessarily make sense or missions.

Speaker 1:          01:13:13       How many good, what percentage of classes have you taken in the last few that were good?

Speaker 3:          01:13:19       Um, maybe.

Speaker 1:          01:13:25       Okay, so there you go. It's worse in graduate school. So 90% of the time in classes will be a waste. Do you want to learn to be a clinician? You could start now. We, Carl Rogers, we, Abraham, NASA, we, Carl Young reading Sigmund Freud. If there's lots of great clinicians, read them, read them. That'll help a lot

Speaker 3:          01:13:44       isn't that, doesn't that mean that the system is flawed? Because yes,

Speaker 1:          01:13:48       all systems are flawed. Most of them are like really flawed systems are murderers. If you're in a system and it's not stopping you to death, it's actually working. Not too bad.

Speaker 3:          01:13:57       If you were supposed to be smart, they are so wise. One,

Speaker 1:          01:14:05       well, I remember earlier in the lecture I thought we talk to you about businesses right? I said, business is run

Speaker 4:          01:14:11       on a 5% profit margin. That means they spin it. And that's an efficient business because most businesses fail. So really well run businesses produce 5% profit year after year. That means they spend 95% of their time just existed. And that's how systems work. System Spin, good system spend. Only 95% of their time existed. Bad system spend about 125% of their time existed, which means that not only do they not produce anything of any value, a sock resources from other things that are producing things about. And so really look, it's really important. I know you're skeptical about this, but that's because you don't know what you're talking about and you should listen to me. Most systems don't work and a lot of them are murderers. And so if you go off to graduate school, it's not appointing hard cause you're not this. No you're not. Yeah. Well that's what you, okay. Another question.

Speaker 2:          01:15:17       What would you recommend to take the gre?

Speaker 4:          01:15:26       Most people usually take it say in the summer before they start two o'clock and that's probably vote right because I wouldn't push it too close to when you applaud because it's just the application process is stressful and you probably would want to clutter that was up much. I would also say people do a lot of study for the gre. It's north at all. Do you want like the one thing you can study for is the psychology of Uri and the best way to do now sprawling breeding introductory textbook or two. But I wouldn't kill yourself spending for the dra because it's not going to help that much. So part of it because it's like the vocabulary that said if build up your vocabulary over rated to 25,000 hours of studying, add another hundred hours for that

Speaker 2:          01:16:19       strong. So

Speaker 4:          01:16:24       during the summer, maybe early fall and then you probably have to apply from November to January. So anyways, back to your question. If you want to, what do you have to do with the university? And this is what you have to do. Graduate School as well is what the institution does. Is it opens up the space of identity and the identity is you're a graduate student. Okay, what does that mean? Well, it means any number of things. It means you can language for five years if you want. But what it does mean is now you have a stamp of approval on your forehead. And so you sit around and read and learn things and you don't have to worry about whether or not you're useful because everyone has said by all of the possible measurement you appear to be useful. So that means you can get to have the luxury and educating yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:17:12       Now you can go off to the institution and 90% of the courses won't be worthwhile just like they are hammering institution. But some of them will be really worthwhile. And so your job is to discriminate between the things that are worthwhile. I'm the thing is the dark and to really focus on where you can get educated and there's lots of places to get educated. So, for example, you'll have your placements and you'll have clients and you'll learn I, that's an opportunity right there to learn because that would be the real thing. And you will need people who know what they're talking about and you want to stick to them like glue because they'll teach you fixed. But, and it's okay that systems don't work very well because they have to spend most of their time just existed because they're complicated things, you know? So the reason I use the business example is because businesses pay a big price for inefficiency.

Speaker 4:          01:18:04       They just do was dive into the ground and disappeared. And so if even a business can only manage 5% genuine productivity, that keeps you a rule of thumb against what she should judge institutions in general, it's hard to make something work. And when you look around the world, most countries don't work. Most governmental systems don't work and a lot of them get so out of control that they killed him. So what you hope for you hope you can get into somewhere that has possibility, opens up a space for you to do what you can do. If you're disciplined and ready to go up and that's good enough. And so the classes, moderate classes, they're not going to be worthwhile. That's okay. You put in as much effort as you need you to pass them and you pay attention to the things outside of that where you're actually learning.

Speaker 3:          01:18:51       Awesome.

Speaker 4:          01:18:54       Well it depends on the institution that you go to. Like if you go into a psy d program, which is just professional training, they won't care if you published. They're not trying to produce people who are scientists. The idea with the ADA programs is that you cannot be a good clinician unless you're a scientist and there's some real truth and that's what the issue is really hurt people. Thank you. Didn't mess up someone's memory. No trouble. If you're a foolish clinician, you can cause a lot of misery and grief because people especially confused in vain people, they'll open themselves up to you and you can that and whatever. Oh Kevin, biases and lack of clarity you bring to the situation has every possibility of making things worse for them. So, so the big research institutions, they want to train the thing

Speaker 3:          01:19:42       critically and

Speaker 4:          01:19:47       as a critical thinker is someone who's good at getting rid of what isn't necessary and keeping what is, you know, often when you think of critical thinking, you think of criticizing things. You know, this isn't good at that. If that isn't the point, the point is to say, well that's not as good as this, so I'll keep this is that it isn't as good as this. It's what you do when you the pain, you get rid of what's not perfect, keep the rest. And that's what you have to do when you go and get educated. As a graduate student, I would say if you want to be a clinician re the great clinicians, you'll learn more from them then then then from anyone else except your clients and with your clients. Best thing to do with them is listened to them. And this is something that Carl Rogers, that's one good reason to recall.

Speaker 4:          01:20:35       Well, one thing that will Carl Rogers is he really figured out her list and people love to be listened to because most people don't have anybody to talk to. And because they don't have anybody to talk to you, they can't organize their brands. Because the way people organize their brains is by talking. You say, well, I've got this problem and I don't know what do about it. So he said, well, what's, what's the problem? And they said, oh, it might be this, it might be that you might be this, maybe it's this reminds me of bath. And it's like they're laying out the situation on the table. So we say, okay, we keep telling me less laying the whole problem. And then they're afraid of that because they don't want to weigh in the whole problem. So you convinced them, it's okay, lay the whole problem, we'll worry about sorting it afterwards.

Speaker 4:          01:21:15       So they made the whole problem and then they look at it and you think, oh, well this isn't really the problem and neither is this and this isn't the problem with it. Neither is that this is the parole. And then it sorta cut down to size right off the bat when you might say, well, you know, what do you want to have happen? So I'm not sure what I want to have happen. So they lay all that out and then they push away what is it necessary. Now they have the problem. Now they'd have what they would like as a solution. And then you say, okay, well you know, what steps can we institute little stamps that you would actually do to transform this problem, you to this solution. And that's very entertaining. It's very useful for people. And so one of the things you can do right off the bat is a junior clinician is listen to the person.

Speaker 4:          01:22:00       And if you don't understand what you're saying, just ask them. Say, no I don't. I can get that. So I'm clear. Or maybe you say, you just said that, but 10 minutes ago you said this and they seem to be opposite. And I don't understand how those two things can both be true. And by doing it any walk them through the process, like your brain is organized at the highest level linguistically. And so if you walked through people through a process of carefully articulating their situation in order, this is the brain and you can do that as soon as a pretty junior clinicians as long as you're, as long as you're listening.

Speaker 2:          01:22:37       So yes. What would she say?

Speaker 4:          01:22:47       That's a good question. Um, well I think there's, there's two things you need to be motivated. Why do you need to have a clear conception of what your life could be like if it was really good. So I can say if you, and this is, oh by the way, here's an extra sentence you guys do. If you do this,

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       we'll help you with what you go to this website

Speaker 1:          01:23:17       and there's four exercises there. They're writing exercises and if you do, then I knew that I knew would be like three times as efficient as you are now. It's hard. One exercise I'll ask you, write an autobiography. And the other is another exercise, Alaska, to do some personality analysis to figure out what your faults are and how you overcome them. Another one, the last few to figure out what your virtues are, how you can capitalize on them. And then the last one asks you to figure out, here's wanted to ask you to do. Basically it says, here's, you've got to get yourself in the right state of mind. So here's the state of mind. Imagine that you were taking, you were charged with taking care of yourself. Okay? So now you're someone that you're supposed to take care of. I don't care what you think of yourself because people are [inaudible], you know you don't take care of himself very well.

Speaker 1:          01:24:07       Put that aside. We're going to assume you're going to take care of yourself. So you're going to figure out what would be best for you, not what you want or what would make you happy or any of those things. What would be best for him. So you need to have a vision of that. And you can ask yourself that three to five years ago I had the best life I could have. What would that be? Like? Loneliness or exercise kind of steps you through that and asks you to think about people you admire or you think about your friends and your family and your career and the way you structured your life day to day. And you try to meditate on what that would be like if it was off demised. Okay. And then, and then the exercise steps you through a process of clarifying that.

Speaker 1:          01:24:56       Okay, so now that's your little vision of habit. Okay, so now you've got that. You know what your life could be like if you were living at brock. Okay, now you need to do the opposite of that, which this program, why do we also asking everybody has a sense of how they can fall apart. All you do is look at how you already have fallen apart and then you multiply it out and you think of up with people that you see on the street or that you and you seen devastated marriages or who have terrible relationships with your family. And you think, okay, what would my life be like if I really let it fall apart? And if you meditate on that property, that should really scary and it's just hearing the deeply. So you should pick, there's no way I'm doing that. What ever happens, I'm not giving that. So then you've got your little happen and you've got your little hat and you know what the difference between, and then you can start to conceive of your day to day life in relationship to those two things. And you can decide which one you want. Does he do that proper?

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       I get hit. It's a DD process because if your life really gets out of control, not only you are you miserable beyond comprehension but still perfectly capable of making it worse, you're a little source of community pathobiology everywhere you go you make it worse. And that's how really that really is hell. And I would recommend that state. I would recommend that you stay as far away from here as you possibly can. So you need to know those extremes cause those are like the extremes of human existence. And you need to know that they exist and what they are for you. And then you can construe your existence in relationship to those two things. And that can help me feel motivated.

Speaker 2:          01:26:51       So

Speaker 4:          01:26:53       and in. So it's good to do it as a meditative process. Making meditatively is different than thinking in a directive way cause it's, so here's a meditative exercises. You can try this. This is a very useful exercise. So try this tomorrow morning. If you do this regular, you'll change your life and sees it. It's a simple thing to do. Technically sit on the edge of your bed when you wake up and ask yourself like you were asking a friend, not someone you knew well, but some of you, you have positive feelings towards you. You'd like for things to go well for this person. Ask yourself what you could do to make the day progressed in the best possible manner. So you ask yourself what you could do to do that. And then you ask yourself, what do you actually would? And you'll, you'll get an answer and the answer will drift up from the depths of your unconscious. You'll say, well, here's things that I've been avoided. I should have, you know, chip away at those are the event. And maybe I'd be this little thing without getting hosanna full about it. And then tonight my life would be one 10th of 1% better. Just very much to go to admission for someone who isn't very disciplined. But one 10th of 1% is the law. No one in a thousand days at one 10th of 1% if no compounding, it's a hundred percent better.

Speaker 2:          01:28:20       So

Speaker 4:          01:28:22       those things can be motivated. One of the things, one of the things I've learned from my own research, because I do a lot of research and you can tell Jerry, is because it was very interested in why people were motivated to do terrible things to other b. And the reason they're motivated to do terrible things is because they left their vice fall. And your life is hard, right? If your wife is basically tragic in its essence. And so life is a difficult word. And if you don't carry that burden property, it will make you resentful and that will make you cruel. And so if you don't want to be resentful and cruel, especially if you know what that means, then you'll do what you can put yourself together because you'd be a force for good rather than evil. That's a lot better. It's a lot better. There's almost no limit to how much people can suffer studying to see, which is also one of the reasons I really like the clinical psychologist. I mean being a clinical psychologist keeps you very much in touch with the actuality of people's lives and that's very unbelievably useful and it's so useful. Like I spend 2025 hours a week every week helping people walk through their most difficult problems. You can't imagine doing anything more possibly useful for informing you will come out to straighten out your own life.

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       So

Speaker 4:          01:29:52       it's worth doing it seriously. These are just oxes locally. We've been doing research with the sweep exercises. We used the first, the future offering on a group of students have Miguel Hooper academically struggling, academic probation, but there are still a smart, right, if you have to add behind the allocated to the gill, but they were failing. So we had to go through this program. We used to have balance control. It was a perfect experimental design. Um, we raised their grade point average 25% drop the drop out rate from 30% to zero. It's a massive change. Now we've been using the same program, the future part of this on a bit at a business school in, in broader now we've used it on two consecutive cohorts of 800 incoming students and we draw their drop rate from 50% to 30% and raised their grade point average 25% and I mean I've used the future authoring program regularly on, on people like know, and also apply it to, it'll change your life.

Speaker 4:          01:30:52       So people very seldom sit down. First of all, you have to think through who the hell you are, right? Where you come from, how did it shape you? And that's really useful thing to do if you're going to be a clinician, it's like psych when else, right? It kind of gives you a sense of who you are. And then you also have to take some time to think, well what do you want from your life? Like what sort of, what sort of features do you want to be cause human being. It's an amazing thing. You know, like we can be just the most wretched of creatures, murderous and corrupt beyond belief. But a person who has their act together is, I'm like a force of nature and that's a lot better. So you might think, well you want to be a force of nature, you know, cause you got the opportunity. You guys are smart, you're young. I imagine you're, you're healthy. And also you can at least manage university. It's like what the hell are you waiting for? Hammer yourself together and see what you can do. It's worth it. Make your life way better.

Speaker 2:          01:31:51       I'm

Speaker 4:          01:31:52       imagine that would be better. So if that's what you want,

Speaker 2:          01:31:58       no,

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       it's a good thing to do. So that's, that's, I don't know any other way that people would take it now. Sorry. I give a lot of agencies. As you step through your life, you will see that there are certain things that sort of call out to you. You don't have to grab your attention in voluntarily, and that's a very interesting thing because people think that there are sort of the masters of their own destiny. You know that you own you. People often will make that argument about suicide. For example, it's my body. I can do what I want with it. It's like, well, no. Neither of those things happen to be true and if you act it out and you'll pay for it, but the rent, there's reasons it's not true. It's not. Some arbitrary idea is that you're governed by forces that you don't understand, knows of the forces the psychoanalysts identify.

Speaker 4:          01:32:50       It's unconscious and unconscious forces are the things that make you interested in things because you can't control that. You know that if you're reading some blood boring paper, some other person might find that the most thrilling thing in the world. You can't even concentrate on it. You'd rather do the dishes or you're thinking about the girlfriend you hadn't grade age or or something, your mind wanders, he can't focus on this. You say, well I have to focus on because there's a testimonial. So like your unconscious mind, he doesn't care. It's like, no, we'll go back into the carpenter or or clean out underneath cleaning the dust bunnies out from underneath the bed, anything but read this paper and then there'll be another paper that's twice as difficult and you're compelled by it. We'll just stick to it like glue and if you'll remember it right away and you think, oh, why is that?

Speaker 4:          01:33:37       Why can, why is the one thing so easy for you to get other things so difficult and even worst whitehead in choose. That's a strange thing because you think, well if you were in control you just say, well I'm going to be interested in this paper and well good luck with that. And so it is new. Decided what we were interested with that. Then you go to ask yourself, what the hell is it? And when you start asking yourself that question, that's when you start to become a clinical psychologist because that's a hell of a question. So anyways, in terms of motivation, one of the things you can learn is to how is, how to follow those things that compel you. And you have to be careful when you're doing that because you also have to, you have to balance that with the certain degree of honesty because if you're dishonest and deceitful video, corrupt the workings of your neural mechanisms and then the light would be shining from places you don't want it to shrink from. So if you're going to pursue the things that compel you, which you can do, which I think is a very good thing to do, that's a quest by the way. You also have to straight yourself only ethically because otherwise you will end up taking some, some bad terms and you can get ridiculously motivated if you do that because you'll end up living in a world where everything is so interesting to you all the time that you can hardly stand and know

Speaker 3:          01:34:59       that's a good place to be. So, um, I was just wondering.

Speaker 4:          01:35:12       No, just some degree on what you do with it, but I think it's a good idea actually. You know, and if you could, if you could make use of the time and so you have to decide is do you have something to do with during that year is productive and that will further your development that will make you more mature. That would be the best thing.

Speaker 3:          01:35:34       Okay. If you want it to do,

Speaker 4:          01:35:50       no, no, no you don't. You remember it look like anybody you want to work with is going to be reasonably sensible because unless you want to work with someone who isn't and anybody who's reasonably since sensible is going to think, well you know, this person's young, they should go kick around a little bit. You know, maybe one of the problems with a place like the University of Toronto for example, is it Lord for the students here like at home for their home

Speaker 3:          01:36:12       undergraduate career. It's like, well that's not preparation for graduate school. You know? So

Speaker 4:          01:36:17       if it will foster your independence and make you more disciplined and broaden your experience, no one with any sense. It's been a look on that as anything positive.

Speaker 3:          01:36:37       Sorry, say that again.

Speaker 4:          01:36:43       Well, if you're going to go to medicine, medical school, you've probably pursue a career in psychiatry. Yeah. And the difference between a psychiatrist and a psychologist is that, well the psychiatrist is an MD psychiatrist can and does prescribe drugs. And there's nothing wrong with that, by the way, if you're a clinical psychologist and somebody comes to see you when they're like suicidally depressed, what do you tell them as well? You know, we're not gonna make a lot of progress and you kind of risks in the next two weeks. So you might want to think about taking some antidepressants so you've got no energy. Put your life back together.

Speaker 3:          01:37:15       All right? You don't want to be

Speaker 4:          01:37:19       dogmatic about any of these things. So, so drug therapies could be extremely useful. But generally if you, if you take the medical group, you become a psychiatrist, well you can't prescribe directly, but that doesn't really matter because you'll learn enough about pharmacotherapy in graduate school. So I've know what I need with my clients. I just write them a letter to take to there.

Speaker 3:          01:37:46       Generally the GP,

Speaker 4:          01:37:49       so you'll know you'll, you'll learn what the basic antidepressants are. Those will be drugs you use most often. Do you recommend most often because are they're blogging he affected or most conditions that involve excess negative emotion now and then somebody will need an antibiotic. If you're a clinical psychologist with a private practice that won't happen very often. So, um, medical schools a long haul. So if you're interested in primarily in working with people in a problem solving capacity, it could be the clinical psychology is a better choice. But you know, you might be medically oriented. Lots of people are medically oriented and if, if, if the more, if the more physiological element of care, Pos q and medical schools a good option. Some people do both. I'm going to talk about that. That's, but you know, some people do both.

Speaker 3:          01:38:52       It'd be focusing on,

Speaker 4:          01:38:53       you mean for first year of graduate school?

Speaker 4:          01:38:58       First year undergraduate. Well what you should really give it your first year as an undergraduate because you should, you should, you should take a wide variety of courses. You should sort of find out what you might be interested in it and you should learn to learn to work and learn to socialize because those things are, you know, the things that make people successful. So I talked about two of them, right? Intelligence, conscientiousness, that's discipline creativities and other ones. But that's pretty hard to develop if you don't already have one. But the fourth thing that makes people successful across time is Bradford social network. And so learning to socialize and to develop a large connection, large social connection, that's unbelievably useful. So you should get good at those when you're in your first year, you know, and that statue pretty. So if you come out of your first year, you're still in university, you got, you know, five courses under your belt, Doug decently, you have a circle of friends. He started sort of start to establish what you might be interested in. Good. And I was successful.

Speaker 3:          01:40:00       What do you think is the time that you bought to the site?

Speaker 4:          01:40:05       Well, the first thing I would say is it's always better to do something than nothing. So don't wait around. And what I mean by that practically is if you're not sure what to do, taking casts and do that and do it hard. And as you do it, you'll learn what's good above what isn't. And then in somewhere down the road, six months to, and be in a better position to figure out what you want. If you keep doing that, sooner or later you'll figure out exactly what you want. But don't wait around waiting is you don't learn anything when you were lingual way. So it's better to go off and try things and to try too hard because then you actually inform yourself. And other than that, there's no real rule. It takes people, it takes people of varying amounts of time to establish an identity. If don't have a well capitalized on, you have to be, by the time you're 30 you're starting to, it started to not be good. And if it's really not there were still by 40 that's really not so good. So if you're confused, get some credentials, you want to have something to show for your effort. But if you pay attention and you focus and you work hard, you'll figure it out. But

Speaker 2:          01:41:22       wow,

Speaker 4:          01:41:25       I, but I, but as I said before, the best thing to do to begin with this, you want to see, you may not know this, but the schools that you attended before you went to university, they were establishing their basic structure was established in the late 18 hundreds and they were originally set up to teach the children and factory workers to be factory workers, their factories. You can tell just by looking at them, even this to some degree, it's still the factory. It's the wrong model. Probably factories is you're not going to work in a bloody factor. You're going to have a career. And to have occur, you have to figure out who you want to be. And so one of the things you want to be doing over the next while is getting, this is why I have a liberal arts education is so useful because a liberal arts education helps teach you what a person could be and that's not the same as getting a job.

Speaker 4:          01:42:25       And the university is not for getting a job universities for figuring out what sort of person you could be. And so it's also useful to take philosophy courses and to take literature courses and to broaden yourself so that you get a a better idea of what the difference is between a great person and the and the trivial person. And then me. And that's not a very modern idea because we'd like to think that all people are the same and that's that's if all people aren't the same, he must have just stopped doing what you're doing right now because you're the as the same as you're ever going to get. If there's differences in quality, then you should infer what's high quality and then you should also know what that is. And so if your first year you wouldn't get helps to to do some thinking and to be guided by people who the culture of recognizes as great thinkers because they've thought about what it means to be human and why that matters. And then you might as well aim as high as you can. Hae not be a good thing to start sorting out the first couple of years university.

Speaker 2:          01:43:27       So graduate programs, I'm not sure I should go straight or right off for ask as well.

Speaker 4:          01:43:37       It doesn't matter. Masters are useless. I mean for, for most places, for clinically, most places you can't practice with the master's degree anymore. In most programs have the masters. I think you could still practice in Elbert radicle bet, but I'm not even sure about that anymore. For an academic career generally maybe depends on why you want to take the extra education. You know, if you're going to go into business or something like that, a master's degree might help you. But if you're after the academic career, it's a phd is you want, and then it probably doesn't matter whether you take a program that has a master's Mphd or just each,

Speaker 3:          01:44:23       yeah, yeah. Um, what about,

Speaker 4:          01:44:39       well, I'm less, I'm less informed about those sorts of status. So I mean, as long as you can practice with the master's degree, then that's no problem. But if you know that that's a different career path to be not as sometimes put you in as a school counselor or something like that, and that's perfectly fine. What the patient choice. It's a, I won't say in some ways it's a, it's a more defined in less demanding life and that can be, that can be extremely useful. You know, what an academic career or something or a career like that. It's a very, it's kind of all consuming and that isn't necessarily for everyone. It certainly isn't forever. And it should. And it should be for everyone. You have to be compelled in that direction. It be the choice. I know you'd have to be more specific in the question. I don't know exactly what you're asking.

Speaker 3:          01:45:49       Right.

Speaker 4:          01:45:56       The best of your best bet is to contact the college and find out what their registration. Good luck with that because their registration rules are pretty vague and it's hard to pin down, but that is what you should do to protect yourself and you should get it in writing because it's all on the phone that that's nothing. You need to get it and run it and I can't really, I can't really give you any more specific information than that.

Speaker 3:          01:46:26       Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:46:38       I can't tell you a lot about that because I looked beside the hold. The whole side of the street is outside of the academic street. They're professional schools. They're mostly set up in the US. They take a large number of students feeding the acceptance criteria of much lower, but the price you paid for that is the incredibly high tuition. It'll, he'll walk up by $200,000 debt. Now that might be okay. You might get to pay that off because you being included, local mission can be relatively lucrative. Typical hourly. The rate is maybe first beginner is maybe to get your practice going and be perhaps 102 hundred $25 an hour, and then that can go all the way up to the $8,300 an hour. Oh Ho. That's uncommon. One 75 was probably more typical. And so if you see six clients a day, let's say five, that's $1,000 a day. So it's about $250,000 a year. So you can pay off for $200,000 debt pretty fast. But you know, if you, if you set up a successful clinical career afterwards and there is quite a financial or a clinical psychologist, there's no glut on the market, although people have to pay you privately or through the insurance companies because it's not an old hip service.

Speaker 4:          01:48:08       Yeah, well there's only about 40 large research institutions in North America. You can find them on the web, they're the ones you already may know about. And then there was a sprinkling of smaller institutions and their emphasis on research productivity is a lot less, or they're not, they're not as competitive. So you could attend those places to get a decent training as a scientific thinker at the same time that you acquire your clinic license. It's perfectly reasonable thing to do. So that's why at the beginning I said, you know, I brought them because there's a big difference. There's some difference between universities and the differences on trivial, but there was a massive difference between being at a university and not meeting. I wasn't at all. So if you have the privilege of being able to choose which university you're going to go too well, great.

Speaker 4:          01:49:03       But you don't want to sacrifice the binary choice, the pause, the binary choice just to fiddle around with the Diet. Okay, so I'm going to close, I'm sorry, I'm just going to get a very quick overview. So here's what you did do as a psychologist, you're that if you're an experimental psychologist, generally you're heading for an academic career. However, there are opportunities and research enterprises outside of that. So in businesses for example, also the activity market for a psychologist is really opening up because psychologists are increasingly being hired at economics departments and business. And as a junior professor at a psych department, you start with the [inaudible] at the business school. Let's start with the selling of up to 50 so business schools are having psychologists because they're figuring out that we know what we're talking about. Whereas Business Phds and economists and not, not usually because their models of human beings are wronged and they don't know their statistics very well.

Speaker 4:          01:50:12       So anyways, the athletic opportunities for experiment with a phd or Spanish, it's a good time to be a psychologist. So it's relatively hard to get it. And when you're in, you better be productive because you won't be a credible candidate if you're not. So you've got to get disciplined. On the clinical side, there's almost nothing more valuable than a clinical degree because you can work as a clinician, can work in a hospital, you can work in academia and you can work as a consultant or you can do any combination of those things. So it's, you have a vast range of possibilities open up for you. If you have a clinical phd, it takes a long time. It's a six year phd and the new few years of training after that and it's hard to get in and when you're in it's competitive, then you have to work, but if you can pull it off, it sets you up for a vast range of possibilities in your future now and then to conclude that personally, if you want to set yourself up for this sort of thing, learn not to waste time because that's the one thing you can do that sort of under your control that will make you more competitive and start to take a boat.

Speaker 4:          01:51:23       They hard about how you want your life to be and how you don't want it to be because that can increase your motivation to do things properly. So all take, I guess. Then there's another question that you'd like to think that then we should probably stop. So it was, anybody have a question that hasn't been your sds?

Speaker 4:          01:51:47       No, it doesn't. Here's what you have to realize. It's not your suffering. You have your own suffering. Your client is entitled to, their suffering is part of their like adding your own misery for theirs is not going to help them all doesn't muddle up your thinking and it encroaches on their territory. You're not there to take over their version. You're here to help them attain clarity, figure out how to lift properly. And so it's your, you have an ethical, it's ethically required to stay detached enough so that you're not damaged by the encounter. And you'll learn to do that. Everybody motors to do that. In graduate school, you'd be surprised like, cause it get, it's a perfectly valid question and everybody wonders, but you learn how to do that and it's still called Ollie. Do you learn how it's the right thing to do? So one more question. Yes. The question about, you said some. So, um, how do you know if they're doing that? Because they look at your last year, this only started happening in the last couple of years. Like I had a student last year, two years since she didn't get in anywhere. It was she found out that just because they looked earlier, she had a pretty bad two year or two years. Would you be relevant? Hopefully she'll solve that by applying to more places. But

Speaker 5:          01:53:25       as the number of applications grow,

Speaker 4:          01:53:28       then the reason you know the methods by which people will be dispensed with get more general, I don't think it's reasonable, but that's irrelevant. Reasonable has nothing to do with like your best. And it's just like I said this to apply to more places and if you don't check weight, if you're a or a minus 80 80th percentile junior reasonable bob, you're recruiting a candidate, you hit it hard enough, you'll probably find a place to go. Yeah. In the last two years. Yup. Yup. So that's still all right. So [inaudible] thank you. On behalf of anyone [inaudible] I said yes, you may or may not know this, but the faculty and the student faculty ratio of university campuses for that is outrageous and you guys put up. So one of the things you might consider doing is not putting up some letters to the dean about the fact that you're a 450 of you to be shocked.

Speaker 4:          01:54:53       Me Number five gram. Okay, so 407,000 so you pay $3 million in tuition for each professor. Nam Salary, 50,000 got some overhead is 300,000 you paid 10 times as much as you should. Her factory seller, you're getting screwed and the reason you're getting screwed as because he put up and it's really not good because one of the things that would help you progress through your academic career as a psychologist property is if you could actually get access to a professor now and then I'm talking about things. So I would highly recommend it to do this with the PSA. Do something

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       about you're getting ripped off, there's no excuse for hundreds of one is appalling. It's 51 is a decent 451 your subsidized the whole bloody university and there's no excuse for it. And he like, he doesn't bother me because I just don't talk to students. Right. Because I have a certain amount of time and I'll talk to as many students as I can and pass that I didn't talk to students cause I can't. So it isn't bothering me except that you what? You should do something about it. This is no excuse for it. And unless you pushed on university, they will know what I'm doing. So when you're paying 3 million bucks per professor just hired here, we only know English professors, but it's not good. It's like it's the worst faculty, the student to faculty ratio of any department at the University of Toronto by a huge margin and a bone psychology departments across North America. It's about the worst. So you should use

Speaker 2:          01:56:49       no one else. You're going to have a rough kind of truck. Does he downloaded design basically going now, have you talked to Shelly Carson.
