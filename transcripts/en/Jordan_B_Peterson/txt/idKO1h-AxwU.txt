Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah, my neighbors, astronomers, it's got a picture of like Jimmy Hoffa, see his head still attached with nobody. I mean the things they could do with photography or so when there is a little bit there is an article, but no more pictures, pictures, pictures, great grandmother for two minutes after class. Anything that makes a difference to shape and a bunch of those, but there's lots of. I guess this is great. Okay, so today we're going to want to pass the picture. You can. We'll take a look at this picture here. This is very interesting. I think there's a number of pictures like this from around this time period in European art. This is about the best complete representation that I've seen. Alright, so I'll pass this around. Anyways, the picture is divided into two halves. On the right side. This is the tree of life. The tree of knowledge of good and evil, sort of combined into one image, which is not all that infrequent. On the right side of the images, Eve Adam sitting in the background here, eve is handing out fruit from the tree, taking it from a serpent's

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       mouth, by the way, that's the certainty of chaos. Taking the apple from the serpents mouth and handing into humanity over here and in the background is this figure that clearly represents death. And also you'll note in the tree, one of the apples is replaced by a sculptor. Alright, then on the right hand or the left hand side of the image, there's a figure that represents the church given maternal forum here seen as a counterpart to eve and, uh, there's a picture of Christ crucified up in the branches of the tree. And that, that symbolizes the notion that the old Christian notion that Christ was the second fruit of this tree. So the first fruit was the, was the fruit that bestowed on people knowledge of good and evil that had as its negative consequence consciousness of death. And the second fruit was the figure of the hero here who's construed in most myths as the answer to the question that was posed by the original event.

Speaker 2:          00:04:00       So you say Christian store story makes a loop, basically it posits that there's a problem, which is the fact of mortality or the fact of knowledge of mortality depending on how you look at it and that there's also an answer to that problem, which is whatever pattern of being as represented by this figure. So the thing that the finger representing the church is handing out our hosts and the hosts and the Catholic mass or theoretically considered to be equivalent to Christ's body. And that's a wrap. That's a reference to really archaic. Um, what would you say? Archaic Sacrificial Symbology, incredibly archaic nature based on the notion that if you ingest something that you can become like it, which is the idea that sort of stands behind the mass. So, um, anyways, you can take a look at this painting one that sorted like it, although it's not quite as good an image in this particular book on page 121 expressing the same sort of idea. So I'll just pass that around. You can take a look at it, think about it because it makes a nice background for the talk Landis class off, which is today. So I'm gonna read you some things today from the last part, the Spanish girl, because while I spent a long time constructing them,

Speaker 3:          00:05:20       I think they're more

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       because I have to cover a tremendous amount of material today. I don't want to miss the two essential lines of the argument. So,

Speaker 3:          00:05:32       um,

Speaker 2:          00:05:38       this whole course has been aimed at trying to understand motivations behind acts of cruelty that have no apparent justification. So one of the things that we've been trying to understand is what forces motivate individuals to, to protect their social territory in general. And the idea is, well, will you shut the door please?

Speaker 3:          00:06:03       Thanks.

Speaker 2:          00:06:13       So I mean the initial hypothesis basically is predicated on the idea that people have an innate response to the abnormal. He is terrifying at first encountered, particularly if that encounter is voluntary. And the reason we construct organizations of social order is to keep that novelty at bay, which is to say that we would rather live where there's order. Then we're, there's chaos because chaos has an intrinsically overwhelming how effective valence. So we have one level of motivation to protect our territory that stems purely from, from, uh, our psychobiology. Everything stems from our psychobiology I suppose, when it's most clear there, then there's a second level of phenomena that have to be accounted for him. And I've told you some stories more recently that Gold Hagen had gathered together when he was talking about the Nazi death camps near the end of the war, making the point that the Nazis did not assuming that they were motivated as you might assume, by the desire to take over the world to dominate the world, which would be motivated by the desire to spread their particular pattern of beliefs everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       So there was no chaos anymore anywhere. You would expect that when they put people like the Jews are the Gypsies into the concentration camps, that they would have tried to extract from them as much productive labor as possible in order to further this particular man. But it seems to be the case at least frequently, that the Labor that was extracted from the victims in the concentration camps was had no productive value whatsoever, certainly wasn't useful in furthering the cause of the war. It may have even happened it evidently at that point, because of course the Germans lost tremendous amount of their intellectual capacity when when the lucky Jewish intellectuals managed to escape their clutches, Gold Haggett points out in social units and details, this sort of thing quite frequently to that much labor, so to speak, was only implemented for the purpose of cruelty and humiliation.

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       So Gold Hagen tells a story about a typical work operation which involved moving a large rock from one place to another wellbeing beat and then moving it back, which is a parody of work not work itself. And obviously only instituted to humiliate and, and torture people who are already bought as victimized as you could possibly imagine. Uh, you know, you need another level of motivation now, that level of explanation to account for that sort of phenomena, which is gratuitous, cruelty or even cruelty as a, as a sort of aesthetic, as a way of life, as something worth pursuing in and of itself, and I don't think you can understand, you don't understand what human beings are like. You certainly don't understand motivation for acts of social conflict until you get both parts of the story sort of firmly embedded in your mind. So you could say, well, it's more purely the case that the fear of unknown territory and motivates our desire to associate it with a group group is composed of people whose actions we can predict. Furthermore, while we're in that group, we can predict our own actions, so pretty. That pretty much keeps the novelty of the environment, so to speak at bay, but also the novelty that's, that's, that's in other people and ourselves

Speaker 3:          00:09:40       and you needed then you, but then you have to account for this other level of phenomenon.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       The way I attempted to do that was by discussing mythologies of the dawn of consciousness. Two of them in particular, the Buddhist, the mythology of the initial stages of the enlightenment of the Buddha and also the myth, the methods containing the story of genesis which describes how Adam and eve ate the fruit of the tree, of the knowledge of good and evil, and then immediately became aware not only of their own mortality but of everything that that sort of signified, which was partly the fact that they were going to die. Partly the fact that now it was necessary for them to make moral choices. They have that capacity part of it. They were going to have to work in that. That's something that we haven't concentrated on that much. They have to work to sustain their existence.

Speaker 3:          00:10:35       You only.

Speaker 2:          00:10:37       You only have to work when you can envision negative possibilities that your instincts would not have normally construed of themselves. Mean animals don't work. They just live. We work because we can imagine a plethora of negative possibilities that do not exist in the present and we're always attempting to ensure that they don't exist in the future as well, which is just a hypothetical place in a sense, but we're the fact that we work means that were dissociated in a sense from what we'd like to do because we certainly normally juxtapose work with what we would like to do and the two aren't in the same category. Work is what you do, so you get to do what you would like to do, at least under normal circumstances, so part of the fall, part of the consequences of the fall or the rise into selfconsciousness, depending on how you look at it, was the necessity of endless work. So knowledge of death, endless work had basically about some stuff. Of course, it's also the case that went out to become self conscious. He puts on his fig leaf. He adopts the trappings of culture. He also immediately hides from God and while those ideas are all tangled together in the Genesis Meth, I mean Adam Heights from God because he's ashamed and the reason he's ashamed just because he's clearly recognizes his own vulnerability

Speaker 3:          00:11:50       and

Speaker 2:          00:11:52       that vulnerability, the recognition that

Speaker 3:          00:11:53       that vulnerability makes it impossible for him to to exceed to God or to see God, at least in the mythological story, and I think what that trying to represent this in part of the fact that it's knowledge of our own vulnerability that makes us doubt our, our. What would you say are

Speaker 2:          00:12:12       our fitness in the sight of God? It's hard to talk about this without lapsing into mythological terms. It's knowledge of Berlin vulnerability that leads to our own shame. I guess that's the simplest way to put it and that makes us hide from the possibilities in ourselves that have been our most potent.

Speaker 3:          00:12:33       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       so are. Then I told me a little bit of a split, a story that sort of went like this. I mean that there's a feedback loop in a sense that's generated as a consequence of the dawning of self consciousness and one is that one is the generation of shame. The other is the moving away from destiny that's most appropriate. That leads to a weakening of character, weakening of character, makes the world seem much more terrible than it is because

Speaker 3:          00:13:00       wow,

Speaker 2:          00:13:03       as you lose sight of the process that can allow you to adapt to things the way they are. It is the case that things that you can no longer handle take on a more and more aggressive and hostile and vicious face. So I guess the simplest way to look at that is to think that in the world is such a complex place, so unpredictable at its essence. It's so charged with danger everywhere that in order to adapt to it properly, it's necessary to utilize all of your resources. Your own knowledge of your own limitations is enough to stop you from bleeding. That those resources have any value. The more you move away from those resources, partly because they take work partly because you don't believe in them anymore that week or you get and the more terrible the world. Paris Hilton basically represented that part in his description of Satan's generation of hail, around tying in another complex aspect of the argument, which was the inability to admit to error.

Speaker 3:          00:14:02       It's hard. It's hard

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       in brief, to demonstrate how old those ideas are are pain without. I guess the basic notion is that it's knowledge of our own essential vulnerability that makes us lack belief in our capacity to face the consequences of our own errors or even to admit that those errors are there. Without that capacity, it's impossible for us to further the development of our personalities because it's only after admission of air that further exploration can take place and it's out of the consequences of exploration. That personality is generated and the terrors of the world transformed into something either positive or at least irrelevant. Okay, so what we're hoping to do today to some degree in a very brief period of time, is to describe how that process, how all the negatives that are associated with with the processes that we've described might be overcome to some degree can to start that by reading something. I guess the argument basically hinges on this point, so does the fact that there are negative things necessarily corrupt.

Speaker 2:          00:15:45       You can see. Nietzsche said, and I quoting his David last week, he said that everyone who only he who suffers from an actuality has motivation to lie himself out of it, and of course that that statement was his attempt to account for human behavior in general making the case. Then we all have reason to suffer from actual on the m, therefore are all motivated to lie ourselves out of it. Freud took an extreme position like that saying that our fear of reality, which was essentially knowledge of our own mortality, was sufficient to have generated all of the religious and the artistic structures that we've erected, which Freud basically regarded as neurotic delusions against the anxiety about death as a powerful argument type thing.

Speaker 2:          00:16:38       I guess the problem I have with that particular perspective is that it's extraordinarily, it's extraordinarily pessimistic because it basically predicated on the idea that unvarnished reality, so to speak, is of necessity, so terrible that it's impossible to face it, so then some, some false, some sort of has to be erected between you and your actual experience in order to make that experience tolerable. Now I can understand the rationale behind that argument. It's brings up again in these social psychological studies that we'd be. That idea springs up again. You know that a certain amount of dilution is necessary for mental health. Well, I guess really what I want to do is explore the other day and they look at the opposite perspective, which is that, well, no, that's not right. It's insufficient grasp of reality that makes it two terrible. The mayor and the story I want to tell you today is the story about, um,

Speaker 2:          00:17:33       how about the exploration of that particular hypothesis. And the first thing I did, I thought I might be useful because one of the things we've been trying to do in this class so far is to draw distinctions between things you know, so that we can figure out distinctions between various negative things and distinctions between various positive and to look at how the mythological imagination categorizes the world so that we can understand it more rationally. What are the things that I think is very useful to draw a distinction between when we're talking, when we're trying to answer the question, is the world so terrible that cannot be actually proceed properly, is to attempt to draw a distinction between evil and tragedy. And I'm going to.

Speaker 2:          00:18:16       Because it's certainly the case. Look, it's certainly the case as we all know that in the course of our life we're going to encounter the same sort of phenomenon of the Buddha encountered when he went outside of his outside of his castle walls. And there's no possibility in anyone's existence for them to escape sickness for old age or death. I mean those, those things are absolutely certain and certainly tended with negative effect, at least in terms of their apprehension, so the question is under those, given that those are the background conditions of existence, is it possible? Nonetheless, that existence can be positive enough so that it can be apprehended accurately instead of hidden from. And I think one of the things that you have to understand before you can answer a question like that is the nature of the distinction between evil and tragedy and in order to address that distinction, I turned first to an argument that was put forth by Ivan in the brothers Karamazov, which is regarded as far as I can tell, is one of the most potent

Speaker 2:          00:19:20       pro atheistic arguments that's ever been sat down in literature. I've been in low shower, two of the brothers Karamozov handle. Osha is a, is a spiritual person. He wants to be a monk and his brother Ivan is also, I suppose the same sort of spirituality from the genetic perspective. They are brothers after all, but he's also extraordinarily intellectual and his intellectual ability has completely destroyed his ability to manifest the sort of faith that that characterizes Losha and so they're sitting down one time, I believe they're both drunk. I don't remember all those characters. The SDS novelists are always drunk and they have a very lengthy discussion about about well, about the central meaning of the world, I guess, and I haven't makes it very, very powerful case and it's the case that it's sort of the worst case scenario. He says, look, this is how the world is constituted by all approaches I can can see above if it's constituted in this way. It's necessary to adopt the attitude of girth is Mephistopheles, which is basically that the conditions of existence are so unbearable that existence, that show itself has no justification. It should cease to be

Speaker 2:          00:20:36       now under most conditions. We don't draw that sort of conclusion, but there are times, especially when when our world's become much less secure than they normally are aware, that sort of thing springs naturally the mind and you know, as long as things are going according to plan, we don't think like that, but when the unexpected rises up and manifests itself in some extraordinarily destructive way, that's the first sort of notion that comes, comes into our minds. So I'm going to outline that argument. This is from Jeffrey Burton, Russell, a for volume series on the devil in the water world. He presents Ivan's argument for atheism. Ivan's examples of evil are all taken from the data newspapers of 1876. They're unforgettable. There's a noble man who orders his hounds to tear a peasant boy to pieces in front of his mother, a man who whips his struggling horse on generalized parents who lock their tiny daughter all night in a freezing privy while she knocks on the walls, pleading for mercy at Turk who entertains a baby with a shiny pistol before blowing his brains out.

Speaker 3:          00:21:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:50       I haven't noticed that such horrors occur daily and can be multiplied without an he states I took the case of children to make my case clearer

Speaker 2:          00:22:00       and so of course what he's doing is he's presenting a situation where the innocent are tormented because that's that's an archetypal situation. Fundamentally, it's because in our typical situation is where the most extreme situations that characterize any particular case on brought into the story. So if you want to tell a very good story, what you do is you make the extreme case and that's what I was doing because how can you justify the suffering of innocence of the other tiers with which the earth is soaked? I will say nothing. We're also states the relation of evil to God has in the century of Auschwitz and Hiroshima once again became a center of Philosophical and theological discussion. The problem of evil. It can be stated simply, God is omnipotent. God is perfectly good. Such a God would not permit evil to exist, but we observed that evil exists.

Speaker 2:          00:22:49       Therefore, God does not exist. You know, I think it's absolutely necessary to realize that this, this, this, this line of reasoning does not have to be formulated in a pure, purely theological manner. I mean whether or not you consider the conditions of existence generally as God or as due to God, has no relationship really necessarily on the attitude you bring to bear on the conditions of existence, whether you're an atheistic or religious explicitly. The same problem presents itself to you, which is that things that are terrible by any, uh, any manner in which terrible can be lead, define, constantly occur without apparent reason and also without, with, without our ability to control them under such circumstances which evidently exists. Is it possible to pause it in any tangible manner that life is worth living

Speaker 4:          00:23:47       on? That doesn't have to be a religious argument or expressed in religious terms. Although at its core, it's a religious. The only religious argument really. So the only question variations on the theme or nearly infinite. The problem is not only abstract and so of course he is also personalized. Immediate believers tend to forget that God takes away everything that one cares about possessions, comfort, success, professional craft knowledge, friends, family and life. What kind of God is this? Any decent religion must face this question squarely and no answer is credible. That cannot be given in the face of dying children. Okay, so that's the. That's the argument there is setup for the worst case scenario is this typical of Dostoyevsky's novels. I mean that's. That's what makes him a great novelist fundamentally is five great novels all address problems that are basically impossible. The relationship of good evil and crime and punishment. Yeah, the relationship of divinity and individuality and the idiot, the relationship of personal behavior to social catastrophe in the devils

Speaker 4:          00:24:58       and the relationship between fathers and sons. That's part of it. In the brothers Karamazov where this argument is also discussed, what do you say to a dying child? You say, look, you can do it. You're strong enough to do it. Hold her hand and fight the Safra and you can't control with the love that you can't. It seems to me that we use the horrors of the world to justify our own evil. We make the presumption that human vulnerability is a sufficient cause of human cruelty. We blamed God and God's creation for twisting and perverting our souls and claim all the time to be innocent victims of circumstance. I don't have much experience as a clinical psychologist to my patients, however stayed in my mind. The first was a woman about 35 years old. She looked 50. She reminded me of a medieval peasant, least my conception of the medieval peasant.

Speaker 4:          00:25:56       She was dirty clothes, hair, teeth, dirty with the kind of filth that takes months or even years to develop. She was unbearably shy. She approached anyone who she thought was superior in status to her, which was basically everyone hunched over with is shaded by both hands as if she could not tolerate the light emanating from her target. She been in behavioral treatment as an outpatient before and was a site known to the permanent staff at the clinic. Others have tried to help her overcome her unfortunate manner of self presentation, which of course many people on the street shy away from her, made them regard her as crazy and unpredictable. She could learn to stand or sit up temporarily with her eyes on garden, but she reverted to her old habits as soon as she left the clinic. She might've been intellectually impaired consequences of a biological fault.

Speaker 4:          00:26:45       It's difficult to tell because their environment was so appalling. It may have caused or ignorance. I thought perhaps that she had an Iq of about 80 or 85. She was illiterate as well to live with her mother whose character I knew nothing about and with an elderly desperately ill and bedridden at her boyfriend was a violent schizophrenia, alcoholic, at least as far as I can determine who ms dot traded her psychologically and physically and was always modeling her simple mind with tirades about the devil in the worship of sate. She had nothing going for her. No beauty, no intelligence. It will loving family. Those skills, no employer, nothing. She didn't come to therapy to resolve her problems. However, 10 burden her solar to describe her mistreatment and victimization at the hands of others. She came because she wanted to make friends with someone who was permanently hospitalized. The clinic where I was interning was associated with the largest psychiatric hospital.

Speaker 4:          00:27:39       All of the patients that still remained after the shift to community care and the sixties were so incapacitated that they could not survive on the streets on. You've seen street people and Aaron cat incapacitated enough as a general rule, so imagine how fascinated people who weren't allowed to go back on the streets where the basement of that hospital, there was a coke room down in the basement of the hospital. The hospital was connected by tunnels all over the place. I think product because it was so cold there. It looked like a scene from Dante's inferno in that coke room. I mean there were people in there that were so damaged. It was just beyond beyond your capacity to imagine. Anyway, she'd done some volunteer work up some limited type in that hospital and decided that she could maybe take someone for a walk and make friends with them.

Speaker 4:          00:28:23       I think she got the idea because she had a dog when she walked regularly and when she liked to take care of all she wanted from me was helping, arranging this, help finding someone she could take outside, help finding someone in the hospital, bureaucracy who would allow this to happen. I don't think I was very successful in 80, but she didn't really seem to mind said that one piece of evidence that runs contrary to a theory is sufficient to prove that theory. Just prove that theory. Of course people don't think this way and perhaps should not general theories to useful to give up easily. It's too difficult to regenerate and evidence again should be consistent and believable before it's accepted, but the existence of this woman made me think she was destined for a psychopathological and from the viewpoint of biological environmental determinism has faded.

Speaker 4:          00:29:13       This faded as surely as anyone I'd ever met and maybe she beat her dogs sometimes and was rude to her sick. Maybe I didn't see her when she was vindictive or unpleasant. Even when our simple wishes were thwarted. Don't want to say that she was the same because I didn't know her well enough to tell, but the fact was that in her misery and simplicity, she remained essentially without self pity and still able to see outside of herself. I hesitate to say that I learned more from her than she did it for me because that sounds literary have tried, but she didn't learn anything from me. Why wasn't she a criminal, cruel, unbalanced, and miserable. She had every reason to be, and yet she wasn't. It seemed to me that in her simple way she'd made the proper choices. She remained bloody but unbowed, and she seemed to me rightly or wrongly, to be a symbol of suffering. Humanity solely affected, yet capable of courage and love

Speaker 4:          00:30:07       such I created all the theory, will powers and spirits both of them who stood and fail and fail, not free. What proof could they have given sincere of true legions, constant faith or love. We're only what they needs must do. Appeared on what they would. What praise could they receive a pleasure. I from such obedience paid when will and reason, reason also his choice useless to me, of freedom. Both despoiled made passive, both had served necessity, not me. They therefore as to right along so we're created or can justly accused there, maker or they're making or their fate has it. Predestination overruled. There will dispose by absolute decree or high for knowledge. They themselves decreed their own report, not I, if I, for new for knowledge, had no influence on their fault which had no last group certain on Granola, so with our so without least impulse or shadow of faith for by me, immutably foreseeing a trespass authors to themselves in all both what they judge and what they choose for. So I formed them free, free. They must remain until they enthralled themselves. High else must change their nature and revoked the high decree, unchangeable eternal which ordained their freedom. They themselves are doing their fault.

Speaker 4:          00:31:30       That's God's discussion of the relationship between choice and evil in milk.

Speaker 4:          00:31:37       Have a patient I wished you described was the schizophrenia can falling inpatient ward had a different hospital. He was about 29, a few years older than me. I've been in and out of confinement for seven years. When I met him, he was of course on anti psychotic medication, participated in occupational therapy activities on the ward, taking coasters and pencil holders and so on, but he couldn't maintain his attention for any length of time. It wasn't even much good at craft. My supervisor asked me to administer an intelligence test to him. Standard wastes are more for the sake of my experience. Then for any possible diagnostic good at my deal. I gave him a dozen or so red and white blocks for the block design test. He's supposed to arrange the blocks so they matched the pattern printed on the cars that came with the test, pick them up and started to rearrange them on the desk in front of them are like timed them stupidly with a stopwatch.

Speaker 4:          00:32:27       Task was impossible for him, even at the simplest of stages to constantly look distracted and frustrated. I asked what's wrong? He said, battle between good and evil. That's going on in my head. I start the testing. At that point. I didn't know exactly what to make of. His comment was obviously celebrate the testing seemed to make it worse. What was he experiencing? Wasn't lying, that's for sure. The face of such a statement, it seemed ridiculous to continue. Spent some time with him that summer. I never met anybody who was so blatantly or we talked on the ward and occasionally I would take him for a walk through the hospital grounds outside. He was the third side of first generation Middle Eastern immigrants. His first born brother was a lawyer. The other physician, his parents were obviously ambitious for their children, hardworking and discipline. Being a graduate student at Mcgill, working towards a master's degree in immunology.

Speaker 4:          00:33:22       I don't remember exactly. His brothers had said daunting example, and he felt pressured to succeed, has experimented work at, not turned out as he had expected. However, any apparently came to believe that he might not graduate, not at least when you hope to, so he faked his experimental results in wrote up his thesis. Anyways, he told me that the 90 finished reading, he woke up and saw the devil standing at the foot of his bed and this event trigger the onset of his mental illness from which he had never recovered. Of course, it might be said that the apparition merely accompanied the expression of some stress induced pathological neurological development whose appearance was biologically predetermined and that the devil was a personification of his culture. His conception of moral evil manifesting itself in fantasy as a consequence of his distress. Such description would remain accurate implausible, but the fact remains that as a person he saw the devil and the division accompanied or was the event that destroyed him.

Speaker 4:          00:34:18       He was afraid to tell me much of his fantasy. You very well developed fantasy world and it was only after I'd paid careful attention to him that he opened up. He wasn't bragging. We're trying to impress me. He didn't want to tell me this. It was terrified about what he thought. He was terrified as a consequence of the fantasies that impressed themselves upon him. He told me that he couldn't leave the hospital because someone wanted to shoot him. I said, typical paranoid delusion. Why did someone wanted to kill him? Well, he's hospitalized during the Cold War on its height, perhaps still during the time when the threat of purposeful nuclear annihilation seem more plausible than it does now. Many of the people I knew used this threat, the existence of this threat to justify to themselves their failure to participate fully in life life which they thought of Romantically as do and therefore it's pointless, but there was some real terror in this pose and the thought of countless missiles pointed here and there around the world, sap, the energy and faith of everyone hypocritical or not, my schizophrenia patient believed that he was in fact the incarnation of the world in our lady force.

Speaker 4:          00:35:20       He was arrested upon his release from the hospital to make his way south who's in Canada to a nuclear missile silo and American territory, and to make the fateful decision that would launch the Third World War, the people outside the hospital, and that is why they were waiting to shoot him. They didn't want to tell me this story because he thought that I might want to kill him to my friends in graduate school. I thought it was quite comical. Denied contact a patient like this one, peculiar interest in human and humans, ideas regarding the collective unconscious. We're well known to them that seemed absurdly fitting that I would end up talking to someone with deletions of this type, but I didn't know what to do with his ideas. Of course they were crazy, my patient, but it still seemed to me that they were true from a metaphorical viewpoint. Historian totality. Length is individual choice between good and evil, with a cumulative horror than facing the world. Historic implied that because he had given into temptation at a critical juncture, he was in fact responsible for the horror of the potential of nuclear war. How could this be? Seemed insane to me to even consider that the active one, powerless individual can be linked in some manner. That time of history as a whole,

Speaker 4:          00:36:29       no longer so sure. I've read much about evil, perpetration and growth, and I no longer convinced that each of us are so innocent or harmless. It is of course a logical to presume that one person, one speck of dust among the 4 billion modes is there any sense responsible for the horrible course of human events, but that course itself is not logical far from it, and it seems likely that it depends on processes that we do not understand. Jeffrey Burton, Russell argues in his work on the history of the concept of the devil, that the classic distinction drawn between Natural Evil and moral evil is untenable. It'll currencies such as plagues and earthquakes belong in the same category. Companies dance as concentration camps on wards the existence of natural evil, for which God is theoretically responsible, has been used as evidence for the most potent arguments for the nonexistence of God. Say you put the nonexistence of any meaning such as I outlined previously. That was the states.

Speaker 4:          00:37:31       Perhaps the entire cosmos is not worth a single innocent child suffering. How can the universe be constructed so that pain is permitted? How can a good God allow for the existence of a suffering world? It seems reasonable to me to draw a distinction between tragedy and tragedy, has an ennobling aspect, at least influential has been constantly explored it to that and great literature and mythology. Tragedy exists where the heroic encounters limitation, evil by contrast is anything but no more participation in Alex whose sole purpose is expansion of medicine, pain and suffering destroys character, forthright encounter with tragedy might increase it. This is the meaning of the symbol of the crucifixion. It's Christ full participation in freely chosen acceptance of his fate which he shares with everyone that enables him to manifest his full identity with God and it's that identity which enables him to bear that fate and which strips over evil. And conversely it is our voluntary demeaning of our own characters which makes the necessary tragic conditions of existence of pure evil.

Speaker 4:          00:38:38       Where did these conditions exist? Why are we sending to unbearable limitation to paying disease and death and cruelty at the hands of nature and society? It seems to me that it is because of game cannot be played without rules. God and man are in a sense twins, so there's a mid rush and this means the God made man because he lacked limitation. We could have everything we wanted merely for wishing it. If every tool performed every job, if everyone was omniscient and immortal and everything would be the same, same old powerful thing, God and creation wouldn't exist. It is the differences between things which is a function of their specific limitations that allows them to exist at all should they be. It seems to me that we answered this question implicitly, but profoundly. When we lose someone loved and grieve, grieve presupposes. Having love presupposes the judgment that this person specific, bounded and vulnerable existence was valuable, was something that should have been. Let's do it. Question lingers, why you shouldn't. Things even loved things exist at all if they're necessarily limitations caused such suffering.

Speaker 4:          00:39:53       I dreamed I was walking out of a deep valley along the paved two lane highway highway was located in northern Alberta where I grew up and came out of the valley for miles around and then the sleep flat prairie asked the man hitchhiking could see another in the distance. As I approached him, I could see that he was in the first stages of old age, but he looked terribly strong. Someone passed them in a car driving the opposite direction and a female voice yelled out, look, he has a knife. He was carrying what looked like a wooden handle kitchen knife, well worn and discolored, and it had a blade at least two and a half feet long. Cross the shoulder strap, the large leather sheath. He was walking along the edge of the highway, muttering to himself, had swinging the leg jerky and chaotic fashion. He looked like the landlord lived next door to me when I was a graduate student living in a poor district in Montreal.

Speaker 4:          00:40:41       My landlord was a powerful aging x biker, former president of the local hell's angels chapter by his own account. He spent some time in prison as a younger man. He's settled down somewhat typically as he became more mature and had brought his drinking under control for a time. His wife committed suicide. However, when I lived there and he went back to him as well, your ways, he often went on binge drinking sprees and spent all the money he earned in the electronic shop. You ran out of a small apartment. He would drink 40 or even $50 in a single day and would return home in the evening. Blind drunk, howling, knows little dawn, laughing, kissing between his teeth, incoherent, good natured still, but able to become violent at the slightest provocation, took me once to his favorite haunts and slightly better condition on his 1200 cc Honda, which had the acceleration of a jet plane for short distances.

Speaker 4:          00:41:28       We perched precariously on the back of his bike, clinging to him, wearing his wife's, which settled my head ridiculously as it was at least five sizes too small drunk. He was almost in a singly destructive and ended up in fights constantly, unavoidably because he wouldn't take slights from people whose paths crossed, who were insufficiently cautious in that conversation with him. I heard by this figure he seemed upset that no one would stop and pick them up as if he were unaware of the dangers posed. As I went by. His gaze fell on me and he started after me, not from anger or for desire, for companionship, I think, but he was too unpredictable for me. He wasn't fast. However, I stayed ahead of him on the road. Scene shifted and I wielding figure nine. We're now on opposite sides of a huge tree. Perhaps 100 years, 100 yards in diameter on a spiral staircase, wander around, wound around the tree, out of the depths below, into the heights above the staircase was made out of old, worn dark wood.

Speaker 4:          00:42:24       Reminded me of the church pews in the church I attended with my mother as a child where I was married. His figure was looking for me. He's a long way back and I hit myself from this view as I send them the staircase. I remember wanting to continue in my original journey out of the valley. One of the flats around the plane with the walking would be easy, but the only way to stay away from the knife was to continue up the staircase up the axis Mundi. That's awareness of death. The grim reaper, terrible face of God compels us inexorably upward towards the consciousness, sufficiently heightened to bear the thought.

Speaker 4:          00:43:03       The point of our limitations is not suffering. It's existence. Excel point of evil by contrast is conscious destruction, manifest desire for increase of pain, anxiety and suffering. We've been granted the capacity to voluntarily bear the terrible weight of our mortality, returned from that capacity and degrade ourselves because we're afraid of responsibility. That's the necessarily tragic preconditions of existence are intolerable. Perhaps we could reserve answer to the question of God's nature is responsibility for the presence of the evil and creation. Until we have solved the problem of our own, perhaps we could tolerate the horrors of the world if we left our characters in intact and develop them to the fullest, we took full advantage of every gift we've been granted. Perhaps the world would not look horrible that it seems to me that it's not the earthquake, a flood or the cancer that makes life intolerable, horrible. As those events appear who seemed capable of withstanding natural disaster, even if responding to that disaster in an honorable and decent manner, it is instead the pointless suffering that we inflict upon each other that makes life appear corrupt beyond acceptability, and that undermines our ability to manifest, save faith in our central nature that makes us work even more diligently for the destruction of everything that lives and breathes. It said, be therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect. How seems stymied has always by as pilots are running query. What is truth?

Speaker 4:          00:44:37       Well, even if we don't know precisely what the truth is, we can certainly tell each of us what it isn't. It isn't greed and the desire above all else for constant material game, it doesn't denial. I've experienced, we know full well to be real and the infliction of pain for the purpose of pain, it appears possible to stop doing those things which we know beyond doubt, to be wrong and to become self disciplined and honest and maybe therefore to become able to perceive the nature of the positive group maturity seems painfully simple, so simple that it's a miracle of sorts that can ever be forgotten. Love God with all thy mind and all I and all that heart sort of truth above all and treat your fellow man as if you were yourself. Not with a pity that undermines his self respect and not with a justice that elevates yourself above you, but as it corrupted divinity, a light to the center, it's more difficult to rule oneself in the city.

Speaker 4:          00:45:32       And this isn't a metaphor. This is truth as literal as it can be made. It is precisely for this reason that we're always trying to rule. The city is a perversion of pride. To see praying in public and uh, clean up the dust under our feet and staff seems too mundane to treat those we actually faced with respect and dignity when we can be active against in the street. Maybe it's more important to strengthen our characters that to repair the world. So much of that reputation seemed self. Channing is selfishness and intellectual pride masquerading as well. Creating a world polluted with good works

Speaker 3:          00:46:05       don't work

Speaker 4:          00:46:10       who couldn't believe that it is the little choices that we make everyday between good and evil, but turn the world to waste and hope to despair, but it is the case we see are immense capacity for evil, constantly realize before us and great things and then small, I can never seem to realize our infinite capacity for good can argue with the soldiers. And when he states one man who stops lying can bring tyranny. Christ said, the Kingdom of Heaven is spread out, spread out upon the earth, but men do not see it. What if this were in fact the case? What if it was nothing but our self deceit, cowardice, hatred and fear of polluted our experience? And turn the world into hell hypothesis at least at least as good as any other admirable and capable of generating. Why can't we make the experiment? Find out if it is true. I want to read you something else. Now. This is. This is another. This is a description of the dream that I collected from my nephew. I'll read you the story about it because it's related to

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       the experiment that I was just describing,

Speaker 3:          00:47:34       right

Speaker 2:          00:47:34       hypothesis that I was trying to generate in that chapter was that,

Speaker 3:          00:47:39       hmm,

Speaker 2:          00:47:40       look, if you're treating someone in psychotherapy for an anxiety disorder, which basically means treating them because they're too afraid to continue living their life in the way that it has to be lived even for it to continue it. It appears beyond reasonable doubt. Now that attempting to convince the person of the unreality of their fear or of the unreality of the category of things to be afraid of is not useful. Don't people do not respond to that? You can't talk someone out of their neurotic beliefs. All you can do is help them learn to confront those things that terrify them and then perhaps what they learned is that they can confront those things, terrify them. They don't learn that the thing itself is any less terrifying, but they seem to learn that their own conception of themselves with so pathologically limited this,

Speaker 2:          00:48:35       that it was that conception that was in fact leading to their to their discomfort because the neurotic person who runs from everything that he or she is afraid of is possibly to themselves. Whatever it is that they are in essence is something so trivial that it can stand up to negative emotion and prevail and in therapy what you do is structure the situation so that the person can learn as a consequence of their own experience, not a consequence of the therapists words. Then if they're brave enough to look at what they can tolerate, looking at the devil in fact get better. And the thing that's so interesting about that, and it's mysterious even from the standard psychoanalytic viewpoint, is that when you do so when you do that to someone, their ability to withstand fear generalizes, which means that if you teach them to withstand fear in one situation, then they're better at doing it in other situations and their fear, even if it's symbolic underneath, doesn't multiply everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       That you haven't exposed them. So they may also get more confident, for example, in their interpersonal relationships and that. So that's a very common contaminant of exposure therapy for agoraphobic women, for example. Then they start standing up to their husbands because of course prior to that, their husbands were categorized in the category of all those things that are too terrible to face and what the therapist is teaching the client. Even if the therapist doesn't know it explicitly, is that you are the sort of creature who is capable of standing off to the category of all things that are too terrible to face. And all you have to do is give it a shot for awhile. Which is basically. Which is to say basically that you have to manifest some behavioral faith in yourself and you can discover that all by yourself and that's as far as I can tell and I've looked at different personality theories and different theories of psychotherapy and me. They tend to boil down to the same thing in some way. That same thing is that, well, first of all, you need a coherent theory about what things are about and second of all, that exposure to the things that

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       frightened you, cures you.

Speaker 4:          00:50:34       There's a now chemical dictum that according to you and was the primary all chemical dictum in steer clear linear inventory. I hope that's pronounced right, but my Latin isn't any good. The translation for that is it is found incest pools and that was the El Kevin. That was the alchemists general theory about where the philosopher's stone list to be found and the philosopher's stone was a material substance in theory that possess the power to grantee turtle life, but also to bring about eternal health and you and. Well, in other words, it was a thing that would. Granted, they're all the wishes and the chemical notion when you can find this thing where no one will look and what that also means from the personal perspective is where you will look well, that's a strange notion, but it's a bit more comprehensible if you start to think about it from the psychological perspective rather than from the empirical perspective because you could say, well, even though the places that we won't look differ from person to person, from the perspective of a natural category, it might be reasonable to pause it. That that place where one will not look is similar in some sense across individuals, which is only to say that all of us have those particular things that we're afraid of facing and the particular is different, but the fact that those things exist is standard across people.

Speaker 4:          00:52:06       King Arthur is night sitting around table because they're all equal. They set off to look for the holy grail, which is a symbol of salvation symbolically container of the nourishing blood of Christ, which is another reference to sacrificial symbolism, keeper of redemption. Each night leaves on his quest individually. Each night enters the forest to begin to search at the point it looks darkest to him.

Speaker 4:          00:52:32       When I was about halfway through reading this manuscript, I went to visit my sister in law and her family. She had a son, my nephew who's about five years old. It's very verbal and intelligent. He was deeply immersed in a pretend world and like to dress up as a night with a plastic helmet and sword Martech. He was happy during the day to all appearances, but didn't sleep well at night, had been having nightmares for some time. He regularly screened for his mom in the middle of his rest and appeared quite agitated by what was going on in his nightmares. This was a daily occurrence, essentially enough so that the household was being disrupted or house. One morning after woken up, what he dreamed about, he told me in the presence of his family that dwarf like beat creatures who came up to his knees, have been jumping, jumping up at him and biting him. Interesting was just looking through some

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       mythological imagery on the weekend and I found out that that while there is some archeological notions and don't know how valid they are, that there was a point in European history where worship of the mother goddess was very widespread and the cultures that performed this worship word then overrun by patriarchal cultures later and patriarchal religions replaced these early matriarchal religions. I don't know the similar theories to that like bio conference theory that human race was once matriarchal and then was later patriarchal have been discredited in the past and I'm not so sure that this isn't just a projection of mythological structure onto history, which happens very often, but it doesn't matter. There are, there are doesn't matter to this discussion, although it matters. Many of these. There are very many ancient images of goddess figures. We've looked at some of them and I found out this week and that many of them are figures of their fingers off the combination of a woman's body without burden.

Speaker 2:          00:54:29       Sometimes the figure has wings, sometimes it has a beat had. It's quite interesting. I guess this would be an example of synchronicity because I've been thinking about this. I just saw the movie crumb. Have any. Have you seen that David Lynch, you should all see that by the way, because it's first of all, it's very interesting study of of an extraordinarily pathological family, three brothers, one who molests women, his bum in the streets of San Francisco who also sits on beds of nails and it has a very ascetic attitude. Another man, 50 years old, never left home, never slept with any women depressed since he was 20. Multiple suicidal finding, kills himself a year after the movies made and this other brother named crumb who's a famous underground cartoonist who produces a lot of the images while he perceives himself in relation to a ship to women in general as a small, thin outcast, sort of figured who tends to clean the back of very large, powerful looking women who by the way often have bird heads, which I found very interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:55:33       Anyways, these figures that popped up in my nephew, his dreams, these dwarf like beat creatures. Where were these sorts of, are this archaic sort of image representing the source of all things and while you say, well, why would it beeped goddess be a good representation for the source of all things? Well, it has something to do with the notion. There's a whole bunch of notions compiled all together that one is the wild birds. They fly. So there's spiritual creatures because they're associated with the air and the sky and so they have a masculine aspect like the whole, like it goes to, for example, in a masculine aspect. And the goddess of course is more a more down to earth bakers. So these figures represent the union of opposites, just like the dragon of chaos, which is a serpent with wings anyway. So that's what pops up in this particular dream. So anyways,

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       he told me in the presence of his family, the door, like creatures who came up to his knees had been jumping up at him and biting him. Each preacher was covered with hair and Greece that had a cross shaved and the hair on the top of his head. The dream also featured a dragon who breathed fire after the dragon exhaled, the fire turned into these dwarves who multiplied endlessly with each breath. Oh, that was a great image too. He told the dream in a very serious voice to his parents and to my wife and I, and we were shocked by it. Same Ingredient, horror. It was really interesting to watch him because he, while I, like I said, he was always reading around this little night outfit anyway, so he's in this world. Whatever it was composed of is very imaginative, but then as soon as we asked them about the dream, I mean he just launched into it without a pause where you could almost. It was almost as if you could see the imagery running in his head and he just told the story with no with no hesitation whatsoever.

Speaker 4:          00:57:21       And well, the other thing, I guess that was what made so interesting to watch him was, was that his attention moved from outside world in and we're, all of us were obviously inside because he wasn't focusing on anything when he was telling the story. He's just letting the imagery run. Anyways, the dream occurred at a transition point in his life. He was leaving his mother to go to kindergarten and was joining the social world. The Dragon, of course, served as a source of fear itself for the unknown. In general, there are a burroughs, while the doors were individual things to be afraid of. So you see the mythological imagery with dragon of chaos, the grease fires standing in the back of everything and it produces these things that have this Artek, matriarchal nature, which is the unknown as it actually manifests itself and experience, and so there's this eternal source and as it breathes fire, particular things that frightened, frightened him would pop up.

Speaker 4:          00:58:15       And the thing that I thought so interesting is there is hydro mythology and a two because hydro of course is multi headed dragon. He kind of had me like seven more grow all basically all that's a pretty accurate representation of the way life progress is under some conditions because every time you solve a problem, some other problem pops up somewhere else. Or sometimes when you solve a problem, the solution that you use to solve the problem generates a whole bunch of new problems and the hydro mythology is basically just a representation of the idea that no matter how much time he's running around putting out fires, new fires keep popping up all over and that's. That will always be the case. It's also a representation of the fact that a political utopia that's conceived of as a permanent state is impossible because when you generate a solution, the solution to these problems and there's no way you can stop that partly because the solution does far more things than you would like it to do. Which is why, for example, drugs have so called side effects. I mean you have a problem, you applied to drug to it. The drug produces all sorts of other problems. I mean hopefully that are smaller than the original problem, but sometimes knows maybe there are bigger and it still remains to be seen, for example, where their television has solved more progress in his creative mind. Yes is the reverse, but whatever the point is, things do all sorts of things. Other than what you think they'll do, like

Speaker 4:          00:59:37       anyways, I asked him why he could do about this dragon. He said immediately I would take my dad and we'd go after the dragon jumped on his head and I poke out at size with my sword. Then I go down its throat where the fire came out. I cut the box out that the fire came from and make a shield from it without really. I mean not really blew me away. I couldn't believe that he could. I mean the idea of going, first of all, he blinded the dragon, which I thought was very interesting, but then he went down his throat. I mean not steps showed you that video. Right? And they go inside the whale. I mean that's exactly, exactly. Do you have a dream? But then there was a twist of brilliance in this dream because he said that the thing to do was to take the box that the fire came from, which was the source of the unknown itself and transform it into something that he could actually use against the unknown.

Speaker 4:          01:00:28       That idea is so brilliant that it's. It's a. it's a miracle of sorts that it can be reproduced in the dream of a five year old because what it says is that what what is necessarily used to go to where fear itself resides without knowing itself resides to identify with that thing and to use it as a defense against the unknown itself, which is exactly what we do all the time when we adapt to the fact that there isn't a milling, which is to say that when something I've known occurs, which means when some new information pops up because the two things are precisely equivalent. It's as a consequence of exploring that new information that you generate, new things that you can use to further the process of adaptation. So you say, well, the unknown is the source of all the problems. We know that, but it's also the source of all the answers to the problems and it is the case that while we use nature against nature, so to speak, to to quote an ancient source that I can remember. That's the process of constructing culture, is we use the material world to defend ourselves against the material world. And hopefully the balance remains on our side.

Speaker 4:          01:01:39       He had reproved preproduced, an archaic hero myth in perfect form. I thought the use of making a shield from the firebox or thought the idea of maintenance shield from the firebox was brilliant. This gave him the strength of the dragon to use against the dragging his nightmares ended at that point and did not return even though he had been suffering from them almost every night for a number of months. I asked his mother about his treatments more than a year later and she reported no further disturbance. Of course, many of you are going to find that hard to believe that that's true. That's actually what had occurred or you saying the thing is he was having this problem, obviously, whatever it was, it was plaguing him in his nightmares, whatever those composed of whatever those were composed of. He was running around like a night trying to act out the solution or you didn't quite have it. He was using his behavior in ritualistic forum to address a problem about adaptation which he couldn't manage, but as soon as he made the dream explicit and then came up with a solution, problem disappeared.

Speaker 4:          01:02:43       The little boy guided by his imagination, adopted identification with the hero faced his worst nightmare. If we're to survive individually and socially, each of us must do the same trick. Wiliness inventor in film will be found. This is the prime alchemical victim. What do you need most is always to be found where you least wish to look. It's not a mythological statement. It's the only recognition of the fact that in order to adapt to ongoing experiences necessary to make use of every experience that you've had and it's only those experiences that you haven't made use of, that you determined are too terrifying to contemplate, and then as a logical consequences, it's necessarily the case that all of those things that you're allowed to state classified as too terrible to contemplate, do in fact contain all that information that you need to survive because it is their locked.

Speaker 4:          01:03:35       It's the. It's their lack of use. That has actually resulted in you constructing a personality that's too trivial to to withstand the full weight of your experience. You know, if something's bugging you, you know, it's like let's say you have, you have a situation with your parents that's never been resolved. It's like bugging you for who knows some people that things like that funding for like decades without ever facing the reason it's bugging us because that's a little chunk of the unknown that your limbic system has detected so to speak, and it's always popping it up saying, look, look, look, look, look. Here's some information you're not paying attention to. Well, I don't want to pay attention to it because it makes me anxious. Well, he asked. It makes them anxious. That's how. That's the form that new information always takes, right? That's how it interests into your consciousness to begin with as something that makes you anxious.

Speaker 4:          01:04:25       Of course you have any number of reasons to move away from it since it makes you anxious, but the problem is if you keep doing that, then you don't make use of all the. All the novel experience on the question is, well, why would you move away from it instead of facing it? Well, the answer to that is obviously because you don't think that you're capable of facing it, which is to say that you've defined yourself in opposition to this thing which is intolerable, and the definition that you use is that I am too insignificant or weak or whatever, inconsequential consequential or unable to face this aspect of my experience, which I know by my own rules actually exists.

Speaker 3:          01:05:04       No

Speaker 4:          01:05:08       anomalous information brings terror and possibility, revolution and transformation, rejection of an unbearable facts stifles adaptation and strangles life.

Speaker 4:          01:05:21       There was a good man who owned the vineyard. He leased it to tenant farmers so that they might work at. Then he might collect the produce from them. He sends his servant so the tenants might be having the proper use of the vineyard bases to serve and beat him all week. Telling him serving. Went back and told his master. The master said perhaps they didn't recognize him. He sends another servant. Tenants beat this one as well. Then no one has said his son and said perhaps they will show respect to my son because of the tenants knew that it was he who was heir to the vineyard. They seized him and killed him, but him who has ears hear Christ said, show me the stone which the builders have rejected that. We'll use the cornerstone.

Speaker 1:          01:06:00       Thank you.

Speaker 4:          01:06:04       Great. That particular story, as one of the sources for the notion of the philosopher's stone says, show me the stone which the builders have rejected that. What is the cornerstone? Oh, it's a complicated story.

Speaker 1:          01:06:20       Was he in the Jewish temple? The quarter stone was the stone that had the perfect dimensions with all of stones are based on that.

Speaker 4:          01:06:28       Right? Right.

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       Jesus as the savior, Messiah, and he is the one that.

Speaker 4:          01:06:35       Well, that's. I would say that's a yes. That's part of the symbolic structure that surrounds the idea. The story in a sense has more. It has a more

Speaker 2:          01:06:48       straightforward interpretation in a way. I mean all of it. The moral of that story means is two things. One is then whatever it is you reject is the thing that you need. That's the first thing. It doesn't matter what it is, it's just the fact is that you have to make use of all the things that present themselves to you whether or not you find the map actively tolerable. Now we already know that you determined what, what's an effective tolerable as a consequence of the value structure that you were raped, right? You're always analyzing phenomena in reference to the goals that you perceive as valid, so whether something is actively tolerable, no, it depends to an immense degree on your interpretation of what's important and it's maybe the case that certain things to you appear intolerable because you're unwilling to give up a value structure that's really pathological. If you gave up the value structure, the thing we looked unbearable wouldn't be unbearable at all. It might be positive so you can switch the valence and things very rapidly by just transforming the thing that you believe it. Well, we already know that certain forms of anomalous information have the capacity to completely overthrow the philosophies that you use to evaluate events.

Speaker 1:          01:07:52       What about the first part of that story or the other story there? That seems a little bizarre. I don't quite see that they are one.

Speaker 2:          01:07:59       Well, why is that idea of the story is saying, well, these two events are precisely the same is that if you define yourself as that creature, which is unable to accommodate two or assimilate negative events, you've Ah, you've abandoned your identification with the hero. That's what that means. What did the individual characters symbolizing the story about the vineyard? They symbolize? Well, that's what I was trying to get at with them with that. Well, the owner of the vineyard symbolizes God. Okay. Now the story is trying to represent is the idea that sacrifice of identity with the hero, which is equivalent to this death internally is equivalent to rejection of the novelist information. That's what it means because it's. This is the thing that I've been trying to lay out describing the relationship between the process that's represented by Satan's Milton Satan. There's no difference between saying this thing is to to intolerable to face and saying, I am too little deface it. Those are exactly the same thing. So removing yourself away from information that you regard as to threatened to tolerate is identical to a destruction of identification with the hero. So why the two services?

Speaker 1:          01:09:19       First, we're wondering what are the. What? What's that from?

Speaker 2:          01:09:26       Yeah, I, I don't know. I don't know actually what route. Maybe.

Speaker 1:          01:09:33       What's that?

Speaker 2:          01:09:39       Well, yeah. Yeah. I guess what I guess what those figures represent his approximations to the hero that which, which would fit perfectly well and into the, into the interpretation that they were prophets. I mean, you know what they like to hear hero even less, right? Right. They weren't too thrilled with people who approximated the hero precisely. And so that will. That's exactly the case. I mean it's a rare. It's referenced to the fact that people tend to devour people in groups tend to devour those individuals upon which the group actually depends. And what this story is pointing out, I guess, is that that would even be the case if they figured that constituted the archetypical individual upon whom the group depends appeared how people would still be motivated to do precisely the same thing.

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       So.

Speaker 2:          01:10:32       Okay, well then the next thing which I really don't have time to go into in much detail, so you have to read this, but this will give you some, some intimation of at least what was going on and know. Look, I've been, while it's been my position fundamentally, that people have paid an insufficient amount of attention to use writings. Well, they're confusing, that's for sure. I give some reasons why that might be the case in the manuscript. Most of his students were women. Most of them were outside of the academic tradition. He discussed religious imagery to a large degree in psychology tends to shy away from any religious imagery because it's very young scientists and it's just dissociated itself from philosophy. It's dominated by materialistic way more materialists in psychology than there are in physics for example. There's all sorts of reasons. It's certainly the case with youngs early writings, but it's even more dramatically the case with his later writings and all his later writings deal with alchemy and nobody's been able to figure out what the hell he was talking about.

Speaker 2:          01:11:31       Why spend all this time trying to decipher these l chemical writings, but what was the trying? What was young was trying to outline was the symbolic representations of the internal process that occurs when people do precisely what my nephew in this dream said that he should do, which is to say what are the consequences of. You can put it all sorts of different ways. What are the consequences of admission of error or what are the consequences of identification with Harold? Or what are the consequences of the adoption of a stance of religious humility? Because all those things piled together and actually constitute the same phenomena. And what you said was, well,

Speaker 2:          01:12:24       it's possible for people to undergo revolutions in their cognitive structures. We know that from Thomas Kuhn much later by the way, so this is not only true for empirical structures, but also for moral structures so we know that's the case and people have updated their views of the world over and over and what. What you was trying to point out was that this could actually happen within an individual and not only that it could happen, but that it had happened many times in the past and there was symbolic representations of all the stages of this particular process and most of them are going to be pretty familiar to you already because I'd be trying to make reference to them all the time in the diagrams that I've been using you and basically stated that there were 45

Speaker 2:          01:13:06       sequences of events frequently intermingled in terms of the narrative structure that characterized the alchemy, some more the alchemist trying to do while they were people who possessed by an intimation of the insufficiency of the churches. Rick, Rick, a representation of reality followed their notion that there was still valued to be apprehended in the interpretation and discovery of matter. The alchemists were the first scientists in a service knowing from the empirical perspective because they didn't have an experimental method method methodology, but from the standpoint of interest because they were the first people who were willing to pause it. That in this huge domain that had essentially been outlawed as heretical by the church, something of interest still might be there to be found. He said, well look, you know, the Church says, as a consequence of these historical events, humanity is being redeemed. The alchemists, you might say, looked around and said, well, if this redemption taking place, things are still in pretty sad shape, so maybe there's something more going on here.

Speaker 2:          01:14:15       Then we might that might meet the eye. All they become interested in. So you want you almost trying to do is to explain why it was that we developed science, especially why developed in Europe. So what, what were the historical precedence to the explosion of science in the last 500 years following the reasonably logical hypothesis that something of that magnitude was likely prepared by us at least several centuries of previous thought rather than just like coming out of nowhere all of a sudden and only in one culture so. Well, the first thing that preceded the development of science was the notion that the pursuit of knowledge about material might in fact be valuable. So that's the hypothesis, test the hypothesis, the abundant life science is that if you investigated the transformations of the material world, you might find some information of value. You said, well, this first popped up in the form of what might be regarded as a kind of cultural dream, and the dream was the dream of the philosopher stone, which was that there was a material substance that if you only possessed it with grandpa and of your wishes, and you can say, well, what is it that motivates science?

Speaker 2:          01:15:26       This is why you thought that science was still embedded in the mythological format. I said, that's what motivates us at the border. We're convinced that if we can just find out enough about the way things are made that we won't have to get old anymore and we won't have to get sick anymore and there'll be enough for everyone and all that seems like a perfectly reasonable hypothesis as far as I can tell me anyways. He tried out. Now, the other thing that you pointed out, however, and this is I suppose where the argument gets very, very complicated, is that

Speaker 2:          01:16:02       what the outcome is set out to investigate was not matter as we can see that because they didn't know what matter was as we can see that they didn't even have way of representing it. Blacking entirely an empirical methodology for what they were actually out to explorer was the unknown part of which was mattered in the material world. As from the from the medieval perspective and young basically made the point that what the outcome was did was posited that the notions of the church, which is the group identity basically we're not complained, were insufficient. Which is to say that you positive that the alchemist was someone who was willing to admit to him, to himself that the manner in which the world had been interpreted was not complaint. Which is to say that there was still something left. So you could say, well, he. He regarded himself as something that was still ignorant and also the church community, which was essentially totalitarian was too military infrastructure is could be imagined, was nonetheless incomplete, and you said, well, it was merely the process of that preset, which is I don't know everything.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       Maybe there's still something left to explore necessarily produced and our identity of the alchemist with the hero, even though they didn't know what I mean, that because what they were doing was acting out the role of the hero and you can say, well, whenever you do that, certain things happen and those things are expressed to no chemical symbolism and what happens when you drop the role of the hero, but were you already know that it's like there's a mission that unknown information exists. The information comes in. It blows the structure of your previous worldview. He descended into a a situation that's characterized by emotional chaos as a consequence of processes that occur in that state of chaos. There's a reconstruction of a new world view, but how is that represented? Now can be the first stage is we're represented either by the prime of material or the descent of the king.

Speaker 2:          01:17:59       Now you guys should know enough about symbolism to start to understand what this means. He said, well, what happens to you when you first admit that something that meant everything to you might not be complete? He said, well, that can be represented as two ways, depending in two ways, depending on what stage of the process you need to be represented by the depth of the cake or by your identity with what was called in Alchemy, the primary material, which is basically chaos, the dragon of chaos, and you can say, well, those two things are the same. Why pause? Because of the descent of the king, the descendant of King and beyond your world, or the death of the king or the distillation of became. Remember the alchemists. They were trying to explain things like why matter would dissolve saying salt water and mercury. So it's a weird mixture of empirical speculation and metaphysical theorizing. You remember the alchemist didn't have any scientific techniques, so all they could do when they were manipulating material, the material world, which was demonic like church association, was used, their fantasies and what were their fantasies full of last mythologies, Christian mythology. That was their worldview fundamentally. So of course that's all they saw. Everything. It's all they knew.

Speaker 2:          01:19:10       That's the dragon of chaos, the prime of material, the source of all things. Well, in the medieval view, the primary material was not just something material. It was much more akin to these mythological notions of the dragon that we've discussed because the outcome is set well. Whatever the world comes from is a weird intermingling of all those things that will eventually become society, the individual soul and matter, which is I think an unbelievably sophisticated perspective because, well, that's something you'll have to think about on your own, but it is the case that whatever the source of all things is is that thing which in time turns into the subject and an object plus society at large. Now we tend to think of that something, that thing as something purely material, but that's because we make the presupposition that whatever we are a subject is something that's reducing to whatever is through the material and I would say, well that might be true, but if it is the case that whatever we are is reducible to something material, by the time we figured you figured out how that relationship exists, the way we interpret matter will be completely different from the way we interpreted now and that's.

Speaker 2:          01:20:19       That's one. That's one thing that really argues against a simple minded material. Reductionism is the presupposition that you understand the phenomena to which you're reducing everything, which you know clearly. Anyways, all these stages, there are descriptions of this process.

Speaker 3:          01:20:51       The key,

Speaker 2:          01:20:54       the death of the king produces immersement and chaos that was also described as the Nigredo, which is an interesting stage. It's often represented in an alchemical symbolism, has a. An old man who was black who was very close to death, sitting in a pit like breathing out of the Raven. It's symbol. It's symbolic of anxiety and depression. Fundamentally more than that. Also emotional chaos and all you one was trying to point out in this analysis, so our committee, what is the. If you lose a moral philosophy, your emotions become dysregulated and you're swamped with anxiety and depression. The outcome is regarded that as a state in this process of transformation. Not as a final statement necessarily, but it's the kind of thing that needs she's describing when he talks about standing at the edge of the cliff and looking off into the abyss. Well, that's the UBS.

Speaker 2:          01:21:45       The chaos is represented by on the dragon also by the queen of chaos. That's. That was my representation anyways. I said, well, the notion here was the thing that was to be dissolved in the salt solvent. The king and chaos can be represented as a Kenyan, a queen, the queen sorting, making reference to the sort of matriarchal symbolism that we've talked about the past and that was the union of those two things that would produce a new structure and that's an idea that's very much like the old Egyptian idea of, well, cirrus going into the underworld or or the idea of the Egyptians have that the Egyptian Pharaoh was simultaneously the old dead Pharaoh and the new federal, which is to say that if you have a particular philosophical viewpoint, which is the manner in which you would describe an aspect of value to your environment and it dissolves all things that you had classified are no longer classifiable and you're swamped as a consequence.

Speaker 2:          01:22:46       Swamp with anxiety and depression, which are two of emotional phenomena that that whole classification system wasn't directed to inhabit. To begin with. When that system blows itself apart, those emotions come back up. And and how do you construct a new system? Well, you use the anomalous information that's blowing your old system apart, plus everything that you had known before to erect something new. And the outcome is symbolized by the Union of the king border and the Queen of chaos, sexual union, something that notion that makes illusion to incest symbolism and their offspring. The divine son was the new state of order on the outcome associated that with with the philosopher's stone. Everything, either a permanent state of order or a permanent state of redemption or the process that gives rise to that when she was the aspect that we're more interested in. I'm sorry. That's too much to bring that discussion to make, to do justice to you, his ideas, but they can't really be summarized rapidly.

Speaker 3:          01:24:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:24:10       I just ask you one thing that's always interested me is there it is. The Union of opposites essentially given the context, the context of the theory of this class, I take the union of opposites to me, sort of a creative type of stable hierarchy of goals. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:24:32       but those goals are essentially a separate things in competition. I mean if they're not, if they're not organized or effects often, why? Why did it? You characterize it as a union of opposites because the fact that they're in competition doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't a structure where you have exactly one opposed to another. What did he mean? Did he get that out of you got that out of symbolism I guess, but at the same time, why isn't it represented more in terms of sort of chaotic competition for other than that? In terms of the. That's a good question. What I think it's mostly because he viewed the competition of. It's more from the perspective of the mythological structures that we've discussed where things are held in opposite the positive aspect of the, of the creative unknown at the negative aspect, the positive aspect of the known and the negative and there's clearly a structure of opposites there and if you what if you take the biological perspective that what young is referring to is the integration of different effects driven philosophies in a sense. Then the notion that they're in opposition breaks down to some degree. There's still a certain amount of. Would you say was that Kurt, to to guess that they were represented that way simply because that's an easy way to, to review conflicting things is in terms of a simple up opposition.

Speaker 2:          01:25:55       I mean if you're gonna spend more than that too though because like let's say that

Speaker 2:          01:26:02       let's say that the two things you want in a given situation, conflict with one another, so that means you value one thing and you value. Now you're in love with someone they don't like your job. Alright? So those are two affectively driven philosophies in a sense, structures of value that are brought into conflict as a consequence of a new situation. In those situations, those forces would war and opposition and that's part of the reason why this has always represented as opposing forces mean you don't have a conflict until you have a conflict of duty. You have a conflict of duty. When one thing you think is important and valuable and morally appropriate conflicts very powerfully with another thing that you think is valuable and morally inappropriate. Then you're caught in the war, torn apart by these two. Flow down. One of the things you and was trying to point out was that your a structure evaluation, the fact that you love this person, the fact that you valued this job are structures that have developed as a consequence of an incredibly lengthy historical process and even the notion of love, although it might be rooted in certain biological predispositions, is a cultural construct that's developed over thousands and thousands of years.

Speaker 2:          01:27:15       That's, that's fed in part for example by the notions of, uh, what's the medieval notion? Central many medieval notion of gallantry chivalry, right? I mean love is the construction and part. Why do you. Why are you so attracted to your job in that particular circumstance? Well, it's very complicated job as being described values as a consequence of all sorts of processes. It's your way of holding anxiety and depression at bay had they. It's part of the way that you described determinant meaning to the world. It's part of a larger social structure. When you put those forces in opposition in a given circumstance or when they can flip in a given circumstance, you're torn apart as a consequence of their conflict that makes you the pawn of the gods, so to speak. What you was trying to describe in his l chemical sequences is the process by which all these conflicting hierarchies of value could be brought into one internally.

Speaker 2:          01:28:15       Coherent story. My story he was trying to represent, he said, well, by the end of the chemical period, the more psychologically sophisticated alchemists were drawing an analogy between whatever the hell the philosopher's stone was in Christ, which is very peculiar thing. So as they had more or less left the church in order to pursue this process to begin with, and what does that mean? Well, the philosopher's stone was the thing that represented that thing that's of ultimate value and in Christian mythology that's also love Christ represent. So it's not very surprising that they would end up falling into the same category, so to speak, because it was the existence of that category that gave rise to both those concrete examples. Anyways. Well, the question is, what the hell does this represent what we're trying to get at painful even dot last lecture? Well, we know already that this process might be regarded as the continual process by which particular answers to the philosophical question, what is the good or generates like, here's one philosophical Schema, new information, what was it?

Speaker 2:          01:29:22       The part it's replaced by another one that's theoretically more complete. New information comes in and blows it apart and so on and so forth. Always never ending says, well, how do you get out of 12? We sent over months ago. Look, you pop out of identification with any of the states which is adolescent identification with an ideology anyways under all circumstances, and you start to identify with the process which is the process of voluntary encountered with the unknown descent into this chaotic state and reconstruction says, well, the only have two modes of protection against a known one is identification with a particular system of beliefs. The other is identification with the process by which chaos itself can be transformed in order. Do you have a saying, well, this constant, and this is represented various in various ways and mythology sometimes as the philosopher's stone sometime as the figure of a given prophet like Moses, sometimes it's price, sometimes it's Buddha, what is supposed to represent his identification with the process of adaptation and not the outcome.

Speaker 2:          01:30:27       You said what's your youngest concerned with is the hierarchical structuring of value systems. That's what do you mean by the Union of opposites? Well, but you said was, look, there's only one answer to the problem of what's more important than what else, which is to say there's only one answer in a sense to the problem of how value should be hierarchically organized, and his answer was essentially the thing that's at the pyramid of the hierarchy of values should be the process by which the whole hierarchy is constructed and that means everything should be subordinate to it. So when you read, for example, in the new testament notions that say it's more difficult for a rich man to. It's easier for a rich man to go through the eye of a needle than to enter into the Kingdom of heaven. What the story means is if you think that security, which means how do I deal with death, how do I deal with the Old Lady, how do I deal with sickness, can be found. If you think that money, material possessions for that matter can provide you with the kind of security that you want, which is security in the face of all those terrible things. You're wrong because it won't work, and furthermore, if you put the desire for money, which is security basically, above all else, you'll sacrifice necessarily sacrifice identification with the only process that could in the final analysis offer for you, the kind of protection that you're needing. So it's not going to work.

Speaker 5:          01:31:52       Well. First of all, this is. There's an assumption here that order is a good thing. That's, you know, that's what you're. Well, there's an assumption here, right?

Speaker 2:          01:32:04       That's, that's the problem with these states is that is the assumption orders. Good chaos isn't. That's wrong,

Speaker 5:          01:32:11       right? I see. Okay. So then you get to that point and what an unresolved issue I have. Is that okay? If you placed yourself with the ultimate goal of the identification with the process, well, I don't see how, if you, um, you know, actively moved towards the unknown, look into that which we are all capable of. So I see I am capable of evil, I am capable of killing someone. I am capable of, you know, all these things. Well, what, how does that fit into that? How does that fit into that framework? So

Speaker 2:          01:32:48       well, tell me more to expand your notion of what it is that you are and also perhaps bring up the capabilities that you would be unwilling to use or even unwilling to admit to at times in situations where they might be appropriate. Like it isn't until, for example, it may be that in order to survive optimally, whatever that means, that you might have to have access to a whole realm of aggressive impulses. The existence of which you're not even willing to admit. So we say, well, if you can actually come to grips with the fact that your behavioral capacities are much broader on the negative side than you might have on the negative side as you define it, then you might have never been willing to admit and you can also start to understand that you may have capabilities that you have not even begun to explore, and it's certainly the case that all, although aggression can be used in all sorts of ways that appear clearly negative, that there's any number of situations where the capacity to maintain your ground or even to move forward in the face of tremendous opposition is absolutely necessary to you.

Speaker 2:          01:33:47       So that would be. That would be one part of the excel. It's also the case that until you're capable, have at least conceiving conceptually of how significant the errors that you're making might be. You haven't got a hope in hell of doing anything about them. You can't even see that they're there. He say, well, I'm not the sort of person that would ever do anything like that, which is of course just patently, patently ridiculous.

Speaker 5:          01:34:08       Once you see that you are capable of killing someone or are capable of, you know, aggressive behavior, it almost makes you not the hero not to act upon those. Aggressiveness stinks. I mean, there may be some certain cases where, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:34:24       that's actually our right. You know, if you're four years, six years old and you go to the playground and the nine year old pounds, you flat, you can't go home thinking while I did the right thing, I was nonviolent because the reason you were nonviolent just because you got pounded, clap. Now it's different situation entirely. If you go out somewhere and you have the capability of truly aggressive response and you're provoking and you don't manifest it well, then that's a different circumstance, but the mere lack of ability to respond in a negative way, it's no indication whatsoever of any morality. That's why I need you to send no standing. Morality is cowardice. It wasn't because he thought all morality equals cowardice. It's because much of much of what passes for what much of what people define to themselves as their own morality is just their own cowardice. That's part of the reason why I figures like the gangster are so popular in American mythology because they act out what everyone would actually like to do, so to speak, but is too moral, which isn't the case at all too cowardly to do. Now there's positive and well,

Speaker 5:          01:35:23       how can you simultaneously say that I'm the person who denies, um, error, the are the person who denies this within them as evil and yet killing is evil. Um, how can you say those two things?

Speaker 2:          01:35:40       Well, I didn't say the ladder.

Speaker 5:          01:35:42       What killing isn't, but that's what I'm trying to get at. Like are we trying to say here that killing is evil? Look

Speaker 2:          01:35:50       there only one way to answer that question I guess. And that is one of the things that are. One of the things that's constantly referred to in hero mythologies is the fact that

Speaker 2:          01:36:02       you shouldn't break a traditional rule. Okay? So that answers that question, right? It's wrong. But then there's a problem with that in the traditional rules as listed are not a sufficient and complete guide to adaptations. So then the question is, well, under what circumstances is it reasonable to break a rule? Well that's a different issue. And so in the broad sense you can say, well, you know, do you want to be good? Well then you follow the Ten Commandments. I mean there are there rules upon which most civilized societies are structured, fine, but there are situations in which the rules conflict, for example, or whether where perhaps they're not necessarily applicable well under those circumstances than what can guide your morality. Well, that's the question that we're trying to answer here because we also need to know if this is the theory, so to speak. What's the practical implication? Because that's one thing that you need to know. I mean that's the only reason that any of these stories have any relevance to begin with. Well, it's your attitude towards the novelist. Information in large part determines your morality. So let's say, let's see if we can figure out what that means.

Speaker 2:          01:37:15       First of all, I would say, look, it's the case that

Speaker 3:          01:37:22       no,

Speaker 2:          01:37:22       you might ask yourself the question, what does life have? Any beans? Well, that's the question that people often ask themselves and I would say, well, what is that you mean by that? Well, what does meaning mean? Well, for me it means implication for action. I mean that's what we mean when we say meaning, are we meeting emotional significance? And then I would say, well, so we're going to look at this structure. Emotional significance. Well, what does anomalous information for Dusek well, anxiety, especially if it's involuntary

Speaker 3:          01:37:50       hope, hope, interest. Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:37:58       isn't that interesting means that has some significance for my behavior or the way that I interpret things that I'd never considered before.

Speaker 3:          01:38:12       Speed.

Speaker 2:          01:38:29       I'm going to read the last three days. That'll pretty much do this. Do a same interest is meaning, meaning is the manifestation of the divine, which is the individual adaptive path. Pursued of interest necessarily exposes the individual tomorrow when social limitations, I'm produces a symbolic death of personality which sort of simultaneously as the precondition to renewal an antidote to the necessity of real death. When circumstances inevitably change. What does that mean? Well, if you watch your experience, there are going to be phenomena that appear to you as if they're meaningful. I would say they attract your interest. You can watch yourself. Your interest will be attracted by the not even on your own accord, so to speak, just by the fact that those phenomena for reasons that you might not understand, produce an orienting response or in your heightened your interest. Well, I would say that that's evidence of the manifestation of the unknown, so to speak, from within the perspective of your particular philosophical framework says if you follow those things that appear to you as meaningful, which is what you want to do anyways, because it is the case that that is the sort of thing that people want to do virtually.

Speaker 2:          01:39:38       By definition. What will happen is you'll end up participating in the process that you described, which is to say that if you hold onto your interest and don't let it go despite all the social pressure that you'll find not to do it because you're supposed to be doing the thing that everyone else says is useful and the fact that it's going to expose to you all sorts of things that you didn't understand to begin with.

Speaker 3:          01:40:00       Well, what if I find it immensely interesting to cut to it?

Speaker 2:          01:40:05       Well, no, no, this is absolutely, absolutely. We will definitely discuss that. I mean, that's. Look, there's two poles obviously say you know what's like Joseph Campbell? He says, follow your bliss, right? Well, in the first thing that pops into the head of the good paranoid is exactly what Daniel popped up. It's like, what if my interest is serial killing? Because if you read, if you read accounts of serial killers, for example, what you find very rapidly is that they're very interested in what they were doing and so if you are very interested, they couldn't start doing and they got their interest expanded as they continued to pursue the territory. So you say, well obviously interesting in of itself is known as sufficient guide because you can interest can manifest itself within the confines of the personality that so pathological than in, in and of itself is a sign post for pathology.

Speaker 2:          01:40:53       When I say, well, that's why we concentrated so much on this. So if you feel your head up with garbage, what did labels is interesting, it's no longer going to be healthy and so there's two poles to the sort of moral process that we've been describing. One is do what you're interested in. Make sure you do what you're interested in. The second thing is don't lie to yourself because if you lie to yourself, you're going to work the mechanism that produces interest as a phenomena because we already know, look, we already know that. What occurs to you as anomalous, what pops up in your phenomenological field as meaningful? It's going to be dependent very much on the philosophical theory that you bring to bear on the event is write your goals, the ends you have in mind and so on and so forth, determined the significance of phenomena.

Speaker 2:          01:41:39       The only way you can ensure that those structures are healthy is if their existence accounts for all of the experience that you've actually had in the past, which is to say that you've constantly modified and updated your worldview to account for all of the experience that you've had. But if you don't do that, you're living within a philosophy that's twisted off cedric precisely to the degree that you've twisted it off center. The more that it's twisted, the more that whole structure is going to produce intimations of meaning where they shouldn't be, and then if you follow those well, they'll lead you places that perhaps you would have never really wanted to go or maybe deeply, unconsciously, perhaps leading you exactly where you want it to go. It depends on how you look at it. So there's two poles. One is when it comes right down to it, the only thing that you have to rely on is the phenomena, meaning you know what it occurs and when it doesn't mean if you're immersed in something you really love, what are they?

Speaker 2:          01:42:33       One of the phenomena that might be that the self consciousness vanishes. That's one thing you can see what performers who are really great, they're really immersed in what they're doing is that they're very attractive because they've mastered that domain so well that they pay absolutely no attention to themselves as phenomenon while they're doing whatever it is they've been doing. Another thing is if you're immersed in that, then your notion of time tends to disappear so you can be working very hard on whatever it is that you're interested in book. I say, well, where did it all the time? Nope, and I would say, well, that's another indication that that's that phenomenon is producing an added note to self consciousness because a big aspect of self consciousness is tick, tick, tick, tick of the consciousness of time. What pops you out of that? Meaning? Where does meaning manifest itself? It manifests itself on the border between order and chaos and the reason it does that is because that's where all the adaptive processes are taking place. That's where you have to be operating in in order to ensure that the phenomena that you use to interpret the world with the structures you use to interpret the world are constantly being updated and also those of your society are constantly being updated because after all I discover something and then I tell it to you and that's how. So that means that the individual process of creative

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       exploration updates the social world as well.

Speaker 3:          01:43:56       So

Speaker 4:          01:43:58       it's not a simple matter of, well, the other thing Campbell's statement for example, is follow your bliss. Well, this strikes me as quite quite one sided in the sense as well, and I guess that's the problem with new age philosophy. I mean, that's why I like his works on alchemy. I said, look, you look where you don't want to look. Now, if someone tells you that it strikes me that maybe you could believe it seems realistic to me, rather than a message that says, well, if you do, if you do in some simplistic sense, whatever makes you happy, that's perfectly fine, so young, escaping through his analysis of this chemical process that if you pay attention to what you find meaningful, it will take you to the place where you would least likely to want to go first because of because of the necessity of this process emerging.

Speaker 3:          01:44:41       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:44:54       The abandonment of meaning ensures the induction of the demonic mode of adaptation because the individual hates point is pain and frustration and we'll work towards destruction of its source. This work constitutes his revenge against existence, which is pride is rendered unbearable. Rebirth is reestablishment of interest after adoption of culturally determined competence is rebirth, makes the individualist practically adapted as anyone in history has motivated is he has courage to be the rebirth of interest moves man to the border between the known culture and the unknown nature and thereby expands is adaptive competence his in the world in this manner, the domain of history is expanded. This capability for extension is the manifestation of God within the individual in the modern world. Socialization should allow the individual to devote the power of history to the act of exploration. Interest manifested in the absence of self deceit, places each of us on the border of the unknown and removes the tragedy from temporality.

Speaker 4:          01:45:58       The pursuit of subjective of interest in there inevitably brings each individual into contact with his own fears, such contact mediocre in the social sphere when expression of individuality conflicts with normative behavior or in this sphere of the absolutely unknown. When pursuit of individual interest takes man beyond the cultural Canada and places him against the forces that govern mortality and limitation per se. The heroic motive being is predicated upon the assumption that something divine exists within the individual that is capable of manifesting itself when called upon when necessary. This is individual possibility arises to meet the challenge presented by life without faith in the heroic challenge must be avoided from the practical viewpoint, this means the abandonment of subjectivity and the search for security. This choice eliminates the possibility for personal development and increases the likelihood of fanatic identification with history or adoption about outright distractedness.

Speaker 4:          01:46:57       Selfconsciousness means in knowledge of individual vulnerability. The process by which this knowledge comes to be can destroy faith and individual work. What this means in concrete terms is that in the course of development and the individual may come to sacrifice his own experience because it's pursuit creates social conflict or exposes individual inadequacy. However, it is only through such conflict that change takes place and weakness must be recognized before it can be transformed into strength. This means that the sacrifice of individuality eliminates any possibility that individual strength can be discovered or developed, and then history itself can progress. Individuals whose life is without meaning hate themselves for their weakness and hate life or making them weak. His hatred manifests itself and identification with destructive power and it's mythological historical and biological manifestations and in desire for the absolute extinction of existence. Such identification leads, Manda poison, whatever he touches degenerate, unnecessary misery in the face of inevitable suffering to turn this fellows against themselves, to intermingle earth with hail merely to attain vengeance upon God garden, his creation, the human purpose, if such a thing can be considered, is to pursue meaning to extend the domain of light and consciousness in spite of limitation.

Speaker 4:          01:48:14       Meaningful event exists on the boundary between security and novelty. The pursuit of meaning exposes the individual to the unknown in gradual fashion, allowing him to develop strength and adaptive ability in proportion to the seriousness of his pursuit is during contact with an unknown that human power grows individually and then historically meaning is the subjective experience associated with that contact and sufficient proportion, the great religious misstate that continued pursuit of meaning adopted voluntarily and without self deception will lead the individual to discover his identity with God and to the bead, thereby capable of withstanding the tragedy of life. Abandoned of such meaning reduces man who is more than weaknesses. It makes them hate life and work towards it's elimination. It could be said that meeting is the most profound manifestation of instinct, so that's why I think Adam hid from God in the garden of Eden.

Speaker 4:          01:49:09       Man is a creature attracted by the unknown and adapted for its conquest. The subjective sense of meeting is the instinct governing rate of contact with the unknown. Too much exposure turns changed to chaos and too little promote stagnation and degeneration. The appropriate balance produces a powerful individual confidence in the ability to withstand life, ever more able to deal with nature and society and ever closer to the heroic ideal. Each individual constitutional unique finds meaning in different pursuits. If he has the courage to maintain his difference, manifestation of individual diversity transformed into knowledge that can be transferred socially changes the face of history itself and moves each generation of men farther into the unknown. Social and biological conditions defined the boundaries of individual existence. The unfailing pursuit of interest provides the subject of means by which these conditions can be met and their boundaries. Transcendent meaning is the instinct that makes life possible.

Speaker 4:          01:50:09       When it is abandoned, individuality loses its redemptive power. The great lie is that meaning does not exist or that it is not important. When meaning is denied hatred for life and the for destruction inevitably rules. If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy the wisdom of the group can serve as a forest that mediates between the dependency of childhood and the responsibility of the adult. This makes history of the power that serves the individual society predicated upon belief in the divinity of the individual, allows individual interests to flourish and to serve as the forest that opposes the tyranny of culture and the terror of nature. The denial of meaning by contrast ensures absolute identification with the group or interest psychic degeneration.

Speaker 4:          01:50:59       If such identification fails, the denial of meaning makes the individual desperate. When the validity of identification is challenged and the great maternal sea of chaos threatens his weakness, makes them hate life as well and to work for it's devastation in him and as well as those around the lie, as the Central Act in this drama of corruption. These are the secrets sayings which the living Jesus Spoken, which did a most Judas Thomas wrote down. This is from the Nag Hammadi Library, and he said, whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not experience death. Christ said, let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds, when he becomes troubled, he will be astonished and he will rule over the all Jesus said, if those who lead you say to you, see the kingdom is in the sky than the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you it is in the sea and the fish will proceed you rather the kingdom is inside of you and it is outside of you.

Speaker 4:          01:52:01       When you come to know yourselves, then you will become known and you will realize that is in you, that it is you who are the sons of the living father, but if you will not know yourselves, you dwell in poverty and it is you who are that poverty. Christ said, the old man, olden days will not hesitate to ask a small child seven days old about the place of life and he will live for many who are first will become lost and they will become one in the same. Christ said, recognize what is in your site and that which is hidden from you will be complaining to you for there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest his disciples and said to him, do you want us to fast? How shall we pray? Shall we give arms? What Diet shall we observe? Christ said, do not tell lines and do not do what you hate. For all things are playing in this side of heaven for nothing hidden will not become manifest and nothing covered will remain without being uncovered. That's it.

Speaker 3:          01:53:13       Thanks.
