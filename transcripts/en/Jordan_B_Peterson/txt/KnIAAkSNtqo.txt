Speaker 1:          00:05          Good afternoon and welcome colleagues invited guests, members of the general public who are following today's proceedings of the Standing Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs. Today we continue our consideration of Bill CC and act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the criminal code. And with this, our last day of hearings on the bill, we will move to clause by clause consideration tomorrow with us today for the first hour or Jordan b Peterson professors, psychology department at the University of Toronto and from the D dot, Jared Brown Professional Corporation, a d, jared brown lead counsel. Uh, thank you gentlemen for being here. You both have up to five minutes for opening statements. And Mr Peterson, I believe you're going to lead off.

Speaker 2:          00:56          Yes sir. The floor is yours. So I think the first thing I'd like to bring up is that it's not obvious when considering a matter of this sort what level of analysis is appropriate. If you're reading any given document, you can look at the words or the phrases are the sentences or the complete document or you can look at the broader context within which it is likely to be interpreted and when I first encountered bill [inaudible] and its surrounding policies, it seemed to me that the appropriate level of analysis was to look at the context of interpretation surrounding the bill, which is what I did when I went and scoured the Ontario Human Rights Commission webpages and examine its policies. I did that because at that point the Department of Justice had clearly indicated on their website in a link that was later taken down that bill see 16 would be interpreted in within the precedence policy precedence already established by the Ontario Human Rights Commission.

Speaker 2:          01:57          So when I looked on the website, I thought, well, there's broader issues at stake here. And I tried to outline some of those broader issues. In the initial. You may or may not know. I made some videos criticizing bill c 16 and it's and a number of. It's a of the policies that surrounding it. And I think the most egregious elements of the policies are that it requires compelled speech, the, uh, the Ontario Human Rights Commission explicitly states that refusing to refer to a person by their self identified name and proper personal pronoun, which is the pronouns that I was objecting to a can, the can be interpreted as harassment. And so that's, that's explicitly defined in the relevant policies. Um, so I think that's appalling, first of all because there hasn't been a piece of legislation that requires Canadians to utter a particular form of address that has particular ideological implications before.

Speaker 2:          02:57          And I think that it's aligned that we shouldn't cross. Um, then I think that the, the definition of identity that's enshrined in the surrounding policies is ill defined and poorly thought through and also incorrect. It's incorrect in that identity is not and will never be something that people define subjectively because your identity is something that you actually have to act out in the world as a set of procedural tools, which most people learn. And I'm being technical about this between the ages of two and four. It's a fundamental human reality. It's well recognized by the relevant say, developmental psychological authorities, and so the idea that identity is something that you define purely subjectively is an idea without status as far as I'm concerned. I also think it's unbelievably dangerous for us to move towards a representing a social constructionist view of identity in our legal system.

Speaker 2:          03:58          The social constructionist view insists that human identity is nothing but a consequence of socialization, which is which and, and there's an inordinate amount of scientific evidence suggesting that that happens to not be the case. And so the reason that this is being instantiated into law is because the people who are promoting that sort of perspective, or at least in part because the people who are promoting that sort of perspective know perfectly well that they've lost the battle completely on scientific grounds. It's implicit in the policies of the Ontario Human Rights Commission that sexual, uh, identity, a biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, um, sexual proclivity all vary independently. And that's simply not the case. It's not the case scientifically. It's not the case factually. And it's certainly not something that should be increasingly taught to people in high schools, elementary schools, and junior high schools, which it is, and it is being taught.

Speaker 2:          04:55          I included this, a cartoon character that I find particularly reprehensible, aimed obviously at it as it is at children's, somewhere around the age of seven that contains within it the implicit can be implicit claims as a consequence of its graphic mode of expression that these elements of identity, our first canonical and second independent. And neither of those happened to be the case. I think that the inclusion of gender expression in the bill is something extraordinarily peculiar given that gender expression is not a group. And that according to the Ontario Human Rights Commission, it deals with things as mundane as how behavior and outward appearance, such as dress, hair, makeup, body language, and voice, which now as far as I can tell, a open people to charges of hate crime under bill [inaudible] 16, if they dare to criticize the manner of someone's dress, which seems to me to be an entirely voluntary issue. So I think that the Ontario Human Rights Commission's, uh, attitude towards vicarious liability is designed specifically to be punitive in that it makes employer's responsible for, um, harassment or discrimination, including the failure to use a preferred, preferred pronouns. They have vicarious liability for that. Whether or not they know what's happening, whether or not the harassment was and whether or not the harassment was intended or unintended. So all stopped with that. Thank you. Mr Brown.

Speaker 3:          06:30          I'm a litigator in Toronto, act and all manner of commercial and employment disputes. I'm not an academic. I live with my clients in the land illegal reality and how the law actually works. About two years ago, I began to see claims of discrimination included in every employment related ct claim. My phone now rings weekly with human rights. Tribunal matters. It has become a reality for employers across Canada. In August of last year, I became aware of Dr Jordan Pearson. He was discussing

Speaker 2:          06:59          what he saw as a problematic law, poorly written.

Speaker 3:          07:02          That's when I observed the oddest thing happening. Lawyers, academic lawyers, important people began to say that he had the legal stuff wrong. Nothing unusual about this bill, and they also said, you don't get to go to jail if you breach a human rights tribunal order. What was happening is they weren't defending the law but downplaying its effects. Now, as a practicing lawyer, anytime a lawyer and particularly an academic says, look away, there's nothing to see here. It gets my antenna way up. So I did some research which can be found in the brief that I filed in advance of today. It sets out the path, the prison on this I knew as a commercial litigator that anyone can end up in jail if you breach a tribunal order. It is a simple civil contempt of court process. People go to jail for this, but what about the freedom of expression issue?

Speaker 3:          07:52          It's a foundational issue. We all know that section two, b of the charter sets out that everybody has the fundamental freedoms of thought, belief, opinion and expression, and we all know that the government is successfully restricted freedom of expression over the years. But what if rather than restricting what you can say, the government actually mandated what you must say. In other words, instead of legislating that you cannot defame someone. For instance, the government says, when you speak about a particular subject, let's say gender, you must use this government approved set of words and theories. The American jurisprudence clearly defines this is unconstitutional compelled speech in Canada. The Supreme Court has annunciated the principle that anything that forces someone to express opinions that are not their own is a penalty. That is to Talbot's Herrion and as such, alien to the tradition of free nations like Canada. Now to see [inaudible] get us to compelled speech, the Minister of Justice is summarized.

Speaker 3:          08:49          Bill see 16 as the enactment amends the Canadian Human Rights Act to that gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination. The Department of Justice website used to say that we must look to the Ontario Human Rights Commission policies for definitions on these terms. Ontario's policies on gender identity and gender expression are so my brief. They state that gender based harassment can involve refusing to refer to a person by their self identified name and proper personal pronoun, refusing to refer to a trans person by their chosen name, and a personal pronoun that matches their gender identity will likely be discrimination. The law's otherwise unsettled as to whether someone can insist on any one gender neutral pronoun in particularly if the Harasser didn't know or didn't intend to harass. It's still harassment. Now, why is this important? Well, in Ontario Human Rights Commission as a policy development creature of the legislature, it creates the policies which interpret the code, but what is most important, the tribunal must follow these policies.

Speaker 3:          09:47          It is bound by them so the commission creates the law on pronouns and Ontario. The policies on pronouns were introduced into the legal framework after the law had left the legislature federally, the same process will be followed as the Department of Justice had said so a similar guideline will be developed as with the Ontario policies. Federal guidelines must be followed by the federal tribunal. The guidelines will mandate pronouns. This will happen after the bill leaves the Senate, mandating use of pronouns requires one to use words that are not their own, which imply a belief in or an agreement with a certain theory on gender. If you try to disavow that theory, you can be brought before the human rights commission for Ms Dot gendering or potentially find yourself guilty of a hate crime. To sum up on the subject of gender, we're going to have government mandated speech now in a on the constitutionality of the proposed bill, the Department of Justice said on its website, look, there's a variation of this bill that already exists in most of the provinces.

Speaker 3:          10:42          I don't believe that's a robust argument in favor of constitutionality. I would refer you to the comments of the now Chief Justice Mclaughlin of the Supreme Court and the decision to Taylor. It's in my brief. The chilling effect of leaving overbroad provisions on the books cannot be ignored. While the chilling effect of human rights legislation is likely to be less significant than that of a criminal prohibition, the vagueness of the law means it may well determine more conduct than can legitimately be targeted as a lawyer on the ground, I worry about poorly drafted a poorly drafted law and its impact on my clients. As a Canadian, I worry about parliament tacitly authorizing compelled speech. The brief I provided to the committee contains a comprehensive legal opinion that I published back in December on [inaudible]. There's a table that shows how the federal human rights regime mirrors the Ontario system in terms of enforcement of policies and guidance or wrap up sir. And finally, it includes the case law that underpins the opinion. Thank you. Thank you both. And we'll begin the questions beginning with a different.

Speaker 1:          11:42          Sure. So Baker. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you to the witnesses for their presentation. As the witnesses know, the nine provinces in Canada, uh, have, uh, uh, the, um, the provision in their laws including Ontario and also the words expression, as I recall appears in four or five provinces. Um, so what you are arguing is against what we already have in law, your reference to the criminality to, to the sections of the criminal code at our last meeting, senators wow correctly pointed out that sections three, 18 and slash 19 starts off by genocide under the heading genocide. The next heading is a public incitement likely to lead to a breach of the peace. And you know, what a breach of the peace is, Mr Brown, willful promotion of hatred. These things are. And then there are defenses listed as you know, in that criminal code provision, there are several defense, if you honestly believe in what you said is if, if you, you know, the, the defenses are extensive in the criminal code, they've worked well for Canada.

Speaker 4:          13:20          So

Speaker 1:          13:22          what do you have to say about the facts of what's presently in the criminal code and your reflection that somehow, uh, the genocide heading, the heading on public incitement on willful promotion of hatred somehow that these provisions should not be included under those headings?

Speaker 3:          13:45          I think I have to be clear, my presentation relates to the amendments of the human rights code or the Criminal Code, and that is in fact how a one like Dr Peterson may in fact find themselves on the wrong side of jail. And so if you have, if you've reviewed the, uh, the publication in the opinion, I say that a simply by breaching the, a proposed amendment to the, uh, to the human rights act, um, and particularly with somebody who is deliberately doing so for instance, somebody was saying, I'm not going to use those words, that person, if they are dragged before the tribunal, the Ontario Tribune or the federal tribunal, I've indicated to you already that the Department of Justice has said they're going to pass the same guideline on pronouns. And so what I'm suggesting to you is that if somebody says, I'm not going to use those words are brought before the tribunal, the Federal Tribunal and the tribunal then delivers an order for payment of a fine.

Speaker 3:          14:44          And alternatively a nonmonetary remedy. I, he cease and desist order, uh, an order to do something, to compel them to do something. And that person who's brought before the tribunal says, I'm not doing that. They will find themselves in contempt of court and prison is the likely outcome of that process until they purge the content. That's what I'm suggesting. I'm not suggesting to you that, uh, that the, uh, amendments to the criminal code, um, well I'm, I'm not advocating genocide. I guess let's just say that. And My, my presentation here is, is restricted to what I see as the Pronoun policy issue in the compelled speech issue. So it covers the provincial legislation if you distraught to disagree with that we've had in place in the provinces for decades in some cases, is the policies that were enacted after it left the legislature and which will be enacted after this bill leaves this, the, this committee.

Speaker 2:          15:40          I would also like to add to that the fact that once I made the video stating that I wouldn't use the Z and Zer pronouns, for example, which I regard as part of the ideological linguistic vanguard, the university lawyers after carefully considering what I said, sent me two letters to cease and desist in my public utterances because they believed that not only was I violating the university standards of conduct, but then I was also violating the relevant provisions of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. Therefore, as far as I could tell, vindicating the statement that I made when I made the video to begin with, which was that the act of making the video itself was probably already illegal and they didn't do that lightly on the provincial. Yes. Senator to put.

Speaker 5:          16:27          Thank you. Chair and thank you gentlemen. Both of you for being here. Um, two questions. One for Dr Peterson at the get go. And then one for the two of you. Hopefully the chair will indulge me a deliberations of this bill. And during deliberations of this bill, we keep hearing the term respect, throwing around respect as indeed critical in debates of legislation as sensitive as this. And there are a lot of people here who need to be reminded that respect works both ways, including people at this committee. Uh, Dr Baker, Senator Baker has already referred to comments as genocide. I don't think anybody here is promoting genocide. However, Dr. Peterson, can you comment on the notion of respect where some of your critics say, why can you not just respect your students, just use the gender neutral pronouns? How do you respond to that?

Speaker 2:          17:29          Well, first of all, I'd have to be convinced that doing so would do more good than harm. And I don't believe that and I think I'm actually in a reasonable position to, to, to justify my claim. I think that the danger that's intrinsic to the law far outweighs whatever potential benefit it might produce. Especially given that there's no hard evidence whatsoever for any. I would also like to point out that the people who are promoting this legislation claim to be acting on the behalf behalf say of the transgender community, but they weren't not elected nor appointed to act as such representatives and they're doing it on their own. Say. So. I've received many letters, at least 30 now from transgendered individuals indicating that the, they are not in accordance with the claims of these so called representatives to be representing or with the intent of the legislation, which has actually made them more visible rather than less visible, which is.

Speaker 2:          18:20          And the less visible is what they had preferred with regards to respect is that you don't meet people generally speaking in a mutual display of respect. You generally meet people in a mutual display of alert neutrality, which is the appropriate way to begin an interaction with someone because respect is something that you earn as a consequence of reciprocal interactions with wwe that are dependent on something like reputation, which is also a consequence of repeated interactions. And so the notion that addressing someone by their, um, self-defined self identity isn't necessarily an indication of basic human respect for them, I think is entirely spurious argument, especially given that there's no evidence that moving the language in a compelling manner in this direction is going to have any beneficial effect. We're supposed to assume that just because hypothetically the intent is positive, that the outcome will be positive and any social scientist worth his or her salt knows perfectly well that that's rarely the case. So

Speaker 5:          19:23          Dr Brown, uh, you've talked about a nonmonetary orders, uh, that could include sanctions like orders to undertake sensitivity and anti bias training. I would like a, either one or both of you to comment on whether you could explain why an individual may have a strong objection to undertaking such a training. And Mr Brown, could you let the committee know how serious the sanction could be? An of course you already dead on that. Uh, if you refuse to undertake such an order, uh, and specifically at the federal level, but what would, what would, why would people have an objection to taking such training? I think I'm going to let Dr Peterson answer why he or someone like him might have an objection to undertaking that type of training. Obviously, once again with the severity of that decision. If it gets before the tribunal,

Speaker 2:          20:11          well, I have a profound objection to, to undergoing such training. In fact, I would flatly refuse under all conditions to undergo it. And the reason, there's multiple reasons for that. The first reason is that the science surrounding the, uh, the so called charge of implicit bias that's associated with perception is by no means settled in, in to such a degree that to one of the three people who designed the most commonly used measure, which is the implicit association test, has detached himself from the other two researchers on the grounds that the use of the test has become, has far its scientific validity and reliability. It's nowhere near valid or reliable enough to be used in the manner that it's been using. And even the more a pro iat researchers who developed the test have admitted to that publicly, even though they haven't stressed it nearly to the degree they showed up.

Speaker 2:          21:03          So first of all, the sciences is not settled and is being used absolutely inappropriately and I can say that as a clinician because I know that and as a psychometrician I know the criteria for using a test for a six essentially diagnostic purposes and the iat doesn't even come close to what's necessary. Then the next issue is, well, where's the evidence that an anti unconscious bias training works? There's no evidence and what little evidence there is suggests that it actually has the opposite effect because people don't like being brought in front of a reeducation committee and having their fundamental perceptions. You see their perceptions, not even their thoughts, but their perceptions themselves altered by collective Fiat. It's an unbelievable honor sir. We have a very engaged committee, concise questions and concise responses with the helpful, uh, senator prep.

Speaker 6:          21:54          Thank you for being here. I want to briefly for the documents from the Ontario Human Rights Commission says some people may not know how to determine what Pronoun to use. Others may feel uncomfortable using gender neutral pronouns. Generally. When in doubt, ask a person how they wish to be addressed Tuesday. If you don't know which Pronoun to use, his preferred, simply referring to their person by their chosen name is always a respectful approach. So you can use the pronoun, you can choose, you can use their chosen name. So if someone chooses to change his name from Paul to Peter, surely you'd use Peter because it's a matter of simple politeness and respect. If that same person is the person chooses to cheat, to change our name from Paul to Paula, won't. I won't use you. Use the name Polo simply as a matter of respect. What's the difference here?

Speaker 6:          22:47          Well, I guess the issue with that and the speaker about the legal issue there is that you're now introducing the full force of the law behind the requirement to use. And I'm dealing obviously with, with respect to the pronoun issue in terms of not addressing somebody by their, by their legally registered name, for instance. Um, uh, I don't think that's where we're running into trouble here. I think the issue becomes that if you don't address somebody by the, uh, the pronoun that they self identify by as I've read out to you the fact that the full force of the law will be behind a that person. I'm that that's what I, I'm a finding as trump, troubling in the legislation, but the Ontario Human Rights Commission gives people the alternative not to use pronouns and use the person's chosen name it, which is always a respectful approach. So pronouns are not necessary or not mandatory.

Speaker 6:          23:38          You can always choose the person's chosen name as a respectful approach. And therefore, I'm not aware that anybody, that there is a, um, a piece of legislation that compels you to use my proper name. In other words, once again, it's the fact that the full force of the law will be behind it when we're dealing with the group being identified in the legislation. And so, for instance, I were not to call you by your chosen name. I'm not sure you'd enjoy the full force of law behind you. Uh, um, as a result of that. And that's what I'm suggesting to you is the difference here. I'm just sorry. When you said that you always base whatever you say on what the Ontario Human Rights Commission is saying, and I'm quoting from the Ontario Human Rights Commission document. They're saying we're not mandated mandating pronouns. You can always use the person's chosen name as a respectful approach. I respectfully disagree,

Speaker 2:          24:32          but then, well I would say then that's actually an indication of just exactly how important the policy documents are written because I can quote this one which which is also from the Ontario Human Rights Commission website that says, and I quote, refusing, refusing to refer to a person by their self identified name and proper personal, proper personal pronouns. Counts constitutes gender based harassment. And so if there. If the policies are written in a coherent manner and there wasn't internal contradictions, then your statement would be a reasonable objection. But since it's not written that way, and I do believe firmly that that's a testament to the. To the degree to which it's supporting written set of policies, is it? It's full of internal contradictions and that'll be worked out very painfully within the confines of people's private lives.

Speaker 7:          25:18          Thank you sir. Good. Well, senator batters. Thanks very much. Both of you for being here. First of all, Dr Peterson. I want to go back to this issue of personal pronouns and if you could please tell our committee more about this issue. It's something that I was not at all familiar with prior to this bill being introduced and in particular about the gender neutral pronouns and your experience in pushing back against being forced to use those general neutral gender neutral pronouns.

Speaker 2:          25:49          Well, I don't think the people who initiated this legislation ever expected that there would be an absolute explosion of of identities, first of all, and also so-called personal pronouns as there has been. I think facebook now recognize as something like 71 separate gender identity categories, each of which in principle is associated with its own set of pronouns and so it's become what linguistically and it's. It's become a parody essentially. It's become linguistically unmanageable and it's also the case that words can't be introduced into the language by Fiat. I don't. I can't even think of a time when that's actually work. We're not exactly sure how words enter the common parlance, but it's certainly not that way. And so the, the, the legislation devolves into a kind of, of, of the absurdity as far as I can tell. I mean, one of the people that I discussed this with claim that the way that you kept track of someone's personal pronouns was to use your cell phone as an adjunct to your communication. And I mean that's, you wouldn't say anything like that if you knew anything about common human nature, let's say in the matter in which people communicate with one another. So

Speaker 7:          26:57          the types of pronouns are talking about just so everyone's clear, because I don't think these are common common parlance, um, ze Zer and what other sorts of gender neutral pronouns are we discussing?

Speaker 2:          27:07          Well, I have very bad memory for that sort of thing, but if you're interested in that, you can find lists of them very rapidly on the web and they'd been produced by, I think they'd been produced by people whose essential desire is to gain linguistic control. That's, that's, that's as simple as I can put it is to gain linguistic control, but they're not used popularly and, and that seems to me to be a real problem as a consequence that you make failure to make their use something that could carry a criminal penalty. So I just don't understand that and, and I don't understand how the government can justify imposing a criminal penalty on the use of words that no one either knows or uses it. It just seems preposterous to me. But there it is.

Speaker 7:          27:55          Could you please also tell us a little bit more about the, your personal experience in pushing back against this? And I mean many are familiar with your story but not everyone. So I just want to give you a little.

Speaker 2:          28:05          Well, I made a video, actually made three videos, but we'll just talk about one of them. I thought I made one criticizing bill c 16 for the reasons that I already described because I went and read the policies and I made my hair stand on end to the surrounding policies. And, uh, so I made a video stating essentially that and detailed out my reasons and um, you know, I've been following the battle of let's say, ideologies on campus for a very long period of time and I suppose I have some expertise in that and there's a, there's an ideological war that's ripping a campuses apart and it's essentially between a, an ideological variant that's rooted in what's come to be known as postmodernism with kind of the Neo Marxist base and, and modern modernism. I would say that that's accounting for all the turmoil on campuses. And I see this as an extension of this campus turmoil into the broader world.

Speaker 2:          28:58          And, and I really believe that is the proper level of analysis. I truly believe that. And so I said that I believe that this is the V, a vanguard issue in a kind of ideological war and that I'm not going to participate on the side of the people whose, whose ideological stance I find reprehensible, unforgivable and reprehensible, especially the Marxist element of it. And so I announced that I was going to use these words because I don't believe that they're instantiating to protect anyone's rights. I believe they're, that the, the, the ideologues who are pushing this movement are using unsuspecting and sometimes complicit members of the so called transgender community to push their ideological vanguard forward. And I firmly believe that so I'm not participating in that. And the fact that it's potentially illegal for me not to participate in that is something that I regard as. I think that's absolutely dreadful. It's, it makes, it puts a shutter in my heart as a Canadian that we could even possibly be in a situation like that. You know, if, if the, if the identity claims that are instantiated in this lead, in the policies surrounding this legislation are applied, it's going to be held for the psychiatrist, excuse my language. It's going to be very difficult for the biologists and the psychiatrists next. And I think we'll see that happening very soon. Thank you, Senator Gold.

Speaker 1:          30:18          Thank you. And thank you for being here. Um, uh, I, I'm never been a practicing lawyer. I was a constitutional law professor and I'm a free speech guy. Um, so I appreciate the importance of the issues that are being raised. I think respectfully they were answered free speech issues were answered quite compellingly by my former colleague, Brenda Cosmin and testimony before this committee. But I, I wanted to make three points, um, uh, Mr Peterson and there are questions sort of varied in this point. I think I heard you say that you thought that the harm to this legislation outweighs the good but, but, but there is the trans community suffers harm regularly when they're discriminated against and whatever else. One might say and worry about human rights tribunals and the like. This bill addresses and would take a major step forward towards reducing harm, uh, that are particularly vulnerable community experiences.

Speaker 1:          31:26          Second, let's see if we could zero in on where we might agree that there is nothing in the law that criminalizes or creates a, an offense to criticize the notion that identity as a social construct, which you do to criticize the way in which words come into the language. The Modern Hebrews and example of where it's coming in by fee and the academy says, does it as well for Shakespeare gave us so much of our language, but there's nothing in this bill that stands in the way of you taking a principal position against all aspects of this including your criticisms of the activist. And the issue is the Pronoun. And, and unless I'm reading it wrong, uh, Senator Pratte pointed out the Ontario Human Rights Commission policy does not say that refusing to use a person's self identified name or personal pronoun does Constitute Gender based harassment. I May, I may be wrong, but I believe it said it could and I think that's a real difference. If, if I turn to you and say, look, please call me they because how I see myself now, because it's hurtful for you to call me sir, or miss whatever, whatever it would be a. But you refuse. And I say, well, Kate, if you're uncomfortable with that because you're not comfortable with that, call me mark, and you refuse to continue to call me by the name that I'm telling you is perfect to me.

Speaker 1:          33:07          Is that not in fact, something that,

Speaker 1:          33:14          is that not something that the law can properly address? This is you were knowingly hurting me. Uh, and, and in that respect, our courts ultimately, I think are capable of striking a proper balance between people who slip up or who, for whatever reasons, just can't get the words out of their mouth and those that persist and intentionally causing it to respond. Would you agree with my characterization of the, uh, free speech as it applies to these issues? Let me jump in. Just on the legal point, after Dr Peterson posted these videos and after he ruins to the consciousness, the Ontario human rights commission deemed fit to release a new policy document called questions and answers about gender identity and pronouns. And in so doing, they said that refusing to refer to a trans person by their chosen name and pr and a personal pronoun that matches their gender identity or purposely misgendering will likely be discrimination.

Speaker 1:          34:15          So I think it's a little bit more certain than what you may have a indicated in your comments, but I'll love Dr. um, a and once again that was, that policy was, was put out after Dr Peterson began to speak on the issue and so I think that's very telling that it was a, a response if you will, to this, this, um, this issue that Dr Peterson raised. I going to know obviously Dr Pearson to go ahead with the other element of your question very briefly sir. Well, so I would say that the very idea that calling someone a term that they didn't choose causes them such irreparable harm that legal remedies should be sought. Um, rather than regarding it as a form of impoliteness that legal remedies should, should be sought, including potential violation of the hate speech codes is an indication of just how deeply the culture of victimization is sunk into our society. Okay. We'll leave it. There are a senator from

Speaker 7:          35:15          same topic with Mr Brown at when the Minister of Justice was before this committee. She said the following, there is nothing within bill [inaudible] that would compel somebody to have to call somebody by the pronouns he or she or otherwise can you comment on preposition? But I'd

Speaker 6:          35:38          agree with that. There is nothing in the bill, but the problem is that in the, uh, the government of Canada, Department of Justice website, um, they, uh, in their questions and answer section of their website which was pulled down in December, it's that top five of my brief. It makes very clear that the definitions of the terms gender identity and gender expression have already been given by the Ontario Human Rights Commission. The commission has provided helpful discussion and examples that can offer good practical guidance. The Canadian Human Rights Commission will provide similar guidance on the meaning of these terms in the Canadian Human Rights Act. Now I take that to the legislative intent and I'll agree with you that the, that the bill itself on its face does not seem to imply any manner of compelled speech. But when we're tying it so deliberately and with this expectation, that's where I think you get into a, into some trouble.

Speaker 6:          36:27          Mr Barney, he spoke about the chilling effects of overly broad accusation. I'm wondering if you consider the terms gender identity and gender expression to be equally, or do you consider one broader than the, um, I think they are overly broad definitions and, uh, and I think the only thing I can offer as a lawyer and a litigator is that, um, the courts don't like overbroad terms and I, and I would refer you to the decision of a London boy Berto Court of Appeal, where in that case the court of appeals is the objective of statutory interpretation is, does, is to discern the legislative intent from the language of the legislation if possible. And to give effect to such intent. This objective becomes difficult to attain. Where there is conflict in precision or a lack of clarity in the legislation of particularly of particular concern in the area of human rights law is that a lack of clarity will cast a chill on the exercise on the, of the fundamental freedoms such as freedom of expression and religion. And so, um, while I personally believe that the, that the terms are not properly or not clearly defined and, and somewhat ambiguous, the courts don't like that type of legislation either,

Speaker 2:          37:42          just to add two things. Um, with regards to the chill, it's already the case and I've seen this among my own students when they're teaching personality, which is what I teach, which also involves a assessment of gender differences between men and women that the proclivity now is for the advanced phd students to avoid any such discussions in their classrooms because of the potential cost of transgressing against, uh, an unknown norm, let's say is so high that it's just easier to teach other things. And so I've seen that clearly and with multiple people. And I would also say that it's no trivial matter that the department of Justice's link to the Ontario Human Rights Commission and their statements about how this legislation was going to be interpreted mysteriously disappeared in the middle of December. Of all the things that have happened to me happened in relationship to this ad that I'd been studying.

Speaker 2:          38:32          I think that was the most chilling. So because it was the, it was the, what would you say it was the smoking pistol, right? Because the issue is what's the right level of analysis? He just supposed to look at the legislation. Well, since the Justice Department said no, you're supposed to look at the surrounding policies. Well that's what I did and that's what I based my case on. And then all of a sudden the link to those, the link tying those two things together just vanished and people had to go into the Internet archives to, to, to fish it back out so that it could remain part of the public record. I think that's absolutely scandalous. Thank you. Senator. I'm adver.

Speaker 4:          39:11          Thank you chair. And thank you both of you for being here. Um, I was trying to take notes, but I think I got this right of Peterson that you talked about this bill as being an expression of vanguard of ideology. Am My, am I right in thinking in, in?

Speaker 2:          39:27          Well, I was thinking more about the policies that surrounded it but, but yes. Yeah. So I'm trying to.

Speaker 4:          39:33          Where would you as a party of one are saying that published documents from the Canadian psychological association, the American Psychological Association, the Canadian Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Canadian Psychiatry Association, and the United Nation human rights experts. So these are all, you know, these are no parties at one associated. They are all, I imagine, lots of psychologists and members of the Canadian Psychology Association and the Canadian Psychiatry. So how would you describe what you're saying, which is your opinion, which you are absolutely entitled to with what everyone is saying, plus the feelings and testimonies of the people who have suffered over 30 years. We've been taking issues to court. These are people who will. We listened to. So how would we describe that?

Speaker 2:          40:31          Okay. Well, with regards to your second point, if the people that you're listening to are randomly selected from a population, then their opinions are worthless from the perspective of, of testimony because you don't know if you're dealing with a biased sample. And that's a big problem with the public consultation process that underlies this bill and you can not appreciate that if you'd like, but it's standard practice in any, in any polling institution or any body that's attempting to extract the genuine opinion out of a so called community of people. And if that isn't followed then you can't tell if the information that you're receiving is bias. And this with regards to your first point, what exactly are all those people who aren't thinking the same way as me sake. You said that there's a bunch of them and a bunch of groups, but you never said what they're saying precisely.

Speaker 4:          41:17          Well, I think our chair who drew me out to 45 percent of your fund to vet out what they're all saying, but in general they say they oppose discrimination and harassment because of gender identity and gender expression and then there's three pages. I can show it.

Speaker 2:          41:34          I oppose discrimination against gender identity and gender expression. That's not the point. The point is the specifics of the legislation that's around it and the insistence that people will have to be a half to use compelled speech. That's what I'm objecting to. I've dealt with all sorts of people in my life, very people who don't fit in and now all sorts of different ways. I'm not a discriminatory person. There's 500 hours of my teaching to my classrooms on tape, on Youtube, but nobody's found a smoking pistol. I'm not a discriminatory individually, but I think this legislation is reprehensible and I do not believe for a moment that it will do what it intends to do. I also don't think that my opinion deviates substantially from the bodies that you're describing because you haven't provided any evidence that they say anything other than discrimination is a bad thing and I think that unreasonable discrimination is a bad thing and it's unreasonable. When people are judged for any reason other than the specific competence that they bring to say a given physician. It's not in anyone's best interest that that occurs, but I don't think that you've demonstrated in the least that the opinions that I'm putting forward are exist in opposition to the standard practices of a say of my particular discipline.

Speaker 4:          42:44          So could you. Could you repeat one more time? Your response to Senate says Golden Pratt, that the Ontario human rights commission has provided what I would say reasonable alternatives to your. Your objection to using pronouns?

Speaker 2:          43:04          Well, I think it's been made clear in the, in the presentation so far is that it depends on which part of the Ontario Human Rights Commission's policies you read. And that's a big problem. I mean that's one of the reasons I criticized this to begin with was because when I went through the policies, I could see that you're absolutely incoherent. So for example, here, let me give you another example. So there's an insistence in the Ontario Human Rights Commission that sexual preferences and immutable phenomena, which indicates at least in principle that it's biologically grounded, but on the same, by the same token, in exactly the same policies, they presume that sexual identity, gender identity and gender expression are entirely independent. It's like, sorry guys, you can't have both of those because one's a and one's not a and you can't put those together and like there's. There's endless numbers of places in the policy surround surrounding bill c 16 that are characterized by that kind of logical incoherency I mean what you're going to do to people who are transgender who are making the claim that they were saved born that way at birth, which is a strong claim. That's a biological claim. It indicates that there's a direct causal connection between some biological phenomena and the expression of a particular identity. It's actually the strongest defense that people who have, let's call them nonstandard sexual identities or gender identities, have to defend the claim. So I have to wrap it up there and move on to a senator well avenue Mr at. Thank you

Speaker 8:          44:32          very much. Mr Chair, I'll leave the time for our guests to put in their translation devices. Thank you very much for being here. My question is for Mr Peterson, do you have the interpretation now, sir,

Speaker 9:          44:50          so

Speaker 8:          44:52          I'm still trying to orient myself a little bit in this bill. I'm a little bit lost in the arguments for and against, but some arguments really struck me because some people said that without this bill there might be suicides. People would become depressed.

Speaker 9:          45:12          Okay.

Speaker 8:          45:14          Transgender people of course,

Speaker 9:          45:20          and

Speaker 8:          45:21          it seems to me that this is almost an extreme position that without this bill there would be an explosion of suicides and depression. So I'd like to ask you a question. As a professor now you work in the, the, the social sciences, you study human behavior. Are there studies or statistics about the consequences that this bill would have on those people? Is this bill, would this bill save as many lives and help as many people as it says?

Speaker 2:          45:55          Well, in, in principle, we would have that information if the policies that have already been introduced by the provincial governments were assessed properly, but as far as I know, there's been no known studies indicating that the introduction of this legislation specifically has done anything to modify the, the unfortunate rates of suicide, depression, anxiety and so forth that are bitter characteristic. Well, you could say often of marginalized groups, but that's a bit of an overstatement. So no, I don't that, that, that was part of my original claim is that there's no evidence that this sort of, um, legal redress, let's say is going to produce any of the positive consequences that are intended. And I do believe that by making the issue, let's say painfully visible, that's one way of thinking about it. There's actually had the opposite effect and it's, you know, it's, it's, it's very, very common and this is something that's, that's well known in, in the relevant social sciences that just because you intend something to happen when you make a large scale transformation doesn't indicate in any manner that that's going to be the outcome.

Speaker 2:          46:59          I mean, it would be lovely if things were that simple and I mean the best social scientists always insist that you build an outcome analysis into any, into any broad scale, what would you call a social intervention because there's a good chance it'll backfire, there's a high chance it'll backfire, so it's all presupposition and it's based at least in part on the notion that the transgender community is a community and that there are voices that speak for them homogenously and that this is what they all want and that will work as intended. And to me looking at this from, from the social science perspective, it's, it's, there's nothing about it that's credible. Missy and I also don't buy the intent, so good.

Speaker 8:          47:44          Senator Dupuis. See Ms Dot. Thank you, Mr Chairman.

Speaker 9:          47:52          Okay.

Speaker 8:          47:53          First of all, I'd like to ask a question to Mr Peterson and perhaps I would also have a question for Mr Brown. My question is as follows, Dr Peterson. I'm trying to understand your position.

Speaker 9:          48:11          Okay.

Speaker 8:          48:13          Do you see a difference between the opinions that you expressed that you were expressing today on this issue as part of this public consultation?

Speaker 9:          48:30          Okay,

Speaker 8:          48:31          and the actions that you take as a university professor where you are in a position of authority and power over your students?

Speaker 2:          48:47          Well, first of all, I don't necessarily consider myself in a position of authority and power. I consider myself in a position of responsibility. Those aren't the same thing, so I don't agree with the way that the question is formulated and I don't understand what that has to do with my stance. I mean if I believe that the legislation is going to do more harm than good and I also firmly believe which I do, that it is more in the issue of ideological move than, than, than something that's designed to address the concerns that it purports to address. I would also like to point out briefly that you know, what should have happened when I made that video and this is relevant to the question, was that like maybe people paid attention to 10 minutes to do to it for 10 minutes and maybe he'd got a newspaper article and then it disappeared.

Speaker 2:          49:33          But I put my finger on something. That's what I thought. And the fact that this issue hasn't gone away in nine months, quite the contrary, it's exploded not only in Canada but in all sorts of parts of the world means that I means to me that I have some evidence that my choice of level of analysis was correct and that there's far more going on here, so to speak. Then the mirror surface issue that we're purporting to discuss and so I take exception to the notion that I'm somehow abandoning my personal responsibility to my students, which is something that I believe is in fact driving what I'm doing. I believe that my obligation to my students constantly used to tell them what I think and to make that as informed and careful and opinion as I can possibly matter. Map Master. And that's what I do.

Speaker 8:          50:20          Zip asked him component. You can see. I think that you understand that if you come to participate or to appear a Senate committee studying a bill, regardless of what we think of the question that. I mean, my question for you is, do you make a difference between your opinion, what you say and the fact that the university which pays you, I believe unless I'm wrong, the university considers you to be under its legal responsibility and so you are in a situation of authority over your students and this means that you can give an, a or an f to your students

Speaker 2:          51:10          components of the legislation. That's rolling. I'm going to move on. Senator Mcdonald,

Speaker 1:          51:17          you can care for you. Um, the thing that concerns me most in this legislation is compelled speech. And I think that's very concerning. Um, this committee is hearing from Megan Murphy who told us her opposition to this concept of gender fluidity, fluidity because you believe gender is a social construction. And Dr Gad Saad also posed for this legislation because of his belief in evolutionary biology. What this shows is that with bill [inaudible] and we are prematurely shutting down a discussion on gender and sex as far from settler appears to be fair, settled. Uh, and in my opinion, when we looked at the provincial definition is set up by the commissions. We are enshrining the theory of a gender spectrum into the law. I'm one of you can comment on

Speaker 2:          52:10          that's exactly what we're doing. We're in and I think I think that that might even be more dangerous than in my opinion, than the compelled speech issue because the social constructionist view of gender isn't another opinion. It's just wrong. So because I can. I can tell you why that is fairly. I'll take one minute to do that. Well, the proposition that's instantiated, for example in this particular visual, which is a good representation of the of the philosophy of the policies, is that there is no causal relationship between these four dimensions of identity and that's palpably observed. I mean 98 percent of people. It's 99 point seven percent of people who inhabit a body with a given biological sex identify it with that biological sex. It's. It's incredibly tightly linked. If you can't attribute causality to a link that that's tight, that's tight. You have to dispense with the notion of causality altogether and then of the people who who identify as say, as male or female who were also biologically male or female.

Speaker 2:          53:15          The vast majority of them have this sexual preference that would go along with that and the gender identity and gender expression. These, these levels of analysis are unbelievably tightly linked and the, the evidence that biological factors play a role in determining gender identity is in a word overwhelming. There isn't a serious scientist alive who would dispute that now you get, you get disputes about it, but they always stem from essentially from the humanities. And as far as I'm concerned, I've looked at it very carefully. Those arguments are entirely ideologically driven. It's a tenant of the ideology that identity is socially constructed. And that's partly why it's been instantiated into law because there's no way they're going to win the argument, but they can certainly win, let's say the propaganda war, especially by foisting, this sort of reprehensible, uh, advertising information on children. And that's part of the, that's part of the express intent.

Speaker 1:          54:09          I would add. A trans complainants have been covered under the existing grounds of sex before the tribunals across Canada. And as the Minister of Justice said, they are bringing this legislation in as a symbolic gesture. And so, uh, I leave it to you to question what that gesture may be, but, but this community has been protected under the existing grounds that are found in most of the human rights codes across, uh, across Canada and on the grounds of sex here, Senator Israel, uh, Mr Brown or Mr Peterson, the, uh, Justice Wagner from the Supreme Court in a seminar, the Ottawa University, uh, in early March of this year, which was a couple of months ago that stated the following, of course, he was not giving a decision from the bench you. Nobody was expressing his views. And if you allow me, I will quote him. It's short when the court eventually faces a question touching on transgender identity. These to preposition will provide essential frames of reference. First one, that identity is not fixed, but changing as the first proposal. And then the second one, that identity is not innate but contextual. I'll repeat that the identity is not innate, but contextual or,

Speaker 10:         55:34          uh, end of quote. Um, I, I, I read that and I try to understand the implication, uh, of this, you know, those two binary kinds of, uh, of, uh, elements of that and he says the court, so I bet that he might have spoken to colleagues or you know, the profession generally would you, would you have a quarrel with that kind of approach to the definition of transgender a reality or a few things that it's a proper way of approaching legally the issues because as you forcefully explain, uh, somebody, one day my challenge, uh, you know, the proposal, the policies and all wet could stem from the enactment of those legislations. So in other words, we'll find ourselves into court one day and we will have to, are, you know, to analyze and argue the case at least taking into account that references those references. That just is wagner mentioned not long ago. So I'll you, you will react to that. Well, I want to make sure I understand your question properly. So

Speaker 2:          56:51          when, when the justice said this, was he implying that the identity is not fixed but it is changing and that identity wasn't innate and it was contextual or was he outlining the, the, the, the arena within which

Speaker 10:         57:05          this debate might take place? No, he was essentially, it was, you know, there was another speech on this. Essentially it was more if I can use an expression that Mr Brown will understand. It was rather an arbitrary, you know, in a conference. The conference was about identity. But of course, uh, since uh, you know, identity is a topic of comment on common debates in Canada. He felt that, uh, it was fully, if he would, you know, I should say, put his grain of salt in the public debate by establishing what he thinks is, you know, out to define transgender identity and establish some parameters. Let's,

Speaker 2:          57:44          let's assume that it is changing and contextual. Okay. Then why is conversion therapy a problem? See, this is what I see. The thing is is that when I started opposing this bill, people immediately assume that I was transphobic and racist and all these other epithets that they're perfectly willing to try it forth at a moment's notice, but you know, there's been a tremendous attempt to make conversion therapy for people who are gay, illegal, right? And the proposition is predicated on the idea that the identity, the sexual preference, identity is not changing nor contextual. It's fundamental. And really what that means is that it's grounded in something like biology. It's, okay, fine, let's scrap that. Okay, now it's going to be changing and contextual. Okay, then why can't it be changed with context? So this is part of the problem with the policies. Is there so incoherent that they're going to work against the people that they're designed to protect?

Speaker 2:          58:39          Now people have a hard time believing I care about that, but you know, the fact that I've been called things doesn't mean that that's what I am. So you know a lot of people who have, let's call it a nonstandard identity, the tightest argument they have for public acceptance of that identity is that it's powerfully constrained by biological processes that are beyond their voluntary control. So instantiate this view of humanity, the social constructionist view of humanity, and you can waive those claims goodbye because they are completely, they are at complete odds with the social constructionist view point and I think that's a big mistake and I, I really do believe that that will backfire hard against the people who this legislation is designed to protect. If it's mutable, changeable, only subjective and transformable on a whim, then why should anyone have any respect for it? Gentleman, they going to have to intervene. The hour has flown by and we very much appreciate your appearance here today and your testimony as well. Thank you. We'll suspend briefly before hearing from an expert.
