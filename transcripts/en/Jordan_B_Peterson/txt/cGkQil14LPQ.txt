Speaker 1:          00:06          Should be this. And you mentioned these ideas of responsibility, of virtue of respect. You've, I think, detailed what you think students shouldn't do in these examples of like protests and these examples of certain types of activist tactics. What advice would you have for students? How can students make the changes that they want to make? Particularly, do you have any advice for students here? Yeah. Read great books. Really, man, you've got this four year period that has been carved out of your lives by society. They, they, it's, it's given you an identity, like a high quality identity and freedom at the same time. And you're not going to get that again in your life. You've got to, you've got a respectable identity, university students and complete freedom associated with that or as near as you're ever going to get. And you've got these unbelievable libraries that are full of the writings of people who are, who are intelligent and articulate beyond comprehension and, you know, and, and you can go there and you can learn all this and you might think, well, why should you learn it?

Speaker 1:          01:05          Um, well you learn it to get a job or you learn it to get good grades or you learn it to get a degree. And that's all nonsense. It's nonsense. The reason that you come to university to be educated is because there is nothing more powerful than someone who is articulate and who can think and speak. It's power and I mean power of the best, sort of its authority and influence and respectability and competence. And so you come to university to craft your highest skill and your highest skill is to be found in articulated speech. And if you're, if you're, if you're a master at formulating your arguments, you win everything. And better than that, when you win everything, everyone around you wins too. Because to transform yourself into, let's consider you consider your transformation, does something approximating the logos. It means you shine a light on the whole world.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Well, there's nothing more exciting to do with that. There's nothing better you can possibly do. And to think that you're going to university to be, you know, trained to have a job, it's like great. That's a hell of a lot better than being unemployed and covered with cheeto dust while you're snacking away in front of your video game in the basement. But it's not. It's not a, and I don't want to have anything against video games by the way, but it's hardly a triumphant call to, to being in the world. And that's what universities should be calling forth. It's like God, you people, you, you know, I know what Harvard students are like. I taught here for five years. You people are spectacular. You're spectacular. You're, you're, you're, you're all capable of being world beaters. You transform yourself into something that's articulated and sensible and grounded in history and knowledgeable and wise.

Speaker 1:          02:41          Man, you can do anything you want and hopefully anything you want for good because if you have any sense, everything you want to do would be for the good because there's nothing more compelling or meaningful or, or useful in combating the tragedy of life than to, than to struggle with all your soul on behalf the good and the universities and forgotten that. It's why everyone's bailing out of the humanities and they should. The humanities are corrupt. They're corrupt because they're not telling the students this. It's so bloody obvious. It's like learn to think, learn to speak room to read. It makes you a super power and individual superpower. You have it under. I don't understand why that isn't just told to students. It's not that hard to understand it. Everyone wants to hear it. It's like, really? I could do this. I can do that.

Speaker 1:          03:31          It's like, yeah, really you could do that and the whole society around you is labored for really thousands of years to provide every single one of you with this spectacular opportunity that you have while your undergraduates and graduate students here, man, they're just, everyone's just praying that you would come here and manifest everything that you could manifest and that's what you should be doing. Instead of waving plaque cards and complaining about how your old pressed for God's sake, you see these Yale students complaining about their oppression. It's just, it just leaves me aghast. It's like, well, we're against the ruling class. It's like, no, no, no. Your baby ruling class members, you're young.

Speaker 2:          04:19          The

Speaker 1:          04:19          only reason you're not rich is cause you're young. You know that's the best. Really. That's the, if you look at the 1%, even the dreaded 1% you know, most of those people are old. Why? Well, when you progress through life, if you're reasonably successful, you trade in your promising youth for your wealthy old age, but you're still bloody old you when you trade it. Would you trade your youth for that? Like if you factor age out of the economic equation, things look a lot different. One. Of course, older people have more money. If they have any sense, they'd been collecting it for their whole life. Is that somehow unfair? It's not unfair unless you want to want to be poverty stricken when you're 70 and you and you don't want to be poverty, strict pop poverty stricken when you were 17 so I just don't understand what's happened to the universities.

Speaker 1:          05:06          I can't believe that you're not told when you come the first day, look man, you are right. You're here on a heroic mission. You're going to take your capacity to articulate yourself to levels that are undreamed of, you're going to come out of here. I'm unstoppable. You're going to be able to do anything you want. It's like that's what you're here for. Instead, you're taught that, well, you know the world's a pretty oppressive place and you're probably the bottom of the victim pile and, and, and, and there's, and there's, there's virtually nothing you can do about it except no deconstruct the patriarchy and it's so rude deed and so pathetic that, that the university should be embarrassed that that's what they're peddling to students. I'm embarrassed by it. You know, I've gone on public record telling parents, how do you well, send your boys to trade school because at least they'll learn something useful. And that's a terrible thing for someone like me to say because I do believe that the, the being articulated in educated in the highest possible manner is there's nothing that's better for you and for society. And why are the why of the university's forgotten this? Well, that's postmodern neo Marxism for you. Then the philosophy of intense resentment and oppression and group identity and god, it's just.
