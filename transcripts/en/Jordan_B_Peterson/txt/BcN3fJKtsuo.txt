Speaker 1:          00:01          Well, I won't back down, you can stand up at the gates of hell, but I won't.

Speaker 2:          00:18          In the first video I posted this morning, I read a letter from a variety of student activist groups calling for my silencing apology and discipline. In this video, I'm going to read a similar letter from a branch of the Canadian Union of public employees asking for similar measures. And so this is the second letter. This is from the Canadian Union of public employees. Actually, it's from one branch of the Canadian Union of public employees. Um, I should also note that another president of the Canadian Union of public employees actually came and talked to me yesterday on, on something unrelated to this about his fear that the new university sexual harassment policy is so broad and so wide that it risks, uh, turning normal misunderstandings into career destroying a debacle. And so, so I'm just telling you that so that you know that, you know, there's not homogeneity on the left and, and there's not homogenous eat within the Canadian Union public employees either.

Speaker 2:          01:16          But anyways, here's what they want. Jordan Peterson's comments. Make the U of t a hostile place to work and study as queer people who study and work at the University of Toronto. We have the right to fully access all the resources of the university without fear. We have the right to enter and participate in every classroom, every lab, library, athletic facility, in event space, and we have the right to participate as ourselves. We have the right to go to work and be treated with dignity and respect. We know no one and explanation of much less a defense of our gender or sexuality. We sit insist on a truth, so simple that it shouldn't need to be stated that we have not. Psychology professor has who has never met us are the authorities on our own identities and yes, we have the right to be recognized and referred to as we are in the ways we choose reviews to low.

Speaker 2:          02:00          Anyone. Least of all, someone who could be our professor or our work supervisor to the side that he knows better who we are and what is the right way to refer to us. If insisting on this kind of recognition seems petty or an unimportant to som, we remind them of our long and continuing struggle as queer people to gain the same rights, freedoms and recognitions enjoyed by CIS straight people. CIS. That's a word I really don't like. By the way we remind that's manufactured word and that's exactly the kind of word that I not ever going to be compelled to say. We remind them that for us going to work already involves daily Calculus, situation by situation, colleague by calling of what and how much of ourselves to reveal. We have to remain conscious of all at all times of the details of our lives that may make us physically unsafe.

Speaker 2:          02:42          Prompt, humiliating questions lead to social alienation or takeaway our chance next employment contract we desperately need in this city in 2016. It is not safe to be a queer person. That's why we had a month long pride festival last year and it is especially safe to be a trans or gender nonconforming person at the University of Toronto. Our commitment must not only be to protect, but to affirm and elevate our colleagues who faced discrimination in danger in their daily lives. We should be proactive in inviting, recognizing that the default expectation for queer people is that we will not be welcomed in new environments. We entered and stand reason comments by professor Jordan Peterson have communicated that in some parts of our working lives, trans and gender nonconforming people are not welcome, that will be denied basic recognition of our humanity, that we will be called delusional and lectured to and that a potential supervisor will be given authority to decide who we really are and how we should be referred to at work in our unions will view this situation constitutes a clear and unacceptable violation of our human rights and our workplace rights.

Speaker 2:          03:42          It has also a violation of the collective agreements we negotiate with the university to set the terms and expectations of our working lives. These collective agreements guarantee US protection from quote verbal conduct or other forms of communication that emphasize the sex, sexuality or gender identity or expression of an employee in a manner that the actor, uh, he Jordan Peterson knows or ought reasonably to know, is unwelcome or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working or learning environment. Professor Peterson ought reasonably to know that refusing to his dress, his students and his tds as they request to be addressed and deriding their identities in public by. I have no idea what, what that means is unwelcome behavior that makes his classroom, his department and his university intimidating, hostile or offensive for us. The UFT administration ought reasonably to know that when comments are made public, they need to be swiftly and categorically condemned and appropriate actions need to be taken to restore a workplace free of intimidation and hostility.

Speaker 2:          04:38          But in case any of our managers and supervisors didn't understand that actions like professor Peterson's and the silence of the university administration in response are unwelcomed, hostile and offensive. Let us be the ones to tell you they are. And now you know, we expect and demand better and our union will be organizing and acting accordingly. Sincerely, qp three, nine, zero. Two Queer Caucus, Canadian Union of public employees. Local three nine. Oh, two. So if you're looking for something to do to help you could write a letter to the individuals whose emails I have posted in the information box and the description box that that is associated with this video. So email them and email all of them and send me a copy if you want. That would be helpful. Be particularly useful if it came from students. Thanks very much. Bye. Bye.
