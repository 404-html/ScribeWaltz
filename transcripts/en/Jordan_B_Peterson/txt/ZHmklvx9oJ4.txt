Speaker 1:          00:00:00       And I'm so sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       so momentarily we're going to return to the basic story and I want to talk to you today about how your brain organizes your perceptions and then I want to talk to you about how that's represented in hematology. First thing I'd like to point out is that we talked about the difference between Darwinian, the Newtonian viewpoints a while back, and one of the,

Speaker 2:          00:00:40       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       one claim that you might make if you were a Darwinian is that whatever your brain is adapted to his reality. No, I mean that seems to me to be the central claim of Darwinian evolution is that you can't define reality any more accurately than that which selects. Now I want to tell you about how I think the brain is organized and then I want to show you, I hope that the way fundamental narratives work can be mapped onto that brain structure. And to me that implies that there's something right about the fundamental narratives because otherwise why would they map onto the brain structures that have evolved to adapt as to the environment? Now you don't. People think about reality. I know subjective terms and they think about it as decomposable into tiny sub units. But I think that that's a limited viewpoint, a powerful but limited viewpoint. I think it's much more realistic to assume that whatever reality is is more like a continual interplay, a very, very complex patterns.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       And

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       I suppose you could make the case that those patterns are ultimately made out of particles, but that's even, that's not exactly true because the particles have to be arrayed in space. So that's part of the atomic theory is that there's not just particles, subatomic particles and atomic particles, but if they're arrayed in space and if there are rate in space, that means the manner in which they're are rate can be informative. And if you reduce the phenomena to the particle without taking into account the patterning of the array of particles, then there's levels and levels and levels of information that you lose and those information that those levels of information are, they may not be relevant for our physical understanding of the, of the makeup of atomic and subatomic particles. But they're definitely relevant to whether or not we can walk across the street. And so I would say if you're related to reality properly, the kind of information that you're processing is precisely the kind of information that allows you to cross the street properly and to do all the other things during your day and your weeks and your months that you have to in order to stay alive and, and, and fundamentally in some sense to propagate.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       So, all right, so we'll start with the neuropsychological argument. Now we've already established the idea that these little frames of reference or maps or stories or whatever you call them, I'll call them stories, I think from here on in our little goal directed units. And there are units of conception and emotion and perception and behavior, their little subpersonalities and there's some personality has an initial starting point and a destination point. And then it can implement behaviors to transform the starting point into the destination point. And then you might say, well, what forms these little subpersonalities? And the answer to that is very complex, but one answer is fundamental motivate motivations. And so I arranged the fundamental motivations on this particular diagram pointed out that you can roughly consider motivations as those that maintain you and those that propagate you. Now it's just a heuristic, it's just a way of thinking about it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       Um, under self maintenance there's thermal regulation, thirst, hunger and elimination. There's all sorts of other things as well, but those will do for the time being. And then under self propagation there's affiliate of desire and sexual desire. Now the thing that's quite interesting about all this is that you know, there are, there are brain structures that underlie these fundament, the manifestation of these fundamental subpersonalities. Now people tend to think about them either as motivations or emotions. And I think that's a use and other useful heuristic. And that you could say roughly speaking, that a motivation pops up, an entire frame of reference and an emotion tends to orient you within that frame of reference. But that's only a conceptual simplification because what you see when you look at the actual brain structures is that like there isn't an emotion center. There are a bunch of micro units in the brain.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       And each of, and there are separable micro units for different emotions and different motivations and they don't necessarily have that much in common in terms of their locale except that they tend to be relatively deep in the brain. So some are hypothalamic and summer in the Amygdala in summer in the periaqueductal gray, which seems to be responsible for pain responses and so we can classify things as motivations and emotions, but that doesn't map one to one on the underlying brain structures. Now I think what we'll do with regards to talking about the brain is we'll start from the bottom up and it's appropriate to start from the bottom up because you are more dependent on your ancient brain structures. Then you are on your modern brain structures in that if you damage your modern brain structures, and I mean relatively modern, let's say the ones that have really evolved in great detail over the last 2 million years, the cortical cap, particular the prefrontal Cortex, a lot of the visual Cortex, if you damage that, you can pretty much go on.

Speaker 1:          00:06:31       Now you know you're going to have one impairment or another impairment, but you can still stay alive. However, there are structures that are lower down that if you damage, that's the end of you. So for example, the ascending reticular activating system, which is the thing that wakes you up when you're asleep at night, when you, when a noise occurs that shouldn't occur, it's, it seems to be the activating center for consciousness, whatever that means. It's way deep down in the brain. It's way down at the top of the spinal cord, roughly speaking. And if you twist your head in a car accident a little bit too roughly, and you shear off they ascending fibers, then you're in a coma permanently and nothing can wake you up. And that's pretty interesting. You know, that consciousness, which we think of again, you know, our tendency is to think about that as a function of the higher cortical systems is dependent completely on something that's unbelievably ancient.

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       So, you know, and it begs the question, well at exactly what level of neuronal complexity do you have to be before you have some consciousness. And the answer to that is we don't know because of the relationship between consciousness and neuronal structure is insanely complex. So for example, you have very neurone neuron heavy structures in your brain. The cerebellum, which has about as many, it has a very rough outer coding like the cortex and it has about as many neurons as the cortical she does. And yet you can take it out of people. They don't seem to show any impairment of consciousness, but they, they, you know, they get a tax sick and they can't control their behavior that well. They have a hard time guiding it and, but that seems to be more or less it now it isn't because there is other things the cerebellum does, but my point is you can have massive massively neuron heavy structures that seem to be related in, in very minimal ways to our experience of consciousness.

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       You know, in your autonomic nervous system is sort of like that too. There's a lot of neurons in your autonomic nervous system. But I think it's a mistake to say that we're precisely conscious of our autonomic nervous system, although now and then we're conscious of its outputs, you know, it governs our, the operation of our organs and all the things that are so complex that we aren't allowed to mess with them as conscious beings, but it's not conscious. And then while somehow some neurons are conscious and we, I tell you, we don't know anything about consciousness. We really don't. We don't have a clue. And I think it's probably because we're formulating the question wrong. You know, those people are people who are materialists reductionists and they believe that consciousness is an emergent property of the underlying neuronal neuronal function. But the problem with that philosophy is that it's predicated on the assumption that they understand what the matter is that's making up that neuronal substrate.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       And I can tell you that by the time we were able to reduce consciousness to its underlying material structure, we'll think of whatever matter is in a way that's completely different than the way we think of it now. You know, so there might be an eventual reduction, but at the same time there's going to be a transformation of the theories. You know, it's clear that we don't understand material that well, particularly because when you go down into the underlying, you know, the tiny underlying substructures at the subatomic level, it behaves in a very, very peculiar manner. So, so anyways, you know, all bets are off with regards to consciousness, but it also does seem to be something that's likely very ancient, you know, and uh, you know, there are people who've attributed consciousness to insects. Insects by the way, seem to go out of their way to take hallucinogenic drugs, which is quite interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       So the, the Flyer Garrett for example, is a mushroom that, it's the famous red and white mushroom that you always see in fairy tales and in Super Mario brothers and like it pops up everywhere and flies will come and take a bite of it. And then they fall unconscious beside the mushroom and they stay there for like 10 or 15 minutes and then they get up. But they'll go eat it again. And reindeer really like them too. And they get blitzed out of their mind on m, Anita miscarriers. And so it, and, and there's, there's evidence for the desire to transform states of consciousness way, way down in the animal kingdom, way farther than you'd think. So you know, God only knows and then you think, well, a big brain is necessary, but you consider something like, uh, Irene Pepperberg, um, African gray parrot, which died a couple of years ago, a famous animal which could speak better than a three year old kid, four year old kid, and had a good, good vocabulary.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       More than 500 words. And it could put together meaningful phrases. It could speak better than a chimpanzee. They use sign language of course. But like this was one smart bird. And if they think about a bird, I mean, it has no brain a bird. It's got a brain like this big. And now I know a bird isn't very big and that actually makes a difference. But the fact that that much intelligence can be packed into that small an area means as far as I'm concerned, that we don't really understand very much about how the brain works. But we do understand some things and most of the things we understand have actually been discovered by animal experimentalists, which, uh, which is a useful thing to know because of course there's lots of people who don't think that animal experimentation is a good idea. Or that we could substitute computer models, which is of course a Spec, spectacularly idiotic theory.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       Because obviously if we had accurate computer models, we wouldn't need to do the animal experimentation, you know, so we're not going to build a computer model that's better than our current understanding, at least not, not yet. We May, we may in the future. So anyways, you can think of the basic elements, the basic structures that are producing these little subpersonalities, um, as, as the output of fundamental biological systems are their motivations or emotions and the structure that appears to be most responsible for this sort of thing. At least initially is the hypothalamus. And I should show you a little bit about the hypothalamus, just so you kind of have a sense of what it is. Um, it's not very big and you see in this diagram that it sits right on top of this, of the spinal cord and the base part of the brain.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       So that's just that little bitty area there, which, you know, it looks from the diagram to be maybe one, 1% of the entire brain mass or something like that. And I think I mentioned to you before that if you take a cat and you take all of its brain off except the hypothalamus, roughly speaking, as long as it's a female cat in a restricted environment, it can pretty much live a cat life except that it's hyper exploratory, which I do think is quite remarkable. You know, cause you'd think it would just lay there passively, right with, since it doesn't have a brain, but, um, the hypothalamus, and I'll show you some more pictures here about types. They all must. So this is a rat hypothalamus and this is a diagram from Larry Swanson who's a real genius and well worth reading, although very complicated. Um, he's a developmental neuro anatomist if I remember correctly.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       And he's interested in how the brain and folds across the course of feet of fetal development and all sorts of different animals. You know, assuming that by doing that in part you can track the evolution, but you can also understand the relationship between one brain part in another. Now what you see here, you see all those little subunits of the Hypothalamus, they're, they're, they're um, indicated in orange, green and black. And so the first thing that you can see is that the hypothalamus is not one thing. It's a bunch of, what do you call those? Um, Ganglia I think is the correct name for the hypothalamic sub organs. And so it's called a hypothalamus sort of for convenience sake. You know, I mean, you can identify it anatomically and it might be a good shorthand for, you know, a rough description of the, of the macro structure of the brain.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       But of course the problem with the brain is, is that, you know, it's pattern one at this level and it's pattern to at this level it's pattern three at this level. And you know, you can go a long ways down before you run out of complexity and a cell is an unbelievably complicated thing and you have, God only knows how many of those things in your brain I think, I don't remember exactly what the latest estimates are, but it's in the hundreds of billions in each of those cells is like, it's complex as a, as a factory in some, like a really complex factory and it's full. They're full of these little molecular machines that are doing things that are so complicated and amazing. You just can't believe it when you, I've seen, you know, computer animations of some of these structures and operation there. The complexity of what they do, you know, to, to take the DNA molecule apart and men too.

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       And then to rebuild it little bit by little bit and to do error correction at the same time. It's like I, it just boggles the mind. You can't, you cannot, I cannot see how you can possibly account for that. Using a straight, sort of Newtonian deterministic model of, of like, of clockwork behavior. The stuff is so sophisticated, you know, it looks more like advanced robotics than it does like the, you know, the interaction of tiny little molecules. There are molecules that work with the DNA that can walk and as they walk, they carry other molecules. And not only can they think things walk, they can walk over obstacles. It's like, and they're like, they're like made out of 10 molecules. It's like, what's going on? You know, it just, it's just beyond belief. Okay. So all of these little nucleus nuclei are, I think that's what they're called, actually, nuclei in the hypothalamus.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       They're all doing slightly different things. So there's subserving while they're radically different things, although they have a commonality of function. And so roughly what you could say is that one half of the hypothalamus is devoted to popping up these little subpersonalities that are devoted to the, the, uh, um, satiation, the satisfaction of fundamental biological requirements. And so, you know, it's not obvious what a fundamental biological requirement is because again, that's a heuristic. It's not a club. It's not a category, but we can agree it's a fuzzy category, but we can agree on some of its contents. And so of course thirst and hunger and the need to breathe would be in there. And then we might also add pain and sexual desire and um, the need for play, although that's a separate circuit and it's not mediated by hypothalamic structures. There's a different circuit for play, play, slash, affiliation.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       So, but roughly speaking, the, the what an animal basically chases and requires on a day to day and week to week basis is mediated in large part by the hypothalamus. And the hypothalamus is also a crucial nexus in the brain for identifying what's going on in the body and then telling the brain what to do about it. So for example, the hypothalamus is the thing that makes you hungry and the thing that makes you thirsty. And it does that because it monitors levels of, of, of substances such as sugar in your bloodstream. And, and also, um, you know, the degree to which you're hydrated and you know, you can, you can, um, sustain tiny little bits of damage to the hypothalamus with unbelievably extreme consequences. So for example, if you get unlucky, you can develop hyperphosphatemia or I don't remember the technical for it, but uncontrollable thirst. And so if that part of your hypothalamus is damaged, people just can't keep you away from water supplies.

Speaker 1:          00:17:57       He'll just drink and drink and drink and drink and drink and drink and drink until you drown and you can't control it. So the hypothalamus is no joke in hyperphagic has the same thing except in relationship to food. So, and on, there have been reports of people who've developed all, I knew a guy in Montreal who, who used to work at Harvard, his name was Frank Irvin, and he did some of the earliest studies at, in the world on the physiology of violent crime. And frank had identified, um, the role of epilepsy as a progenitor to violent crimes. And so, you know, the defensive rage circuit as part of the hypothalamus. And if you, if you're unlucky, you can have a particular form of epilepsy that will activate the defensive rage system. I knew someone who had, who had a seizure condition like that, and then they get uncontrollably aggressive.

Speaker 1:          00:18:50       Now this guy is quite an interesting story. So it first happened to him when he was about 18 and he was out drinking in a bar and alcohol lowers your seizure threshold. So it was out drinking in a bar and all of a sudden he got up and tore his shirt off and then his friends were coming. Like he was in an aggressive stance and backed into the corner and his friends were coming close to him and he told them, go away or I'll hit you. Now. He was a very well socialized person. So I think what happened is that he went into this defensive rage state, but because he was so well socialized, he could tell people to stay that way, stay away from him. But he couldn't stop himself from hitting them and attacking them if they got close enough. So anyways, I believe at that point he slapped a police officer who came to rescue them and they took him to the hospital.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       And on the way there he hit his fingers against the hood of the car and put dents in it. And then when he got up to the hospital, now I don't remember the particulars of this, but he picked up a kidney bowl, which is like an enamel covered steel ball and twisted it in an in a figure eight. It's like, yeah, try that. It's not so easy. So in the next time it happened, he was in another bar. And so what Ha, what the hypothesis was then was that someone had spiked his alcohol with some sort of drug gay, but he went. But that was never demonstrated. But he got off of all that because he had no record. He was a perfectly peaceful person. And then the next time it happened, he was in another bar and he did the same thing. He backed into corner, ripped off his shirt.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       And then he told me that when he was looking, he looked down the hallway and all he could see was fire. And then a police woman came to to get him because of the bar phone, the police and he hit her. And then after that he had eeg testing, which showed that he was susceptible to seizures. And so he swore off alcohol. I've never had another drink and he's like 35 now. I never had another drink in his life. And it never happened again. But it's just a good example of of, there was a kid at the University of Texas at Austin about 30 years ago who had seemed to have a perfectly reasonable, you know, family life and so forth, reasonable upbringing. And he started to become increasingly violent in his fantasies and he climbed up onto a tower cause there was a high tower at the University of Texas at Austin and he took a high powered rifle and I think he shot 16 people before they finally got him.

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       And you know, when they, when they did an autopsy at a fast growing tumor that was pressing on the hypothalamus. So the hypothalamus is no joke. You know? And for those of you whose introduction to neuropsychology has made you assumed that the Cortex is in control, let me tell you, the cortex is only con in control when you, when all of your other basic requirements are satiated. And since you're a modern person and you live in luxury that's unparalleled in the history of the world, all of your fundamental biological sub personalities are always satiated. And so that's what you think you're like, but you're only like that because you've beat, you never been anywhere where you weren't like that. So, so anyways, now here's one of the things that's cool about the hypothalamus. So the first thing is, is you have these different subsystems say these different nuclear that are responsible for these different subpersonalities oriented towards sexuality, oriented towards hunger, oriented towards Thurs, oriented towards temperature regulation, et Cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       You know, and I think of them as sub personalities because they have a viewpoint. They want something that they want to go somewhere, they want to accomplish it efficiently, and they have emotions that go along with it. So that, you know, if you're going for some water and you drop a glass or somebody gets in your way, or the tap is working, you're going to feel frustration and anxiety and irritation. So they come fully equipped with emotions. They have their own motor outputs, which they basically prime. And those would be the motor outputs that are, uh, aggregations of habits that you have been able to learn that have the eight of you previously in your water searching behavior. So for us, that would be, you know, getting a glass out of the cupboard. That's a gripping issue. And then a transport issue. And then you have to turn on the tap.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       And so, and Luria who a famous Russian neuropsychologist called those things kinetic melodies. And so if you think about it from a p a jetty and perspective and alluring in perspective, at the same time, you can think that piaget talked about how children put together basic, you know, motor they're not reflex is exactly their complex sequences of what started as reflexes. And then those can be linked together in a, in a sort of, in this sort of dance that you're always doing with your body and each of those little dances, you know, we think water seeking, you're going to have a set of water relevant dances that you can do that you know your experiences taught you to become expert at. And when you get thirsty then knows or liked the dis-inhibited. That's my guess. They're

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       disinhibited and prepared for execution, you know, and then the specifics of the circumstance that you're in determine which ones are deceiving is inhibited enough to actually run. It's like you're full of little machines and they're all on there ready to go, but they're all shut. They're all like held in status in some sense by cortical inhibition. It's like, I like to think of the brain, sort of like a nuclear reactor, you know, the core is really active, it's on, but then you have all these rods going into the core to keep it from, from uh, going critical. And the CORTEX is sort of like that in relationship to the lower parts of the brain. Those parts of the brain, man, they're, they're alive. They're like, they're like the titans of mythology. You know, they're sitting down there, these fundamental forces and they're ready to leap into action at, at a moment's notice.

Speaker 3:          00:24:33       But the cortex basically keeps them inhibited and it seems to do that. So imagine that you have a vision of your desired future. Okay. And then a vision of the transformation stages that you're going to undertake to move from where you are to that desired future. Okay. So then what you're doing is you're comparing your interpretation of the present to your interpretation of the desired future. And then as long as those two things match, which the hippocampus is the hippocampus is the thing that's determining that, it's the thing that's computing the match between your fantasy of what you want to happen with your fantasy about what is happening. As long as that matches, then the hypothalamus, the hippocampus basically and, and we don't know exactly how this works, although it seems to work to some degree through modulation of the reticular activating system, the match.

Speaker 3:          00:25:28       If the hippocampus matches what you want with what's happening, then all these other little sub systems are basically shut off and if they, if the hippocampus detects a mismatch, which is when novelty occurs, right, rights like something went wrong, then you get disinhibition of the reticular activating system. It's like you wake up and then everything's primed for action and you know that solves the problem of what you should do when you don't know what to do. And that answer is you should get ready to do everything. You should be on alert and ready to implement whatever actions, whatever. It's not even whatever actions, it's more like you get, you should be ready to implement whatever subpersonalities the situation seems to call for as soon as you're able to identify what they are. But otherwise it's sort of like an army that's all of a sudden gone on alert.

Speaker 3:          00:26:17       You don't know who's going to be called on, but everybody should be ready. That's a high stress situation. Okay, so, so part of the hypothalamus is, let's say for the sake of argument, it's popping up all these little subpersonalities that have to do with basic basic instincts. The words are all wrong because they're not like an instinct sounds like a drive and people aren't driven. We're not that simple. We're much more flexible than that. Even rats aren't driven. There is a very, um, seminal experiment that was done at the height of behaviorism. So, you know, the idea with the behavior is perfectly smart idea was that the way a rat learned was it would start with a reflex. It sort of in the Piagetian sense. And then you could teach it a new routine, which was an aggregation of little tiny reflexes. You could teach it a new routine by rewarding it.

Speaker 3:          00:27:10       So let's say here's what you do with the rat. So you want to teach the route to climb the ladder and go across it a little ladder. And so the rats sniffing around in the, in the, in the, in that little rat cage, and then it gets close to the ladder. And so you give it a food palate and then it hangs around close to the ladder. And just cause you've reinforced, like you really reinforced the manifestation of those micro behaviors that are associated with the ladder. And then maybe at some point the rod puts one little paw up on the first rung, you give it a food pellet and then pretty soon the rats going like this fairly frequently. And then the next thing that happens is it puts two paws up there. And you know, if your patient using reward, you can get that rap too.

Speaker 3:          00:27:50       You can get that damn rap to do damn near anything. Skinner taught pigeons to navigate guided missiles by maps in the Second World War by packing, which is, they never did use them. But really it's pretty impressive. You know, you think pigeons are stupid. They're not stupid. They can read maps, which is pretty damn amazing. So, so the idea was that what the animal is doing is chaining together deterministic reflexes, right? But the thing about a deterministic reflex is that it's not flexible, right? If it's a deterministic reflex, it really is a drive action, a initiates action be that initiates action, see, and it's a fixed action pattern. And some animals do seem to learn that way. So there's these little animals, I think their moles that do this or shrews shrews. Let's say you teach a shrew to gill from point a to b by a very inefficient maze, like route.

Speaker 3:          00:28:48       But the shrew could just walk straight there. But once he learns to do this, but he can't figure out that he's going from here to here. Whereas if you train a right to do this, the rat will figure out, you know, to hell with all this circuitous ness, it's just going to go straight from point a to point b. And that was one of the first that that finding was part of what indicated to early neuro, neuro psychological researchers that animals produced a map of the environment. And you know, in some sense partly what we're talking about when we're talking about these structures, you know the A to b structure is a map. That's another way you can look at it. So anyways, so you've got this rat and its behaviors are all chained together, right? So I already told you, you know, I spoiled the story in some sense because I told you that the rat could learn to take a shortcut.

Speaker 3:          00:29:39       But one of the earlier demonstrations of the independence of rat learning from the reflective conditioning was that, so let's say you've trained to rap to run down a maze. Okay. So hypothetically it's using its front legs and his back legs and it's learning to chain all that together. Front leg, back, leg movement, turned left, front, leg back, leg movement turned right, et Cetera, et cetera. While so then, well, what if you put the little rap, you tie up his back legs and you put them in a little rap like wheel barrel. So he's got wheels instead of legs. It's like the route zooms through the maze swell so much for the reflex theory, right? Because obviously you didn't train the rat to use a cart with its rear end stuck in, hadn't figured that out all by itself. So, so, so anyways, there's, there is a system in you that allows you to chain reflexes together.

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       It's a very primordial learning system and the behavior got that right. It's fast, very, very fast because it requires do neuro connections. So there's some advantages to simple learning, but once, once you get up into the higher, even the moderately higher cortical and subcortical functions, you're past the point of a mirror reflects chaining. Okay? So let's say for the sake of simplicity, the hypothalamus says you need waters. So your current state is you're thirsty and your desired state. As you get to go to the tap, you know, you can feel your mouth dry and so forth. And then some fantasies about drinking, some water start to come into your mind and then all of a sudden you're kind of possessed by that. And so it's starting to interfere with your, with your conscious goal directed behavior at that point. And finally it's insistent enough like something knocking on the doors.

Speaker 3:          00:31:18       So you think, man, I'm, I'm thirsty. And, and you know, maybe you even think I'll work better if I have something to drink. And so you go off to the fountain and then what your campus is doing is you've got this little idea, which is your desired future about how this trip is supposed to go. And then you're, you're watching to see how the trip is actually going. But that's an interpretation to, and then if there's a match between the two, the hippocampus just leaves you the hell alone. You don't get anxious, you don't get, you don't get knocked off the track. You go there, you have the water that satiates that system, that's a form of rewards, satiation, it's called consumer Tory reward. And then that system disappears. It goes back to the big dungeons from which it emerged. And then in all likelihood, another one pops up.

Speaker 3:          00:32:06       Now it's an over simplification of human behavior to assume that you just go from one hypothalamic Lee mediated state to another. Although I would say that's what two year olds do. And in some sense that's what animals do. And you know the two year olds doing it because that little creature hasn't gone any more organized than hypothalamic, you know, so it's, and you can see this if you watch two year olds, it's like they're laughing and then they're crying and then they're hungry and then they're hot and then they need to go to the bathroom and then they want to play. It's like it's just one pure motivated emotional state after another. It's quite fun to watch. And they're also relatively hyper exploratory is as long as and playful, you know? But they're cycling through those things all, all the time. So, so, so you, you can't say that that's really what an adult human gods.

Speaker 3:          00:32:54       And the reason for that is that the problem with the, with the pure, with the reason that you need a cortex and the other subcortical structures that aren't hypothalamic is because the world is too complex for those primordial systems to solve the problems they're supposed to solve. A in every possible situation, be across multiple timeframes and see in an environment that's consists of the interactions between other very complex beings. So you know, it's almost, it's almost like an arms race of complexity in some sense that's driven, are driven our evolution. The smarter you get in some sense, the more variable you get. And that's a problem because as I got smarter say over the course of evolution, all you people got smarter too. And so we're all competing and cooperating with each other. But the whole damn system is getting more and more and more and more complex.

Speaker 3:          00:33:53       So you have to grow a brain in order to manage that and at least, or you keep it simple. Well we didn't keep it simple. So we decided to grow a brain instead of you, I don't know if you know this, but um, you ever, you've looked at a chimpanzee and feel like they don't look a lot like human beings, you know, I mean there's obviously some things in common, you know, their hands are quite human and their ears are quite human, but you know, their forehead comes down to about here and uh, they, they're kind of shaped like this, you know, they're a big round, they've got a huge round body and whereas a human being, it's sort of like, you know, a stick with two sticks coming out of it and two more sticks were really, really thin. Hardly any gut. And whereas the chimpanzees like it's intestinal structures are way, way, way, way longer than ours.

Speaker 3:          00:34:40       And so it has to pack that into this huge gut to the damn. Chimpanzees sits around eight hours a day chewing. And the reason for that is it eats leaves. It's like you go out in the forest, need leaves and see how damn many leaves you have to eat before you feel full. It's like all the chimp does is sit there and chew leaves and then it has this huge guts so that it can extract some nourishment out of it. We figured out how to solve that problem once we discovered fire and hunting because within we could cook pays and then we that enabled us at least in principle to trade gut for brain, which I think was a pretty pretty useful trained all things considered, although it's still might get us in trouble. So no, cause the brain's a very energy hungry organ and, but we very, very efficient food and it turns out that cooked food is much more nutritious from a caloric perspective than, than raw food.

Speaker 3:          00:35:30       And so you can, you can afford to sit around and develop a brain if you've got high quality food. Otherwise out there in the, in the jungle chewing on leaves like an idiot for like, they're just about as bad as Pandis. You know what? You know why those things are damn near extinct. They used to be carnivores. All they eat is bamboo shoots now that's it. Nothing else. Bamboo shoots and they have no nutrition. So they have to like eat bamboo shoots all day and then now and then the bamboo crop fails and there aren't any shoots. It's like, well, so much for the parent as it's like if an animal ever deserved to go extinct, it was definitely the panda hunt. Something yet lazy bastards. Anyways. All right, so now this, I discovered this about the hypothalamus when I was reading Larry Swanson is just bloody well blew me away because, well, you'll see why at least in part.

Speaker 3:          00:36:22       So half of the Hypothalamus, roughly speaking, is sort, sorta devoted to popping up these basic primal subpersonalities, the sorts of things that you share with animals. But then you might say, ah, what happens when one of those doesn't work? And the answer is, well, you get an anxiety response. Now the anxiety response is not mediated by the hypothalamus and neither is pain. So look, if you're an idiot, you're body tells you, hurts you or tells you or scares you basically. But what's interesting about that is that the pain systems and the anxiety systems are not in the hypothalamus. They're separate systems. Now the pain system is old, old, old. It may be, it's as old as the hypothalamus. It's way down there in your brain. But the anxiety system is a lot newer and you know, that kind of makes sense because you can imagine primordial organisms really didn't stop until they ran into something that was hurting them.

Speaker 3:          00:37:17       They couldn't think, oh no, I might run into something that will hurt me. Well you can't think that until roughly you have an egg. Della, let's say, cause the Amygdala seems to be at least it's responsible for lots of things and all these areas are interconnected. But one of the things that seems to be responsible for, at least in part is anxiety. And so when your hippocampus detects a mismatch between what you want to have happen and what is happening it, this inhibits the reticular activating system. And one of the things it activates is the anxiety system. The anxiety system says, stop you in it. You don't know where you are or what you're doing. And so you should quit before you get into trouble. And we don't like that feeling very much. That freezes us. But it's better than pain. So you, you feel anxiety so you don't have to feel pain.

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       Now pain seems to occur when you encounter a stimulus, let's say a situation where the sensory, the stimulus magnitude is sufficient to damage those parts of you that are encountering it. So too bright, a light to auto flame, to cold, a piece of metal to hot food, whatever. You know if it, if it's of sufficient magnitude to damage you, you get a pain response out of that and the pain response is supposed to teach the part of you that moves forward not to do that again. The anxiety system responds to cues of pain. Now the pain system is pretty complicated as well because frustration is a pain like stimulus. Disappointment is a pain like stimulus, grief and loneliness are paying like stimuli. Depression is probably a pain condition. So even though the pain system is quite primordial, it's grown up like a complex tree and it subsumes many different functions.

Speaker 3:          00:39:03       So, but, but it's, it's still a very ancient system. Whereas the [inaudible] system, which is newer, you've developed over time to tell you what might hurt you so that you can avoid contacting it. And so you've got your hypothalamus and it's telling you, you know, it's laying out these little subpersonalities that are helping you deal with the fundamental necessities of the world. The pain system is there to tell you when you have encountered a situation that is harmful, the anxiety system is there to tell you when you might be going to encounter something harmful. And that's the thing that's activated when there's a mismatch, right? Because the mismatch says you don't know where you're going, where are you are, where you're going, and so you might get hurt. Now the other thing that happens, roughly speaking, is that when the hippocampus disinhibit the reticular activating system that turns the other half of the hypothalamus on, and this is quite cool because the other half of the hypothalamus is the place where the ventral tegmental area is located in the ventral tegmental area is the part of the brain from which the dopaminergic tracts emerge.

Speaker 3:          00:40:12       And those are the tracks that you use a to explore and be to respond to cues of conservatory reward. So what that means in non technical languages, that when you encounter mismatch, you get anxious, which is what you should do. You should stop, something's wrong. And then as long as nothing else happens that's painful or threatening, then that system starts to climatize. Partly because you're looking around and thinking, right? It's, people often talk about this as habituation. That's a stupid idea. It's habituation. If you're a sea slug, it's not habituation if you're a person, except that very, very primordial reflects like levels of the nervous system at the higher order levels that we're talking about. It's learning. And so if you stop and you're anxious, what happens? Well, generally speaking, you start thinking what the hell might be going on? And you're running through all of these different theories and, and part of the way that works is that it's partly a consequence of state dependent learning.

Speaker 3:          00:41:15       So if you, if you're anxious, you're going to be primed to remember situations that you are anxious in before and why should you do that? And the reason for that is anxious things that make you anxious is at category. It's actually a category. Now we tend to think of categories as something that exists in the objective world, but that is not how your brain categorizes things. You have to learn that really painfully to make objective categorizations for as far as your natural nervous system is concerned. All things that go bump in the night are the same thing. And what is that? While it's some bloody horrible, ah, predatory Crocodilian dragon like monster that hides under your bed and comes out in bites you when you were three. I just ran a little paper today about this kind of cat that lived back when we were still figuring out how to use spears and this was a particularly nasty kind of cap and it preyed on us roughly speaking.

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       And we didn't get eaten by too many cats because cats really can't bite through the skull so they could go for your neck. But that was, you know, they didn't necessarily kill you, but this cat had a mouth that fit right around your skull and it had two teeth that went in here and two teeth that went in here and it was a silent killer. And there is evidence that even children are capable of recognizing the motion pattern of a predatory cat. And one of the hypothesis is that we still have, you know, all of our primate ancestors that didn't get eaten by that particular cap, we're pretty damn good at detecting cats, at least have that type. And we seem to have,

Speaker 3:          00:42:55       what would you say, conserve that ability at least to some degree. So you think about a category, it's like, you know, you might think, well there's fish and there's birds and there's, and there's mammals and there's this reptiles and you know, those are, those are linnaean classifications. They're based in some sense on, on evolutionary divergence and, and where they're not on morphology on the way the animals put together. Who Cares about that? Things that eat you. That's a category and you need, you need that category. And then the other category is also things that mighty you. So things that eat you, you know, those are things that can hurt you and things that you, that mighty you are things you haven't classified yet but might be dangerous. And so that's your natural, your brain's natural category one of them. And then you might think, well, if that's the natural category C, that's the sort of thing that, um, the guy who wrote the visual, an ecological approach to visual perception,

Speaker 3:          00:44:00       he talked about as an affordance, that was the word I couldn't remember last week. So an affordance is something whose meaning you instantly perceived. And so you might say, well, no, no, no, you see a cat and then you infer that it might eat you. It's like, no, no, no, no. You see something that might eat you and then you might be able to figure out that it's a calf, but it's, that might eat you, that you see first, not the damn cat. And so this is, this is a fascinating phenomenon. It it, it suggests like the hi to Gary Ins have proposed that what you perceive first in the world is meanings and out of the meanings you extract objects. It's not the other way around. And so if you look at the way your brain is organized, that's how it works folks. Because the more primordial your brain system is, which means the more ancient it is, the mortar tied it is into your survival.

Speaker 3:          00:44:56       The more it's perception is action predicated, you know? So for example, if you hear a loud noise behind you, when you startle, that's your response while you're going into a crouch. That would make it difficult for a tiger to bite the front of your neck. And you do that. Like that's big man, that's before your it's way before you're thinking. It's before you're perceiving. You know, consciously you're not getting images or sounds at that point, it's so quick. And that's a, that's a category. Things that make you go like this and that's a good category. Now, the reason I'm making such a case about that categories, that's one of the mythological categories is things that go bump in the night. And then one of the things that primordial people were trying to figure out is, you know, you could take up any old animal is thinking as figuring out how to escape from a Predator that isn't what human beings wanting to figure out.

Speaker 3:          00:45:50       Not once we were able to abstract. What we wanted to do instead was to figure out how to escape from the class of all things that could eat you. Not just any particular old thing, but all of them at once. That's the advantage to categorization. Can we arrange things so that nothing can eat us? Well? How do you go about doing that? Well, believe me, we've been working on that problem for a very, very, very long time and one of the answers we came up with, we'll get into this later, is the idea of sacrifice and sacrifice is a very, very ancient idea. But I'll, I'll just give you a bit of a preview. It took me like 20 years to figure this out.

Speaker 3:          00:46:28       Human beings discovered sacrifice a long time ago and they acted it out before they understood it. Okay? Because we act out all sorts of things before we understand it. And idea is sort of, well, you can make a bargain with God. You might say, well what's God? Well we'll, we'll approach that problem later. It's a very complicated problem. But one thing you could think of God as is God is the anthropomorphic representation of the entire social structure across time. So you might say, well God will reward you if you behave property. But what does that mean? Well, imagine that you could conceive of everyone who wasn't you as one met a person. Okay, imagine that that met a person is gone and you can make a deal with that thing. You can say, well, if you behave, if I behave properly, that mess have being will respond, pause property to me in the future.

Speaker 3:          00:47:19       It's like it's true, right? You know that if you make a promise to someone and you keep it, then something good is likely to happen to you in the future. So that was one way that God, that's God the father derivation. It's, it's far more complicated than that. But that's, that's not a bad point. And we kind of figured out that we could bargain with it across time and that that would work. So I read a really interesting paper by someone who's actually a former student of mine is iem sheriff. And he analyzed the relationship between criminal behavior and belief in hell across a whole set of countries. I don't know when it was an exhaustive, you know, if it was an exhaustive analysis, correlational analysis, it's way more peaceful in countries where people believe in hell. So you know and you think, well should you believe in hell?

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       It's like okay, well yes and no. You know, atheist arguments aside, we're not even going to bother with them cause they're kind of moronic so well the idea here is that there are certain views, there are certain action patterns that if you undertake you will be viciously punished in the future. It's like, yeah, that's going to happen. You try lying to everyone that you meet and you just see how well you do over a 20 year period, man, you're going to be in such trouble by the end of that 20 year period. That hell will be the only accurate way to describe where you're situated. So it's no joke, these are real things. And people came up with these ideas for a reason. Now Hell isn't only where other people put you if you're bad, it's a lot more profound, the concept of that. But that's not a bad start.

Speaker 3:          00:48:53       So anyways, the sacrificial notion was something like we could not do what we want to do right now and do something else and that'll make things better in the future. I mean, think about that people, that's the most brilliant idea human beings ever came up with. There's this old story, which is probably not true about how to catch a monkey. So you get this jar, it's got a pretty thin neck, just big enough for a monkey to put his hand in. And then you fill in with things monkeys like deed, say like let's say hard candy just for the sake of argument. So you put that out there and then the monkey goes in and sticks his hand in and grabs a bunch of candidate, can't get his damn handout because it's only big enough for an input is, and then so then you can just go pick up the monkey.

Speaker 3:          00:49:35       It's like, well, what's the problem with the monkey? It can't sacrifice. It won't sacrifice its grip on the damn candy for it's future existence. It's like that's what your parents had been teaching you ever since you were little kids, let go of the candy so that you can live and you know, that's delay of gratification, right? That's conscientiousness, man. That's the discovery of time and its relationship to the social environment. It's so brilliant, you know? And part of what people were trying to figure out when they were developing these rituals of sacrifices. Okay. So you think about society as a metta person. It's usually represented as male by the way, but not always. It depends on the circumstances. So what is this a person want? What you've got to kind of figure that out. Partly what it wants is don't eat all the damn grain today.

Speaker 3:          00:50:24       Save some for next year. Right plan. Act as if the future exists as part of the social contract. God, that's such a discovery now. You know it's, it's not, it's only people who figured that out. I mean squirrels have kind of it in some sense because they store up knots, but you know, I mean the squirrels and squirrels are smart. They just kind of got the inkling of it, you know? And I think what squirrels do is they eat all the nuts they can possibly eat right now and then they store the rest of them. It wouldn't go hungry to store nuts for the future, but human beings will do that. Don't eat the seed grain. Right? Cause then you're going to die next year. Okay. So all right, so back to the hypothalamus. Now you're doing something you want to do and you're tracking how that's going.

Speaker 3:          00:51:11       Both of those are hypotheses by the way. And all of a sudden something happens that you don't want to have happen. Like you live in Flint, Michigan for example. And so you decided to go have some water and it turns out it's not water at all. It's land. I don't know if you guys know about that, but it's quite, it's quite, you know, it's just the sort of thing that makes your jaw drops. So you know, the state is in big trouble, Michigan and so they appointed an auditor to control finances. I believe at the state level might have only been at a city level but doesn't matter, let's say the state level. So the auditor was looking for ways to save money and one way they decided to save money was to re to hook up Flint Michigan's water supply to a river instead of to the Great Lake, which is what it's right beside.

Speaker 3:          00:51:56       It turns out since flint was at an industrial center for forever, that the water's just plum full of lead. So now they have like 50,000 lead poisoned people living in Flint, Michigan. That is not a good thing. Led lowers your Iq rapidly and it makes you violent. So it's for the $10,000 they saved, they probably cost themselves half a million dollars per person. It wasn't actually that there was lead in the water, it's that the water was more acidic. Oh, it took the lead out of the pipes. Yeah. Okay, okay. Right, right. Good point. Good point. Well, I'm not here to complain about Michigan politicians, but the point is is that just because you think you're out for a drink of water, that does not necessarily mean that's what's going on and that's why I said you're comparing your vision of the future to what you think is going on right now.

Speaker 3:          00:52:46       Now, if you read the the neuropsychologists like vinegar Nova in Socal, often Jeffrey Gray, they're basically behaviorists. And so what they tell you is this, and this is different. What they tell you is that you have this little expectancy map. It's like the map the rat has of his surroundings. It's a spacial temporal map. And so when you're doing something, you expect a certain outcome. Okay? And then what? You compare that to his reality as it unfolds. Okay? So you could say you've got this map and then stimuli appeared to you, and those are objectively real. It's like, no, that's wrong. It's wrong. You're, it's interpretation everywhere. You think you know what's going on right now and you think you know what you want. And the reason I'm making such a big deal out of this is because look, if you're a rat and you're going about your business and something you don't want happens, according to the gray behaviors model, you have to revamp your map, your expectancy map.

Speaker 3:          00:53:46       But according to the bottle that I'm proposing, it's way worse than that because you don't know where the damn mirror is. It might be in your map of what you want, not what you expect. That's a different thing. But it also might be in the map you have that, that's of the present. So it's not just the map that you have, it's a prediction of your actions that's at fault. It could easily be the way that you're construing the World Right now. And it could be error at any level of behavior. And so what it means is that when an anomaly you'll occurs, it spreads doubt through the entire hierarchy that we were describing, including the future and the present and even the past. And you, you know this, you know this perfectly well, you can see it when you encounter a complex and normally so a complex anomaly would be you have a longterm relationship and you get betrayed.

Speaker 3:          00:54:38       Okay? And so betrayed means you've trusted someone and they've enticed you to do so and then they exploit that trust and her view for Dante that betrayers were in the lowest circle of hell. So it's a particularly nasty thing to do to people because in some, you know, if you think about trust as the precondition for interpersonal relationships, which it is, then if someone acts towards you in a way that violates your trust in trust, they've done you the worst disservice that someone could possibly be done. Okay? So you get betrayed. All right, so bang, that's an anomaly. What does it imply? Well, that's the wrong question. The right question is what doesn't it imply? It implies that you just don't have the foggiest notion of what you're doing or what human beings are like. You know? And that's, especially if it's a particularly vicious betrayal, maybe you know, you've been suckered by a psychopath.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       It's like, okay, update your model and account for that. Good luck. Especially if you're naive, because the probability that you'll be able to reach down into the depths far enough to come up with a coherent explanation for why someone would do that is very, very low. You know? And what I've discovered in my clinical practice is that if you get betrayed badly enough, the only language that you can use to describe it is fundamentally religious. At some points of of betrayal, it's good versus evil. It's malevolence and them. It's the malevolence that really traumatizes people. It's the, it's the fact that that person was out to hurt you. It's like, oh, well, what's a human being like when they're capable of that? It's like, it's an age old question. Now I'll tell you something is weird and interesting. So there's this old idea in genesis, the first idea, one of the first ideas in genesis is you know that God made people a paradise to live in.

Speaker 3:          00:56:29       Okay? So let's just be wild about this for a moment and assume that you're a little model when it's going well is a little paradise, right? It's like the world's turning out the way you want it to, but there's a snake in there somewhere and that means, well, why is there a snake? Well, because there's a bunch of things you're not paying attention to while you're going about your business, right? In fact, there's almost an infinite number of things that you're not paying attention to, and the problem is one of those infinite number of things that you're not paying attention to. Consumers shift on you all of a sudden, and so there's always a snake in the garden and then you have to figure out what to do with it. The thing is, if you interact with the snake, you get more conscious, but the problem with that is you lose your little paradise.

Speaker 3:          00:57:12       Okay, well it's worse than that because that story is really old, but we have no idea how old it is. It's disseminated all over the world or it emerged independently in different places. We don't really know. But in any case, it doesn't matter. It's a fundamental enough story. Tree plus snake plus people that no matter where you go with, some people have tree snake stories. So, and I think that's because we lived in trees for like 30 million years and we got eaten by an awful lot of snakes. And so, you know, it's a story that really appeals to us. And every bloody science fiction movie you go to, most of the time, if the aliens are bad, they're always reptilian. You know, it's like you don't get Furry Little Koala aliens that are chasing you around. It's like, it's like the ones that alien, you know, they're a reptile inside a reptile, they're nasty beasts and they come out inside of you even, you know, which is another symbolic idea.

Speaker 3:          00:58:06       So, okay, so you've got, you've always got the damn snake and it's popping out to all the time and there's nothing you can do about it except get ready to deal with snakes. No getting rid of them. So that's the first lesson. You're not getting rid of the damn snakes. You better learn to deal with them. Then the next question is, what is the worst possible snake? Now, one of the things that happened in Christianity, and this was influenced in part by Zoroastrianism, was the idea of almost an independent eval arose. You know, in, in fact there was a branch of Christianity called Mannequin that construed the world as a battle between good and evil, where good and evil had equal reality and they were in this eternal battle. Now that got wiped out by, uh, by the standard Christian theory, that evil is actually just the absence of good, which anyways, you can have a big debate about that and people have for thousands of years.

Speaker 3:          00:59:00       But as Christianity developed, there's this weird mythology that grew up around the weird myth in genesis and the weird mythology was that the snake in the garden of Eden was also sake. And then he's the king of all evil. It's like, okay, what does that mean? It's pretty straight forward. What's the worst predator? Well, that's easy. The worst predators, a human being. And so the worst of all possible snakes is the most malevolent possible being. And that's exactly right. And that's why that association was made. It's so, and it's so interesting because it took people like thousands of years to make that association, you know? And it wasn't really put together well until Milton formalized it in paradise lost. And so it's like we kind of observe this in action. You know, that there were bad people. Okay, so bad is a category. But what is bad entail while mythologies of eval center in on the central features of what constitutes bad, you know, and carnivorous might be one of the things.

Speaker 3:          01:00:01       Money malevolent out to hurt, right? Be trail lying. All the cardinal you could take of the cardinal. Great. Since that's the worst snake, while it's a psychologize aviation of the idea of the Predator. And you know, it's even more sophisticated than that because one branch of that theory is that the worst Predator is the evil force outside of you. But the next branch of that is that the worst proud Predator is the evil force within you. Yeah, well that's when it gets really psychologized we take, well that's, you know, is that superstition? It's like, hey, that's not superstition, boys and girls. It's a lot more intelligent than that. It's the most sophisticated theory of the way things work that we have and it's correct. Now what that means from a metaphysical perspective. We're not going to talk about that because we can't, but we can certainly talk about what it means in practical Darwinian terms.

Speaker 3:          01:00:56       You better know what's after you. And the worst thing that can possibly be after you is a fully motivated and completely malevolent human being. It's like, you know, skull crushing cats be damned. You know, all they want to do is eat you. They're not going to torture you. Whereas if you fall into the hands of the wrong human being, man, you could be an excruciating pain for the next 20 years. So people are very imaginative when they figure out how to hurt someone and they can keep it up for a long time and they're fully motivated to do so under some conditions. And so you really got to watch out for that. So, all right, so back to the hypothalamus. So when you have a mismatch between what you desire and what you're after, then the hippocampus says, oh, we don't know where we are.

Speaker 3:          01:01:45       That's what it says. You no longer know where you are. Okay, what should you do when you don't know where you are? You should stop moving and then you should, well then what? They should prepare to do a lot of things. Okay. Then one, then you should explore. Well, that's where the other half of the hypothalamus comes in. That dopaminergic circuit that mediates positive emotion, right? Almost all the positive emotion that you experience in your life, the kind you like, which is hope and curiosity and expectation and, and surprise. And, and, and that's all mediated by the dopaminergic systems. It's a major league contributor to your, to the totality of your being, especially in a positive direction that's rooted in the hypothalamus. And so what that means is that it's quite cool. You got your fundamental motivations, you know, your basic blood biological motivations. Bang, they fail.

Speaker 3:          01:02:37       What happens? Anxiety. That's a newer system and exploration. That's an older system. That damn exploratory system has been there forever. Now if you look at classic hero mythology, which we're going to do in great detail, what you see is that the typical myth of it of humanity is we live in a place, we'll say we have to live in a place and the place is doing quite nicely. Thank you very much. It's like the hobbits and, and uh, Frodo, right? The first one, the Lord for the, uh, what was it called? The hobbit. The hobbit. Okay, so you've got a little shy or they're right. It's all peaceful. It's full of these little people who are a little on the arrogant side. They're kind of dopey. They have no idea what the hell is going on in the outside world. But they think that's okay.

Speaker 3:          01:03:24       They think, you know, just, you know, peculiar people are concerned about that sort of thing and they got their little happy paradise going. They live a long time, they eat a lot, you know, they party a lot. Um, unbeknownst to them, which is very interesting feature of the story. The only reason they have any peace at all, it's because they are descendants of old kings continually patrolling the borders. Right. Those are the striders Eric Gordon, he's the member of the race of old kings who patrols the borders. Well those are, those are ancestral figures. It's like you can all sit here, your little happy paradise, but the only reason you can do it is because the sons of great kings have put borders around your kingdom and you can think it's funny cause in the Harbutt that hobbits basically despise strider. You're like, they're very, very suspicious of him.

Speaker 3:          01:04:15       He's kind of dirty and dusty and he looks like he's been banged around all over the world. He sort of like a trout. It's like they don't know. He's the son of a great king. Good thing for them that he is. However, okay. So then you've got the little Shyer and what happens? Evil things are stirring. And what is it? Well, fundamentally it's a great dragon. Well that's a snake, except it's like medicine snake. You know, it's, it's, it's snake with fire. And you can be sure that fire was not only one of our greatest allies, but one of our greatest enemies, especially when we lived on the belt in Africa. Cause that thing would burn now in that, you know, and so get the hell away from that and on. Well, so anyways, so one hobbit who's woken up by a wizard, right? The wizard is a symbol of the self from the union perspective. So there's one hobbit who's a little bit more creative and exploratory than the rest. And everybody has little respect for him, but they think he's pretty damn peculiar. He decides that he's going to under the tutelage of the wizard, he's going to go check out this dragon. So he leaves the borders and he goes out into that unknown. And then the rest of it is an adventure. And one of the things that's very interesting, again, from a union perspective is that what is the hobbit have to become in order to conquer the Dragon?

Speaker 2:          01:05:32       A thief.

Speaker 3:          01:05:34       Now that's pretty weird. A, because you'd think, hey man, this guy's out to be a hero, so you should be a hero. It's like, no, he turns into a thief. Why? Well, it's because if you're going to conquer a dragon, you better be a hell of a lot tougher than you are naive. And so partly what happens is that for the hobbit to muster up the forces that are necessary for him to confront something, that that is that fundamental, he has to transcend his coward. What would you call it? The, the cowardice that he describes as morality. Okay, so Nisha, for example, each is often viewed as a critic, critic, critic of morality. It's like that's not true. What? Because nature identifies morality with cowardice, but that's not what he does. What to says is this.

Speaker 3:          01:06:24       If you're too afraid to do something so you won't do it, then you'll say that the reason that you don't do it is because your moral. That's not the reason. The reason is it's you're too damn afraid to do it. You might want to, but you're too afraid. That doesn't make you moral. So what happens to the Harbutt, for example, is once he gets outside the kingdom, he asked to develop a whole array of potentials that he never developed before because they were either not necessary in his civilized place or because they were forbidden as immoral by the cultural situation that he grew up in. Say, well, think you have to be touched by the, you have to be touched by the snake in order to defeat the snake. Where else have you seen that motif? It's Harry Potter, right? I mean, Harry Potter's a strange character because he's not obedient.

Speaker 3:          01:07:17       Not at all. In fact, he's quite disobedient, but he breaks the rules in the service of higher morality and the higher morality is that he faces down the dragon that paralyzes you and he frees the virgin. That's what happens with Ginny Virginia Virgin. It's the retelling of Saint George and the Dragon. And interestingly enough, the reason that Harry Potter revivified is because the double doors phoenix comes by and cries in his wounds while the Phoenix is something that dies in his reborn. And so the men have myth underlying the second volume of the Harry Potter series is that the part of you that sustains you through an encounter with the dragon, that paralyzes is the part of you that can die and be reborn. And what that means in a sense is if you're wrong about something and you fall into a pit, then you should let go of what you're wrong about so that something new can arise.

Speaker 3:          01:08:11       And so it's better to be, it's better to be the thing that transforms in response to catastrophe, that it is the thing that's static. Yeah. And that's another big discovery of people. We are, we're like, we're agents of transformation, which is of course why kids are so bloody obsessed with magicians and wizards who are agents of transformation. You know? And that's all embedded in the mythology. It's all acted out. Nobody understands this sort of thing to speak of. Certainly the kids don't. It just hits them, you know, cause they can recognize the pattern. They know that there's something magic about them. Even though they're living in a cupboard in a London suburb where everything is boring and flat and under control. That's not the real world. And it's true. It's not.

Speaker 4:          01:08:56       Is that why we have more patients or people including criminals who say who admit their crime selves?

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       Oh well not only no. Know more patients we off often have admiration for them. Oh yeah. I mean like how many movies feature up attractive bad guy while or for that matter it attractive bad woman. You know, it's like, it's because it's because of the Nietzschean observation. The people who are good aren't good. They're just cowers where's the guy who's bad? Well at least he's not a coward. Well then you might say, well, you know, yeah, he could stop being empowered and also become a good guy. But I mean that's often, often, but not always the actual plot of the movie. Cause that's the redemption of the bad guy. You know? It's also what women fantasize about in relationship to the beauty and beast mythology. They don't want the coward. He's the guy that wants to be the friend. It's complete bullshit. The bad guys in advance over that, but not a big enough advance because he's a bad guy.

Speaker 3:          01:10:02       The best thing you want is a civilized, bad guy. It's like that's what you want. Well, no wonder because it's only a civilized, bad guy that's going to be capable of dealing with the dragons. It's right Lloyd Axworthy. When he was the minister of Foreign Affairs for Canada, we know all the massacres were going on in Yugoslavia. It was front page news at one point. It was during the ethnic cleansings. He said, I don't have the imagination for that kind of evil. It's like, oh, well that's really impressive, Mr. Minister of foreign affairs, did you ever read about the Holocaust? It's like, it's time to wake up a little bit. These things happen, but he said it has a moral claim. I just couldn't imagine that sort of thing happening. It's like, well, it's, you're a little on the naive side, aren't you? And parading that around his morality is not a reasonable thing to do.

Speaker 3:          01:10:49       When you also happened to be minister of foreign affairs, it's like you should be looking out for the snakes all at the time cause they're definitely out there and Milosevic was definitely one of them. And so if a naive person meets someone like that, the naive person loses and that's not good because there were lots of people like that and be better if they didn't win. So okay. So the hypothalamic, the fact that the exploratory circuitry is actually embedded right into the hypothalamus way down there with like lust and thirst and hunger. It's so great because it shows you how the mythology works. It basically says, okay, here's a bunch of things you're doing now and then something will go wrong. Okay, you need a system to deal with things when they go wrong. What's the system? While it might kill you, bang better, have some pain and anxiety to protect you.

Speaker 3:          01:11:39       Well you better figure out what it is. Okay. Better have an exploratory system so that you can go out there and gather some more information. While that's, that's the human story. Gather information in the face of danger. That's the human story. That's what we do. So, and that's the hero myth. And the hero myth is a redemptive, and that's because it is redemptive. That is what works. Or at least that's what we've staked our being on. I mean, who knows? Maybe all of this exploration. We'll just get us in trouble. I mean, that's another part of Genesis, right? Poke around and see what happens. Well, you know, you're doing that all the time. You're in your little paradise battling away all happily, and then you just can't stop yourself from pulling on a thread somewhere. And then you find out, oh my God, you know, maybe that's when you get suspicious about your partner cheating on using maybe this person cheating on me and you can't leave it alone.

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       You can't leave it alone. You got to go look at the snake. It's like bang. It turns out it's there down. You go into the underworld, right? And you might think, well, maybe ignorance. You know, maybe the bliss of ignorance would have been better. Well, it's not like psychologists don't tell you that. All those positive illusion people, that's their whole shtick is right. It's better to be little bit dumb about how things work cause otherwise there's no way you can be happy. It's like that's an idiotic theory on two accounts. A happy isn't the point and be dumb is not the goal. So you know, it's, it's, it's so, it's so ignorant that it's actually corrupt, which is really saying something because you have to be pretty damn making rent before you get to corrupt. So it's a hell of a thing to teach people.

Speaker 3:          01:13:19       You know, you have to delude yourself in a minor way, otherwise you can't stand being alive. Oh my God, that's awful. That's really awful. It's like here's a different story. Maybe your Dick Tough enough to open your eyes. I'd be a much better story. And it's possible to, cause people are really, really, really tough. It's just they live in these little protected places, you know, and they never get out there and hammer themselves out against the world. So they never discovered that they're tough. But you know, when you might think, well that's your opinion. It's like, no, it's not my damn opinion. We know that if you take someone who's naive and and, and paralyzed by anxiety and you put them in psychotherapy and you expose them to the things that they're afraid of or disgusted by end avoiding that it isn't that they get less afraid, they get more confident.

Speaker 3:          01:14:06       And that's what generalizes, you know? So you know, if you bring somebody who's got a mouse phobia, need them house for the year, then they're not ever afraid of a bunch of other things. Why does that happen? Well, they weren't afraid of the damn mouth. You're afraid of their own inadequacy and then you teach them that they don't have to be afraid and they think, hey, I don't have to be afraid. And then they're not afraid of a whole bunch of things. And so you get generalization from behavioral exposure. And so it isn't, there's no question about whether or not exposure to the things that you avoid is curative. It's the fundamental axiom of psychotherapy. You know that. And figuring out what you're going to do with your future. But even in psychoanalysis, it's face what threatens you, right? It's just that the psychoanalyst tend to go after past traumas, but doesn't matter as far as your brain is concerned.

Speaker 3:          01:14:52       A dangerous thing in the past is exactly the same thing as a dangerous thing in the president. And it seems to be partly because the Amygdala doesn't have any sense of the time. And you know, it's interesting because one of the things young observed was that there's no time in the collective unconscious. It's like everything is in eternal now. So let's say you got traumatized when you were a kid. Your age you're in and make the growth. Maybe you got bit by a spider or some damn thing. It's like you're afraid of that spider then and now. And in the future it's the same. It's outside of time. Hippocampus, it's the thing that's dealing with time. So you know, if you really learn a lesson, it's supposed to be timeless. While you know you can still help people overcome their phobias, but he can't get their damn Amygdala to shrink again.

Speaker 3:          01:15:40       So you can just get it back under control. Okay. So that's pretty cool. And then we could say, let's go up a level or two. Well, let's look at the Amygdala for a minute. So things about the Amygdala have probably changed since I updated my knowledge. But it doesn't really matter because the fundamental systems I'm telling you about exist. And they keep moving around in the brain because we don't know exactly how they work. But at a system level of description, you know, and with the, with the, at a system level of description and using slightly vague neuro psychology, we can localize these sorts of things in the brain. Okay. So the Amygdala gets inputs from everywhere. And basically what it's looking for is things that might threaten you. And I would say the, you could say in a sense that they'll make the law has a inbuilt sense of the monstrous.

Speaker 3:          01:16:36       And let me show you, this is a good time to show you, uh, uh, a little, a little comic. This is a great comic. Someone stoned came up with this comic and they really did cause it's a, it's a, uh, head comic, uh, underground cartoon comic. But I really liked this comic because it just shows you what's going on perfectly. Okay. So there's these hippies, they're, they're all friends of this guy named fat Freddy and, and you know, they're, they're basically useless hippies and they don't pay rent and they only do smoke pot in there, you know? And so anyways, at one point they make a bunch of money on some cocaine deal and they buy this whole mouth in the country and they think they're going to go out there and live in paradise. And so they bring their catalog, which is fat Freddy's cow who has his own adventures with cockroaches and so on.

Speaker 3:          01:17:24       Anyways, if you've ever had a cat, one thing you knew about cats is they don't like to move. It makes it very upset and nervous. And if you put them in a new house, they are not happy about it. And the reason for that is you've blown their map, right? It's like the cat will slink around in a new territory and map every single place in every hiding place, you know, obsessively till it knows what the hell's going on and then it'll find me. Relax. So a cat in a new place is not a common cat. A cat in a new place is a nervous cat. Okay. Which is also indication that you don't have to learn to be afraid. What you have to learn is how to be calm. And that reverses the way that psychologists generally talk about anxiety because they're all hobbits and they think that life is safe.

Speaker 3:          01:18:07       And so they think that because life is safe, you have to learn to be afraid. It's like that's dopey. The natural condition is terror and curiosity. And if you're really lucky now and then you're somewhere safe enough so that you don't have to be afraid. And that's tenuous and delicate. And so what you have to learn is how not to be afraid, not how to be afraid. So anyways, they got the cat. And so he's in his box and they take them out of the box and the cat thinks, so this is the country. And then the cat goes real low and start sniffing. And that is what animals do when they first start exploring both of those things, they crouched down and that makes them less visible to predators. And they sniff. And the reason they sniff is because like most animals are all no's.

Speaker 3:          01:18:52       You can tell that with dogs for example, their whole brains are built around their sense of smell unlike us, which most of our brain is built around vision. But anyway, so the cat's slinking around there and then it smells something that it doesn't know and it thinks God only knows what this thing that I don't know is. And so it re it would freeze first and then it would beat a hasty retreat. Okay. So now it's underneath the porch. One hip, he says, where'd the cap disappeared now the other one says under the house, and then the cats down there shaking, which is what cats do after the freaked out like that. And it's got this little fantasy going. You'd hide too if you'd smelled what I did. And then it imagines up this monster and a monster technically is the amalgamation of unrelated parts.

Speaker 3:          01:19:36       So what's the monster? Well, let's go duck feed and it's called like bare arms and, and it's got a skunk tail and it's got kind of a wolf head and it's got antlers and you think, well that thing doesn't exist. It's like, that's wrong. That thing exists. In fact, it's a really accurate representation of what's out in the forest. Now any one animal wouldn't look like that, but the set of all possible animals looks exactly like that. And then you might think, well, what do you want first when you're something you want quick and dirty representation of what to be afraid of? Or do you want to hang around trying to figure out whether that thing has hooves and teeth? It's like, no, you want it quick and dirty representation of just what might be lurking out there because that's intelligent hypothesizing, right? It's the kind of hypothesize and it would be evolutionary driven.

Speaker 3:          01:20:28       You ever see? Uh, the far side cartoon, uh, Monster Snorkel. I loved that cartoon. So there's this little kid in his bad, it's dark and he's under the covers. He's one of those ugly little kids that Gary Larson always drew. And he's got this snorkel that you use for, you know, scuba diving and what do you call it? Snorkeling, scuba diving and all that sticking out from under the covers is the snorkel so that he can breathe. And then of course in his imagination there's some like reptilian dinosaur, like things sitting beside his bed. And it's like, well, why? Because that's what he's hypothesizing. Why? Because that's what's in the dark. And you think, well, you can tell your kid, well, there's no monsters in the dark. Yeah, right. And then you say, never talked to a stranger. It's like, get your story straight. People really, you know, it's so dopey.

Speaker 3:          01:21:25       He's like, yeah, there's monsters in the dark. So what are you telling your kids? No, there's no such thing as monsters. First of all, they're driven half crazy because they think, well, what am I afraid of? Then? You know, and second you tell them over time that there are monsters in the dark. In fact, you're probably more paranoid about the damn things then your kid is, you know, so what do you tell them? There are monsters in the dark, but you can probably handle up, especially with our health. Okay. So now I'll tell you a story. So my nephew, he was six, he had night terrors in night terrors or this strange phenomena where all of a sudden you wake up screaming is quite unpleasant. And then you might say, well why was this happening in the answer as well? We really don't know. But there was some instability in his household at that point.

Speaker 3:          01:22:14       A, he was just going off to kindergarten. So that's a big transition, right? It's out of paradise. I would into the world and be, his parents were in the throes of approaching divorce. So there was that sort of undercurrent in the house. Right. And you know what that's like. You walk into a house like that, it's like you know something's up. It's like the error is frozen and it's probably something that you can smell. I think, but whatever, it doesn't matter, but you can certainly tell. And so anyways, he's, he's waking up at night screaming away. And so during the day, he's a very verbal kid. During the days running around, I guess he was about four, not six. It's got this little night hat that he wears. It's a plastic night hat. So he zooms around without all the time and he's got this plastic sword and he's doing around with that too.

Speaker 3:          01:22:59       And so you think, well, what's, what's he up to? Well, he's playing night. Just kind of weird day because you think, why would being a night be attractive to a kid? You know, we weren't nights for that long, but whatever, it doesn't really matter. He's running around playing night and he goes to sleep and he puts his night hat and his sword right beside his bed. So fine. I watched that. I'm watching what's going on with him. I'm figuring out what's going on in the house. And you know, his mom is worried because he's having night terrors. It's like, yeah, it's horrible. Wakes up screaming. So, okay, nighttime comes, he wakes up screaming. We're all sitting at the breakfast table the next day. And I said, did you dream about anything? Anyway, yeah. And then got right into this dream. And he said, okay, well this is what happened.

Speaker 3:          01:23:48       I was out in a field and all of these little dwarfs were around me. They only came up to my knees, but they had big beaks. They didn't have any arms. They have big beaks on them and they were covered with hair and Greece. So they were all greased down and there was a cross shaped at the top of their head. Wherever I went, these beat dwarfs would jump at me with their feet and bite me. So it's like a horrible image, right? He said they're everywhere, so everyone stops eating breakfast and we're like watching this thinking, wow, that's no wonder you're screaming man. So, and then he said, yeah. And it was worse than that because like there was smoke and at the back of the little doors there was this dragon and the dragon was breathing out, smoke and fire and the smoke and fire would turn into the dwarfs. It's like, oh my God, what do you do about that? Wiping out some dwarfs. It's like, who cares? The Dragon. We'll just breathe up some more. It's like that's life man. I've got this. Excellent. I've got this excellent picture. It's, let me show it to you cause it's, it's worth finding even though it's going to interrupt my story a little bit.

Speaker 2:          01:25:12       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:25:13       Well I'm not going to find it because it'll take too long, but I'll tell you what it is anyway. So it's a Greek amphora. All right. You Know How am fora there? Those, there's like a boss sort of and they just keep winding them and uh, it's dreary. It's painted on like a, like a cartoon. It's sort of black and white and it's got this hero who I believe is Hercules. And anyways, her, these is facing this snake and it's a really cool snake. So first of all, its tail is curled in a perfect circle. And that's if you look at dragons and snakes and mythology, there are often their tails often curled in a circle and it means something like it means something like infinity. But anyways, and then there's all these snakes. It's a high drug, so it's a snake with like eight can say.

Speaker 3:          01:25:55       And so then there's Hercules with his sword. It's like, well what's the problem with the hydro cut off one hand? What happens eight more heads? It's like, hmm, quit cutting off heads. Yeah, it's a good piece of foreign policy advice for the Middle East. No. So the hydrus keep growing. Okay. So you know, cutting off heads isn't going to be of any utility. And so here's what the story is saying. It's like no matter how many problems you solve, there's going to be a bunch more problems. And it's even worse than that. If you have a problem and you solve it, that's going to lead to more problems. So even the solution is a problem. Right? And that's the law of unexpected consequences, right? That's why automobiles have destroyed the atmosphere. Everybody thought in automobile is for getting from point a to point b. It turns out it's not.

Speaker 3:          01:26:40       It's for transforming the world into the world's holes, into jungles. We didn't know that. So that's an unexpected consequence. So anyways, the kid is faced with this horrible conundrum, like, what am I going to do? Go out these doors and they're biting me and then there's this stupid dragon. So I said, what could you do about that? Now that's called a loaded question and it will be inadmissible in a court of law in a sense, because it, what is it? It's a question, but no one isn't right. I'm telling him something, you could do something about that. Well, that's a hell of a theory. It's like, well, yeah, I should just lay down and let the door of seat me, you know? No, no, you could do something about it. I said, what could you do? And then he said, I put my hat on, I get my sword.

Speaker 3:          01:27:31       Then I'd go get my dad and we'd go up to the Dragon. I jumped on his head and then I poke both his eyes out with my sword and then I go right down the stomach to the place where the fire comes out. And I cut a piece off of that and I'd use it as a shield. And I thought, right, art and Kid, you got it, you can fight. It was so cool because he had the whole thing, hey, and that's why he's running around playing night. He'd almost go on it and all I had to do was drop. There's this fifth chemical phenomena called a supersaturated solution. It's kind of cool. So if you take, you know, water can only dissolve so much sugar until the sugar starts to crystallize out, right? But if you're careful, you heat up the water, you can dissolve a bunch of sugar in it.

Speaker 3:          01:28:14       And then if you really slow, slowly cool down the water and you don't tap it and there's no impurities, you can get this sugar, you can get this solution super saturated, which means weirdly enough, it holds more sugar than it can. It's like it forgets to crystallize it or something. Or maybe you know, it needs a little impurity or a shock or something to get it going. But it's like, it forgets to crystallize. So then if you take a little crystal of sugar and you drop it in, it's like he goes and instantly, it's all crystal. So, so that's what happened to this kid. It's like he was there, he was ready, he had the answer. And all I had to do is say you could do something about this and Poof, instant hero myth. And the cool thing is no more night terrors. So well, so you get the picture. It's very, very cool. All right, so back to our discussion now. All right, so you've got the brain here. And so this is uh, the brain has conceptualized by Alexander Luria who was the Russia's most famous neuropsychologist and who

Speaker 3:          01:29:34       got the big picture, right, man. So basically he said there's a bunch of different ways that you can divide up the brain. You know, it kind of, it depends on what you want, you know, which is an interesting way of thinking about it because you might say, well, how should you divide up the world? And that's her is, well, it depends on what you want, right? It depends to some degree on the features of the world, but it depends even more on what you want. So one of the things Luria said, it's okay if you go from the back to the front of the brain, the front of the gray part here, what you see is roughly speaking, the back half of the brain does sensory processing, especially visual processing. And the front half of the brain does motor processing. Okay. And so if you look at the back of the brain, the sensory unit there, you see that there's an auditory area and a visual area. And what's cool is those overlap to some degree. So there's some hypothesis that the places where the sensory systems overlap, it are the parts that are responsible for your experience of a unified perceptual field. So here's an example of managing the visual cortex in the auditory cortex. Overlap in one place. Okay? So it sort of be maybe hear about there, let's say on the left side. Yeah, there, that's the part used for silent reading.

Speaker 3:          01:30:49       Isn't that cool? It means you're using your eyes, his ears and the way you do that is used. The overlap between the visual and the auditory cortex. It's so cool. You can use your eyes his ears. So, you know, so the senses aren't as separate as people think. And you know, when I, I used to wear glasses and I couldn't hear what people were saying when I wasn't wearing them. And the reason for that is I couldn't, I wasn't watching their lips say. And so a lot of what I was hearing in language processing was the expression on their face and the movement of their lips. So take off my glasses, I'm deaf. So anyways, so that's the sensory unit. Half the brain, most of it's visual cortex because we're insanely visual creatures and the front half is the motor unit. Okay, why? Well, because we proceed and act.

Speaker 3:          01:31:31       So it's the part of the brain that's responsible for Zika. You around you, you've got voluntary action, right? You, you inhabit a nervous system that enables you to navigate your way throughout the world. We're navigators fundamentally, we really are navigators and you don't ask can navigate by the stars. Think about that. How the hell can enact navigate by the stars. They figured that out by figure, you know, watching ants is figuring out how to get back. And then up the sky, and then the ants were wandering around not knowing where they were going. It's like, yeah, there's lots of things we don't understand. I can tell you that. So anyways, the motor unit, you've got the motor strip. Now if you touch that with an electro during brain surgery, then people will either move or have the impulse to move and you can map out how the body is represented in the brain by touching that strip with an electrode.

Speaker 3:          01:32:22       And that was done by wilder Pinfield at the Montreal neurological institute. It was a major move forward in the understanding of the brain. And he did that on epileptics before surgery because he didn't want to take out parts of the brain that you know were necessary. So he's trying to figure out what they were doing. So that's the part that enables you to act voluntarily. And in front of that, there's the premotor strip. And then in front of that, there's the prefrontal cortex. Now what's cool is that the premotor strip and the prefrontal cortex grew out of the motor strip over the course of evolution. So then you might say, well, why do we think, and the answer isn't so that we can come up with accurate objective representations of the world. The answer is so that we can plan what to do and what you see fundamentally is that as you move forward in the brain, you go from action to planning action.

Speaker 3:          01:33:16       And so by the time you get to the prefrontal Cortex, let's say the Dorsolateral prefrontal Cortex, which is the part of the brain that you use for abstract thinking, what you're basically doing is conjuring up avatars of yourself in an imaginary world running the mess simulations in your imagination and the collective imagination. That's what stories are, and then running the simulation to the end to see if you live or die and if you die, then you don't implement the simulation. And if you live in thrive, then you do implement the simulation. And so was it Karl Popper, philosopher of science said, the reason we think is so that we can let our thoughts die instead of us. Right. That's smart. Well, that also ties into the death and rebirth idea, right? It's like are you going to die? Are you to let your, you know your avatars die?

Speaker 3:          01:34:10       And one way of thinking about that is that your current self is just an Avatar. Now if you understand that, that means you also understand the relationship between the union self and the ego. The Ego is an Avatar. The self is the thing. Now, I don't know if you know this, but the word Avatar, it's actually a theological term. It's from, it's from Sanskrit and an Avatar is the form that God takes on earth. It's pretty cool that that turned into the word for the thing that you use at a video game, right? That's your little, you know, disposable self. You throw it out there in a world and it can live or die and you're back there like God, just be an eternal all along the way. So that's a very, very thing. But anyways, even before we had video games, we were doing that, right?

Speaker 3:          01:35:00       Cause we had fiction, we had stories, we had imagination and it's, it's decoupled from our motor systems. And so we can implement these, you know, hypothetical instances of ourselves before we implement them. And you know, that's Kinda how we fight hydrus. It's like, okay, you got eight snakes, what do you do about that? You'll have eight potential selves. So you multiply potential cells just as fast as the world can multiply snakes, you know, and that's what evolution does, right? So you know, let's say you've got a mongoose, mongoose, mongoose, mongooses, they like to eat snakes. They're really good at it. They can eat cobras, go mongooses. So you think, well a mongoose gets killed by a Cobra. It's like, well it's not a very good mongoose, but that doesn't matter because the mongooses are generating all sorts of Mongoose and one of them is going to be able to kill the snake.

Speaker 3:          01:35:49       Not all that. That's all that really matters. So there's a very funny mouse that lives in the desert in Arizona. I'd like this most a lot. And it jumps and it, it's so cool. This mouse, it feeds on Scorpions. It's like, how the hell did it learn to do that? Anyways? It has to teach its young to eat scorpions and it's quite immune from Scorpion Vanneman Venom, which is quite helpful. But still, you know it goes out in this, it's like you going out to wrestler Nile Crocodile, it's like a scarf. He and he's a big thing compared to a mouse. The mouse will hop on the Scorpion and they have this terrible fight and finding the most tears it apart and then it brings it back and feeds it's little mice, babies pops and you know what it does. Then it goes outside and howls at the moon like a wolf just sort of, it sounds like a mouse.

Speaker 3:          01:36:39       So it's really squeaking out. But if you slow it down, you know, which is what you have to do. For example, if you want to hear mouse vocalizations cause they're often super, super what, what uh, above, above your threshold for hearing pay excepted that to here or rats laugh when you tickle though. He had to slow down their vocalizations because they, they laugh at ultrasonic frequency. So he had to slow down your, their vocalizations to hear them laugh when you take a look. But anyways, these damn nice go out in the desert at night after eating a scorpion and they howl at the moon, which is like go mice. So, so anyways, anyways, back to the brain here. So there's all these terrible monsters being generated and you generate avatars of yourself to cope with. I'm in generally used to have to like evolve to do that, but human beings being the smart creatures we are generated up and the environment in the imagination and then populated it with imaginary representations of ourselves and then try those out and then we implement the ones that we think are great.

Speaker 3:          01:37:43       And then you might think, well we've been doing that for a very, very, very long time. And then you might think, well maybe we figured out exactly what thing we should implement. And then we might say, well that's the savior figures in mythology. That's what they are. So what else would they be? You know, people would be trying to figure out what the hell we are for forever. And the fundamental question isn't what is reality maideb not the fundamental question. The fundamental question is how do you act in the world? And that's a whole different way of thinking about the world. But I think given that I'm a Darwinian, I think it's the fundamental question. And you know what? Obviously, given what I've described to you so far, you can't fall in love too much with your current self. Because what if it's wrong? Well, you should let that sucker die.

Speaker 3:          01:38:36       And so then you might think, well, what part of you is it that doesn't die when your Avatar's die? Well, that's what you'd called the self. So let's say you got undergo a personality transformation here. There's the old view, you're all naive a and something comes along and just wallops you bang into the underworld, you fall apart. Hey, and then bang, there's a new you and maybe a little, you know, battle weary but wiser, fine. But then you know that one gets walked, walked out and bang into down the road and up you come again. It's like fine. What's constant across all those transformations? That's the core element of, of the, of the person. That's what you called the self brilliant. It's brilliant. So smart. Okay. 15 minutes and then we'll, we'll go on.
