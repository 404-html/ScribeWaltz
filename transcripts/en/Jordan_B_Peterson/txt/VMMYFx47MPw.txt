Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, how's it going, everyone? So today I have a very special guest, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson. He's a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and a practicing clinical psychologist. And I want to read just a, just a little bit of, um, of, of, of paragraph, just a little piece from his, his arm, his own website. And Jordan Peterson has published more than a hundred scientific papers transforming the modern understanding of personality and revolutionizing the psychology of religion and his now classic book maps of meaning. They're the architecture of belief as a Harvard professor, he was nominated for the prestigious Levinson teaching prize and is regarded by his current University of Toronto students as one of the three truly life changing teachers. Uh, Dr. Peterson. Thank you for coming on and tiering that. Is it, is it safe to say, is it fair to say that you are considered a rock star now?

Speaker 2:          00:51          Well, my youtube channel seems to be, have become very popular. And uh, I've been, yeah, I mean I hate to use that characterization, you know, but, um, yeah, there's been an explosion of media interest and then public interest in the sorts of things that not only the sorts of things that I've been dealing with say sort of philosophically and politically, but also in the, in the lectures that I'm putting up for people on, on Youtube, which I'd been doing for about about four years now. And I think it's the combination of the stance that I took on, on compelled speech and, and on political correctness in general and also the content that I've been provided with the people that they come to the channel for the, for the political controversy, I suppose. And they seem to stay for the content. So that's pretty, it's been, it's remarkable. I mean, I don't know what to make of it. It's, it's remarkable.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Yeah. You like it. There's been like a, a shift of people wanting to, they like, they want to hear stuff like this. They're, they're really excited to hear like a position of free speech when, when, when a lot of people actually have been kind of railing against it. And um, it's really interesting the type, the Times that we're in because unfortunately it's coming from a lot of people on the far left. There's like this a Torah, a authoritarian left type of movement taking a foot. And that's basically war. Most people kind of a recognized you from because they saw a protest, uh, that was going on at your university, um, about, and it was about a bill see 16.

Speaker 2:          02:27          Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah. Well cause I made a video that, that where I, I expressed my opposition to the go. The Canadian government's attempts to make certain kinds of speech mandatory and also our to oppose the University of Toronto Human Resources Departments, attempts to impose, uh, what I regard as inappropriate and, and likely harmful so-called unconscious anti bias retraining on the, of their, uh, human resources employees, which I think is a very dangerous incursion into the civil rights of, of, of their staff as well as being based on very poor science in my estimation. So yeah, people, people, people, uh, there was a protest as a consequence of that and that got a lot of attention on youtube and that was one of the things that drew a lot of attention to my channel. So,

Speaker 1:          03:23          yeah, absolutely. I mean it's what, it's how I found you. It's um, I actually did a video on it and I saw that you tweeted it out, so I was actually like, oh, he, he, he seen it. And I, I feel, I feel strange because I'm like the type of content I make. I try to be a very lighthearted, I tried to have people, I try to be a crack a lot of jokes and have people at least have some fun through through the madness. So when I was also like seeing that, I was like, oh, I wonder, I wonder what he thinks because I don't know,

Speaker 2:          03:53          I got a real kick out of your, out of your coverage. I thought it was really funny. And it's funny because some of the best conversations that I've had with people on Youtube so far have been with people who have, uh, who are, who have a background in comedy, roughly speaking. And I think it's partly because people who have a good sense of humor and who have a comical take on things are also likely to tell the truth because there's almost nothing funnier than telling the truth. Right. If you say things that other people think but won't say, then you know, there that often makes it very funny. And I thought you're, oh, I think your general very comical and wedding so

Speaker 1:          04:27          well that, that, that I appreciate that a lot because, yeah, like, uh, I don't know, hearing, hearing, stuff like that. Sometimes I'm like doubting myself. I don't know. I'm like, should I, should I try to be more, cause, excuse me. Um, I'm in, I'm kind of, I guess I've been shoved in this, uh, this community called this skeptic community on Youtube. And, um, I, I, I do try to be skeptical, but at the same time, like I said, I tried to be more just on the comedic side. I was thinking about being more serious and try to be like, say more respected, I guess in the, in the, in the community that I'm in. But I kind of want to just, I was like, no, no, no, no. There's, there's enough people. I don't know if you're, um, if you watch, say if there's any, any youtubers and taking in particular that you watch, I don't know if you've, uh, seen say anyone like Sargon of a cod or armored skeptic. Yeah. And, um, have you had any

Speaker 2:          05:15          I'm going to be on star gone show and in, in the relatively near future

Speaker 1:          05:20          I suspected that much. Um, especially he just did a video about it. I saw it, um, recently. And that was actually something that I wanted to ask you about cause he was talking about mcmaster university and um, and that's actually something that I wanted to, I really, I was really interested in and knowing like say, um, was this, how do you like you officially like on you just like a target now we're now you're being shut down where we've seen it happen to other people, people that like say the Milo Yiannopoulos, but you know, he's a, I can say a provocateur and so it's, it's very telling that they would go out of their way just to shut you down when I know it just seems like you're not saying anything that is irrational. You're not saying anything that is even remotely extreme. And a, I just wanted to get your take on how did you feel when, when you got, when you got your, your, um, shutdown at all?

Speaker 2:          06:12          Because when I was there, I didn't really think of it as being shut down. Um, and the reason for that is because things aren't exactly what they appear to be anymore. And so for example, now when I go and talk at places, the place I'm talking out is barely the place where the event is happening at all. The real event happens on Youtube. And so I went there and I saw all these people acting in a very, what would you say? Well, it was partly a, a vulgar manner because they were yelling things at me that were, um, just, they just Asinine, just, they're not the sorts of things that you'd expect. Even protestors who had any sense to be shouting. They're, they're, they're just, they're just low rent insults, you know, low grade insults and behaving very badly and laughing about it and on their cell phones and misbehaving in a, in a very bad way.

Speaker 2:          07:15          And, and having the goal, for example, to appear at the mcmaster talk behind a huge banner with a hammer and sickle on it. Like, as far as I'm concerned, I really mean this. There is no difference between appearing behind a banner with a hammer and sickle on it and appearing behind a banner with a swastika on it. And the fact that you can get away with that at a university and that that's considered, uh, what would you describe it as a reasonable stance in the aftermath of the events of the 20th century where we know that at least a hundred million people were killed by communist totalitarianism is absolutely reprehensible. But when I was at mass mcmaster, I thought, and I thought this ever since that first, that first protest where I, where I was shouted down, increasingly the appropriate thing to do when surrounded by protesters is to document it and let them, let them destroy their own credibility. And so far, virtually every time I've had an encounter with the radical social justice types and I just let them be, which, which is I think a reasonable approach. They've undermined their own position dreadfully. And so I don't think of it being as being shut down at all. I just think about it as another route to victory and even an effective route. Cause I may be 150,000 people have watched that protest now at mcmaster university may be more far more people than were at the event itself. So

Speaker 1:          08:44          No. Yeah, you're absolutely right. It, it actually, I mean it wouldn't, this stuff does happen. It does bring, it brings these issues to light and it shows just how ridiculous these people are acting and showing that like you, you take them seriously. And I 100% agree about the, the hammer and sickle thing like 100% because, um, especially when you see what's been happening at say for instance, like trump rallies around the United States where a lot of these people that consider themselves a communists or Marxists or whatever, or um, antifascist they're just just beating the hell out of people in the, in the name of fighting fascism. It's, it's the most, it's the most like, it's the most ironic thing that I, I've, I've witnessed in quite a while. It's, it's pretty, it's pretty sad. It's pretty sad to be honest. But, um, like you said though, people are, um, and just in droves is just trying to shy away from that and be like, this is not, this is not the way to go. And so yeah, it actually is a very good thing that, you know, will say there's the silver lining for you getting screeched at and shouted down and everything. It's, it's

Speaker 2:          09:47          a massive silver lining because now I'm in a situation that I suspect is very frustrating for those who are opposing what I'm doing, where if I go speak somewhere and there are no protestors, then I get to speak and I'll get a viewing of a couple of hundred thousand people. And if I go somewhere and I don't get to speak, then that gets a viewing of a couple of hundred thousand people. And so at the moment I'm in this extraordinarily fortunate position where as long as I don't do anything to unforgivably stupid and get carried away or get arrogant or anything like that, that um, as long as I've cautious as if I keep pushing forward with what I'm doing, then I seem to come out in a positive light either way. And that's a great position to be in. It's an amazing position to be in an eye. It's also been, I've learned some really interesting things here as well.

Speaker 2:          10:42          So one of the things that's happened, you were talking about my youtube popularity, I can tell you some details about that, that you might be interested in. First of all, the overwhelming majority of the people who come to see me live and who are watching my youtube videos are men. It's about 90% men. And you know, you might think that that's because my political stance say it doesn't necessarily appeal to women, but I don't think that that's what it is. Because when I looked at the demographics for my lectures, my personality lectures in my other university lectures that I put online since 2013 even before this political issue became central, let's say about 85% of the people who were watching my lectures were men. And that's strange because about 75% of psychology students in universities are female now. And so I've been trying to figure out why is it that men are coming to watch me and why is it that men are watching my lectures and what I, so I've been speaking to these audiences about a variety of different things and I've been concentrating mostly on the right to free speech, um, and in an apolitical, in some sense, like I'm making the case that it's necessary for free speech to be placed above all other political virtue so that no matter who it is, no matter who positioned that's being put forward, they have an opportunity to engage in political dialogue.

Speaker 2:          12:10          But also I've been talking an awful lot about responsibility and responsibility is the other half of rights, right? Because your rights are my responsibility and my rights are your responsibility. And so you actually can't have a discussion about rights without having a discussion about responsibility unless you're willing to forget about half of the story. And the radical leftists in particular. And even the moderates I would say have been pushing this idea that the quality of life that someone enjoys is entirely dependent on the rights that they are granted or the rights that they take to themselves. And I have been putting forward the counter story, which is, well just hold on a minute there guys. You should be concentrating more on responsibility that you should be upholding in the community and getting your act together as individuals and living in a way that makes you valuable to your family and to your, to the broader community and learning how to bear a heavy load, like a civilized human being and the man, the young man, man, they are so hungry for that message.

Speaker 2:          13:12          Just, just unbelievable. Their eyes light up. And you know, I, I've got this program that I wanted to talk to you about too. Uh, I designed this program a while back called future authoring. And that's available@selfauthoring.com. And it's a program that helps people write out a plan for their life three to five years down the road. And so what the program asks you some questions it asks you, okay? So imagine that you were taking care of yourself like you're someone that you were cared for. So you're, you're, you're trying to set your life up so that you have a good, high quality, valuable life. However you want to define that. That's up to you to define it, um, in Eros to think about, well, what do you want from your friends? Or Hoe do you want your friends to be? What do you want for your career?

Speaker 2:          14:01          How are you going to educate yourself? How can you use your time in a high quality and productive way outside of, uh, outside of your obligations? Um, how are you going to handle drugs and alcohol? Um, what do you want for an intimate relationship? How are you going to structure your family? You know, the, the basic can take about that as the basic dimensions of a, of a functional life. So the question is, if you could have what you wanted, what would that look like? And assuming what, what you wanted was also best for you, you know that you were heading in a positive direction. So you're asked to think about that. And then you're asked to write for 15 minutes without too much concern for grammar or structure about what your life could be like three to five years down the road if it was set up in a manner that you would find optimal.

Speaker 2:          14:46          And then you're asked to write a counter position, which is all right. So think about yourself critically for a minute. And then imagine that you let your bad habits and your resentment and your hatred and, and everything about you that's, that's subpar. It's suboptimal. Get the upper hand and it augured into the ground. What sort of hell would you be in three to five years down the road? And so we basically imagine you specify a heaven that you can strive for and it held that you want to avoid. And that sets you up for maximum motivation a cause. You're running towards something you want and you're running away from something you don't want. And then you're asked to lay out an implementable plan and to come up with detailed rationale for what you're going to pursue. So, okay, so that's all a long story. But we've tested this program and a number of universities in Europe and in North America, and we found the same thing each time.

Speaker 2:          15:39          We found that it, it works better for, for students who are doing worse. It's not just for students, by the way, but we've tested it in students because it was, it was an easy population to actually assess its effectiveness. And so, um, we found that it increased student's grade point average by about 25% and decreased the probability that they would drop out of university by about 25% so about, so huge effect. But what was really cool was that the biggest effect was on men. And if you look in the universities now and it schools for that matter, women are outperforming men. Definitely. And I think it's because of the men. Well I, we don't have to get into why that is, but they are. But if they do the future authoring program, the men catch up. And then here's the kicker. This is, this is something I think is absolutely fascinating.

Speaker 2:          16:31          So when we did our, our big study in Holland, I worked with a woman there named Mikayla shippers. And uh, uh, another professor named Ad Cheaper's and we ran about 7,000 students through this program now. And then we broke them up, not only buy, buy, buy sex, but also by ethnicity. And so we broke them into male and female and also Dutch national and no one western ethnic minority. And then we looked at, at their initial performance before they did the program. And so the higher performing people where the Dutch women and then the Dutch Dutchmen and then the non Western ethnic minority women and then the non Western ethnic minority men who were out underperforming the Dutch women by about 70%. So a huge margin and dropping out far more frequently. When they did the program, the nonwestern ethnic minority men caught up to the Dutch women and passed them within two years.

Speaker 2:          17:34          And then we, no kidding, man, that just blew me away. And so like, cause that's, that's so unlikely, right? Usually when you, when you produce an intervention that's designed to improve things, first of all, it usually fails. Sometimes it makes things worse. And even if it does succeed, what usually happens is, is it makes the higher performing people do even better. But that isn't what this did. What it did was take the people who were doing the worst and it increased their performance up to the point where they were indistinguishable from the high performers. And so, so there's a bunch of things about that that's interesting in the first is that people make the claim all the time that say in European communities that if you're a visible minority, the reason that you're not attaining the same, uh, accomplishment level, let's say, is because of sociological or political or economic reasons.

Speaker 2:          18:26          But we produced a psychological intervention that helped people get their acts together at the individual level to set concrete goals for themselves that they want it and that removed the effects. And so that's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about because you know, among your listeners there are going to be people of, of all sorts who are drifting and, and a lot of what I'm doing when I'm talking to live audiences as an on youtube is to, is to tell people, help people figure out how to get their act together and aim at what they want. But what it, what seems to be the case is if you can get men to sit down and think about how they can take responsibility for what they want in a way that would also simultaneously benefit the community. Their performance goes way up and their quality of life improves and their mental health improves.

Speaker 2:          19:12          And, and I've got like hundreds of letters now from people who have listened to the lectures or done that program and said that, you know, it's turned their life around and stopped them from being nihilistic. Stop them from wasting their time constantly and doing foolish things and set them on a path that they regard as much as much more powerful. That's the thing too, it's, it's not that, the other thing that isn't taught to young men now is that the reason you get your act together so that you have power and influence, right? So you get strong and indomitable and so that nobody can get in your way. And I don't mean that you become a cruel monster. Although being able to be a cruel monster is actually extremely useful, but doesn't mean you should be one. But being able to be one is means that you're no pushover and who you know, you're, what kind of man are you. If you're a pushover, you're hearing you're not good for yourself or anyone else. So anyway, so that's been very exciting.

Speaker 1:          20:09          Yeah, it sounds amazing. The results are just like, that's, that's fantastic. Like hearing that stuff. And I, and I totally understand that and it's something that, say for example, it's something that I kind of would need where I was even telling one of my friends the other day that, you know, I'm like, you will, you'll, you'll succeed much better, especially if you have something mapped out. Like if you have it, if you actually can physically see it, if you not just like, you know, thinking about and you're bouncing all over the place. It's something that I've, I would do a lot and say recently I've been say, okay, I want to get better physically and mentally, especially physically. And uh, I've just been kind of all over the place in war. I was just like, okay, I need to sit down and I really need to figure out what I'm going to do and I need to, I need to actually just write it out.

Speaker 1:          20:56          And this is, this is the type of food I'm gonna eat. This is all this legwork. When I can actually see it. Like it's so much, it's easier to, to just obtain, it's so much easier to like, it's, it's not just, I dunno, like I always just feel like saying your head, you have so many thoughts. So it's hard to just lock on to one thing though when you can actually just like focus on to something like that. Um, like this program that you have, it sounds exactly what a lot of people would need. Sounds like something that like my, my friend that I hang out with, um, like, um, every week it sounds like something that he can really benefit from. So, and I'm sure he'll watch this because he actually does watch my channel. He's like, he's a good guy.

Speaker 2:          21:30          I think what I'll do is maybe what I'll do is I'll set up a discount code for your viewers and I'll send you that. You can put it in the lake and your youtube video link. Oh, definitely. Yeah, that would be good. And I'll send you a couple of codes to, and if you feel like, if you, if you're inclined to do the program, if you're interested, maybe we can have a conversation about it after you're done.

Speaker 1:          21:49          Yeah, I'll give it a shot, man. I mean, I, I'm sure I could benefit from it myself if, especially my, my, my audience knows how, um, how chaotic my life has been. How, um, they, they, they never know what setting I'm going to have in the background because I move around so much and I'm, I mean, I'm just, I'm just trying to, you know, I'm, I'm figuring things out as I go do and I'm very open and honest, so I never, I don't know. I never, I never tried to hide the fact that I just like, oh, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm getting pretty old. I mean, I'm not old, but I mean it just to a standard of, I shouldn't be bouncing from place to place because I'm, you know, traditionally I should probably have my own spot and, and it should be completely focused in and established. And, you know, like I said, I just,

Speaker 2:          22:33          so you've obviously latched onto something. I mean, you've, you've produced a pretty successful youtube channel, so how, how, how common, how did you manage that?

Speaker 1:          22:43          Well, it was, um, I, I mean from a young age, I always knew that I wanted to entertain people. Like I just didn't know exactly what I thought it was going to be through music because I always would play music. I always, uh, you know, started playing the guitar and the drums and stuff. And, uh, when I, when I kind of reg recognize that that wasn't really what I wanted to pursue because of just the, the independent, like the independent thoughts and the stuff that I want to do, the visions that I have, it's very hard to work with people, especially when there was other people have their own type of visions and ambitions. So when there was something like Youtube, oh, when that became a thing, um, I started just, just putting some stuff out there. Like I actually, I honestly thought I was going to be like a gaming channel when I first started the channel.

Speaker 1:          23:27          Um, that was the first thing that I was going to try to do, especially since, uh, gamers were doing so well. It's like I would love to be a part of that community, but when I saw, um, like I said, free speech being threatened when I saw a, the thing that propped up like say in 2014, ah, Gamergate. And, um, and, and then there was all little where a lot of these, you know, radical leftist, we're, we're going after things like metal and saying that metal is sexist and stuff like that. Um, and we need to, we need to do something about it. And, and that's when I started just putting out some content and people were starting to listen. And, um, it's no secret that it's no secret that people, a lot of people like to listen to me because they think like I'm a breath of fresh air.

Speaker 1:          24:06          It especially, you know, there's, there's this, there's a, and there's a stigma, um, you know, of, of, of black Americans where people are so shocked too that, oh, wow, it's so nice to meet somebody that's not x, y, z. And you know, it, it sucks to say that it sucks to say that, but it's just, it's just the truth. I mean, you know, the, the, the black men that I know in my area or say that I've met and I've lived in say south central Los Angeles just smack Dab in the middle. And it's just unfortunate. It's an unfortunate community. They're not really interested in like say they can really benefit from a pro the your program because they're, they're just not interested in anything. And a lot of people that I've met and I've worked a bunch of different jobs there, they just, they already, they feel like they're, they're doomed already. Their, their, their destiny has already been set. They are,

Speaker 2:          24:54          it's a terrible thing for people to say because the world is full of more possibility than people generally realize. And um, you know, here's a couple of things that are, that are interesting in that regard. So you, you may or may not deal with it. I've done a lot of work on the psychology of religion. And one of the things I did was look into the origin of the word sin. And strangely enough, so the word sin means essentially to violate the sacred moral code, something like that. And you can think about that is breaking a rule, but that's not exactly the right way to think about it because sometimes it's a sin not to break a rule. You know, if the rule is is, is unjust or, or tyrannical or outdated or blind, then it's up to you to break the damn rule and to suffer the consequences.

Speaker 2:          25:44          And so to sit and means more to go against your own spirit and to violate your own spirit and to violate your own, your own proper motive being, you know, to not to be true to yourself. And it's actually derived from a Greek word and the word is [inaudible]. [inaudible] and [inaudible] is an archery term and it means to miss the center of the target. And so in my, in my role as a clinical psychologist, I'm always dealing with helping people. Uh, you might think what I'm doing is curing mental illness, but that's, I don't think that's really what I'm doing. What I'm doing is helping people get their lives together. And lots of people come to me not because they have mental illness big because they have very, very complicated lives. They have, their families are fractured or, and they're under extreme societal pressure and they're, you know, they have economic trouble and maybe they're sick and like life is hard on them and they have real problems.

Speaker 2:          26:38          And what we try to do is to figure out what the target is and then figure out how they can hit it. And I can tell you a couple of reasons why people fail. And one reason is is that they don't ever define what constitutes success. So they never even aim at the target. And my experience has been, if you specify a target intelligently, like he can't, you don't want to shoot your Arrow at a target that's 50 miles away that you can't see, you're not going to hit it. You have to put a target that's pretty close and then it's sort of within your skill level. But most of the time if you set up a target property and you practice, you can hit it. And so the idea that people have that they're do from the outset. That's, that's true. If you believe it.

Speaker 2:          27:21          And I know, and I'm, I'm not trying to say that that life is equally difficult for everyone and you should just pull up your socks and get at it. I'm not saying that because I know full well that that's not true, but you can overcome a tremendous amount of, of, uh, opposition. You can, you can defeat a very, very powerful set of adversaries if you're locked onto goal that you truly value and that and that you've thought through and articulate it. And writing that down does really help as you observe before the psychological literature on that is very clear. So I would say don't, don't make the mistake of assuming that your life is doomed without putting that theory thoroughly to the test. And you know, the other problem with that idea, and this is something that goes along with nihilism, is that you might say, well, it's, it's pointless and I'm doomed and the world is against me. It's like, yeah, the problem is that also gives you an excuse not to take any responsibility. And maybe that's the underground reason why you're, why you're saying that you're doomed and that everything is stacked against you. You know, that, and that's not to say that there aren't structural inequalities and all of that because obviously there are so,

Speaker 1:          28:34          yeah. And, um, and that's something that I 100% agree with you. I think that, but I think, yeah, I think leaning more towards, I think there's a lot of people that just try to opt out and they then, you know, they don't want to take any responsibility. I think there's a bigger influence of that where there are clearly there are clear cut examples of, of people just thriving, you know, um, through the, um, the worst of circumstances.

Speaker 2:          28:57          I made this video called message to millennials at, at New Year's around New Year's. And that got to be very popular. And I think it was, I think I made the future, I think I talked about the future authoring program in that video, but one of the things I had thought about was I thought it would be comical and this was after I came across you, I thought it would be comical if I could run a discount code for the future authoring for black guys, but I didn't know how I would do that. But what's the demographics of your, of your, of your viewership, do you know like who watches you?

Speaker 1:          29:31          There's a very small amount of, my demographic normally is like say a Caucasian male of course. And because of that there's a, there are some, some black dudes that just don't even want to, that, you know, they want to call me a coon or an uncle tom or whatever. And they're saying that I'm catering to the due to the white man and all this. And

Speaker 2:          29:52          why do they say that though? Because I mean like why is, why is that, why is that something that would be directed against you? Because that seems like a, like it's a curious kind of insult, you know, I mean I understand being insulted, I get insulted, but you, your, you have to wonder sometimes why it's that particular kind of insult that gets directed against someone. So why do you think that's being, why are you, why are you being put down in that particular way?

Speaker 1:          30:17          I just feel like, I feel like it's there. I feel like there's a lot of people that are just being told to think that way. I don't, I don't think genuinely because I never really had that issue. Um, I, I really didn't have that issue growing up with, um, with like say when I would be in a, in a, in the black community. Um, there were a lot of them because there were some people that just like, say for example, that maybe grew up in a private school a little bit and they had a diff, a little bit of a different start. Maybe they're an empty vessel and they were just able to just have like books, like just literature and it didn't really grow up on TV and stuff. And that's kind of how I got my start. And then from there I just kind of entered the public spirit of, of school and everything.

Speaker 1:          30:55          And so most people were pretty cool with me. But then as I started to gain a little bit of notoriety, I started to notice that there's, there's quite a few people that, and I'm like, where are you getting this thought process from where I'm, I'm, I'm like a trader or I am a coon if I don't, if I'm not exactly like you, if I'm not like say you know, the stereotypical bt black guy that's just only exclusively into hip hop, you know, I like, I love listening to hip hop, but you know, I also actually like, um, metal a lot more. And because of that thing, it's like, oh, you're, you're a, you're whitewashed or you're this. And I'm like, why? Why? Like why, why are we, he

Speaker 2:          31:34          seems particularly dopey to think of you as a sellout because you've made yourself a presence on youtube. It's not like anybody's handed that to you on a silver platter. It was just something, I mean, that sort of thing is open to anyone. And, and we're in the wild west frontier days of youtube and you built yourself a following, pretty much of your own accord. So I don't see, I, I mean it's to obviously some of it's got to be to do with resentment and jealousy. You'd say that because that sort of thing that generally drives insults. Right. But I saw the same, similar thing happening. I thought it was very distressing at that free speech rally that we talked about. There was a kid there who now works for rebel media, Nikki opion guy and he's pretty dark and pretty articulate, you know, and, and now he's cut himself a good career with rebel media, which is pretty funny.

Speaker 2:          32:24          But, um, when he was speaking at the open mic, because it was an open, open mic session, the woman who founded black lives matter in Toronto was standing about 12 feet away from him. And she yelled coon Adam about a times and I thought, well, she's, she's someone I have who I think is almost utterly contemptible and yeah. And, and because her, her behavior generally speaking is beyond reprehensible. But I thought that was, I thought that was a remarkable thing for her to be doing. Absolutely. Jaw droppingly appalling things to think to do. But I was also curious about why that particular insult.

Speaker 1:          33:06          What does that mean to her? I mean, I, I, I wonder that myself. Um, I wonder that myself, especially because like reading up from my understanding of what a coon actually is and what a coon, uh, used to be was kind of like the, was kind of like the whole, uh, the, the shucking and jiving term where you had to like turn on, you had to like put on like a, a show to entertain, you know, the, the masses or whatever. You had to, you had to like, you know, um, for example, be very stereotypical, like say a lot of people that, a lot of people in the black community, the ones that are calling people a black people like me, a coon or kind of, they're actually the ones that are at koons themselves. Actually, the Wa the way that I'm like, yeah. And it's like hate you mean?

Speaker 1:          33:49          Yeah. And it's like, dude, it's so, it's so embarrassing to see how like the descent that I get on my channel, I get a lot of, um, valid criticism from people. Sometimes they'll, they'll tear me a new ae because sometimes I'm just, you know, I deserve it. Sometimes I deserve it. But when it comes to like, um, black people, usually the ones that are, you can visibly see their thumbnails and avatars. It's just, it's, I actually feel very disappointed because it's usually just an ad hominem. It's usually Kuhn and it's usually sell out. I can just do the keyword search and, and um, search Koonin they see you as somebody joking around because I was, I made a video like about a year ago or something just called like Hashtag [inaudible] Macoun just basically embracing it, kind of showing me, I don't really, I don't really buckle. I don't, I really don't care.

Speaker 1:          34:37          Like the Ad Hominem attacks and just, just petty insults. It, it does not affect me at, at whatsoever. So that was actually, um, I, I, I, I was supposed to make a shirts and everything like that, but I kind of got a little bit behind. Um, but yeah, just kind of showing people that, hey, it's, you know, whatever, just let that just slide off of you. And, um, it's, that's all, that's all they have. And I, I just, it does kind of break my heart a little bit. I feel like, say, I would hope that I would be somewhat of, um, like of an example of, hey, you know, it's not, it's not hopeless. Like you can, you know, it's, it's stop, stop talking about systemic racism and, and saying that it, you know, chopping a doomsayer and try to better yourself, you know, try to, if you're, if you're living in a bad situation, how, how can you get yourself out of it?

Speaker 1:          35:28          I always use my mother as an example where she talks about just, um, all this stuff that she went through. She went through a lot of stuff. And, and to be able to, uh, raise two kids and, you know, put us, uh, give us a good start in private school, private elementary and, and then on, and then I went to public school afterwards. But I had, it just gave me a huge advantage to where my mind felt incredibly stimulated to the point where I remember doing like, uh, uh, fractions and taxes when I was in first grade. Uh, dealing with those type of things that were, it was very typical that the time. But now like very useful to the point where, hey, I do my own taxes, I don't have any problems with that. And like people are always like, oh, I don't know what to do. I've got to pay somebody some money. And I'm like, Nah, dude. What?

Speaker 2:          36:13          I think also the insults, like there's a, there's a, there's a kind of, there's a kind of challenge that's associated with them too. So if someone, like if you're involved in a particular worldview and someone comes up who actually challenges that either by what they say or what they do, the first thing you're going to do because you don't want to recalibrate your entire belief system is you're going to throw horrible things at them and see if any of them stick. And so I guess partly what happens is that, and I'm in, I mean I've been insulted in that way as well because people have called me a bigot and, and it turns than up. And uh, I was protected against that to some degree I think because I'd already put 500 hours of videos online. And so if I was any of those reprehensible things, people probably could have found that out pretty quickly by going through the material that I put online because I every, almost every word I've uttered to students in the last five years has been recorded and is publicly accessible.

Speaker 2:          37:12          So if there was anything in what I was saying or what I believe that was actually, it actually deserved that kind of a derogatory classification, then it would be found out very rapidly. But it's also the case, I think that people, when they throw those sorts of things that you, there's a part of them that's hoping that you can withstand it and tell them exactly why they're wrong. Just on the off chance that you're the real thing. And so you know, you're, you've got a certain amount of success that you generated yourself. And so people are going to say, well you sold out and then they're going to sit back and watch and see what you say is like, well, I said he's sold out. Maybe it's true, but maybe he can defend himself too. So it's sort of like people will throw the worst that they can at you and see if you can withstand it. And that's part of the way they test to see if they actually should pay any attention to you. And so, so how come, how come you're able to let the insults, let's say, why do you, why do they, I mean they must bother you to some degree, but they don't bother you that much and you don't let them stop you. And why is that?

Speaker 1:          38:18          Well, it's the only thing like that, that the only thing that bothers me is like say the insults when it, when it comes to, especially when it comes out, when it's race related, the ones that bother me are the ones that like say when it comes from, when black people in general, the ones that I would cause feel like say my content could help out. Uh, some, some black Americans. I've made some videos about saying, you know, stop basically stop just thinking that they're, the world's against you. Stop just thinking that uh, United States is this a systemic, a systemic racist system in 2017 or whatever. And you can't, there's just no point of trying, like, stop telling your children that, you know, like give them a, give them a boost. I would think that they would help me out. So that's the only time when, when they say stuff to me like that everybody else, um, I've been on the Internet for so long that people are just going to talk and say some of the worst things.

Speaker 1:          39:09          And most times they would never say it to your face. They would never, most people, now it's starting to, but now I'm starting to see a shift though, especially from looking at the protest and, and the speeches that you were trying to give him and when people are trying to shut them down, what I'm seeing is what normally used to just be fantasy becoming reality and like in the, in the entire spectrum where like say if you've ever, I don't know if you've ever actually been on tumbler.com I don't know if you've actually logged on there, but see a lot of tumbler at all. Yeah, it is. Um, I would say that a lot of stuff that you hear nowadays, like when you hear about gendered pronouns diseaser and all the weird things that are coming up foot and the other Ken and, um, people just being just mean and just nasty to a lot of that stuff.

Speaker 1:          39:58          I would see that was tumbler. Like I've never heard of any type of, you know, a hundred different type of, uh, pronouns until, ah, tumblr and I don't know what this was like the safe space for them, I guess. And now do you think Tumblr is like that? Why do you think that's focused there? I've, I've wondered that myself. I've, um, I, I have a friend that I was, I respect her greatly, but she's one of those people that, that, you know, uh, changes her name and her and her pronouns and this and that and had a boyfriend that, um, you know, he has a beard and stuff, but he's like, call me. She, and I'm like, okay, I'm sure. Um, but, and I'm trying to figure out like what, where I can't find the root and, and seeing like his was there like a giant presence or maybe a public figure that maybe started talking about these ideas because I don't know, the only thing, that earliest thing that I could really find, I remember like say back in 2011 I started seeing a trend happened in Texas where it was being wolves.

Speaker 1:          40:58          Those were on that twilight movies. This, the twilight started to come out. Maybe it was even younger because I think the toilets were, yeah, it came out a while ago on the movies. But um, I started seeing that a bunch of people are starting to dress like wolves or putting tails on and all these things. And I was starting to see stuff like that and maybe it was just the pop culture, things like that. We're making it socially acceptable. And then it started to be discussed on forums and everything. And then maybe tomorrow. I don't know how it became the, the, the, the ground zero, but it seems like that for me and now it's just being translated into academia. Like your, you're starting. Okay. So That's interesting because you know, one of the things I've wondered about with all this identity

Speaker 2:          41:34          transformation, and this includes not only the sort of gender let's call it play that you're talking about, but also that other kin, uh, uh, universe, it looks a lot to me like the sort of fantasy play that's characteristic of kids when they were about ages say from about four to about nine or maybe four to 11, you know, that that would be the, the, the, the maximal extent of it. And I wonder to some degree if what's happening is that because, because I don't think that modern kids get enough chance to engage in fantasy play. Like, like pretend play like they did 30 or 40 years ago, that maybe that was, that's been pushed aside by, by mass media. It's being pushed aside by computers and video games. It's been pushed aside by cell phones. And it's also less common because children's play is so structured now, partly because they don't have very many siblings and play dates are set up in kids' lives are hyper structured.

Speaker 2:          42:37          And so kids have to go through that pretend play period. And I'm wondering if maybe because we've suppressed that in our society, if it's blossoming out in universities when kids get away from their parents and can start to experiment with their own identity, if they, if they're doing that through uh, in, in, uh, in, uh, because it looks like pretend play. I'm going to pretend to be a boy. I'm going to pretend to be a girl. I'm going to pretend to be an animal. I'm going to pretend to be a war wolf. It's fantasy play and there's a lot of objection when people say, well, I'm not going to play your game. You can play your game, but I'm not going you, you don't have any right to compel me to play your game. But it may be that there's a developmental impulse that's being manifest there that didn't get its chance to express itself at the proper stage of development. Something like that is it really is strange.

Speaker 1:          43:31          It is. And I, I, I feel like there definitely is some type of correlation because when you, when, when I was, when I was a kid and when know we're going out, we were like, oh, I was just, I'm old enough to where we didn't have any type of a technology other than like say the Super Nintendo was, was like, oh, this is amazing. And I'm, no, I would take the bus. I can only think kids can do this anymore. Just take public transportation. I'll be back by sundown. I would go to another shitty, sometimes I'll just go ride my bike and me and my friends would have like missions. We would do crazy stuff hugely. Like, um, I wish I recorded some of this stuff so I can remember it. But my point is that yeah, definitely kids don't have anything like that. And like you said, the, with the mass media, with a, with the video games, as much as I love video games, there is so much structure that you can't really, you can't really branch out and really create the, you're very limited to what you can do.

Speaker 1:          44:23          Even when like bdo games when you can like create a character and stuff. Sometimes that's as far as it can go, but you're still kind of limited to where you, where you can, you, you can't fantasize. It's why I say I still like, I still love reading books because you can just, you create your own world in it. And then sometimes if somebody has read the same book, you can compare and contrast and be like, how do you see this character? Even though if sometimes they describe them, you'll still have an imagery of how they look. And I think that

Speaker 2:          44:49          boy, because I think what happened in part was that, you know, kids engage in pretend play when they're too young to read, but then when they start reading fiction, they are still engaging in pretend play because they have to imagine the characters. Whereas in movies and in video games to characters are basically put forth for them and that, and that there's utility in that because there, there can be additional structure but the law, but the problem is, is that additional structure also stops you from having to use your imagination. And it's, it's through your imagination that you experiment with all the different things that you could be. And maybe that's just being pushed later into development now. And that's why the young people are so outraged when you, when you violate their there pretend identity, you know, they look like kids playing to me except that they're really, they're too old to be doing that.

Speaker 1:          45:39          Yeah. I mean, and that's where, and that's why it's so, it's so absurd to me that say something like, uh, uh, see 16 it could even be like, pastor did that. There's even a need for it that there's, because like you said, it does seem like make believe and pretend and it's like, how are you taking, how can you take this seriously? How could you take this seriously and, and, and, and what's happening? It also seems like such a, a major, uh, regression, like something that you're trying to hammer down on, like say on free speech, you can get in trouble by misusing someone's pronouns. And then now, um, recently, uh, m one oh three motion the motion has been brought up and um, what has been going on with in one word in one or three? Have you been keeping up with that?

Speaker 2:          46:26          Oh yeah. Well, well, one of the things that's happening that's really interesting is that, um, as far as I'm concerned, so I'm going to do a couple of lecture series or a lecture series in the next year and I'm starting in May. And what I want to do is start at the beginning of the Bible and talk about the psychological significance of all the stories right from the beginning to the end. But I also, and this is something I, my Patriot patrion funding is helping me with this. And then there's something else that I want to do in parallel, which is that I started talking to a group of moderate Muslims about a week and a half ago while and some a couple of months ago. Very, very smart people and very committed and they want to put forth, uh, they want to start the process of describing what a reformed and moderate Islam might be. And so, and I think that's the right way to go with regards to the tension that exists between the West and the Islamic world or even within Canada, between, there isn't a lot of tension in Canada.

Speaker 2:          47:29          Yeah, I'm about anything really. But to the degree that there is tension, what needs to be done between new immigrant communities and the communities that they're integrated to obviously is for a dialogue of consensus to be B to b started. And hopefully that I'm going to engage in that. And that's the proper way to fight Islamophobia. But the, the current government insisted that this motion, which is, it's not a bill, it's just a, it's emotion, which is a expression of commitment on the part of parliament to go and study, uh, uh, um, an issue or to make a moral stance on an issue. And they described

Speaker 2:          48:10          the concern with the emergent Islamophobia and the opposition parties in Canada complained about the specifications of Islam in this, in the wording of this motion and said, well, look, we can, we will all support an Auntie prejudice and anti harassment and antidiscrimination motion cross religions, no problem. But if you use that word Islamophobia specifically, we're not going to support it. And so they offered to the, to the current government the possibility of unanimous consent for the motion, but the originators of the bill wouldn't withdraw the wording, which I thought was absolutely appalling because Islamophobia is a really, it's not a good word, stress ball. It takes a medical term phobia and uses it politically, which is really a treacherous and sneaky thing to do. And second, it specifies a specific religion when there's no evidence that that religion is being specifically targeted. I mean it might, there's no real evidence in Canada that the adherence of that religion or suffering from any more discrimination then the adherence of other minority religions or even the adherence of, of so called majority religions. So it was a very bad idea. But,

Speaker 2:          49:26          and so I, I think just other approach is better. And so my I publicly opposed m one oh three a with a certain amount of the fact because I'd be talking to the people who, who are running for the leadership of the official opposition in Canada, the Conservative Party. And I've talked to a number of them about [inaudible] three and about also we shoes of responsibility among young men because the conservatives finally have something to sell at young people and they never have it for the first time in the history of, of conservatism during my lifetime anyways. The Conservatives have something to sell to young people and that's responsibility. And so we've also been talking a lot about that. But, um, so, so there was some opposition to I'm one or three and I think the proper way to, to progress with that too, to reduce the tension between the Islamic world in general but also Islamic newcomers in Canada and, and longer term Canadians is to engage in a dialogue with moderate people.

Speaker 2:          50:22          And I hope that that's going to get off the ground. We've, we've got the ball rolling in some very people already on board. We've got the ball rolling for that and I hope I'm going to play a role in that. So that would be really exciting. It would be really fun to do that in parallel with this biblical series. So, cause then I can, I can approach the fundamental stories of, of Judaism and Christianity at the same time as engaging in a public discussion about the meaning of Islam and the implications of Islamic belief for, for, for the broader political culture. So that's an exciting opportunity. No doubt about it.

Speaker 1:          50:58          Yeah, that sounds great. And it sounds like a great way to go about it too. If you can do those things simultaneously, especially he's still, there can be any talk about like, oh, he's just a criticizing Islam or, or, or whatever. When you also, you're just, you're, you're, you're, you're talking about just religion and that kind of across the board, you know, and I'm trying to understand it. Yeah. And I think a lot of people are too, and I think that's kind of like what's so frustrating about what's been happening and things like say in one or three even like existing or say something for quite some time on, on youtube that just, there are certain words that if you put it in your title, your tags, like your video would be demonetized. They're saying it's advertiser, it is an advertiser friendly. And you know, sometimes you wouldn't even be saying anything harsh.

Speaker 1:          51:47          I like say sometimes they'll say, I would just love to have an honest and open dialect about Islam because I think there's a lot of people that don't understand it. Now there was a lot of people that are just like, oh, all Muslims are this. And I've seen quite a few people that are like that. I'm like, wow, I think we need to talk about this. And, and people don't want to talk about it because people that were full time, you're not gonna make any money off of it. And it sucks. Like, I feel like it's such more of a important issue that I would just, I wouldn't like say I put out a video, um, this just talking about what happened in London not too long ago, just because I, and I knew it was going to do monetize my, like, why not? I want to just at least put it out there and just saying, can we, can we, can we talk about this? Can we, can we be honest and say that there's definitely some type of issues. And like on both sides, there's, there's just, um, you know, there's a lack of communication and I think, yeah, what you're, what you're gonna do is, is fantastic because it's, it's desperately needed.

Speaker 2:          52:41          Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you know, I'm fortunate because last April when I set up my patron account, which was way before this political political issue exploded, I did it mostly out of curiosity because you know, I was making, I would say, fairly low quality videos from a production perspective. I was just using an ipad on a, on a tripod.

Speaker 3:          53:06          Okay.

Speaker 2:          53:10          I was just using an ipad on a tripod and I thought, well, maybe I could, you know, I, by that time I'd had about a million views. And I thought, wow, that's, that's a lot, man. If I wrote a book that sold a million copies, I'd be dancing a jig out on the street. So I was starting to take youtube seriously because I thought, I thought about it for a while and I thought, well, oh, I see what's happening. This is, this is like a Gutenberg revolution. It's the first time in human history where the spoken word has as much reach as a book and as much permanency. And that's a whole new thing, man. And, and it's way faster than a book. Like you can, as you know, you can. Well, this video we're making right now, we can have this published and in front of an audience, an immense audience, and attract a couple of hundred thousand viewers within a few days.

Speaker 2:          53:58          It's unparalleled. And so I thought, oh, I'll set up a patriot and account because that was a new thing too. And because I was, I've been really curious about how creative people can monetize what they're doing and it's very difficult. And so I was looking into that and I found Patriot and I thought, well I'll set up a patriot account, see what happened. But I was fortunate because I decided not to use advertiser generated revenue on Youtube. I decided to use patron and I didn't know it at the time, but that also made me more or less immune to threats of such things as demonetization, which is, which is a form of, it's not exactly a form of censorship, it's more, it's more like, it's more like an attempt to turn the, the tremendous diversity of music on youtube into elevator music. Right. It can be contentious because then you can't sell advertising on it.

Speaker 2:          54:50          Well, if it's not contentious. And interesting. No one's going to watch it. So it's a, it's a suicide move in some sense on the part of the advertisers because if they sanitize youtube, then all that's going to happen is another, another free speech video site is going to pop up and people are all gonna flock there in no time flat. Like it's longterm suicidal move. But um, but there are ways to protect yourself against it. Um, and, and Patriot on seems to be an interesting way of doing that. How many, how many youtube videos have you had? Demonetized

Speaker 1:          55:22          um, I've had, I've, I've, luckily I haven't had too many, I probably had a total of like six. And um, the, the, the ones that, the main ones that have been demonetized where the were pretty old and I wasn't really going to generate any money for them anyways. So it was, and however, this month, um, I've had one of them that was one of my better videos, the, or at least it did better. And it was the one about, um, the, the attack in London and that was immediately to monetize. And I was just like, well, okay, fine. And then another one, because because of, um, the whole ad hysteria with a bunch of the companies pulling out, they started to crack down a little bit harder. And they am, I responded to, there's this company called Mike and they just still put out a bunch of nonsense.

Speaker 1:          56:10          Like a lot of people are starting to pull back a little bit on their social justice warrior, ultra progressive nonsense, but they're still pushing on. And they had a video called things by people killed in 2016 and we're just like a bunch of trends, right? A dancing moves and all this stuff saying that if why people do it, it's, you know, it's cringy a, and I'm, and it's still, you know, just being, it's only true for nerdy white people. It's right. I mean, that's really what it comes down to like, but like, I mean, and it comes out even like say, I mean just nerdy people in general when you see people dance or do something that just have no rhythm, it's just so cringey but you just can't look, you get the secondhand embarrassment. Right. And um, but yeah, they just put out some ridiculous stuff.

Speaker 1:          56:49          So I reacted to that and that video did very well and that got demonetized recently, so I'm like, oh great. So I'm not going to get anything from that anymore. One last thing I want to ask you because people really wanted to know, uh, what is your opinion on pineapple pizza as a topping? Um, well a pineapple is upon you hate, you hate pizza. I used to work at a pizza restaurant and I learned was that you actually have a lifetime maximum of pizza ingestion and once you hit that, you can't actually eat any more pizza. And so I hit that when I was about 16 cause I worked in a pizza restaurant for about four years. And so I ate my 10000th pizza and that was like, oh, that's it, man. There was something about the spice. I think it might be a Reagan know that that specific spice that I don't like, and so even covering it up with pineapple, that would improve it, but it still makes it really difficult for me to eat pizza. All right. Fair enough. Fair enough. All right. All right. Sounds good. All right. I'm Dr. Peterson. Thank you so much for taking the time out of your, I'm sure your insanely busy schedule to talk to me, man. It's been an absolute honor and it was real fun and I like your channel and I wish you the best of luck, truly, and I hope you, I hope you get yourself oriented and, and knock 'em dead. Good. Most definitely, man. Thanks again. I appreciate it all. All right. All right. Bye. Bye.
