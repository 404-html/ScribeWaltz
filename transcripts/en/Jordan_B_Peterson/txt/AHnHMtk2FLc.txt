Speaker 1:          00:05          So I have a plan I'd like to talk to you about, I presume that most of you watching this video are subscribers and are interested in the content of this channel. Um, I'd like to improve it. There are some features of the videos, especially the class lectures that I'm not happy about and I presume you're not all that happy. Both them either. Um, most importantly, I think they lack the proper images, but there are also segments of the videos that are only relevant to an in class audience, so information about tests and so on and there's parts of them that arena audible or where the digressions aren't exactly appropriate and as well there are lectures across years that pertained to the same theme that should be unified in some manner so that they're as intelligible and tight as they could be. I'd also like to make transcripts available to people and it would be good if the lectures were subtitled. The transcriptions would help with that and then maybe they can also be translated. Um, I have some volunteers who are already working on that. So I set up a page for this channel on a site called Patrion.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Patriot allows people who are interested in the contents of say a youtube channel like this one to help in the further development of the projects that are posted there. So if you're interested in doing that and you'd like to see the sorts of things that I just described, then you could click and subscribe and maybe that would be good. So that's the plan.
