Speaker 1:          00:00:00       So you were to have read today. This section on classification is just a small section, right on categorization. And then the next section on boss, basically on the new buddy Alicia, the rest of the taping and the creation myth. Okay. Now that's the most fun. That's the most archaic up creation guest that we have in written form in anything approaching a state of completeness. So it's interesting from a historical perspective, um, because it's so archaic. It's also an like the Mesopotamians has an extraordinarily well developed dogma, Religious Dogma as far as I've been able to be terrible in some ways. Well I think in, in many ways Jewish and Christian theology are elaborations on a mess of attaining to think they'll eliod. It points out the Mesopotamian creation myth, although it's about 5,000 years old and seq stamp form is definitely based on oral traditions that are much older than that. So it's not, it's not like you can say that the Sumerians just originated the Enuma elish in a, in a very brief period of time on ground that haven't been prepared. They just codify, uh, traditions that have been handed down orally to that date and so we haven't been written for it. Now.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       The first thing I wanted to tell you about was this notion of categorization and I think, I think this is Roger Brown pointed out with 20 years ago or there about that time. We have always in psychology tended to think that the way that people think is the way that scientists think and the way that we categorize things is in terms of the categories that we think are appropriate from the scientific or the logical perspective. Brown points out that this is well that is a minimal amount of investigation basically in the cycle. Linguistic domain immediately indicated that this was in fact false and that we do not categorize things naturally the way that people do scientifically. In other words, we don't use the notion of the proper set and he uses as a standard example of the proper set, the idea of triangles and you can tell what a triangle is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       Absolutely. You can define what's a triangle, what isn't. There's no fuzziness about the borders and everything either fits in the set or is outside of the set and by contrast are natural categories don't seem to be of that type. They have fuzzy boundaries and they're more concerned with function, so to speak, or with an effect of relevance than with sensory and with swift. Absolutely determinable sensory essence. So we categorize in in much more vague manner. And it seems to me that I gave you the listing in this, in this document of the qualities of natural categorization as they'd been described by George Lakoff in his book, a women fire and dangerous things and lack off is basically following up on a tradition as I'm not a psycho linguist, and this is no new news to me basically. But lakoff has been falling apart. Church tradition that was established by Roger Brown and Eleanor Ross, who was one of his students and the older elder has made a big name for herself studying categorization.

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       The thing I think is so interesting about this is that what Rosch and lakoff describe as categories are very, very much like the kinds of categories that religious thinkers have used that have been studied from a completely different perspective by people like [inaudible] and Mircea Eliade. So it's not that surprising if you think about it because it's obvious that religious categories aren't proper sets, their natural categories are can't people in religious categories. And I've always thought that way. So it's not like it's, it's not that surprising. What's surprising our guests more surprising is that the overlap between the two literatures is, is not well explored or, no. So, uh, the first thing we should do, I guess is think to think about this notion of categorization.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       Yeah. Okay. Lakoff describes natural categories is cognitive models. So the first thing he says is that they are embodied with regards to their content, which essentially means that they can be used without necessarily being defined. It means that they are implicit in action without necessarily being implicit and description. So basically what lakoff is pointing out is that if you act towards a number of different things, as if they are the same thing with regards to your actions, then you are in fact, uh, you are in fact treating those objects as if they're in the same category. Because one domain of category can be fucked, like significance for motor output. And that's, you think, if you think about, it's like what defines chair because chair's very and all sorts of ways, they vary so much that there's very, there may be very little sensory overlap between one chair and another if there's not much. There's not much similar between a stump, for example. And the kind of designer chair that you might see in a museum, they're very different objects. But the thing they have in common is their implication for output, which is the chairs are things that you can sit on, right? They're defined by their, by their significance in our under sensory nature. So I used an example here. What makes a dog you? You might say, I can't say but I know one when I see one, which is another indication that you'd be using a natural category,

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       the August something friendly, something to be petted and something to play with. Although such knowledge does not comprise everything that makes up you regard his dog. The thing that's interesting about those ideas, something friendly, something to be petted and something to play with is that in a sense those are not precisely the attributes of the dog. I think of a natural category of dog because what you're, if you define a dog as a friend or as something to play with, you're actually defining the object in terms of your interactions with it and not in terms of the object and a lot of the terms we use have exactly that nature. Like beautiful. For example, it says when you define it, say if you to find another person that's beautiful. It's very difficult to tell exactly where it is that that quality besides, I mean people say beauty's in the eye of the beholder.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       We know there's quite a substantial amount of cultural variation in terms of attitudes towards beauty. So it's very difficult to pin down what constitutes beauty from the objective perspective. I mean there's been a certain certain attempts to do that and they've been somewhat successful. But the point is is that as beauty's in the eye of the beholder, but it's something that we naturally attribute to an object. So a lot of the things that we consider properties of objects are actually what lakoff describes his interaction with properties. There are things that we attribute to the thing that actually arise as a consequence of our interaction with the thing. So like the notion of friend, when you, when you describe, if you put someone in the category of friend, you're actually describing them in terms of your pattern of interactions with them. Although you attributed the qualities that make up those interactions to them and you do that automatically.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       And what I'm suggesting with, with regards to this study of categorization is that we do that. That is the natural way that we think is we think about things in terms of their implication for our behavioral output and we need to do that because that's what adaptation means and say a few of adapt adapted to something. You've structured your behavior well. Basically what you've done is structure your behavior in the presence of that thing so that it does what you want it to do, which means basically that it doesn't threaten you then it doesn't hurt you that it furthers your progress towards the goal or that it caused the tombstone, that goal itself. That's behavioral adaptation and

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       well

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       those things, the things that make up that category of objects to which you've structured behavioral adaptation that's explored territory. How's the domain of the known say in that domain is everything that you understand how to act towards. Now what I'm trying to suggest in the course of this whole manuscript, because that's how your brain works, the scientific overlay of scientific categorizations is just a thin veneer on top of that and in some sense it's irrelevant. The near from the perspective of emotional regulation. Science has enabled us to describe things ever more accurate so that we can keep track of them are still what we're interested in is determining how to behave in the presence of things. That's what we want to know. Okay. Now lack off points on a few other things about natural categories and I want you to think about this in regards to the sorts of categories that we're going to talk about for the remainder.

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       Of course he says they're characterized by basic level categorization and basic level primacy and basically what he means by that is that we tend to view things as in a category or as objects to themselves if they're the right size for us. In other words, that the world that we perceive, which is the world of experience, which is in some sense doing world you can get access to is human sized. The cat. There are categories that naturally spring to mind because they're handy. That's a good way of thinking about, it's like the English imperial system of measurement. We can we define things in terms of being English imperial system and it's very handy. Literally a foot is a foot long and inches. The length of one digit in the point lakoff is trying to make is that the world would have experienced presents itself the way it presents itself because of the interaction between our physiology and whatever it is.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       That's how we there and one of the things that we're going to try to explore is what does it mean to say whatever it is that that's out there. I mean we tend to think of it scientifically as the objective world, which would be exactly the same as it is now if none of us were here except that none of us would be here. The point lakoff is trying to make is that what we define as reality is somewhat more or what were you experiences? Reality is more complex than that. It's an interaction between whatever it is that's out there and ask and everything that we think of is real. We defined like in terms of our experience of temporal duration and size and weight.

Speaker 3:          00:10:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       I guess the only way, the only way you can get your mind around this to some degree is to try to think of what lakoff is saying in a sense is that the fact that we're human and have the characteristics that we have, which are basically our limitations, means that the universe is constituted in a particular way with regards to us is that we have a built in level of analysis. It's obviously not the sub atomic level or at the molecular level and it's not the cosmic level either. It's human sized. Now if you start thinking about what would constitute reality in the absence of a human observer, the first problem that you run into is the problem of a reference point is you no longer have anything against which to judge things like duration or size and certainly not things like certainly not things like color or beauty or emotional significance. Don't those categories obviously disappear. What happens to the sensory categories is not all that easy to figure out either.

Speaker 3:          00:11:08       I can't, I already can't figure it out. Would you find that in his book, the Character Physical Mall discusses encoding the nature of human experience in a mathematical form and sending it to an alien so that he could reconstruct the world that we experience based on the proportion of an elemental character or an element or something like that. And he gives a fairly good, uh, just from that, it's convincing that you could describe the world independent of human experience.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       If you define, if you define the, that, that, that make up our capacity to experience is that if you eat, if you can just, you could possibly describe the world that we exceed the world in terms of something which is transhumance by, by, by using mathematical symbols. Well that's interesting. So feynman says he, he would define our level of analysis mathematically as well as what it is that we're experiencing. And that would give an alien the capacity to see what it is that we see. He wasn't, he wasn't talking about, he was talking about a trans human reality. Fiman does mischief subject the reality of reality to the presence of the subject? Right, right. Well anyway, I got to, the subject must have some sort of intelligence that is, it leaves me in some way where like our own in order to interpret what we send out there.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       So just really not [inaudible] so there's an alien out there who has a similar enough intelligence to ours that can, that can understand this thing that we've sent out. I mean then then they're the subject in question. It opens up the, it draws question too. I mean it, it sort of puts a question mark over the possibility of seeing that reality is dependent on that [inaudible] it's ridiculous talking about reality in the absence of the human subject. Well, trans human, yes, but trans subject, no. Okay. One small difference between, okay, well I don't want to make too much of this because it isn't, it's knowing something that's critical to the arguments that, that we're going to, we're going to undertake. One of the things I want to tell you about is how mythological categories represent the category of all things that exist in the absence of a subject, but just kind of a strange category and even the mythological, like in the scientific world, we presume an objective independent reality.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       I don't want to argue, I certainly don't want to argue about that because it's way too complicated an issue, but may have also presumes that something exists in the absence of a procedure or in the absence of a subject. Although the thing that exists is very difficult to define and that's one of the things we're going to take a brief look at today because my, my question is what does, what does science have to do it and all of that science, another size is size of the, of the, uh, of the raptors point that which presents us up to the reference. Well, all the lack office basically saying is that certain categories seem to present themselves to us more naturally than others. Like the category cat presents itself to us more naturally than the category of species of cat because we naturally, we're naturally predisposed, so to speak, towards making an object out of.

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       I was something like at cap now, no one knows exactly why it is that certain forms of categorization appeared to us more nationally than other sorts. I suspect it has something to do with what you can say. I have something to do with our biological hard wiring, which is not really much of an answer. It's just the way and we are and we perceive certain things more accurately than we perceive other things. I mean, just to take a trivial example in, in this room will focus all of our attention on each other's face. It's like I'm not going to spend a lot of time when I'm talking to you, looking at your hands. My natural point of orientation in our discussion is your face. It's very significant for me, and I think you see this sort of thing. If you look at children's drawings, I mean she's a child's drawing of a person's, you know, usually something like this.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       Maybe there's not even a body, but the head is 90% of the person and the face is 90% of the head. And that's, I think this is a protocol linguistic representation of me of a human being. Children tend to produce these sorts of figures spontaneously. I would say that's kind of a natural hero glyphic that stands for person and the things that are most relevant about the person or the things that are focused in on by the child. It's just certain things appear to us more naturally than other things and those things more naturally constitute our world.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       So talking about sides really quickly, you returned to physics stuff and what's intuitive that you can sort of look at the, you can sort of divide the universe into three very basic levels of order to magnitude. You can have sort of what's intuitive. There's the Newtonian universe we all live in and you can have the cosmic aware of which is sort of defined by signing mechanics and space time. And you can go to quantum mechanics, which is smaller than you could possibly perceive. And if you, if you look at the mathematics involved in each one, the Newtonian equations, the ones that make sense to you that you think in and the other ones seemed like when you read about in the first time you think to yourself, how could this be? But in a, in a sort of mathematical sense, they're all,

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       that's an excellent one because the nature, that's an excellent example because the Newtonian universe is intuitive and the reason that it's intuitive from the loch coffee perspective is that the laws are in accordance with our motor patterns are patterns of adaptation. I mean Psja is pointed out that we first adapt to objects from the motor perspective as a consequence of exploration. Then we build our abstract notions about our relationships with those objects as a consequence of our established motor patterns. So that basically that basically sums up the notion of embodied knowledge. And your point is that these other universes are counter intuitive. They, they're not in accordance with our experience. Well that's partly because they aren't the, they aren't the left the levels of resolution or the orders of magnitude towards which we actually adapt our behavior.

Speaker 2:          00:17:25       So yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       Okay. Anyways, you can finish reading through the, uh, the properties of natural categories. They have interest in categories. I also think that, well, membership and sensuality gradients is kind of an interesting category, uh, as this familial resemblance. The idea of familial resemblance is quite interesting. Basically what this is, Raj has been coaching under the thing that she's worked on. Say if we have notions of prototypes where our categories is that there's a kind of an ideal thing that constitutes the category, the category bird people wouldn't say, for example, that robin is a more prototypical burden than an ostrich and you can't exactly, do you have a question? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:18:13       Maybe it's not really a way to what you're saying, right. But do we sort of subconsciously concrete different categories or find things easier in a categorized? And what we see, I mean now we'd all look at each other's faces, but if you have dreams, you can sort of identify somebody. Even if they look completely differently, you can say, you know, and I knew in my dream this was supposed to be your father. Even though he looked like my math teacher, they maybe are we sharing of getting out of different subconscious of essence of people? Then when we

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       in in a dream or I don't know. I don't know. I know what you're saying and people. Yeah. I mean there must be some other category, some other way of categorizing. Yeah. I guess what happens in, in, in a situation and dream like that is that you have to conflict in categorizations of one takes predominance. So you say, despite all these exceptions, the product, typical aspects of this, whatever it is, are still intact. So we're not, you'd have to look at the individual differences in the dreams to be able to do your own exactly. Exactly how that happens. But this is the prototypical Smith brunt of this is, you know, your classic example. How do you identify some family members is coming from all from the same family. You have all these Smith brothers, there's five of them, and you can all tell their brothers, but they don't share the same complete set of characteristics is the prototypical brother.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       Maybe he has six characteristics. So you might say, well a big nose would be one and the heavy mustache would be another kind of beard would be a third big years and be a fourth and heavy eyebrows from vfm in glasses say would be a six. So that's your prototype people, Smith's brother. But to be recognizable as a smith brother, perhaps you only have to have two of these characteristics and the rest can vary. So this character would have big ears and eyes and maybe the mustache, but he didn't have a little nose and no beard. And then this character would have the glasses and a big nose and mustache. A little areas I, I'll say a beard anyways, you get the idea and they don't share. They're not like triangles. You can't precisely define the captain characteristics that this myth, Brett Smith brothers half, theoretically the old rate to this relate to this central prototype which we abstract from our experience in some complex manner.

Speaker 1:          00:20:27       So the notion of what else is interesting. Well the other thing about natural categories is that instead of being distinct, like, like a proper sets as make it overlap. And this is part of the reason that, well knowing this helps you make sense of it, the logical categories because they shift with context. Unfortunately that makes them difficult to interpret. For example, one of the most basic divisions of the world from a mythological perspective as masculine versus feminine. And that's related in a very profound way to explore a territory versus saw unexplored territory. Um, the problem is is that whether or not something is masculine or feminine tends to depend on the context of interpretation. So for example, if you talk about an island and the ocean, then the island is masculine and notions feminine. But if you talk about an island in the sky, then the island is feminine and the sky is masked.

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       But so we, even though the island is theoretically objectively the same in both circumstances, it's cloud. It's an effect of classification, shifts with context. Now you might think, well that's a bizarre property for a categorization have. The thing is we do this all the time. This is actually how we derive meaning in large part. It's always context dependent. Like most of the words you know, you don't know because someone told you the meaning of them. You know because you derive the meaning from the context. You see a normal word, one context, and then in another context and then in another context and you can derive the meaning from from from analysis of what's common across the context. Maybe you can define it novel where if you saw it in 10 different sentences, you have enough information there to figure out what the word means and the meaning of the word shifts with the sentence. In this meaning of the sentence shifts with the paragraph and the meaning of the paragraph shifts with the essay. That's why you can pull things out of context and reversed their meaning often. So the fact of context dependent meaning has gone up that much of a mystery

Speaker 3:          00:22:28       cause everything happened. I'm a little confused when you see a door or something. Okay. Now someone can say that they see a door and it has, you know, they, it has sensory, you know, information like it's a door you open and close it but they feel nothing towards it. Right. But does it have value?

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       Well it's only, it's always last week for example, we talked about the relationship of things to your story. You have your story and um, like if part of your ideal future

Speaker 3:          00:23:04       doesn't have it doesn't have any relevance unless it interferes.

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       No, no, not only interferes with if it aids. Do you think, what, look again, whatever it looks to me like your cortex evolved in part to modulate the automatic reactions of your limbic system to stimuli to make it more flexible. How it looks to me like what's happening is that what your cortex has done is high jack, your limbic system. In this way it says you can put anything you want into the goal box, but as soon as you put it there, it's a conservatory reward. It doesn't matter what it is. Now you have a lot of underlying biological systems, but how has their own idea about what should be here, but you can still put whatever you want in there. It's a conservatory reward now. As soon as you do that, everything that you encounter is construed in relationship to that goal. So the door is only relevant if you need to get through it to get to where you want to go. Right now it's not relevant at the end of the class. It will. Absolutely, and you shift the significance of things by shifting your framework of reference and what we're trying to define this. What constitutes a framework of reference. That's one thing. What is a framework of reference? I would say in terms of natural categories, everything within here is of one type of thing and everything outside of it is I'm a completely different type of thing and I tried to define that as the known and unknown.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       Or You could say as, and I really think this is, I've been trying to chase

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       say categories have this central prototype and there's all sorts of mythological categories. Masculine, this one category and feminine is another, a sky as a category and earth is it a category matter as a category and water as a category because things overlap in some odd way, like sky tends to be related to masculine. For example, I've been trying to chase down what's at the core of these mythological categories and that's why I come up with these terms. No woman unknown. And then there's the process of mediation that's the knower. Or You could say, and maybe this is even more fundamental, the unknown. It's unexplored territory. The no one has explored territory and the knower is the explorer and that's how we conceive of the world. The world is made up. Yes, yes. And this, that's it. That's how our brain naturally organizes things. How come? Um, I was a little confused. How come that the heavens or the sky is considered masculine and cans? We would think known territory because compared to the earth it seems like it's more unknown. Good question. Good question.

Speaker 4:          00:25:55       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       well have to think about that part of the answer. There's two masculine categories and that's part of the answer is the explored territory tends to be the king. Do you think the old king Michael Cirrus or example, where does the knower tends to be masculine as well as usually the sun, that's horace say or Marduk and these are usually skype bonds. They're assimilated to the sun, the sun as assimilated to consciousness. So that's basically the answer to that. The sky is the domain of the sun. The Sun is massive. Why is the Sun Masculine? Well, because it's associated with consciousness, illumination, enlightenment, it rate it rules during the times when we are conscious. It's also the thing that fights the dragon of chaos in the night packs. It's way out in the belly of the beast and then is born again

Speaker 3:          00:26:47       in the morning. So that's, that's the answer, that question. I could think of a way, but the sky could be explored. Territory relative theory, people who never thought of going up in this guy, this guy is not something you move through, but something it's over you. And to that extent it is exploring. It's very predictable. And even if you move a great distance across Europe, this guys is relatively the same. Where's your changes? Inadequate,

Speaker 1:          00:27:12       right? Yeah. That, that can be as well. It's also the case, you have to remember, and this is one of the things that makes analysis of mythological symbols tricky. They do shift with context and they're not always culturally stable. For the Sumerians, this guy who was male and the earth was female, but for the Egyptians, the sky was female and the earth was male. That's more rare, but it does happen. What seems to be, well, so you have to look at, you have to look for the prototype that's at the core of this to try and make sense of it. The shifting relationships. So the mother earth notion is more common. Laptop. The fatherland is also a mythological notion, right? You fight for the fatherland, we fight for the man. Those two ideas have slightly different slants. It seems like to call the explorer

Speaker 3:          00:27:57       predictable, unexplored, the unpredictable might be just as fundamental.

Speaker 1:          00:28:02       Yes, yes. Fair, fair enough. Fair enough. That's another, that's a perfectly reasonable way of looking at it as well. And that's, that's basically where you see the, uh, neuropsychological overlap instantly because we do know now that you're emotional systems are our a priori hardwired to respond to the unpredictable. That's a domain. Now it looks to me like in terms of neuro psychological function, then the left hemisphere of the linguistic hemisphere, it's specialized for habitual patterns of action. It looks to me like it's the hemisphere that rules and known territory. Okay. You say, well, your brain is actually wired up so that it, it has one set of responses that are useful when you know what the hell you're doing. And then it has a whole other set of subsystems that are useful when you don't know what you're doing. And when you do know what you're doing is the linguistic left.

Speaker 1:          00:28:52       That's it's you. And when you don't know what you're doing, it's the limbically dominated right hemisphere that then appears to mediate your actions. Now why would I say that? Oh, it's part of it. Because we know the right frontal cortex responds to punishment and threat. Trevor, the APR already phenomenon that appear with the appearance of the unpredictable. So the right hemisphere is what governs your behavioral responses. When you encounter something you do that you can predict in terms of it's more cognitive functions. Well, governance, anxiety, that's for sure. It may govern pain. That's not so clear, but it looks like it's, it looks like there's a high possibility governs depression anyways. Um, it's also the part of your brain that's good at recognizing patterns and generating stories. And my guess is that you can think about this. If you encounter something you don't understand, the first thing you tried to do is to figure out how it's like other things you've already encountered, which is basically to say that when you're first trying to adapt to something that you don't, can't predict, you try to apprehend in it familiar patterns say well even people who just with the sky then that's how we get the constellations had this massive, an undiscovered territory that constitutes the night sky.

Speaker 1:          00:29:59       You chunk it into patterns and that makes it identifiable and you have stories that revolve around the patterns and you start to move the information from the domain of the unknown into the domain of familiar territory. And when you think about it, the right hemisphere is the hemisphere that seems to be specialized for for stories and for fantasy. And it is fantasy is hypothesis generation as far as I can tell, a fantasy is the story of well maybe it's like this and your and your right hemisphere seems to be good for that. So then you have a nice set of functions. It's the thing that is activated when you encounter something unpredictable. So it stops you, it makes you shut up and look, and then the next thing it does is just start thinking it's specialized for global pattern recognition. Recognition wants to give you a quick and dirty answer.

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       What's out there? Well now, right hemisphere thinks, well it's like this. It's like this. It's like this. It's like this and it gives you a picture. So you get something like, I'm like Kelly who will encounter and a little bit later who's a, who's a monster that inhabits the unknown. That's basically composed of determinant things that are frightening. So like Kelly was the goddess of the unknown. She has staring face big teeth, she sits in fire, she has eight legs like a spider. She's a picture of the thing that lives the out there in the unknown. Anyways. Okay. Back. Can you elaborate on how the left rewards in the business as well? It seems to be, it seems to be more specialized for information that you already know how to handle. And it also, it's also good at handling linguistically mediated information that by the time you've chopped up the world into units that you can describe with words, you've already done a pretty good job of adapting to it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       You can even have straggly represented if, if you're still, I think action is a form of categorization. If you really don't know something, all you know about is the in its presence. You should stop or run. That's a form of categorization. It's pretty generalized information, right? By the time you've explored something really thoroughly, you can describe it and words and you can communicate it, and that seems to me part of what the left hemisphere does, but it's also responsible. We think about it this way. The left frontal hemisphere is also responsible for the generation of positive aspect. Now, you only generate positive ethic in the presence of cues of conservatory reward in the presence of incentive rewards. Now, incentive reward is something that indicates that you're getting closer to your goal. Okay? Now explored territory is basically full of indications that you're getting closer to your goal.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       That's why it's explored, right? Because you've already transformed it from something unknown and threatening into something that you can use to get to where you want to go. And the left hemisphere does that. So it looks to me like, well it looks to me like those things all sort of fit together. Adoptation basically means in its, in its most optimal sense, adaptation means that you transform something you do not understand into something that you can not only predict but can you, because you just don't want to transform everything into something irrelevant, right. That would be useless. You want to transform things. You don't understand the things that you can do something with that you want to do.

Speaker 5:          00:33:13       So, so at the individual has a different balance through which they approach like the youth, like the balance between the left and right hemisphere or the first two.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       Well there's, there's some evidence for variation and temperament. You know, some people are more inhibited and some people are less inhibited. Now the problem with that is that I believe that, I mean it does look like there's pretty solid evidence for these temperamental variations. So you might say that you have a lower threshold, for example, for experiencing anxiety in the presence of something or a new one, then the next person does and that's to cross situation. The problem with that is that it doesn't take into account the fact that what's unexpected is always construed in relationship to the story, but my guess is that if people looked into this, they find it inhibited. People have different stories about the way the world is constructed and part of their biological predisposition towards timidity manifest itself in the structure of the stories they tell themselves about the world. It makes sense because if you're more, you're more frightened by people. The stories you tell about them are going to be twisted more towards the domain of threat. So those

Speaker 5:          00:34:22       does that balance also very situationally, like you said, if if someone is refusing groups up in all this information that does have relevance to their story and they're ignoring it until it gets to a certain point where they can foresee,

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       yeah, I think there are a whole last half of the course is about that. It's like because one of the things that you can do to yourself to make yourself more pathological and just know how to adapt to normal, his information and that makes you function with pathological. I think

Speaker 5:          00:34:50       so. Would that actually make the right hemisphere less reactive or we didn't make it yet?

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       It would make, it would make a left, I don't know.

Speaker 5:          00:34:57       Compensating function or is it,

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       I think it, I think what happens in those circumstances does the right hemisphere starts to make a lot of noise so your dreams start to, or one of the students I had last been open the in the class this past last year has just written a paper for me on the potential function of dreams. He points out that in in neural map, in neural net modeling of pattern recognition, there's a phenomena called catastrophic failure where if you have a neuro debt and it's going to a bird category and a fish category and you'd throw in a penguin, well what happens is that the bird county going to fish category collapsed and all you get is animal category. So there's kinds anomalous information that will blow a whole categorization systems. So what he paused it was that there's one system that has, that does categorization and another that's slowly feeds at anomalous information so it doesn't collapse.

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       So it has time to adjusted structure to the new anomalous information, but blowing into a categorization scheme. Now you have to have a categorization scheme because if you don't, you don't know how to act. And if it's really global, like if I tell you, you say, well how do I write an essay? And I said you act like a human being. So this is pretty, this information is so vague as to be completely useless for the task at hand. You want to categorize it, you want information that's sort of sufficiently high resolution so that it will aid you in your task. If I blow all your categorization sets and you're just left with this really amorphous, amorphous categorization, you don't know how to act. So you want to maintain your categories. What he suggested was wasn't the dream slowly moving almost information up into that categorization schemes.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       So, and in terms of your question, well if you, if you constantly ignore anomalous information pouring in from the right hemisphere, basically what you've done is categorize more and more information into the category of things that are so terrible they can't be faced. And I think what you do under those circumstances, you activate a monster, so to speak, that lives in your right hemisphere. And it gets more and more and more powerful until one day when at a weak moment say it just swallows you whole. And that's when you fall catastrophic. We into depression or into terrible anxiety or maybe even depending on your physiological predisposition to something resembling schizophrenia. So Katie, you keep, because all that information that you've encountered that's anomalous and scag rocks, you categorize it by avoiding it. And the category is so terrible. I can't face it. So you think that if you integrate it, you don't end up with nightmares?

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       Yes, that's right. That's right. Although if you haven't been integrating and then you start, the nightmares might increase in intensity. And it's also the case that when you are dreaming, you know, your, your, uh, your spinal cord, your reticular activating system, the part is activating the hippocampus and the Amygdala. And that's the part of the brain that deals with anomalous information. It reverts to two brainstem control. So it looks to me like this is a good, this is a reasonable hypothesis. You have a system that deals with what you know and another one that deals with what you don't do. You need both. If you ignore one, well, there's a whole social psych literature that says if you ignore anomalous information, you're happier. You know, which is that, that's a really appalling literature because they don't take temporal duration into consideration. It's real good in the short term.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       What, what are really, oh, there's a whole, yeah, that's right. That's right. The positive illusions literature is Taylor or, yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's being, it's being trashed with empirical data showing that, yeah. In the short terms, good solution for the long term. You know you get hostile and anxious and depressed and people don't like you very much, which is you know, hardly all that surprising but they actually wrote self help books, self help books telling people that positive self legions would good for mental health man. Despite like 5,000 years of philosophical evidence to the contrary,

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       both of these hemisphere, right hemisphere working at the same time. When you come across experience, what would happen to a split brain patient? Is there been any, any,

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       well we do know for example that, I don't know, I don't know the literature on emotional responsivity of split brain patients, but I do know that if you sustain right frontal cortical damage, it makes you inappropriately northern depressed and anxious. And what that, what happens under those circumstances is that you acquire functional psychopathy, which basically means that psychopath doesn't regulate his behavior as a consequence of information that indicates that his behavioral output is doing something that in the long run is it's a bad idea. Well, there's a, there's a famous paper by Islam and demands you about a guy who uh, can't remember his initials. He had an Iq of 143, right frontal damage, no measurable decrements in Iq. So he's still 143 is three standard deviations above the mean. We're talking very bright person here, but he makes series of catastrophic decisions that look, that are up, the sort that you'd associate with stupid criminality. He, uh, gets divorced, he marries Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:40:03       uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       well, someone who is very bad for him basically gets involved in a whole series of terrible business decisions, et Cetera, et cetera. So if you're missing the information from your right frontal Cortex, you're happy. No kidding, because you've knocked out the whole system that deals with all those things that make you unhappy, but you have to be unhappy to live properly

Speaker 1:          00:40:28       when you encounter those things, the dope go out according to plan because if you don't attend to those things that don't occur according to plan, then you don't learn. And if you don't learn, you keep your model of adaptation stable in the face of, in the face of shifting environmental contingencies and what that basically means is that over time the thing that's you gets old and senile and that's how it's represented. Mythology by the way, and that's the, that's the image of the wasteland. No, that's the land where all the trees have dried up and everything's all, nothing grows and you can read that as the absence of the positive aspect of the great mother, which means that there's no beneficial novelty around or you can read that as the tyranny of stupid if you all would. Either way.

Speaker 2:          00:41:14       You're suggesting that. Are you suggesting that in the apps and so a connection the left brain will dominate? Probably one of them.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       I think that's true, like this is speculative, but there's some, there's some physiological evidence like the left brain, the left hemisphere is in most circumstances in schizophrenia. For example, if you're a schizophrenia and you start hearing voices, it appears as though there's a possibility that the reason for that is because the areas that are associates that are isomorphic with the language centers but are in the right hemisphere have been released from tonic inhibition by the language centers in the left hemisphere and our start to become active. And the way you interpret that is I hear voices, they aren't me. So which, which suggests to me that who you are as far as you're concerned is mostly the sum total of linguistically mediated processes that localized usually the left hemisphere but mostly their linguistic. We immediate, which is only to say that mostly what you are as far as your own self regard, he's a culturally constructed entity, most of which has been constructed using the mediation of language that's up settlement.

Speaker 1:          00:42:29       No, no one won't be because first of all there isn't consciousness. There's a bunch of processes that are consciousness now. Like one consciousness that's clearly conscious is what happens to you when something enormous occurs. Because you will orient towards that. And I think orienting is most central to what we define as consciousness. Because like even in this room, look, there's only a few things that you're really conscious of. You're very much not conscious as a general rule of the floor, the ceiling, the walls, most things around you. The only thing you're conscious of is that part of your experiential field where there's some novelty emerging, right? That's because you're orienting systems are activated and those are critical to consciousness. And this is very interesting because in mythology and mythology, one of the things that brings about the war, the world is the capacity to discriminate between things, capacity to attend to novelty.

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       Um, well I want, I want to get into that. Of course, today's discussion actually see, look, when you're orienting towards things you're attending to the world that's defined by chaos and transforming it with the intermediation of exploration into defined territory from the mythological perspective, that's equivalent to the construction of the world. Now that's why in in Christian theology, for example, there's the doctrine of the logos. The logos is being assimilated to consciousness. It's a solar light entity mediated by, by, by language. That's why it's the word. It's also a simulated to Christ, and this is not a notion that's unique to Christianity as we'll see. That's the thing that creates the world, creates the world by dividing. Look, here's an example. In the earliest Sumerian mess, there's a dragon who lives in the primordial waters and he gives rise to two wedded daddy's once the sky and the others, the earth, they're separate, but not really.

Speaker 1:          00:44:35       And the way the myth represents that is that they're locked in something technically called a Hieros Gamos, which is a mystical marriage. So they're in sexual union, they're united. They're not really two things. There are union gives rise to a third force. That's their sun, the god of the atmosphere. As it turns out the scenario, it's the God is the atmosphere who separates them, pushing the sky up to the sky and the first out of the earth and thereby creates the world. What the hell does that mean? Well, it means that in any creation myth, there's four elements, chaos and once chaos. That's the union of everything. That will one at one point be distinct and in sometimes represented methodology by the Indian, between the mother and the infant, cause that's sort of symbiotic, right? Ones absolutely dependent on the other, but yet in a sense they're two distinct entities where they will be two distinctive, but anyways, chaos.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       That's the dragon that lives at the bottom of the water. It gives rise to two days. Earth and the sky. They're law, conceptual union. They give rise to a sun. The God of the atmosphere. This is the sun gone. He separates them. That's the world. Now you could say the world is born as a consequence of the interaction of the sky. God in the Earth, God or you could say that the world was born as a consequence of the fact that the Sun God separates the two. Most stories are accurate. All this stories saying you have to look at the mythological representations. The story say, well the earth, this is chaos there. If that's a maternal, that's the mother.

Speaker 4:          00:46:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       that's normal. It's the source of all things.

Speaker 1:          00:46:29       Sun. God separates these two things by discriminating between them, which is basically by taking the thing that's novel and transforming it into the thing that's explored. That means the origin of the cosmos from the mythological perspective. So there's three, there's three seminal out elements in in your standard creation myth. The mother, the father, and the son, and the mother is the unknown, unexplored territory. The fathers, the known explored territory and the sun is the process that mediates between them. And I have assimilated that the orienting reflects because it's the thing that focuses in on novelty, initiates the process of exploration, which is the process by which the determinant world is form. Thank well why does the determinant world under those circumstances? Well, it's all those places that you can go where you know how to behave and those places consist of the territory but also the behaviors of everyone else but you interact with.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       So Nolan territory is social territory because all of our actions in habitual are defined by the actions of others. So part of what it is that we know when we say we know how to map the actions and interactions of others. So that's why the no one is also similar culture and to the Patriarchy and the cane. Because of course the king is the behavioral model that defines the state who everyone in the state imitates so that everyone in the state can predict everyone else. That's part of it. Anyways, so for me you're explored territory because I can define what you're going to do with this situation and the reason I can define us cause we shared the same story, which is what we're pursuing. Goals there are at least concurrent, they don't conflict because they conflicted. We'd have trouble because you be mapping things with one motivational significance and I'd be mapping the Mfi other, which basically means we either have to negotiate, which means you'd arrange your story and I'd arrange mind or we fight. That's, that's it. Those are the two options. Or I can pretend that the conflict doesn't exist, in which case sooner or later it will get me.

Speaker 1:          00:48:34       Now I want to, because this is a course about social identity and social conflict. I want to read you some or get to one, one sec. I want to read you some things for Mircea Eliade because it'll help you. It will help you understand how it is that we naturally categorize things. So you want to remember chaos because that's the thing that we're, we're going to discuss. They'll chaos is what exists before there's a separation of subject and object and the thing that chaos is is then both spirit and matter. Terrible mythological way of speaking. I'll give you an example of what that means. Piaget said that the subject constructs himself as well as the object in the course of exploration, which basically means that what you are formed out of is all those things that you discovered as you were approaching all those things you didn't know. Now you form the world has a consequence of the process of exploration, but you also form yourself because it's in the process of encounter with novelty that you generate information and it's information that you build your cell phone. So from the mythological world, the thing that's chaos that existed before the world existed is composed of spirit, which is what you will be and mattered simultaneously, which is very, that sounds very interesting. Quonset. Okay. Question.

Speaker 2:          00:49:58       Oh, okay. All alright. I don't want to go off into different groups. No. The symmetry between the pros and goal process and then the state one. Chaos state. Yeah. And then the known nowhere. No, unknown knower. No. Yeah. So the knower is in the place of the process.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       The know raise the process. So no worries. The process. So

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       becomes the mechanism, which your body's

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       the process. Yeah. Or something. Yeah, that's right. That's right. And that's what religious stories basically push you towards. That's why I wanted to show you this story. Martech. Martech is the person who encounters the, I know. I'm the God who attains the highest position in the hierarchy of Gods. Who then goes out to fight time. Who's the dragon of both? She's both the dragon of chaos and the mother of all things. Those two categories get overlapped some stairs and in the, in the fight with timeout, Marta generates the cosmos. Now the Mesopotamian King Imitates Marduk. That's what gives him power. That's, that's what gives his position validity, is the fact that he's the embodiment of the Sun God. But what does that mean? Well, the Sun God is the thing that makes the world well. What does that mean? Well, the sunken garden is an image of the process of consciousness, which turns the unknown, which is undefined territory, into explored territory, which is the world.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       And as long as the king, so then the arcade people say the state, if the king doesn't do his job, the state becomes sterile. Crops don't grow, for example. And you say, what the hell? Trying to quit warrant. How they all kind of attitude is that if the king doesn't do his job, crops won't grow. Well, what it means is the king is a pattern of adaptation. If he doesn't constantly update his behavioral attributes in the space of shifting environmental contingencies, the beneficial aspect of the environment will disappear. So when they are caring, people says, if the king doesn't do his job, then the state becomes say, no crops won't grow there, Dan. Right. What do they do? He killed the king, sacrifice the king, or he has to undergo a ritual that indicates salary sacrifice, which actually the king of Mesopotamia did every new years when he renewed the cosmos, he had to do that. Cause if he didn't renew the cosmos, which basically meant update his pattern of behavioral adaptation representation, then the environment would drift farther and farther away from the state and everything would collapse precipitously. So the king had to voluntarily and counter novelty or in the long term, he would catastrophic. We encounter it along with all those people anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       Okay. Last semester. Can you relate that somehow to why money has value or the use of coins?

Speaker 1:          00:52:45       Oh yeah. That's a funny one though, right? Well, a gold coin has the, the head of the head of a head of state on it. Why? Well, the gold is a symbol of the sun and the sun is the Sun God and the emperor is put on the toy. Did you indicate value? Because this is the thing that is most valuable and it's symbolic representations of that that we've used to signify province basically.

Speaker 2:          00:53:13       So yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:53:17       gold is always been assimilated to the sun at least in the west, so okay. Now I want to read you some things from Elliot and I think these things are well from the perspective of social psychology and the notion of understanding conflict and the hopes for its revolution resolution, these sorts of things. I think your revolutionary if you understand their significance because the only out he basically describes how it is that people naturally perceive those who are not like them. No, I wouldn't say, well, if I'm like you,

Speaker 1:          00:53:48       if I'm like you, I share your story. Okay. This is a castle. We're both inside. I can construe your relationship to me with regards to our end goal. That's, I also am going to get to this later. This is also a dominance hierarchy. The kings at the top of it and every organization is set up that way. It's like if you and I are both, if you and I in a hundred other people are pursuing the same goal, we organize ourselves into a dominance hierarchy. We each have a position that basically constitutes a sub goal of that greater goal and the utility of the goals are rank ordered in terms of their importance and the person who's at the top is simultaneously the most important person in the dominance hierarchy and an embodiment of the goal. Chief Executive Officer in a corporation for example. How you can also relate that in thinking about that this week too, the more complex stories, remember it looks like this

Speaker 4:          00:54:57       and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       Now the thing that's neat about this is this is also you remember, does everybody remember how this works? Is that the story is actually consists of sub stories basically all the way down. Now the higher you are up on the dominance hierarchy, the closer you are to the broadest expanse of this story. So if you're just a functionary in an organization, you have one of these stories and anything that comes along to disrupt you, like if you get fired is only going to bond or people who are working on that particular sub goal. Now if you're the king or the chief executive officer, you occupied this territory. So like in the case of a, of a hostile takeover of a corporation, that means the whole structure is potentially disruptive and everyone inside that structure feels anxiety and depression because their stories are being disrupted. Okay. Now you can also see how groups form in relationship to this because you're, you're most tightly identified with those who share the most at the most, the broadest subset of your embedded stories.

Speaker 4:          00:56:07       So

Speaker 1:          00:56:10       does that make sense? Would you say that to response to Kennedy's assassination? Right. Perfect. Exactly. More accurately in the north when the North Korean emperor died, people said the sun had set, the sun had permanently, people were on the street wailing and crying, you know, carrying around pictures of the sun, God who disappeared because the whole state was placed into chaos. But at the same thing happens when, when, uh, when Stalin died, for example, when any tire and dies because of the tire is well in bodies and bodies, the story of the state killed the tyrant. Everything collapses. People come out in the streets and cry.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       Yeah. Fry points out that people like Queen Elizabeth still draw crowd because lots of people still thinking of medieval fashion, so to speak, but more accurately Queen Elizabeth in bodies or stories, everyone's story. She's the, she's the focal point you could say. Or She's the person who incarnates the abstract and stories now so you can say that or overtop of her objective reality is laid. Uh, uh, I don't know how many describe it. A glamorous facade that people see you because of their subjective interpretations and she acts out that role. That's right. That's projection. Say That's a good example of projection. They think that what they're so excited about is the queen. It's her attributes. But you can say in a sense that's true. It's what she signifies for behavior. But that's not exactly a property of the object. No. Is it? Now if you can understand that, you get very close to understanding what it is that our people are referring to, what they were referring to.

Speaker 1:          00:57:50       A God cause it Queen Elizabeth in a sense is an incarnated to go out and the, the more potent gods occupied broader domains of the story. You know what the Mesopotamians said, and this is the core for religious stories in general, is that the thing that should be at the top of the hierarchy is Marta, right? Marduk was elected by all the other gods to be the cane gone. He's the process by which it normally is transformed into explored territory and what that basically means that if in your hierarchy of values was placed above all else is the necessity of responding to a normally every time it manifests itself, then all your other biological systems that determine value will operate properly. And if you put something else in the place of that God, so to speak, then sooner or later everything will fall into chaos. That's that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       That's what those mythological stories and try to tell people that your attitude towards anomaly that determines everything and you have two choices. You to face it voluntarily or no, and if you don't, well, that's why we're reading Milton's paradise lost because Milton's paradise lost is a story about the consequences of voluntarily voluntary failure to admit to the existence of the normally. Okay. Now, so you see, you read the story of Martech, the Samarian myth. It's very, very interesting. You say all those gods, they organized themselves into a dominance hierarchy, so they're threatened by timeout. She's the dragon of chaos. She con she caused the dude's unexplored territory. She's going to destroy all the gods, create creator. God's always do that and that's because the unknown generates everything and takes everything back, so it has this ambivalent motivational status, the source of everything kind of place that everything returns to. It's a constant threat. It never goes away. There's always something you don't have. You don't expect to deal with. The gods organized themselves into a hierarchy and they put Marta cat the talk. Then he's the king.

Speaker 4:          01:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:05       It seems to me that what that story is telling you with regards to the construction of the dominance hierarchy is two things. It's first of all, the Mesopotamian society was the consequence of the intermingling of a whole set of cultural groups. Each of them had their own God, which is basically their own representation of the highest ideal, projected more or less into the external world. Now there was a lot of differences between these representations, but in the process of becoming one culture, all these gods had to fight it out, so to speak, for dominance in the territory defined by interpersonal communication. And the myth of Marta climbing the dominance hierarchy is the story, the cumulative story of the combat between these gods and the rise of one clock, two preeminent status. Now you can see at the end here,

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       yeah, on page 96 I don't know how many of you have your book, but Marduk still in the Sumerian Myth Mesopotamian myth. Martin still has a whole bunch of sort of other names that were likely the names of gods who sooner or later became assimilated to Marduk. He sort of took over their domain and the Mesopotamian said that mark had, I don't remember how many names cst, and here are some of them. And so what the Mesopotamians basically concluded unconsciously, so to speak, was that whenever Martech represented was also vital to what all these other names representative. And here are some of the names he's Nam to lack of who's the God who restores to life. Okay. That he's describing his role in the process that we

Speaker 4:          01:01:47       I'm talking about. Yes. Okay. Chaos. Impulse. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:57       When the Mesopotamia Martech is the God who restores to life, this is what they need. Here's this process, this being read as death, stale state rejuvenation process. That's more deck. That's named number one who can restore all ruined gods as though they were his own creation. The God Lord who who by holy incantation restores the dead thoughts to light. Same thing. This is the dad doors and you can say, well why is that while your behavioral patterns of adaptation or the consequences in the final analysis of your mimicry of all those people who came before you and established moans, exploration driven modes of adaptation, which is to say that what do you consist of in terms of your behaviors is the cumulative behaviors of your whole culture in so far as those would be adaptively relevant and most of those were established by people who are now dead ancestral fingers in many religions, the ancestral figures or assimilated to God and that's because they determine your behavior.

Speaker 1:          01:03:00       Then when the unknown is the domain of the dead gone. So that's basically, there's an interesting little side is a piece of knowledge I know about you as if you were completely identified with your culture, Your radiology snake. It means you're the product of people who lived before you, not your own original thought. Cause you buy den, you've adapted the dogma, which defines you. It's not you. It's the construction of people who were damned ideologically Huh. The catchword of an ideology as a slogan. Slogan is derived from the Welsh. Like Gareth slowly, Gareth means battle crime. Yeah. Which is a nice commentary on etiology. Okay. Um, yes.

Speaker 6:          01:03:45       So it seems to, okay, so the right hemisphere seems to be what, what the process is doing, what the king is doing. They're the ones that are going out into the unknown and the other ones that are, that are using what they find, um, just for adaptive behavior.

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       Okay. Hang on one note now. It's not exactly right. Okay. Look chaos. That's the dragon, so to speak. That's the possibility. That's the unknown before it's being contacted. It's the unknown. Hypothetically is the fact that behind everything that you know, there's this reality that you can say anything about something that you actually encounter that's unexpected, that's the manifestation of the unknown in your experience. That's in the normally, okay. The right hemisphere is responsible for point. I think in conjunction with the limbic system is responsible for pointing out the fact of a normal is just to say that if you're pursuing your goal directed linguistically mediate plans and something you didn't expect or curves, then you're septal hippocampal and to make delek systems grab your motor behavior on your intention and force of towards the anomaly. Then you had, then you make a decision process or ignore and the thing that makes the decision I think is the left is left hemisphere. It's the thing that decides whether it will voluntarily make the descend or will reject it. So then what is it that, because I think we experienced chaos from the aspect of perspective when we're completely dominated by the processes of the right hemisphere, which is to say the ASTEC does aspects of Keanna, sorry, basically anxiety, depression and while I think the third category is sort of schizophrenia length symptomatology, this is right here, Mr mediated. We did not like that. When when? When your brain has flipped, the woman is from the left hemisphere in the right hemisphere, you feel like dying. In fact, you might commit suicide.

Speaker 1:          01:05:58       [inaudible] that's, I mean that's part of the reason why people are very motivated not to bend. The intention is to it to a normally is the vase and its first manifestation. It's anxiety provoking and painful. But you have to balance that against knowledge than if you don't pay attention to it. All that will happen is that it will grow until instead of you facing it, it will attack you likely when you're weak.

Speaker 6:          01:06:22       Okay, so, so you have this anomalous pieces of information. Remind him as your focus is on the left hemisphere says go after it or not, or or ignore it and then does it then call again to the right hemisphere to, to, to use patterns to identify it, et Cetera. And then,

Speaker 1:          01:06:37       well, we'll keep that. So that's a good question because the thing about an anomalous experiences, it doesn't present herself purely in our, in in its objective manifestation. Let me give you an example. So you're sitting in your apartment at night, it's quiet and you hear a noise that shouldn't be in another room. Okay, so you're reading, they have disrupts your reading. I'd say here's something fall over. Something big that disrupts your reading. It's like your goal directed activity has, has been eliminated. It's like your alert, you wait, you might even wake up if you're asleep, but you're alert. So you walk cautiously. But you might run out of the house. That's one way of dealing with air. You might fall in the police, but let's say you decide to explore while you're conflicted because you are driven towards it, but you're also angry, anxious. So you walked towards the room and let's say the doors are like this and it's dark in there and you reach your hand in to trouble like you watch what your mind does.

Speaker 1:          01:07:35       When you do that, say if you watch the pictures the degenerate because it's trying to figure out what the hell is in there. You'll get all sorts of fantasies about the potential things that might be in the next group. If you actually watch yourself do this, you generate, what are some of the, some of the visions will be more or less we are less capital on and maybe it's America, but you also get images that are monstrous, like that's what's well, that's both a hypothesis that your brain is generating about what might've done it. A warning that something terrible might be in that room because you don't like you read it. Do you know what? I want to put your hand in there and the anomaly all at once because it already, it emerges. The anomaly emerges in a sense in already categorized for, that's the thing. You never really encounter chaos per se. As soon as something unexpected happens, it's already presenting itself in the form of a potential hypothesis, so I think you're right. Hemispheres is doing the pattern recognition instantly.

Speaker 6:          01:08:34       So then it seems like the left hemispheres that gets the decision maker, basically it just uses the right hemisphere for for, okay, what is, what is anomalous, what give me the patterns and then let's see how to use this for adaptive for my adaptive behavior to get to the,

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       I think that, I think that's, I think that's how it works. I think the information, if there's a continuum between entirely explored and not explored at all, as information moves from the category of no unexplored Vol, two entirely explored. It moves across the hemisphere so to speak. So the locale of specialization shifts and there's evidence for this. I mean the right hemisphere does seem to be the place where activity takes place most particularly when you don't know what the hell you're doing. Also, the other thing that happens is the, like if you're practicing in new activity, when you first start practicing huge areas of the cortex light up and as you get good at it, the area that's involved gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller until there's just a tiny center somewhere. It's really specialized for that activity and then it's not conscious anymore. Can you do it automatically? Piping and things?

Speaker 1:          01:09:37       Well, I don't know about all right. Well I don't know enough about the literature on specialization. Tell you what for I don't know where motor patterns ended up localizing, for example, I don't think anybody knows. We know that the prefrontal cortex is involved in construction and monitoring of motor plans when they're first being formula, but once they're perfected, where are they go? It seems still somewhat mysterious. The uh, yeah, it seems involved in regulating the smoothness of their, of their, uh, of their application and the Basal Ganglia are involved in motor. I'll put two, but where are those patterns are localize. I don't think anybody knows yet. Seems a bit brash and generalize that to have as business. These are the possible ways, separate. Absolutely. Patterns of activity. Yes it is rubbish. And the thing is is that broadly is, this is broadly speaking and I don't think it's so much a matter of hemispheric specialization may be as whether the information is linguistically media. There's still an image form or whether it's an image form. We're still at the level of behavior so I know when you read it just isn't, it's you risk simplification to think of it in terms of hemispheric specialization, but there's still, there's still enough useful information to be driving that when you're making to make it worthwhile.

Speaker 6:          01:10:56       So if you were to look at language then could you say that that the organization of thoughts and all that is left hemisphere, but let style and m the actual thoughts coming from the right hemisphere? Does it? It doesn't seem right.

Speaker 1:          01:11:07       Well, broadly again, I would say that there's some evidence for that. Things like style that is pattern recognition capacity. I mean that's, that's all. Like the fond toner on a given type face for example, has nothing to do with the information per se. It's sort of an emergent property or or styles and architecture, literature and so on. There are patterns there are difficult to, and I think they are related to two story and image. So I know that you know that the right hemisphere is specialized for the comprehension of stories. It is specialized for the comprehension of patterns. It's the hemisphere that's responsible for your understanding of music and most nonverbal cues. It broadly specialized for negative effect. So, and it's also architectonic [inaudible] construct so that it has a left less differentiated structure than the left hemisphere, which seems to indicate it's better for quick and dirty analysis.

Speaker 1:          01:12:05       And I think what it does is use metaphor. It says this unknown thing, kind of the same attributes as all these other unexpected things that you've already encountered. So look out. So which is useful information. If you don't know anything else about the unknown, it's good to know that it's like all those other things that you already encountered that you didn't understand. But I think what's happened with in religious systems in large part is the people have constructed images of the unknown like Kelly, and then use those as ritual models against which to practice patterns about amputation that are specialized. Not for anything particular, but for adaptation to the unknown in general. Because that's really what you have to know, not how to do something, but how to do something when you don't know how to do anything. That's really what you need to know.

Speaker 1:          01:12:52       So you get things like the great goddess who's responsible for death. The only thing to her that's acceptable is the human sacrifice. But what does that mean? Well, they originally acting up, and this says, to get from here to here, to make an adjustment to the fact of chaos requires constant sacrifice. What? Sacrifice up at king, for example, that the king is a pattern of adaptive behavior before you can understand that in the image or semantically yanked it out, and that's where those rituals come from. So that plaque, kate's the goddess, endless sacrifice. Well, that's right, but what is it? Well. It's endless sacrifice of that thing that you value most, which is in fact in the abstract and for your current set of beliefs and your configuration, your view of the world, the thing you want to give up the least because it's the thing that protects you from emotional chaos. That's what you have to sacrifice all the time in order to adapt to the fact of the unknown.

Speaker 1:          01:13:57       Okay. Now back to social psychology. I want to read you these things familiar [inaudible]. This is very interesting for religious man. Space is not homogenous. He experienced his interruptions and breaks in it. Some parts of space are qualitatively different from others. Drawing not nigh. Hither says the Lord unto Moses, put off my shoes from off they feet for the place where I'm they'll stand is holy ground. Exodus three five there is then a sacred space, enhance a strong, significant space. There are other spaces that are not sacred and so our without consistency or core structure, they're amorphous have no definition, nor is this all for religious man. This spatial lauren homogeneity finds expression and the experience of an opposition between space that is sacred, the only real and really existing space and all other space, the formless expanse that surrounds it.

Speaker 4:          01:15:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:42       It must be set at once that the religious experience of the [inaudible] spaces and primordial experience, he means by that an archetype experience doesn't have to be learned. It's a structural element of experience. Homologeo Homo Habilis homologous to the founding of the world. It is not a matter of theoretical speculation, but have a primary religious experience that precedes all reflection on the, on the world,

Speaker 4:          01:16:06       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       Or just the break effect in the space that allows the world to be cost to to that because it reveals a fixed point. The central access for all future orientation. When the sacred manifest itself, there was not only a break in the emoji native space, there's also a revelation of an absolute reality of the non reality of the bass around the expanse, the manifestation of the sacred ontologically founds the world. Okay. Now what Eliade is trying to say, look, you're a cognitive systems are founded upon certain preset positions. What did I eliade is trying to do, and this was a guild was trying to do too with this idea of vacation with the archetype is just to point out what are the most fundamental levels of presuppositions upon which all the things that you think. In fact, our baits as Kurt Gadell pointed out that any, any internally cysts, any internal and consistent system, logical system is necessarily predicated on presumptions and the can be approved from within the system. They have to be accepted. Their axioms, like Deon seems of geometry. This is an axiom. There's defined territory and undefined. This is what you protect. This is where you live. It's the establishment of this. That is the precondition for everything else you do. So establishing that initial sacred space, that's a religious act, the primary religious act.

Speaker 1:          01:17:25       So what is clear? So it's clear to what it'd be grieved. That discovery that is the revelation of sacred space, possesses existential value for religious man. For nothing can begin. Nothing can be done without a previous orientation in any orientation implies acquiring a fixed point. It is for this reason that religious man has always sought to fix his abode at the center of the world. That's where the medieval notion that man exists, whether it be earth was the center of the cosmos. That's where that idea came from. It wasn't an empirical notion. It was the notion that wherever we live, that's the center that's defined space surrounded necessarily by an expanse of territory that we haven't explored. Now we already know to what to make of that in terms of implications because we know what an unexplored territory signifies. First. It's signifies fear and it signifies promise.

Speaker 1:          01:18:13       So defined territory is security established in an expanse of anxiety and and curiosity. Funny but eight priority. It's anxiety. So you're a village is surrounded by the places you don't know because it's frightening out there. Why is it frightening? No behavioral structures have been erected to make that space habitable. So it's the domain of monsters. It's the domain of wolves. It's the domain of foreigners. It's the domain of barbarians. It's the place that you can explore. It's like the old maps, the whole medieval maps of the world to find territory amorphous just surrounded by ocean with monsters. That's what that means.

Speaker 1:          01:18:54       There were monsters out there and unknown territory. That's, it's interesting too, cause the most is always take the form of whales. But Wales aren't whales for medieval people. And if they didn't know what Wales, where there are serpents, sea surface that live in the sea and if you go out there out beyond explored territory, the sea serpent comes out of the sea and swallows you. Perhaps the hero's mission right down into the belly of the beast. You might come back and you might not. But what that is is the projection of mythology on the world. So for the European exploration was an extraordinary radical. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. Yeah, I did. Well here I going to tell you exactly exactly how radical that was. This is something in reality is that pains to describe what are the outstanding characteristics of traditional societies is the opposition that they assume between their inhabited territory, ambien determinant space that surrounds it. The former is the world more precisely our world. The cosmos. So when Marta constructs the cosmos, that's what that means is he's constructing habitable territory, the definable world out of the amorphous reality that surrounds it.

Speaker 4:          01:20:00       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:20:01       Everything outside of the cosmos is no longer cosmos, but it's sort of other world, a foreign chaotic place by ghosts, demons, foreigners who are assimilated to demons into the souls of the dead. Now this is, this is some other research, that idea. So this is an insert more specifically to the dragon of chaos. Okay? So this is the point here. Your natural category of foreigner is the dragon of chaos. They're in the same category. Not because you've assimilated them together, but because you have not yet distinguished them. They're still the same thing. So your natural response to the foreigner is he's the thing that isn't human that occupies the space defined by chaos. Who's a primary motivational significance is the generation of terror and disorder. She say you don't get an explanation then about why people are hostile with the foreigners. What you need is an explanation for those few instances where that does not, in fact, they'll curve

Speaker 2:          01:21:01       okay? In, okay? Among the Hicks sauce.

Speaker 1:          01:21:06       Barbarians were assimilated to Apophis who do borrowers? The Sun,

Speaker 2:          01:21:12       no, sorry. Yeah, that's right

Speaker 1:          01:21:15       Hicks. Those were barbarians from the Egyptian point of view. They kept coming into Egypt and disrupting everything. They were assimilate hicks sauce met barbarians, and they were simulated to apophis who devours the sun. Okay, so that's the Egyptians among the Indo Europeans, the ancestors of the mortar, the Indians, the assimilation of enemies in back,

Speaker 2:          01:21:34       nope,

Speaker 1:          01:21:36       to the slaying of [inaudible]. In fact, enemies were called Burton's and Virta was the gigantic dragon who held back the waters in the hollow of the mountain. Interests laid him and constructed the world. So for the Indo Europeans, the slang and enemies was precisely equivalent to the act that constructed the world. And that is because when you slay your enemies, you expand your territory in the expansion of territory is equivalent construction in the world. It's a heroic enterprise. You're battling the enemies of the state among the Zoroastrians and the ram. He will, trump's in the battle. He truly kills me. I'm sorry, the fight of the hero three tournament against the dragon as they hakka is recounted as the struggle of King Fair done against the foreign new surfer, the dragon as to hack and it's the same story. This is an arrhenius foreigners or the dragon of chaos. They bring disorder into the state, so to overthrow the forerunner, to establish new territories to to the same thing that the day he did what he established the world

Speaker 2:          01:22:39       now. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:22:45       At first this cleavage, the first side. This cleavage in space appear to be due to the opposition between an inhabited and organize hands, cosmo sized territory and the unknown space that expands beyond its frontiers. On one side there's a cosmos on the other side of cameras, but we shall see that if every inhabited territory is a cosmos, this is precisely because it was first consecrated because in one way or another it is the work of the garden cards or is in communication with the world of the guards who determine destiny in that territory and who therefore caused the toothy organizing principles of the society, the dominance hierarchy that rules there.

Speaker 1:          01:23:20       That's the thing, you know, inside say can space. You're all, you're pursuing a goal that's shared by everyone else that's in that space. So their behavior is all random, predictable as a consequence of their participation in the same story. It's a religious story. This defined by the dominance of the certain God. So when you go out into new territory, the first thing you do is consecrate that new territory to the God that rules your territory. So the order rules, order rains there, that means the world's created and what it means, that order range there is that whenever other people go there, they have to behave the same way you behave. So they're predictable. So that means they're out of the domain that's defined by CAS. And they don't terrify. You don't undermine. They don't pose the possibility of undermining everything that it is that you believe in.

Speaker 1:          01:24:05       So lem, it says all this appears very clearly from the thing that ritual for taking possession of the territory that shouldn't becomes legally valid through the erection of a fire alter consecrated to Agni. Is this a quote from the religious texts? The shout of path that Brovana one, he says that what is installed, when, what has built a fire altered and all those who build the fire alter our legally established. Okay, so this is rules for in California, New Territory by the erection of a fire alter Agni is made present. You see a fire, the erection of a firewall to, that's a symbol of the construction of civilization, right? And because the mastery of fire is something that is absolutely integral to the establishment of border anyways,

Speaker 1:          01:24:48       but the meaning of the ritual is far more complex. And if we consider all of its ramifications, we shall understand why concentrating your territory is equivalent to making it a cosmos for in fact, the erection of an alternate Agni is nothing but the rep production on the microcosmic scale of the creation, the water in which the clay is mixed, the clay. So the altered is assimilated to the primordial water chaos. The client that forms the base of the altar symbolizes the earth. The lateral walls represent the atmosphere and so on. And the building of the alters and company by songs that proclaim which caused region. It's just being created. Hence the erection of a fire altered which alone validates taking possession of her new territory is equivalent to the construction of the world and I'm known for an unoccupied territory which usually means unoccupied by our people.

Speaker 1:          01:25:33       Still shares in the fluid and larva modality of chaos, my occupying it and above all by settling it man symbolically transform it, it transforms it into a cosmos, through a ritual repetition of the creation of the world. What is to become our world must first be created and every creation as a paradigmatic mortal creation of the universe by the guards. When the Scandinavian calling this, this took position of Iceland and cleared it, they regarded the enterprise. Neither has an original undertaking, nor is human and profane work. For them. The was the repetition of a priority will act and transformation of chaos into cosmos by the divine. After creation. When they tilt the deserted soil, they were in fact repeating the act of the gardens. So was organized chaos by giving it a structure, forums and norms, whether it is a case of clearing uncultivated grown or conquering and occupying and territory already inhabited by other human beings.

Speaker 1:          01:26:24       Ritual taking possession must always repeat the cosmogony from the view of archaic societies. Everything that is not our world is not yet the world. The territory can only be made ours by creating a new this religious behavior and respect. Unknown lands continued even in the west down to the daughter of in times Spanish and Portuguese. Conquistadores discovering and conquering territory is took possession of them in the name of Jesus Christ. The raising of the cross was equivalent to Carson crating which country? Hanson some way to a new birth for through Christ. All things are passed away. Behold all things become new. Two Corinthians five 17 the newly discovered country was the nude recreated by the cross. Of course, and when the Americans landed on the moon, the first thing they did was put up the American flag. It's a profane repetition of precisely the same notions. This is this undiscovered territory is now part of the world order rules there in North Carolina.

Speaker 3:          01:27:20       So also Lord, through the ritual after that, because like in the bag agonize like the fire guys, your guide of transformation. So if you're transforming that land from that, which is honest, it that which is explore, right and thereby making it simultaneously sacred part of it. Sacred territory. Yep. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:27:46       Yup, that's right. That's exactly right. In the ritual that you undergo when you're creating the fire temple is equivalent to participating in the act. For example. That's defined by Marduk. Just the, the fighting with the Dragon. That's reference till I read it. I think the reason you might think this is completely off the wall, but I've thought about for a long time, it makes a certain amount of sense to me. Chaos is represented by a drag. Why? Why are you dragging the urge? Any dragons? But it's partly because the dragon is a creature of the of matter because it's a serpent and it goes around on the ground and has wings. So it's also a creature of the air, so it's a symbol of the union of opposites, right? It's also a serpent so it can shed its skin and be reborn. So there's an element of transformation in there. But I always saw this great picture. It's a picture from the medieval church. It's called souls in the grip of hell. And there's, there's a picture of this monstrous dragon and inside it's wood carving inside. If there's all these people who have hard, horrified expressions on their face, but maybe being devoured by a serpent. Now

Speaker 1:          01:28:47       we share our ascending spinal tracks on their limbic system with animals. The pulling a long ways back on the file of genetic chain and our limbic system and the cameras. This is all as amphibians. In fact, the hippocampus first made its appearance win. Our rn says to his crawled out of the water, which is kind of kind of interesting from a symbolic perspective. I think the reason that the dragon of chaos as symbolized by the dragon is because when we fall into that, our actions and aspects are dominated by parts of our brain that are so old. But they still partake in the aspect of the world is defined by my reptilian potency.

Speaker 5:          01:29:25       Anyways,

Speaker 1:          01:29:26       you can think about that. I mean I debated whether or not to, to make a point about it in this manuscript cause it seems to be kind of a strange notion, but the fact is there are dragons everywhere in the world and they're representative of something. Okay. So we

Speaker 5:          01:29:39       thank in these ways and draw these distinctions naturally. It's not a feature of the object. So we would tend to think of,

Speaker 1:          01:29:45       well it depends on how you define the object. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:29:48       Thank you. These ways, even when the territory that we're exploring isn't a spacial object, even if it's something abstract, like a concept.

Speaker 1:          01:29:55       Absolutely. Hello. Our ideological concepts around, especially in your logical concepts or actually abstract representations of adaptive behavioral patterns, they're not descriptions of the objective world. Like if you share a Marxist ideology, Marxist ideology is a body of laws, which basically means that it's a verbal representation of a pattern of action. This designed to transform order into chaos, chaos, and order. Although with the Marxist state works the other way round. So that's right. You're any illogical identification is in fact your abs, your identification with uh, with a god of behavior that's become abstract that into a higher order philosophy. Okay. But don't you think,

Speaker 5:          01:30:36       I mean obviously in those situations then you can use that as an impetus to fight or to have more.

Speaker 1:          01:30:40       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:30:41       In some cases the fact that it's not a spacial object or a literal possession or territory or land might change the way that we approach it. I mean we'd still approach it in the same way in our mind, but the consequence,

Speaker 1:          01:30:52       no, I think it's worse. I think it's worse because look if was, if you've taken it on the wall then you train it so that it, so that it's adapted to a territory you can't come along and have an argument with it and thereby undermine its whole sequence of that applications. Like once the animal is gone and sat down, station fixed about the only thing you can do to really follow it up is to shift its environment. Like you can move it somewhere else. But if you have abstracted your patent and about adaptation up into an ideology that's verbally mediate, and I'd come along with a set of principles that it make logical nonsense. If some of your presuppositions, I can blow apart whole schemes of you're an adaptation in the course of say an afternoon and it might take a long time for the consequences of that to like have their effect on all your structures about amputation. But the point is is that one side transformed my adaptations into words. I can adapt abstract and that's where the useful, right? I mean I can build potential adaptive models in the abstract without having to ask them. No, that's the positive side. But the negative side is this. Once I can abstract out the principles, I'm really vulnerable to an argument. And what an argument is is a war that sparked with works and if it fails then we just cascade down the chain of abstraction to the actual part of the way. So

Speaker 5:          01:32:05       I'm not going to ask you about. So I guess what I'm trying to get at is something more like if there, like if there is a fertile valley, 10 miles outside of mine order and you're there. I have to, if I'm not going to cooperate with you, I have to kill you in order for me to have that in order for me to explore it and for it to be mine. But if I'm studying astrophysics and you're an astrophysicist in China, I don't necessarily have to kill you in order for me to be able to study even the exact same thing that you're studying. But you kill this person by firing off letters undermine.

Speaker 1:          01:32:37       Sure. Well look, that's it. That's it. No, that's a good, that's a good example because there's no necessary reason why a scientific model has to simultaneously take on the effect of Valence of an adaptation or more. But to the degree that your career is contaminated with your ideas, you're going to respond to your competitors as if they were enemies. So if you've abstracted yourself from your objective ideas, which basically means if you have a light, it's independent of your scientific beliefs, then you can treat them as objective elements and there's no necessary reason for you to get your emotions involved. But the truth, like the real situation tends not to be that way. As the people get their objective pictures tangled up with their religious beliefs, and then they do view attacks on their domain as personal attacks. But you're not supposed to do that in science. In fact, science is actually the mechanism whereby we separate those two types of models, but it doesn't always work. So, so it seems

Speaker 5:          01:33:39       like if you're like, like when you're literally exploring the actual physical world, it's absolutely inevitable there's going to be physical violence and conflict. And there's no even possibility of getting around that. I mean, in principle that isn't necessarily part of it. But then so is it wrong to say then that when you're no longer studying the physical world and when you're studying more abstract things that most likely you're probably still going to behave the same way, but there's at least the possibility that you can,

Speaker 1:          01:34:07       no, I wouldn't say, okay. I will. No, I wouldn't say that like I don't think if you're studying things that are objective, you have in principle the possibility of being objective about when you didn't have to fight over it. If there's one thing and we both won and won't cooperate, we must for sure it didn't like about your apartment. Right? Right. There are all like your, your first premise was the bloodshed was a necessary intermediate. Okay, but that's not one of the things we want to do in this course. The reason that I'm interested in the structure of myth to begin with is to figure out, look, here's your alternatives. If I let your ideas in my head and then I end up in chaos, that's one option. Okay, so I don't let you, right. Isn't the body you have by killing you? That's another option.

Speaker 1:          01:34:54       Now, both of those options seem to me to be pretty, pretty distressing. You can't expect me to give up everything I believe in just because you have different idea. By the same token, if the only way that we can settle our disputes is through force and you'll have an involvement. I have one, well that's pretty much the end of the story in there too, so it's sort of anxiety, depression and the possibility of suicide and cultural degeneration on one side or like conflict. It will kill us both on the other side. Right. Those are the, you might describe those as the horns of a dilemma, but then the question is, well, given that dilemma, what's the, is there an alternative path? Well, that's what we're hopefully going to define mostly in the second part of the course because that's the dilemma. It's a terrible dilemma mean before if you had an ax as stone axes and sticks and so did I, and we have fight, well, there was at least the possibility that one of our groups wasn't going to end up.

Speaker 1:          01:35:44       But now when we're talking about territorial disputes between hours that are fully armed, the possibility for settling the problem violently. It doesn't even exist unless you're willing to, unless you'd be willing to kill me unless you'd be willing to die just to kill me. Which of course is always a possibility. And it's now like how deep your desire for revenge action is. So, so the middle road is always a compromise or having, because your copper, if you have an argument with Sonia men's, you take a little of their idea and then it'll enough of yours so that you're so that you're going to get along. And if you have a, if you're have a more sort of physical situation, you're just compromised in terms of getting what you want. Isn't that, isn't that exactly what, what culture is is compromised so that everyone, well a certain part of your providers because if you had are modifying our behavior in some territory, part of it's dispute, but part of it's, well if you do this I'll reward you and if I do this you'll reward me.

Speaker 1:          01:36:40       And so like it's positive mutual, a modification, but also words. I can't have everything I could possibly want. I mean if I could just have everything I could possibly want, I would not function and this economic function in society. All right, right. You get, what you do is essentially theoretically is you'd give up some immediate gratification for the longterm protect possibility. I've continued stable gratification. I mean that's one way of looking at it or at least being able to live in society, which I have to do. Right, exactly. Exactly. That's the social contract sort of notion right now. So, but you said compromise and I would say, well rather, so if you know, here's your negative option one, which is I kill you and here's maybe option two, which is I listened to you and thereby lose all my faith. Well then the question is like, is there some need a principal that isn't either of these that can be used instead of them?

Speaker 1:          01:37:31       And I would say, well that's why we're studying what Marta represents. Because I would say at the core of all belief systems is a representation of the process by which the belief system was erected, which is the most important thing about the belief system. So if you're, you have belief system may that you're like dogmatically attached to and I have a belief system B and I'm dogmatic, the attached to it. And I point out to you that despite our differences that the core, the most important thing is something that we actually both agree about that might help in some way smooth the possibility of transition. It would also make us at least reasonable negotiators because, well, here's an example. You have to see if I want to negotiate with you, we need a higher order point of reference that defines the rules because otherwise I might make an agreement with you and then just like how don't you went to shreds is the first chance like, yeah, right?

Speaker 1:          01:38:25       So you have to be able to trust me even to begin the process of negotiation. So I would say, well this is a weird example, but let's say in, in the Christian marriage ceremony and white table that is the union of two disparate territory's. Well, the notion is, is that the male and the female want to with post to subordinate themselves to the process. The Christ represents smart, smarter, and Horace, et Cetera, and in breath and Buddha. And why is that? Well, because this person has, you know, their story and this person has their story and you didn't have the stores produces a lot of unknown territory like right away. And in order to mediate between the two can, you know, higher order principle, which says, so that's the rule. So it's like, okay, I'll negotiate with you, but you have to trust me. And vice versa. We have to put the possibility of trust above all our dispute. So you'd say what trust is one of the aspects here, et Cetera, et cetera. So then we have a higher point of reference to mediate or just be it. So I'm saying, well, this is one territory, this is another. We need to find out what rules the unexplored spaces in between so that when we get there we know how to act.

Speaker 5:          01:39:40       Say One more question about that similar sort of thing. What if the type of thing that you want to explore it isn't the type of thing that inherently precludes like there's sometimes the things that if I want to have it, I must keep everyone else from having it in order that I can have it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:54       Yeah, that's a zero sum game.

Speaker 5:          01:39:56       Right? And there are other sorts of things that aren't that way. Like for instance, if, if I just had this dispute that I couldn't resolve with the Chinese, astrophysics says I would not necessarily need to even knowledge that he was studying something. I mean I,

Speaker 1:          01:40:10       well that's true. Look it up on it. There are going to be like, I wouldn't have to fight. This is your story and this is his story. You both established domains of reality. Cosmo, cosmo's, oh, the plural of that is to costs as long as he's studying phenomena that are relevant to your pursuits. But even if studying, again,

Speaker 5:          01:40:35       that same thing, I did not have to keep him from studying it just so that I can study it.

Speaker 1:          01:40:39       You not have to kill him as long as, as long as the implications of what he discovers have no negative significance for your ongoing story. That's, that's, that's, yeah. It seems like when you're

Speaker 5:          01:40:50       like just solely to the physical world, like in rivers and who's going to own the valley, then if you're not willing to cooperate and you're not going to give up your goal and you have to kill them. But if it's an abstracted thing, like you're not studying a particular tree yours, but you're just studying a concept. Yeah. And even if he wants to stay in the exact same bit of territory,

Speaker 1:          01:41:10       well he don't make that argument about limited territory too all the time. Cause they say because there's some economists to basically follower, which population theorist who said we were all destined to starve my office. Yeah. There's somebody coming in a suit taken both thoseand perspective, which is that everything is a zero sum game. And so the competition for resources as necessary. And there's others who say, well no, that's not true because you redefined territory by transforming your adaptive structure. And that means that what may look like bounded territory is only bounded because of the way that you approach it. And if you think of a new way to approach it, well then there's plenty of resources for all. And so far the [inaudible] ones I think are winning the argument, which is to say that territory is defined by your behavior in it, not by any objective aspects of the territory.

Speaker 1:          01:41:56       So, you know, he was a jury of distinction between over goods and really these are really structures of belief. Uh, I mean it seems like you can, I would say, I would say not, not usually, because what constitutes a good, it's always construed in relationship to the pursuit of a goal. It's like we fight wars over oil and the 20th century, but we wouldn't fight wars over oil and the 19th century because the effect of the effect of Valence of petroleum has shifted as a consequence of a shift and in our environmental structure. So and that's a natural good, so to speak, but like I don't buy the concept of natural resource, I think. I think there's a real flawed logic somewhere there because natural resource plays the same role in economic theory as stimuli does in psychology. I mean suddenly they were like, we agree that oil is a good and so we're fighting over it.

Speaker 1:          01:42:48       Yeah. That's then just say that I look at the world in such a way that I don't think the world very differently out of the world in such a way that your way of looking at the world is inherently a threat to it because it's different from my, from mine and so it's not exactly that we can compromise. We have to come up with some integrative principal. Right? Absolutely. That's why it was taking dispute fighting over oil. It seems to me, yes. I would say yes because we can't. In other words, we have to get to some other level so to speak. Yeah. We should do that with the fight over oil too, because there should be a higher, theoretically at least there might be a higher order set of principles to which we would be willing to subordinate our competition for oil. Yeah, I mean, and it seems, I don't think it's not, I don't think it's unreasonably Utopian to presume that in the long run it would be better if we could get as much as possible for everyone.

Speaker 1:          01:43:47       It would be like from the selfish perspective, better like think it was a historically, enormously van, for example, that the Americans rebuilt Japan instead of burning into the ground and plowing you down. You're with salt, which is your more standard human response to demolish, demolished enemy. And it was the same Mikey said about Germany, but the addition of Japan to the world economic power strikes me as a net benefit even to the victors evil, which was a well union. Well that plus the Japanese are online, so to speak. We have access to the creative intelligence of an additional several hundred million people or however many people inhabit Japan. So that's, it's not a zero sum game. There's no necessary reason to construe it as a zero sum game. It can be played that way, but it's, I think it's an error so that eliminates the known, the notion of the distinction between like limited resources and ideas because resources are ideas.

Speaker 5:          01:44:46       Let's see. When I look at, I mean I think I do, so I see this danger that you're in. Couldn't get any theologies and fight wars over them, but on the other hand, to me they seem, it seems to present a more optimistic playing field because just if we have this drive to explore that must be so satisfied and we want, we want to explore the physical environment. We must fight. We must either cooperate or fight because if there's one object and that there aren't duplicate copies of it and only one person can explore it, I must,

Speaker 1:          01:45:13       yeah, I see what I can both explored independent, well that don't even need to talk. I always, the farm with the space race was good for that for precisely that reason. It's a great, it's a great outlet for necessary explored very Tennessee. It would not necessarily, I see what you mean. Yeah. I haven't been saying all along. And the whole point of abstraction and sort of in terms of evolutionary development is so that you can figure out what's good and bad without actually going out there and getting slaughtered by it's bad. So therefore, and the, our whole cultural system is being extracted so that you can have, you can do these things where it hasn't actually, but it has a very, the problem with it is that it has this attended a danger that we haven't discussed, which is the Tam Cascade. You can also blow your whole system.

Speaker 1:          01:45:56       It's like that's, I think that's what we did with the site. I guess I should some smell. It's not quite three. When the scientific revolution came about, the discoveries of the scientific revolution in abstract form seem to contradict the presumptions of the religious systems upon which we erected are a deputational structures. So the consequence of abstraction was that we could destroy our belief systems and that brought on an existential crisis. So the problem with abstraction is yes, you can explore the abstract is very powerful. But you can also be undermined really easily by words. So what another reason it's really useful to study your theology I think is because it gives your ideology, your necessary believe that kind of from ground they can no longer be your mind easily by a few casual words. Cause you're north, you're no longer. If you think about it as a tree,

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       you're way up here in the branches, you haven't got the foggiest clue what's down here. It's all unconscious so to speak, which is to say it's all procedural. Lord still embed images. Somebody would come along and give you a bit of harassment here and it blows your whole adoptation we'll structure apart. You hate that. I mean it's, it's very hard on you. But that's mostly because you don't know what's down here. So your house is built on shifting sand, no one on the rock. And the point is you're supposed to this, this ties in with the philosopher's stone inventory that we'll get to in the second half of the course. But the idea is that you're supposed to build your house on a rock. And the point is you have to figure out what that rock is. And that's, that's part of the reason why we're spending so much time to discussing this pattern of adaptation. Because if you know that in your belief system is description of the process by which belief systems are generated and that's the thing that you need to do above all else, well it makes you much more resistant to casual disruption of your, of your adaptations structure. Cause you know what you should do when you don't know what to do, which is the thing you need to know the most.

Speaker 4:          01:47:49       So they're reading. Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker 1:          01:48:01       The simple answer would be yes. Let me see. Well you use the abuse of history is pretty short. The basic writings of nature. No, you don't have to read all that. Read beyond good and evil as much of it as you can. It's very difficult to read. But,

Speaker 1:          01:48:16       but it's very useful. The great mother. Well look are the reason that I signed the great mother is because it's the most comprehensive survey I know of. The symbolism of novelty basically of the great mother. And what you should do is go through it and get familiar with what it is that new saying. Basically all he's doing is saying, well, there's a sim. He thinks it's the collective unconscious by the way, which is right in a sense there's a domain, it's the unknown. It has a positive side, the negative side. Here's the symbols that have accumulated around that domain in representation. If you read that, like go through it enough so that you get a feel for the language of the symbols, which basically means you have to understand when you see the statue of Diana who has a multitude of breasts, you have to understand what that image signifies, how when you see Kelly who has, who's eating someone she's giving birth to, you have to be able to see it.

Speaker 1:          01:49:13       No one has a foreign artifact but as a representation of something that you understand, so you have to read that book and a half until you get the language. The reason for that is because unless you can, unless you understand those mythological representations, you have no idea how terrifying the thing is that you want to avoid. Because in normal circumstances it are well protected existences. We never ever encounter anything but scares us badly enough to let us know how scared we could be. If you look at these mythological representations, you can get an abstract notion of how terrifying territory really is and it's very useful. Get instant insight into other, into the artistic productions of arcade cultures. So, and uh, the origins and history of consciousness. Well that's basically the best book that I do have. It describes hero mythology. So again, you have to go through these enough so that you get the gist of what the authors are trying to, are trying to describe. In the great mother Newman describes the symbolism of north in the origins and history of consciousness. He describes the symbolism of the process that explores novelty. So again, you want to get a picture of it cause then you'll start understanding references to heroes and so on. As we, as we proceed through that, through the divorce or these ordering? No, not really. Not really.

Speaker 1:          01:50:45       Not really.
