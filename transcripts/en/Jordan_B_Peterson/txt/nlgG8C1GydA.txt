Speaker 1:          00:00:28       I'm Steven Blackwood. I'm part of a small team of people founding a new university in Savannah, Georgia. I'm the president of that new institution. I'm here today at Cambridge University and ancient, a gust and beautiful institution and I have the great pleasure today to have with me, Dr. Jordan Peterson, professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, and I think it is safe to say an uninsurable figure of our time. Jordan, it's a real pleasure to have you here today. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       Thanks. Pleasure to be here. Just unbelievable place.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       Jordan and I are going to talk today about what he has called the inflection point and my hope is that that conversation will lead us

Speaker 3:          00:01:14       okay

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       into a discussion of the possibilities for cultural renewal. Indeed, the possibilities for the, the renewal, the renaissance of a more fully human culture. John, I think you've called that the inflection point or called our cultural temporal moment to kind of inflection point. Why don't we start there? What is the inflection point?

Speaker 2:          00:01:40       Well, I think we're deciding, we're trying to decide if there's such a thing as a direction to move forward to into the future. That's what it looks like to me mean. On the one hand we're making tremendous technological progress in all sorts of directions simultaneously. And that seems to be having mostly positive effects, especially economically, especially on a global scale. And another hand we seem more confused about are the foundations of our culture and the potential directions that we're moving in. Then we have been for a while and that seemed especially acute in educational institutions and that seems to be a consequence of the constant cultural critique that's been generated. I would say mostly on the, on the postmodern edge edge of the academic, what would you say? Academic uh, territory. So, so we're trying to figure out what's next, what do we have to offer to students, all of that.

Speaker 3:          00:02:46       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:02:48       I know that it was, it does. Yesterday was published the 50th Anniversary Edition of Solzhenitsyn's Gulag archipelago with a forward

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       that, uh, you've, uh, foreword written by you, which I think you've described the writing of is one of the greatest honors of your life, if I got that right. Yes. Academic. Now, I suppose the question I have there is, is why is that so important? Well, the book was important because it was the first, it was the first work that succeeded in undermining the Marxists project from a moral and an intellectual perspective simultaneously. I mean, other people had pointed out the terror of the Soviet enterprise, Malcolm Muggeridge and George Orwell, among others, often people on the left, interestingly enough. But it was always possible right up until the end of the 1960s for the people who held on to that collectivist utopian dream in the west to rationalize what had happened in the Soviet Union, partly by sweeping it under the rug, but also partly by, um, while using the old adage that you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       It became obvious by the end of the 1960s that the Omelet wasn't very well prepared and that millions of eggs, so to speak, to Belabor a metaphor, had been broken. And so when Solzhenitsyn wrote his great book, um, it became impossible for anyone who was willing to be part of the cultural moment to ignore the fact that something had gone dreadfully sideways and that it couldn't be attributed merely to a cult of personality or to some abnormality that wasn't intrinsically part of the doctrine itself. And so that was partly what soldier soldier Knutsen revealed about the Soviet Union as such. But at the same time, the evidence that precisely the same thing had been happening in places like Maoist China perhaps to even a larger degree, well, undoubtedly to a larger degree. And then in Cambodia and all the other places where Marxism produced utterly murderous consequences.

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       Um, and so that was the book that did that and it made Marxism morally repugnant. Um, it all, it was also one of the events that catalyze the transformation of Marxism into identity politics as far as I'm concerned, because a lot of the people who held the, the victim victimizer narrative as sacrosanct, that that was the appropriate way to look at the world, to divide people into identity groups of whatever form. And then to see history as the battle between them, the history, the present and the future that that trans, that transmuted, especially in France because even though the Marxists had beaten, um, unmasked, the murderousness of the doctrine had been masked. That didn't, the people who had held that doctrine, we're still looking for the easiest lateral move. And so that was one of the driving forces for the development of postmodernism, not the only one.

Speaker 2:          00:06:13       It's the postmodernists are also figured out something or run across something that really is an intractable problem. They ran across the problem of categorization and that that actually happened in multiple disciplines at the same time, including artificial intelligence in psychology. People realize, start to realize about in the early sixties, and it was probably under the pressure of the AI types, that it was very difficult to perceive the world because objects aren't just there for the looking because every object is made of sub objects and as part of a higher order structure of objects and defining what constitutes the appropriate boundary to put around a phenomenon so that it can be perceivable as an object turns out to be a virtually impossible task. We're not sure how it can be managed. And so the, that realization of the intrinsic complexity of things led to a crisis, I would say an intellectual crisis, which was, well, if there's a near infinite number of ways to perceive a finite set of entities, how is it that you can call any one interpretation, either canonical or valuable?

Speaker 2:          00:07:23       And that's part of the postmodern skepticism, let's say a Meta narratives and it's actually a reasonable critique. Um, the problem is as far as I'm concerned, that what the postmodernists did was used that problem, which is a genuine problem, uh, as a critique of the structure of the West. And then instead of addressing the problem directly, which is, well the world is very complex, but we do in fact perceive it and they're actually our value structures. They just circumvented that and pop back into a bastardized form of mark. The bastardized form of Marxism that we see today is identity politics and that's been extraordinarily destructive to the universities. Well, let's, well let's, let's, let's talk, talk

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       about that a bit more because it seems to me that, that it would be a great shame if people were to think that your, uh, your writing this foreword to Solzhenitsyn was simply to document something as an historic phenomenon as essentially important as that historic documentation is. It seems to me that what is of interest to you is not simply to shed light on the terrors, the hundred million slaughtered a in the course of the various Communist revolutions of the 20th century. Those various etiologies motivated by Marxism and other, uh, other forms of, of, uh, philosophical ideology. But because it seems to me that you take what was present in that philosophically, ideologically still to be at work in, in to have been, as

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       it were, reborn in the west. And so I suppose what I'd like to ask you about is what are the, what are the characteristics of the Marxist ideology that led to those, that, that, that very obvious death and destruction, which in a, in a subtler way you see to be, am I right to say you see to be at work in the West? Uh, so I like it. It seems to be very important that we have a deep sense of what the, the governing assumptions of our culture, our or it's hard to transcend them. Yeah. Well that is exactly the issue because the question is whether or not the past is over. I mean, there's a Mark Zack Marxist philosopher named Richard Wolff, who challenged me recently on youtube to a debate. And really the answer that I posted was this forward. And he accused me of being stuck in the past.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       You know, it's, well the, you know, the, the wall fell in 1989 in the horrors of the Soviet era are over. And we, we, we can't paint, we can't eternally tar Marxism with the brush of these past events. I mean, as if these events are over or as if 50 years is sufficient time to forget about the corpse us. But that's his idea, you know, and to me it's the same idea that you might put forward if you are a neo Nazi by saying that, well, you know, all that happened back in 1945 the fundamental doctrine was sound and we cannot allow our judgment about these eternal truths manifested in the national socialists doctrine to be forever tainted by some unfortunate historical events. And I think that that's just, well, I don't even know what to say about it. I mean, one of the telling things about his comments was that he only talked about the Soviet Union and not all the other terrible places that the same doctrine had been implemented with equally murderous effects.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       And so that was quite the argument by evasion. But I, what I tried to do in the forward and in my thinking in general is I'm always trying to get to the bottom of things. What's at the bottom? And it seems to me that what happened, if you look at what happened in the Russian revolution, like the first thing you want to do is give the devil his due. Okay. And the way you do that is by pointing out that hierarchical structures, not we'll, we'll start even before that. People have problems that have to be solved. Life is a sequence of problems that have to be solved. If you don't solve the problems that life puts forward, you suffer and you die. So assuming that you don't want those two outcomes, then there are problems you have to solve. And, and so you have to set an aim.

Speaker 2:          00:11:36       And the aim is to solve the problem. And then because we're social creatures, we have to solve the problems by organizing collectively. And the way we do that, generally speaking, in relationship to an aim, is to produce a hierarchy. And the reason for that is that if you have a problem and you want it to be solved and you a variety of people working on it, you're soon going to discover that some people are much better at solving the problem than others. And that will inevitably produce a hierarchy and it should because then the, even the, the structure of authority is, is in sync with the aim and the aim is valuable because it's a problem that everybody agrees that is an actual problem. So you're going to get hierarchical organizations and you should. Now the problem with that is that as soon as you produce a hierarchical organization, two things happen.

Speaker 2:          00:12:23       One is that a small minority of the people do almost all the creative work. That's the pre to principal. And the other is that the benefits of the hierarchy flow disproportionately to a small number of people at the top. So, and that's another manifestation of the pre to principle. And it is something that marks pointed out, although he blamed it on capitalism, which, which is a big mistake. Even if you're concerned for those, the hierarchy dispossesses so you produce a hierarchy, both the work, the work flows from a minority of people and the benefits flow to a minority of people, and those might not be the same people by the way, right? Because hierarchies aren't perfect in their ability to distribute resources as a consequence of a productive effort that that's part of the problem with hierarchical organizations. But then what the hierarchy does is produce a layer of the dispossessed that stack up at the bottom near zero, and it's the majority.

Speaker 2:          00:13:16       It's always the majority. So that's the price you pay for hierarchies. Now what the left does is say, look at the dispossessed and keep the hierarchy flexible enough so that it can twist and band and transform unnecessary, but also so that the dispossessed don't fall so close to zero, that aid that they're done, they're in misery B, that the talents they might possess can't be utilized. And see that the whole structure doesn't become so untenable that it destroys itself because of the inequality, perfectly reasonable propositions. And so then you could say, well, there's a certain number of people on the left who are genuinely motivated by concern about dispossession as well as the dispossessed of course, fine. So that's to give the devil his due. And so then you might say, well, there was moral reasons. There were more reasons for at least a subset of those who are involved in the Russian revolution to be involved.

Speaker 2:          00:14:10       They were interested in helping the dispossessed, but there's a problem and this is the problem of the left. There's a problem. So on the right as well. The problem on the right is once the hierarchy is established, those who dominate the top have every right to overstate the moral virtue of the hierarchy because it privileges them in particular on the left. The problem is is that it's not easy to distinguish between care for the dispossessed and hatred for those who occupy positions of, well, you could say authority. The leftists would say power. You could also say competence, which I think is more to the case or ability. It's not easy to distinguish care for the dispossessed from hatred for those who occupy the preeminent positions in the hierarchy. And if it's power, then it's hatred for power, but if it's competence and it is competence, if the hierarchy is functional, then it's hatred for the competent.

Speaker 2:          00:15:03       Okay. Then you say, all right, so those are the two competing motivations, care for the dispossessed and hatred for the, let's say competent. Let's play that out. Historically speaking and see, which is the more powerful force. While that got played out very rapidly in the Russian revolution. And what happened was even if there was a s a minority and perhaps even a majority, although there wasn't, but perhaps even a majority of those who truly cared for the dispossessed, those who hated the competent slaughtered them, it turned out that the hatred was a much more potent, uh, geopolitical force than the compassion. And then, and another twist occurred too because the, the narrative was Bursch Waze against proletariat, let's say. And so that's those at the upper most pinnacle of the hierarchy against those who were the dispossessed. And that was also the historical narrative. And then it was the right and responsibility of those who are oppressed to rise up.

Speaker 2:          00:16:01       But that ran into another problem, which is basically the problem that the, that the, the postmodernists, especially on the feminist side, have now identified as intersectionality. It's like, well, it turns out that you're, you can so easily be placed into one group. I, in fact, this is the perception problem that we talked about before. There's a very large number of groups. You can be placed in it. It might be an unlimited number of groups in fact. And so then if you're motivated primarily by hatred and your, your, your desire is to produce as much mayhem as possible. You can take any given person and you can analyze the multiple groups that they belong to. And then you can find one group in which they're the oppressor. And then because there's no excuse whatsoever for the oppression, even if there's one dimension of your identity along which you're an oppressor, then you're grist for the, for the, for the bone crushing mill of the, of the Soviet work cap.

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       And that's exactly what happened. And so as the Soviet revolution progressed, more and more people got thrown into the cauldron, let's say the socialists, the students to religious people, the, all the, the, the old, the original Revolutionary Stellan had all of them killed. Cause there was some, and if it wasn't you that was guilty because of your group membership, then they just expanded the capacity that the, the parameters of the idea of group, well you're not an MPR oppressor, but your grandfather was a landowner. Well that's good enough. That's, that's, that's your class. That's, that's, and so that's sufficient justification to throw you to the wolves as well. And so what you saw is this just unbelievable expansion of murderousness driven by the twin improper presuppositions that you could define people by their group identity and that history was best conceptualized as a battle between the fortunate, the unfortunate long those group identities. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       If we could pick up that, that notion of the, the group identity and the collect what you call the co, the collectivist thinking, it seems to me that might be opposed to a kind of robust view of the human individual as the site of responsibility and agency suffering. And so it seems to me that, uh, what I'd like to ask you about is the, is the connection between, or the ways in which the collectivist thinking results in the annihilation of all human particularity, whether it's economic or a familial or, uh, uh, you might say, it seems to me that what's going on in the collectivist thinking is the absolute enemy of human particularity and freedom itself. That's

Speaker 2:          00:18:46       the enemy of the idea of the individual, the sovereign individual, which is the central idea of the West. I mean, and that's manifested in the underlying religious structure. So if you think about Christianity for example, you think about Christianity psychologically is strip it of its metaphysics, at least for the purposes of the argument. You see the emergence of the idea of the divine individual as, as well as, as what, as, as part of what's what, as part of divinity itself, right? As an integral part that's part of the trinitarian idea of the part of, uh, of divinity itself. And that divinity to me is the capacity of the, of individual consciousness to generate order from potential. So the way I look at people, first of all, so like people who have been criticizing what I'd be doing, think about my philosophy such as it is not that it's mine as a sort of variant of iron Rand's ideas of the centrality of the individual individual above all, that's not the issue.

Speaker 2:          00:19:48       It's a conceptual issue. Is that what, what, what category is to be primary? And for me, the individuals to be primary. And there's a variety of reasons for that. First of all, the individual is the locus of suffering and also the locus of responsibility. So, so those are really the two reasons that the individual has to be made primary. Um, but, and, and the divinity element of the individual. And, and this I think is coated in our deepest stories, it's really deeply coded in genesis, particularly in the opening chapters of opening verses of Genesis, is that what human beings confront in their lives is akin to what God himself confronted at the beginning of time. And so it's easy for us to believe that we're deterministic creatures like clocks and, and that it's the past, the drives us forward in a deterministic manner into the future.

Speaker 2:          00:20:43       But I don't believe that's the case. I actually don't think there's any that that's the case because people are so complex. You actually can't predict them as if they're deterministic, excepted in very constrained circumstances. And so it's a hypothesis, but it's not a very good one. Um, and although it has its utility, what, what, what seems to me to be the case, and I think this is how people conceptualize themselves and how they act towards themselves and towards other people and how our social structures or political structures are constituted, is that human beings constantly confront a landscape of possibility. It's potential itself. And, and we have a belief in the idea of potential. We have an idea that there are things that could be, it's a very strange conception of reality because it's not a materialistic conception because things that could be aren't measurable in any sense, right?

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       But we certainly act as if they exist and we all treat each other as if our, one of our fundamental ethical requirements is for you to confront that potential properly. And that would be to live up to your responsibility is you have these gifts and talents and, and possibilities that have been granted to you. And if you fail to make use of them, your talents, let's say, then that's a sin of sorts. And that's a religious way of thinking about it. But it doesn't matter because that's how people treat each other. If you have a child, for example, or or, or a spouse or a friend, brother to anyone you care about and you see you have the intuition that they could be making more of themselves and what they have, then they are, then you're deeply disappointed in that. And the reason you're disappointed in that is because there's a call to us, an existential call to confront that potential.

Speaker 2:          00:22:37       That's, that's everywhere that faces us in every direction and to transform it into the most functional and habitable order possible. And the way that that is to be done properly is with truth. And, and, and I think that all of those ideas are integral to the Judeo Christian substrate of Western culture. They're fundamental ideas. And so if you put the group before the individual, then all of that disappears when you're, when you're debating with the radical leftist, postmodern types about free speech, you're actually not debating with them about free speech because they don't believe in free speech. It's not part of their conceptual universe because for for speech to be free and therefore valuable, the people conducting the conversation have to be sovereign individuals capable of generating independent thought independent of their canonical group identity and reach a consensus through that process of dialogue, none of that exists in the postmodern world.

Speaker 2:          00:23:42       All of those preconceptions would be attributed. Well. Something like Euro centric neocolonialism, something like that. It seems to me that wasn't work at that is a radical dismissal of the possibility that the individual has access to anything at all. That is to say that that that in, if you don't do believe in free speech is fundamentally motivated by the, by or, or sustained by the confidence that our discourse or dialogue, that human thinking itself can reach something stable, that it has a relationship beyond the by beyond immediacy and that and that and that there's me on power and beyond power. It reaches beyond power to truth. There's no point in ever having a conversation about anything if the conversation itself doesn't have access to something transcendent. Exactly right. Well. So what happens with, and this is especially true for people like food call Dera too, to some degree as well, the first thing you do is you define the fundamental motivation has power.

Speaker 2:          00:24:39       Because that's all there is, is there's the dominance of one group or the other. And so then the dialogue has to serve power because that's all there is. And so yeah, all of that is obliterated. And, and by, by doing that actually, the, the, the postmodernist make it impossible for them to solve the conundrum that validly drove poss postmodernism to begin with. So the conundrum is infinite set of potential interpretations. That's a real conundrum. That's the problem of complexity, right? And, and it's real. So then the question is, well, is there any solution to the problem of complexity? And this is where issues of moral relativism start to become, um, PR paramount. Because if there's no solution to the problem of complexity, then there's no canonical interpretations. And all the interpretations are just, well, what would you call it? They're there expedient. They have the expedience of power.

Speaker 2:          00:25:34       But see, my best pathway through that essentially I think has come from the developmental psychologist, Sean Piaget and Piaget could be considered a Neil Kantian. You know, the cots fundamental doctrine was act such that if your action became a universal maximum that that would be of universal benefit. And so, and but by Piaget differentiated that and, and, and, and demonstrated how that evolved naturally in the course of the spontaneous maturation of children through play. It's, it's absolutely brilliant. So I can give you a quick example. So my granddaughter who's 14 months old has just learned a new game. And the game is, she plays it with her wooden spoon and the game is she has the spoon and then she looks at you and then she gives you the spoon and then you take it from her and she lets it go and then she watches you and then you give the spoon back and she's very happy to get the spoon back.

Speaker 2:          00:26:32       But she's also very happy to give it to you. And then she turns to the next person and she gives them the spoon and then she gets it back. And then you can play with there. And the play is, well, now you've, you've, you've, you've, you've started to embody the principle of reciprocity, right? We can trade and, and it's a repeating game. It's not one trade. You don't end up with a spoon. And I don't end up with this bone. We both have the spoon some of the time across time. And there's some utility in the exchange itself. Okay. So she's playing without in thrilled about, and no wonder because it's a walloping walloping discovery. And so then you take the spoon from her and maybe you, you hold it a little longer than she expects and that makes her a little nervous. But then you give it back and then she's relieved and that makes her happy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:17       Or You cover the spoon with your hand and then she's a bit confused about where it might be a new, show it to her and you give it back and she's happy about that. Or she reaches out to grab it and you pull it away a little bit and move it back and forth. So she has to do a little more effort to get it. And as long as you don't push that, and it's a bit of a challenge to her, uh, both, both physically in terms of, of coordination, but also psychologically in terms of delay of gratification. She also finds that gratifying and the, and the reason for that is that you're, you're showing how her, how robust and resilient the idea of reciprocity is across sequences of transformations. And it's just this little thing you do at the table. You think, well that's nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:27:58       It's like, no, it's something. And so the P is Yeti and idea is something like there's an, there's an implicit morality that emerges to constrain the infinite set of interpretations. And it has to do with the structure that we'll maintain reciprocity optimally in the largest, including the largest number of people across the largest amount of time. And so, and so the way that I've been portraying that for the people who've been listening to my lectures, is that what you need to take responsibility for yourself as if you care for yourself. Okay. So first we figure out what's yourself. Well, it's not just you now because you aren't just, you now you're the community of use that extra stretch across time. So in order for you to take care of yourself properly, now you have to learn to play an iterative game with yourself that's sustainable and even potentially improvable across time.

Speaker 2:          00:28:49       And there aren't many games that you can play like that. So that starts to radically constrained the set of possibilities. And then it's more constrained than that because not only do you have to play a game with yourself that can repeat across time to minimize suffering, to remove the possibility of death, to allow for the possibility of productive movement in a certain amount of happiness. But you have to do that with other people around you and across time. And so there's you and the multiple use embedded in your family and the multiplicity of your family members embedded inside a culture and, and the extension of that culture across time. And so for you to act properly than all of those things have to be harmoniously balanced at the same time. And that radically reduces the set of potential interpretations. And that's the antidote to the, to the chaos of, of, of, of the infinite array, potential perceptual, uh, worlds and, and well, and then there are questions that emerge out of that.

Speaker 2:          00:29:48       Like, well, what's the best way to play that game? But we certainly know that a reciprocity fairplay the spirit of fair play is, is, is immensely important to that. And that's what Piaget documented and that Wa it's what we all know. And also that there's something about truth that's absolutely integral to that as well. So, and the postmodernists just, they just, they got the problem, right, but they, they never went the next steps. And it's partly because, well, why is it, why is it they had an easy answer at hand that required almost no transformation in their original worldview? Well, we'll just keep the Marxism will just transform it into something that looks different and that'll be good enough. Minimal change. So

Speaker 1:          00:30:32       it seems to me that that, that the, that the, the, the, the collective, the collective is thinking that's at work in the insistence that only the group matters has the effect of radically annihilating the integrity of the individual. In fact, that may be even, it's a, its essence. Well I think, I think it's, it's a actually that is the saying. I believe so at the bottom and because there's a, there's a murderousness at the bottom of the collectivism

Speaker 2:          00:30:55       that needs to be accounted for. And so I see what's at the bottom. And this is partly a consequence, say of the insistence that the west is a patriarchal tyranny. The, the desire is it's the Cain and Abel Desire. See Cain was jealous of Abel. Not so much because Abel was God's favorite, but because Abel deserved to be God's favorite because he had done things right and it's very bitter. It's very bitter in life to see a gap widening between you and someone else, period. But it's particularly bitter if you know the gap is widening because the person who is doing well is doing, is actually doing good and doing well. And that implies at least in eradicating the vagaries and randomness of life, and I'm, I'm perfectly aware of those as factors. It's, it's bad enough to be down, but it's worse to know that you're down because you've put yourself down and then you have a choice, which is do you do turn against the ideal itself because it becomes so painful to gaze upon it or do you destroy the ideal out of vengeance and spite?

Speaker 2:          00:32:06       And that's, and that's, that's a simpler pathway forward then decomposing and deconstructing yourself and being reborn. The Christian idea for, for lack of a better word, is that something has to be sacrificed in order for the potential of the future to be manifested in the best possible way. There's always a demand for sacrifice. The question is what should be sacrificed? And the answer is you. That's the answer. It's you that should be sacrificed. And then the question is, well, what part of you and, and the answer to that as the part of you that's not worthy, that needs to be put into the flame that needs to be burnt off. And that's a process of death. And rebirth. And if there's lots of you that has become corrupt, then most of what passes through the fire will be burnt off. And that's terribly painful for people.

Speaker 2:          00:32:57       It's, that's the desert. You know, w imagine that your, that your essential personality structure is tyrannical. So you're a rigid idealogue, you're cast in stone and so you decide to move from the tyranny who escaped from the tyranny. Well, where do you end up where you don't end up in the promise land, you end up in the desert for 40 years and maybe you die there. I mean, even Moses did. So it's out of the frying pan into the fire, that's for sure. And it's no wonder that people are loath to let go. And then the more tyrannical they've become, the more they've restricted their possibility and all of that and sold their soul to the dogma of human beings. Let's say a soldier Knutsen would describe it, the less there is of them that will be left after everything is stripped bare. And that's a terrifying, that's a terrifying possibility.

Speaker 2:          00:33:44       It's much easier to take the other route and it becomes easier and easier. And then while there are other motivations that pile up as well, bitterness, the hatred that bitterness can, because you know, you've lost your chance, right? You had your chance and you've, and you've squandered it and the, and the feeling of that. I think that's why Cain tells God after he gets caught after his murderous act, he says that his punishment is more than he can bear because it's the realization of what he's done. He's destroyed his own ideal. And that's what you do if you're a collectivist, you destroy yourself as an individual and that's all you have. And so there's, there's nothing in that except I would say a continually opening pet of hopelessness and despair. And then that drives bitterness and hatred and desire for revenge and all of that. It's a terrible cycle and we've seen it play itself out over and over and, and, and, and we haven't yet precisely learned from that. So to me, it's part of an eternal struggle. You know, it's been outlined as a, as a war in some sense. That's going on in the human psyche since the beginning of time for for all intents and purposes,

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       it seems to me, Jordan, that your position is, is fundamentally a positive one. It's an affirmation of human dignity, the freedom that dignity demands and an affirmation of the infinite particularity of human life. If one were to contrast the collectivist thinking, on the one hand we've, when might call it a kind of abstract rationality, is if there's one solution to fit them, one size fits all kind of top down logic. What's on the other side? What's the, what's the antidote to that in the individual

Speaker 2:          00:35:25       it is particularly, I mean one of the things I talk about in 12 rules for life, and this is an in my lectures, this is become a, a meme, strangely enough, something that's widely distributed on the web, partly because there's comical element to it. It's to clean up your room and everyone laughs about that because I'm taking that seriously. It's like, oh, clean up your room. Everyone's mother has told them that a thousand times. Right, but I tried to explain why. It's like, well you have a bit of chaotic potential right in front of you. It's in some sense infinite in its potential and the the domain in which you can manipulate that might be rather restricted because of the restrictions that that are part and parcel of your existence. But maybe you have your room and you might think you might have contempt for that and so it's a complete bloody catastrophe, but you don't have to, you could think, well, I've got a little, it isn't a room.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       It's a place of potential and as soon as you know that, then it's, it's not your room anymore. It isn't a room. The room that you see is your preconception of the space that you inhabit. What's there is, is a fragment of infinity. That's what's there and what you see is the, is the, is the low resolution consequence of your assumption and lazy habit and blindness. That's your initial room and you think, well no, that's not the room. See part of what artists do. For example, when van Gogh Paints a room and you look at it glowing, he's trying to show you what's beyond your perception of the room. And I mean this technically, like the way that your visual system is set up is that whenever memory and presumption can, can, can replace direct perception, it will because it's simpler. So you literally see what you expect to see and if what you see is dull and drab and boring and pointless and, and, and, and uninspiring, then that's you.

Speaker 2:          00:37:25       It's not what's there. And what the artist does when he or she represents that mundane reality is to remind you of what's behind it. The potential that's there. And so what I'm suggesting to people is that they take the potential that's right in front of them. It's like, okay, and here's the rule you're aiming up. There's something that you could change, that you would change now might be a very small thing. Could, well that's within the grasp of your power would, is within the grasp of your will to combine those two things might be very small shift. You might only be willing to make a very tiny step forward. It's like fine, good enough, make a tiny step forward and that makes you a slight bit stronger than you were before. And then the next step can be slightly larger and it's, it's the path of humility.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       It's what people, it's what people act out when. So there's this cathedral, it's actually, it's not a cathedral, it's an oratorial in Montreal, I think it's the second largest one in the world. It's set on a hill at the top of a hill and there's a huge staircase leading up to it from the bottom of the hill. And people often who are crippled and who were on crutches and so forth are in wheelchairs, go there and make their way painfully up the hill. Or maybe they do that on their knees. And the idea is that they're struggling incrementally uphill, step-by-step despite their burdens to reach the city of God on the hill and they're acting out. That's life. It's like the proper aim is the city of God on the hill. And what is that? Well, that's that place that we talked about already where these levels of responsibility are stacked together harmoniously so that you're acting in your best interest and in your family's best interest and in and in the world's best interest. And I would say in the best interests of reality itself, right? Assuming that we have some integral role to play in reality, which is certainly at least true at the human level. That's the city of God on the hill that beckons to everyone and you, you move up that you move towards that humbly. So that's one step at a time and you do it despite your burden and you're suffering all of that. And that's all dramatized in that and it's, it's a perfect dram of that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       And would you even say it is not to be despite your suffering, it's in, in through your particular suffering. We, one thing that strikes me about, you know, clean up your room, clean up your room. Yes it is the affirmation of the particularity of your life. I mean, one thing that strikes me about deepest in our human experience is that it is infinitely particular. I mean, you mentioned your, your granddaughter. I mean the, the, the loves, the people, the experiences, the places that were shaped by it. They're not places in the abstract. This, this top down sense as if there could be the, you know, the same kinds of clothes and the same kinds of experience for all human beings. It, that that's the enemy of the very deepest truth of our human experience, which it seems to me is infinitely particular, but not infinitely particular in the center, which those particularities just go off into nothingness. Those particulars are precisely our points of access to the transcendent, to the infinite, to the, to the, to, to, to, to that switch.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       That's where the reality is. Yes. So that's why young said that modern men can't see God because they don't look low enough. Yes. They're not, there aren't paying attention to the importance of the particularities because the particularity is where the pen meets the paper, right? Yeah. And it's just a tiny dot every, every, like when you're, when you're writing, it's, it's a dot. And then it extends into a, in those transform into words and sentences and paragraphs, but the particular act is where the pen meets. Yes, yes, yes. That focal point, right? That's the center of the cross by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:41:13       Yes. Yes. Well, you mentioned the cross, I mean certainly in the, in, in, in, in, in the, in the history of, of the West, one of the ways has come through as a and in the east to is in Christian theology is the very notion of the incarnation. You know, what does that to say, but that the infinite is in the particular and that they, that, that they are, that they are co

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       inherence that the infinite in fact has no life except in the particular and the particular itself has a relation to her is comprehended by that. Very infinite. And so it seems to me that that what is going on there is an affirmation that every particularity, no matter how tiny itself has revelent Tori of, of a transcendent, and I think it was from the gospel of Thomas, but I might have this wrong. The Kingdom of God is spread upon the earth. But men do not see it. And that's that. That's that infinite, that infinite possibility in each moment of particularity. And that is what artists, that is what great artists are reminding herself. They'll take a slice of space and time. It was it money who painted the haystacks. He went out into the fields in France and he painted the same haystack like many, many times under different conditions of lighting.

Speaker 2:          00:42:33       And to show how different my, if it's a, if it's a haystack, it's the same thing, but it wasn't, he paid attention to the particularities. And so what great artists are trying to do is, well first of all, so imagine the painting. So it's a painting of a landscape. And so the first thing is that it's layers of time because the painter has gone out there and seeing the landscape and then seeing it again and then seeing it again and then seeing it again and then seeing it again. And it has to pay attention to the particularities of the light and the color and all of that to represent it properly. So it's and, and, and the mere fact that he's done that is, it's, it's the acting out of the idea that in this tiny slice of time and space, there's something worth attending to for an infinite amount of time.

Speaker 2:          00:43:20       But you can't be because you just can't do it. But you need to know that you couldn't do it and then it would be worthwhile. And so the painter encapsulates the landscape and then frames that it says like, look, look through this window at the transcendent that's behind the low resolution representation of your assumption, the blindness that you, the, the expedient blindness that you by necessity bring to bear, to every situation. Remember, what's behind this. Always remember what's behind this. And that's what art calls us to do. That's what beauty calls us to do is to make contact with that. And then you say, well, the problem with the, particularly the problem with the particularly is that it brings suffering. And the bringing of suffering with particularly can also allow evil to enter the world because that particular suffering can engender bitterness and resentment and hatred and all of those things.

Speaker 2:          00:44:13       And the desire to destroy. So the particularity carries with it a tremendous risk and a tremendous burden. And so the answer, the question is, well, how do you tolerate the particularity and take advantage of the potential? And the answer is to make a relationship with the infinite that's behind the particularity. And that's the fundamental religious idea is to, if you can maintain the particularly, but also stay in contact with what's transcendent and infinite beyond that, then you can then you have the potential strengths to tolerate the catastrophe of what's limited and then you get to have your cake and eat it too. In principle.

Speaker 1:          00:44:52       Yes, yes. I want to return to education in a moment, but, but on the way there, as it were. Jordan, I want to ask you, uh, you've, you've talked about this, this the inflection point. What is the inflection point and how might it be understood relative to, uh, what I would I take to be a very decadent, a worldview in its last gasps? It seems to me, even that, uh, many of the, uh, frankly simply slanderous, uh, attacks on you personal, personally blatant misrepresentations of the, the very plain fact what you're saying, it seems to me that there's an animus there that is precisely, there's an animist there. But the question is where is that coming from?

Speaker 2:          00:45:42       Well, we, if you look at a Derrida for example, and his critique of the idea of logo centrism, you know, as, as the, as the central Motif of the West, let's say, and he, and he knew at multiple levels what that critique meant because he knew what logos meant. Logos means embodied truth. And there is of course, a religious dimension to that. And so he was criticizing the notion of fowl logo centrism and, and so he was going right at the core of the doctrine of the individual. Now the question is, why might someone do that? Now, I think the reason for that fundamentally is that there's a terrible responsibility that goes along with it. So imagine that you offered people here, here's the offer. Offer one.

Speaker 2:          00:46:28       You don't matter. It's, it's a really say the narrowest of materialist view points is you weren't here then you were for a brief period of time and then you're gone. And that all washes out in the endless sands of time. Nothing in your life is significant. Nothing about humanity is significant. Nothing about the world itself is significant. It's all a matter of blind, random chance. And it's all the same in the end. Who cares in a million years, right? And and the price you pay for that is insignificance. But the advantage that you gained from that is that fundamentally you have no responsibility because nothing you do matters. And so then there's no moral burden. There's no obligation. And of course, if you can gather expedient pleasure while you're deteriorating pointlessly, then that's all to the good. So it's, it's a libertinism as well. And that's inviting obviously because short term pleasure is by definition inviting.

Speaker 2:          00:47:26       And so you can abandon any pretension to a relationship with the infinite. And consider that only a sign of delusion and weakness. Assume that your life is material and irrelevant. It doesn't matter. And then you can shrug off all responsibility and pursue short term pleasure. While there's some real advantages in that, it's very, it's a very easy pathway. The alternative is, as far as I'm concerned, is no, you don't understand. You are the, you are the center of the world as center of the world. It has many centers and you do partake in this process of casting the potential of the future into the reality of the present and the past. That's what your consciousness does. And the quality of what you produce is dependent on your, on the ethics of your choice. Your choice between good and evil in every moment is what determines the course of the world.

Speaker 2:          00:48:23       And that's on you. It's like, well, that's deeply meaningful, but it's unbelievable. It's in it's ultimate responsibility in the literal sense. And I think that in order for us to set things right, we have to understand that we have to take on that burden of ultimate responsibility as if it's not only as if it's ours, which it is, but as if there isn't anything better that we could do. And I, and one of the things that I found so gratifying about the lecture to her that I've been doing is that and why keep doing it. The live events in particular, um, cause we've done about 100 of them now so far is that when I explained to the audiences, and this is especially true, it's speed seems to be especially true of of men but of young men, but not so young even to say, look, you have, you, you have an ethical obligation to lift the heaviest load you can possibly conceive of.

Speaker 2:          00:49:19       And that's the primary call to adventure in life. And that call to adventure is so worthwhile that it justifies the particularity. Everybody, it's like lights go on and they think, oh, I see. So you need a meaning to set against the suffering and to protect you against that temptation towards men. Malevolence you need that. Well, where's the meaning to be found? Well, it's not happiness, it's not short term pleasure. It's not, it's not self development, it's not self esteem. It's none of those things that are so focused on, on, on the individual's psyche event. It's, it's literally the stumbling uphill towards the city of God with your burden. People go, well, that's where the meaning is. And they know that because they know responsible people, they know, they admire responsible people. They already got that say, well, that's what you should be calm. And they think, and not only that, that's what you could become because that's what you are in the deepest sense.

Speaker 2:          00:50:14       Yes. Yes. Would you, would you say that, that, that, that the antidote denialism is meaning? And if so, uh, you know, I think you've described yourself Jordan, as you've said, I think the surfer not the wave. And I suppose I want to ask you what is the wave, because it seems to me where it a moment of very great, uh, cultural potential and it could go any number of ways, but that the very fact of what one might call it, the Jordan Peterson phenomenon, a worldwide, your book translated into dozens of languages. Your rec lecture halls packed, uh, is a sign of a longing, a self conscious longing for, for, for, for meaning. How would, how would you, how would you describe what that wave is that, that you didn't create, but that you will start speaking some of its technological? So, so I would say that wave is, it's got multiple levels and so, so we could start from, well it will start from, I would say what's most obvious and that would be the medium rather than the message.

Speaker 2:          00:51:16       So I, um, and these people that I'd been associated with, this intellectual, dark web group, we're, we're in the fortunate position of being early adopters of extraordinarily powerful technologies. So, and, and the technologies are twofold. There's, there's online video and then there's podcasts. And so they're technologically revolutionary in a variety of ways. So online video is revolutionary because it brings something closely akin to a live performance to an infinitely large number of people on demand permanently. So then you think, well, what's the advantage of a book? Well, it's permanent. It's relatively low cost. It's easily distributable. Right. So what, what's the advantage to online video? Well, it's, it's inexpensive. It's not inexpensive. It's free. It's far easier to produce than a book. Like the lag time from video to publication is the day. Like we can put this online today instead of the three year lag that a book would require and then far more people can watch and listen, then can read because reading is a minority ability and in some sense really fat, real expert level reading.

Speaker 2:          00:52:28       You know that because such a tiny minority of people buy books and people are made uncomfortable by books, they're intimidated by them. Even if they have the intelligence in principle to do the reading, it's not part of their cultural mill. You, that's a small minority of people. And so all of a sudden online video allows, allows the spoken word to have the same impact as the written word. And that's deadly. That's a good and Berg Revolution. And then with podcasts that's even magnified because you don't have to sit and watch a podcast. You can walk around, you can exercise, you can do the dishes, you can, you can drive. Many people who come to my lectures are like long haul truckers and guys who run forklifts and you know they're in their machinery all day and all they do is listen to podcasts and so all of us and they can listen to the podcasts because more people can listen, then can read and maybe way more people can listen, then can read.

Speaker 2:          00:53:23       We have no idea, maybe the potential market 10 times as big and so they can do it when they want to. They can also do it in private. If you read and you're on the subway, people can tell you're reading. If you're sitting at home and reading well then you're with a book and if you're uncomfortable with a book, you think that's pretentious or presumptuous or part of a class that you don't belong to or anything that makes you feel inferior. Well, you can just circumvent that you listened in private and so people and people are taking that opportunity like mad. And so that's part of the way it's, let's say that technological revolution in communication that's illustrated that people have far more depth and capacity to concentrate that anyone would have imagined. You didn't see this with Netflix and HBO, it used to be on TV.

Speaker 2:          00:54:06       There was an idea that while movie was about as long as you could attract people's attention for 90 minutes, that's the most the typical person could concentrate for. It's like that turned out to be complete rubbish. People will follow these incredibly complex like literary level net narratives breaking bad, for example, that has multiple characters following multiple streams of development for, for endless hours and they'll binge watch it. So we have way more capacity for sustained concentration that we thought and these new bandwidth unlimited technologies are revealing that to us. And I happened to be an early adopter of this and so that's, that's part one of the wave. And then, then there's the message part and it has something to do with cr culture for a very long time has articulated out a a right of rights. You have rights, you need to demand them, you need to claim them.

Speaker 2:          00:54:59       It's like, but, but that's, that's, that's half the story and it's not the most salutary half because it turns out that the meaning in your life isn't the consequence of the claiming of rights. The rights are in some sense what other people owe you. I know there's more to it than that, but, but it's that in large part. Well, you can just get what you're owed. It's like, no, that's not where you're going to find your meaning. What you're going to find, where you're going to find your meaning is responsibility, which is the other half of the rights responsibility equation. And people don't know that this is the, the, the, the, the, that, what would you call, this is where, this is where this is the point where things come together properly. You need a meaning in your life to forestall the suffering and to make you strong enough to resist malevolence where's the meaning to be found?

Speaker 2:          00:55:47       Rights, impulsive, pleasure and happiness. No responsibility. Oh, who would have guessed that? It's not part of the narrative because the responsibility narrative even is usually about duty or patriotism or something like that, which which is okay, but it's, it's, it's an ideological narrative too in its own right. This is different. It's like, no, you don't understand is that what makes life worth living is to pick up the p two two to take it's kits, task atrophy, and embrace it and carry it and to realize through that who you are. So one of the things I figured out in this lecture tour, there's this old idea that you go into the abyss and to Nietzsche and idea that you can gaze into the abyss. You gaze long and what you find in the abyss is a monster. Tolstoy wrote about that. That's the dragon at the bottom of the abyss.

Speaker 2:          00:56:40       Let's say that Satan himself for that matter. And, but if you go into that, into that as deeply as you can, what you find is your, you find, you find, you find your, your, your, your fragmented father in a, in a comatose condition, in a, in a, in a, in a desiccated and, and, and separated condition. And then you revivify that. Well, what does that mean? It means something. It means that if you look in the darkness, you find the light. That's one thing it means, and that the light really stands out against the darkness. But the light is to be found in the darkness. So that's a very interesting thing. That's a quest narrative, but it means more than that. It means something fundamental. So we know, for example, that if you take yourself out of your current state of, of predictability and safety, and you put yourself in a new situation, you'll learn, right?

Speaker 2:          00:57:33       You'll observe, you'll incorporate new information. So that's a cognitive issue. But that isn't all that happens. What happens is that new genes turn on within you and code for the production of new proteins that happens neurologically. New parts of you turn on. And so the idea is that if you can move yourself out into the world and push yourself out against a maximum array of challenges, more and more of you turn on turns on into, and then the question would be, well, what would you be if all of you that could be turned on was turned on? And the answer would be, you would be the resurrection of the ancestral father. That's what you would be. And so that's why Christ says I am the way and the truth and the life, and no one comes to the father except through me. What that means is that if you take on the unbearable burden of being voluntarily, then that transforms you into the ancestral father. And that's true. And so that's unbelievably optimistic because what it is so interesting because it's, it's dark beyond belief rights to say, well, the world is characterized by suffering and by malevolence of a depth that's virtually beyond comprehension. But if you choose to comprehend that, what you discover in that is the light that destroys the darkness. And that's, well, that's announced really something to discover. It's, it's, uh, it's, it's the discovery that there isn't a discovery that's more profound in that that's the search for the holy grail or the philosopher's stone, all of that.

Speaker 1:          00:59:04       It isn't that the, isn't that the search and indeed the finding that every human being is made for. Um, what I want to ask you, Jordan, is about the role of education here. So it seems to me that, that what the meaning that people are finding in your work that you can listen to in podcast. You can, you can, you can, while you're doing a long run, uh, uh, drive, uh, across the prairies or wherever it may be. But it seems to me that, that the, the deconstruction of our culture by a world view that has denied the integrity of the individual that has denied the individual's relation to the transcendent, to any stable, knowing, denied the dignity of the individual, that, that deconstruction. It's not for no reason that the, uh, the postmodern view calls itself deconstruction that has very deconstructive effects in my view, in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:59:59       It seems to me that the rebirth of, uh, or the, the renaissance of a more adequate to more fully human culture depends on more than, um, it depends on institutional life. We need cultural forms. We architecture, there's all kinds of, uh, fully a full culture is a complex, uh, uh, an infinitely complex structure. Uh, but I think we've, we've as it were, deleted out the memory banks in so many profound ways. And so what I'm, what I'd like to ask you about is the still have the libraries. We still have the libraries. Well, thank God for that. Thank God for that. And this is where I want to turn to education because you say in, uh, uh, at one point you say that that we need to rescue the treasure trove of the past, the Chinese restaurant. He rescued the values of the treasure trove of the past and integrate them. And I suppose I'd like to ask you about the rules of the university

Speaker 2:          01:00:49       these are for, is to remind people to, to, to lead people to doing that. I mean, we wandered around Cambridge today and you showed me King's chapel for example, which is so beautiful that it's just beyond belief. And that's a call, right? That's it's a call to a mode of being. And it's a, Socrates believed that all learning was remembering. And, and it's true in the sense that we just discussed is that through encounter with the tragedy of life and the malevolence of life, that that more of you will come to manifest itself. But that can be, that can be facilitated by your incorporation of the greatness of the past. So you say, well, each great philosopher, each great thinker is a fragment of the ultimate ancestral being. It's a fragment of, of God the father, let's say. And you get a fragment from Nicha and you get a fragment from Plato and you get a fragment from Vichtenstein and you get a fragment from Shakespeare and, and, and there's something, imagine this, there's something that makes all those people great.

Speaker 2:          01:01:49       It's whatever greatness is and it's broken up apart. It's broken up across all of them. But if you went, if you experience, if you're exposed to each of them, then you absorb what's your, you're exposed to and have the possibility to imitate it and absorb that greatness across its, its fragmentation across many people. And then you can, that can come to awaken that within you. And that is the purpose of the universities. And the reason for that, it isn't, it isn't something casual. It's like, well it's, it's, it's good to be more. If you go to university and you take a humanities degree, you'll come out more well rounded. You know, that's, that's not the, that's not, it's such, it's such a weak way of putting it. It's that no, you wake up and realize who you are and then you're ready to take the world on your shoulders. And that's what the universities are here. And that's what students, students are dying for. That, that's why men are abandoning the universities is because that call isn't there.

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       Yes. Well there's just no answer to the call. You might say the, it seems to me that the wave is the longing, the longing for that call to be answered. And it seems to be that there are universities that have failed us and utterly failed. They're antithetical. Do you might call them the, the water main that is distributing a worldview that is corrosive of,

Speaker 2:          01:03:04       of, of, of, of what is best in the human being? Well, the, the, the doctrine. So one of the fundamental doctrines of the, of the collectivists leftist, especially on the feminist end of things, is the idea that western culture is a patriarchal tyranny. And so first of all, we could say, well, that's inappropriate psychologically because the way that you represent culture architecturally is with the tyrant and the wise king. And so you can say that there's the tyrant and that's always true. But you also have to say that there's the wise king, but there's no wise king. There's only a tyrant. Okay. And that tyrant is, that's all men. It's all male. And so, and so then, and so that's a view of history, right? Is that the view of history is that, well, women have been the primary force of oppression in relationship to women throughout history has been men.

Speaker 2:          01:03:55       No idea about the cooperative endeavor of men and women or their mutual desire to lift each other out of misery, which is a much more accurate way of representing history and a much more grateful, inappropriate way. None of that. No one's a patriarchal tyranny and men are responsible. Okay, well, so where does that leave young men? Well, let's say young men are attempting to manifest competence in the world and to become good people. Well, there's no good and there's no competence. There's only power and it's related to the patriarchal tyranny. And so that conflation of competence with power, which is an absolutely pathological move in my estimation, is also the desire to discourage and to devalue and to destroy. And partly it's based on fear because the idea would be, well, a fully fledged man is nothing but a powerful tyrant and therefore dangerous, better to emasculate him completely.

Speaker 2:          01:04:49       So it's nothing but harmless. Even though he's useless, he can't do anything that's bad, which is an unbelievably horrifying, that's the castrating mother, the Friday and castrating mother. That's the terrible element of, of the, of the female body politic. That's the evil queen. That's the counterpart to the evil king. Something we never talk about. So, and that's what's facing young men is that at least they're discouraged from becoming what they could be. Um, yeah, at least they're not encouraged, but it's worse than that. They're actively discouraged. And so the universities have become, they've become institutions of active discouragement and especially for men. And so what's the consequence of that? Well, especially in the humanities and social sciences. Well, it's obvious. All you have to do is look at the statistics. All the men are leaving. There won't be a man left in the humanities and social sciences in 15 years at the current rate of, of gender transformation of the disciplines.

Speaker 2:          01:05:47       And then you see this equally appalling phenomena occurring phenomenon occurring, which is that virtually all of the female dominated disciplines are politically correct. And I think that the reason for that is that the reasonable women don't know how to regulate the behavior of the unreasonable women. The benevolent queen can't regulate the evil queen and that and that hatred for the patriarchy. That's the feminist part of the postmodern neo Marxist monster is, is has decided that he masculine [inaudible] and weak men are preferable to tyrants and, but, and those are the only options because there's no such thing as genuine competence. What do you want to call young men forward to do? Is to take their place and say, look, you have to understand it's not just about you, is the world will be a lesser place without, without that, which you could reveal to it because of your particular rarity. And that whole that you leave by the absence of your presence is going to be filled with something terrible, not just something neutral, but something terrible. And that's on you. And so you, you, you have a calling that's, that's vital. And, and people, people need that. They are die. They die.

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       Yes. Yes. It seems to me that the ideology that's dominant and very much of the university is not only destructive and all these ways, but chess boring and that it's patent inadequacy to our deepest human longings, male, female of, of, of all of all races and kinds that the deep transcendent longings that we all have, the need for self longing, for self knowledge, that that idiotic elegy is, it is patently inadequate to at satisfaction. And what I see in young people today, many, many young pills, I know you see this in the thousands that you encounter is, is they're not interested in fighting some cultural war. They simply want to discover the deepest truth of themselves. And, um, so I want to ask you a little bit about, about the role of education. We talked about the lighting up and the, the awakening, the encounter with depth and truth. Um, you know, there's a certain kind of abstract view of education as though it's a kind of inert process. So you're just sort of downloading into the, into the, into the mind. But in fact, the nature, yeah, sure. Of

Speaker 2:          01:08:10       our, of our, of our, of our, the nature of our souls is that, that it's

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       an, it's a dynamic reality. You know, the room who's not just the room, it's the place in which you would, you encounter yourself in the, in, in the, in the rule of clean up your room. But it seems to me that that's what's going on in, in, in all education at its best, and that it's not enough simply for the library to be there. Their needs there, certain mediation of the institution. So for example, we could have, there's a piano in the other side of this room, you know, we could say, well, there's a piano, you're free to play the piano. Uh, but I, I can't play the piano. I don't know the cords and the scales. I haven't, I haven't.

Speaker 2:          01:08:45       And yet if I, if I, if I did all that, then what I can make happen on the piano is infinitely richer than if I've never learned to play the piano. And I suppose, I suppose when we talk about rescuing the values of the treasure trove discipline as the precondition for freedom. Yes. Right? Which is, which is, uh, which is actually a Nietzschean idea, at least in part. I mean it's older than that. It's the apprenticeship idea. It's that it's that before, before you can be a painter who can paint what's beyond mere memory, you, you have to inculcate that discipline skill. And a lot of that is painful repetition and hard grinding work. It's the sacrifice of the present for the future. But once you manage that, then things open up and virtually everything you learn to value is like, that's very, very, very difficult to learn to write.

Speaker 2:          01:09:37       And there's arbitrary, arbitrary rules that you have to follow and bind yourself to. And while you're learning those rules, the probability that you have any creative freedom to speak of or any facility with the rules is very low. You're a, you're a rank beginner and, and even to some degree, whatever creativity you have is going to have to be stifled. Well, you're passing through that, that key hole. But if you pass through it, then something massive opens up on the other side. And it is definitely the case that disciplinary institutions, universities are exactly that is their places of guidance and, and their places to encourage people to develop the discipline that's necessary to see beyond the discipline. I mean that's why we have disciplines, right? I mean the words aren't there by accident. You have to narrow yourself first and then you can broaden outward.

Speaker 2:          01:10:28       And so that's, and that's part of the process of maturation, that part of the, that's part of the sacrifice of childhood. Say in childhood you're nothing but potential, but it's not realized and you don't know how to realize it. And so then the question is, well, how do you get to a point where you realize the potential? And the answer is you sacrifice almost all of it to a single direction. This is niches, commentary on the Catholic Church because he a great admirer of the Catholic Church, despite the fact that he was also a radical critic. Critic of Christianity said the cow. The thing about the Catholic church is that it forced everything to be interpreted within a single explanatory framework. And that was a discipline. And once that discipline was established, then the discipline mind could in every direction, which is precisely what happened. And so, and, and, and that's the thing about growing up is that when you're a teenager and a young adult, you have to sacrifice everything.

Speaker 2:          01:11:23       You could have been as a child to be the one thing that you're aiming at. But then that opens up and the universities are part and parcel of that process and you need the guidance because the, the, the library is too large to wonder through it unaided. Yes. And that, and I think that comes down to, to the, to the question of, of what you need to, what are, what are the books that can be read to be transformative. I mean we, we, you know, the, the, the otherness that realizes in that awakens and opens up the self, that light that turns those lights on is not just a random otherness. I mean, you can look at a brick wall all day and never get anything. Like would we get by looking at the king's chapel that we just came from a few minutes ago, that, that the, the levels of pattern and depths and beauty that are present in that building, that's a kind of metaphor for what the most wonderful, most contexts of our own, of our own past offered to us.

Speaker 2:          01:12:26       You know, they're, they are lying on the shelf, but when opened up, uh, and explored fully, they open up in us the, there are portals. So I suppose in my book a book isn't a paper. Yes, that's you, that's your memory. That's your perception of the book. It's a portal. Yes. And, and, and you know, one of the ideas, the postmodern idea is that well, there's no canon and if there is a canon and it's only there to support the tyrannical patriarchy because of course the tyrannical patriarchy is the explanation for everything. But I've been trying to solve that problem technically with, I have a small staff that trying to produce an educational system online and we'd been trying to understand, well what is it that makes a book canonical? There's actually a technical answer to that. So you imagine that books exist in relationship to one another.

Speaker 2:          01:13:12       That's a perfectly reasonable postmodernist claim by the way. Books exist in relationship to one another. Okay, well some books have hardly any relationship to other books. Those are trivial books. Now they might be undiscovered works of genius. That's another possibility if there recently written, but it doesn't matter because you can't separate the wheat from the chaff at present. It's too difficult. There's too much chaff. But if you go back into the past, you can rank order books by the degree to which they've influenced other books. So it's like citations in some sense. And the books that have influenced the largest number of other books are the canonical books and the ultimate canonical book. And the West is clearly the biblical corpus because it's influenced virtually everything. And so you have to know it because it's implicit in everything else. And so you start there and so you have that, you have that knowledge at least to some degree.

Speaker 2:          01:14:04       And it gives you the foundation, the metaphorical foundation, the conceptual foundation, the mythical foundation that you can use to then, well maybe you can now that now Shakespeare opens up to some degree of now Milton opens up to some degree in Dante, opens up to some degree and you think, well, why should those open up and answer as well as the social constructionist claim? You're at least in part a historical creature. Well then those books are about you. They're the, the patterns in those books are the patterns of your perceptions and your actions. And without understanding them, then you don't know who you are. And you can't guide yourself properly through life. And so you, you, you come into university and you encounter experts and they say, look, this is canonical. Why? Because it's had a disproportionate influence on everything else. So you need, there's something here that you need to know about because it's about you.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       And, and it isn't about the you that's here now. In some sense it's about the you that can unfold across time in the, in the best possible way. So each of those works is a call to adventure. Every painting that's a great painting or a building like that. King's chapel. If that's not a call to adventure, I mean, what else could it be? We were talking about that. So these ancient buildings, these great ancient buildings that Europe is littered with, these were people would, we're aiming at something beyond themselves, beyond the span of their lifetime. They, they engaged in the co the collective manifestation of these great works to aim, to, to, to participate in aiming something that at something that was beyond them. It was a divine aim. They had that, that will to produce this beauty that transcended centuries. You know, and maybe the will that produces beauty is always aligned with that, which transcends centuries.

Speaker 2:          01:15:51       Maybe those are the same things. He even paintings, oil paintings, you know, they, they take a moment in time and they cast it into a permanent form that can be, it can be preserved across centuries. And so there's something about, there's something about the establishing a relationship with eternity that's key to the construction of something that's beautiful. And then that in itself becomes a call to a relationship with an eternity. So, and you need that people hunger for it. I'm at the University of Toronto, there's the, the, there's the European cathedrals side of the campus, the older part. And then there's the modern factory side of the campus and it's sold deadening. My building is made out of cinder blocks, you know, and my, my brother in law, who's his own sort of genius calls that hosel architecture, anything could happen there and you could wash it away. And it's like, and it's just, it's, it's, it's, I have my students now and then sit in a classroom like that and look at it and tell me how it makes them feel. Random wires hanging from the ceiling, you know, nothing but cinderblock the cheapest form of construction. Nothing that's beautiful, pure, boring, dull utilitarianism with these bare shiny desks and terrible fluorescent lighting. It's like it's ugly, right to the core and it, and it's corrosive. It

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       eats away at the heart of the university, which is about the beauty that's eternal. And, and that isn't optional. It's not impractical. It's, it's the most practical. It's, it's, it's that upon which the idea of practicality itself is predicated. And that's the university. And people should be flocking to the university's dying to be educated because they are dying to be educated. I have dozens of young men who come to me all the time after my talks and say, look, they give me a note. When did last night, here's the note, six weeks, six months ago, I was deeply suicidal. I had no reason to live. I was completely nihilistic, said, I started watching your lectures. I started to adopt a more responsible outlook. I realized that that was important. I started to try to tell the truth and to put myself together. And without that I wouldn't be here.

Speaker 1:          01:18:02       And that's a little note. And that happens over and over, you know? And then I go talk to journalists and this happened in Scandinavia. It happened with his GQ interview. I just did. While your message is primarily directed towards young men, so I can, there's this judgment about that. It's like, oh, there's a problem with that. Is there, I mean that wasn't the point, but that is the audience is what, there's something, there's something wrong with talking to young men and encouraging them. It's like that makes me somehow somehow suspicious the hatred of humanity that is present in that critique is mindblowing. It, it's, it's, it's, it's absolutely beyond belief and you think, well, it's only misogyny. It's like, no, it's not. It's like what? Who are you leaving for the women to have as partners? These did demolished and week, whether it's a zero sum quality of it.

Speaker 1:          01:18:50       I mean as if, as if, as if lifting up any human being is not a good for all of us. I mean there's the whole point about the necessity of our care for the oppressed is because they are part of us know you only care about them in groups. The individual impressed person is irrelevant. It's the group of oppressed people that's relevant. And so if you just help one person, no. Well you see then, then that's, that's that, that, that flies at the heart of the collectivist doctrine. You said something very, very powerful when you talked about the people should be flocking to the universities. You're in an image that comes to my mind is the image of a fountain. And know people come to the fountain to drink, to slake their thirst. And, and, and, and, and it seems to me that we need, we need new institutions of higher education.

Speaker 1:          01:19:34       That's the fountain of living water. Yes. Yes. Moses. That's why Moses is a master of water in the desert. So we thought a master of stone mass. Yes. Yes. And one thing that really excites me, Jordan, is that, is that what we see right now is, is this longing. There's so many thirsty people, it seems to me we simply need to, to build new fountains because as you say, the books are in the library. We can, we can, we can give a rebirth to the past in the form of the hunger and thirst that are in young people simply by feeding it. And that, it seems to me that, that there's a kind of

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       cultural pacivity, particularly when it comes to the university. People say, Oh, well, you know, you could never do anything about that. Well, you know, the university, they're just, well, you just have to kind of write them off. Well, why don't you have to do that? Why can't we start new ones? People, there've been thousands of universities started over over two years, come into the university and they've got this facade of cynicism. You know, that partly because they haven't had great experiences with the educational system and it's no wonder partly, but it goes all the way back to the, to the beginning. Yes. I mean you've talked about this in dating in your booklet into the university to interrupt, but that the, what moves in in the whole k to 12 educational system in a certain sense, was founded with in large part to bring about that collectivist control and to, to stultify.

Speaker 2:          01:20:52       And to annihilate the, the, the freedom of the individual. And so that's, that's pretty well ingrained. By the time someone comes to university and no wonder they don't like it, they don't think they like educational institutes as swab and then, but they're still desperate enough to come and they might say, well, I'm doing this practically because I needed a degree to get a job, which is, you know, as perfectly reasonable. It's perfectly reasonable as a, as a fragmentary ambition. It's a good fragmentary ambition, but their, their, their, their core is dying for something deeper than that. And they're coming, they're coming to university. The way that you enter a cathedral properly, if you enter it properly, they come prayerfully. They're hoping, but they won't talk to anyone about it. They're hoping, God, I hope that what I need is here. And if you provide that, then they're just overwhelmed by it.

Speaker 2:          01:21:45       And, and then they're motivated to, to work and to move and to put themselves together because it doesn't take much water on to really transform a part surface. And these young people, they have their cynical facade and it's easy to be intimidated by that because they're, they're judgmental in their lectures, in your lectures, and maybe they're not paying attention and they're snapping gum in there playing with their computers, but there, there is part of them that's at the back listening and hoping that something will emerge that will captivate them and when that happens then well then well then that's when it becomes something absolutely remarkable to be an educator because then you're providing guidance and you're providing the guidance that that's, that's well that's, that's, that's the bread, that's more than mere material brand and then the students are extraordinary, extraordinarily rewarding to work with because there are so, it's not pleased.

Speaker 2:          01:22:36       It's way more than pleased. They're so engaged by what's happening that the whole thing comes alive. That's, that's when it's a great thing to be an educator. And what, it's been great for me to go on this lecture tour because, which is why I keep doing it is because every evening it's like that. I get 2,500 people in an auditorium and I start talking about the things we've been talking about it. Everybody's dead silent and they're locked onto it. And it's an unbelievably gratifying process. And then people come up and say, you know, oh, this has been so useful to me. Things were so terrible and falling apart in so many ways. And like all of a sudden I'm just stacking these things up and putting them together. So interesting watching the young men who come in and talk to me, and it's, it's young women as well.

Speaker 2:          01:23:21       Well in North Idaho, always just so young, uh, many of the women come and say thank you very much for what you've done for my sons for example. But the men come up and they say, it's like they're telling me a secret, you know? And it's the sort of secret that you'd only tell an intimate friend that you trusted. It's like, you know, man, I wasn't doing so well. And these are often rough looking guys. You know, they say, look, I've been really trying to get my act together. You know, I've been working it out with my wife and I, I've been, I've been trying to get my relationship with my son straightened out. And here's my father by the way. He came along with me and we're getting along just fine and it's really working and they say it hushed voice, you know, and they say thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          01:23:59       And I say, great, that's so great. I'm so thrilled to hear that. And they, they're telling me that because they're hoping that I would in fact be thrilled to hear that because they want to tell it to someone who would be thrilled to hear it. And I am thrilled to hear it because I do believe that the, that redemption is something that is accomplished at the level of the individual. And every time you hear someone say, um, that they've, they're, they'd oriented themselves properly. It's like a bell rings in heaven to exactly that and so, well, so, well, so that's absolutely, and chronically overwhelming, but it's, it's absolutely remarkable to see this, to see how much desperation there is for this. When I talk to audiences about the relationship between responsibility and meaning, they inevitably go dead silent. There's not a, there's not a Russell, there's not a cough.

Speaker 2:          01:24:54       It's like, is that the secret? Is that the secret? Is that it's the voluntary adoption of responsibility? It's like, well, that's the, that's the central message of the West. It's like to pick up your cross and it and know and everyone's been told that, but they don't know what it means because if it's not being articulated enough so that it becomes something that's practical, it's like, yes, look at the terrible responsibilities you have right in front of you. Your family is hurting, you're in trouble. There's problems in the world. It's like all of that's right there and all you have to do is all you have to do is take responsibility for it and then you've got what you need. All of a sudden think, oh, that's what I needed. I didn't know that. I thought that was something to avoid. It's an impediment to short term, hedonistic pleasure, you know, went to happiness.

Speaker 2:          01:25:41       There's nothing happiness about, happy about lifting the suffering of the world. Onto your shoulders. It's like this is way, way better than happiness isn't what you feel in the king's chapel. It's something so magnificent that happiness pales in comparison. So it's, it's, it's thin, grool happiness and young people know they're pursuing hedonistic pleasure and you know, no wonder, but there's nothing in it that sustaining and all it does is make you cynical. It's like is that's all there is another one night stand, another, another binge party. You know, and it's not like I have anything against in principle against some of that exuberant, youthful hedonism. But, but it's, it's not. If, look, the universities have turned into places of parties, why? Well, because that's what the students find best to do there. Well, that's not good. What you want to offer them as a reason to not party.

Speaker 2:          01:26:42       It's like, no, you got to understand, you come to this class, hung over. You're not going to be able to get it. You don't go on to be able to write properly. You're going to pay a price for that hedonism. It's like, and the price will be too high for you to bear. It's like, oh well nef hedonism for me. Then I'm like, I've got something important to do. That's the way out of that. But that, that thing that's more important has to be offered and it can be offered. So when I've seen it happen over and over to people and it's, it's, it's extraordinarily good for them. If you're an addict, and I've talked to many people who are addicted, you need a reason to stop being addicted, which means you need something better than the drug. Well that's what you offer at universities. It's something better. It's something better than everything else. And if you're not offering that, then it's all a facade. It's all a factory, a knowledge factory, which is the modern university factory knowledge factory products.

Speaker 1:          01:27:36       It seems to me. And we'll conclude here, I think momentarily, it seems to me that that the time is ripe for a radical in beautiful rebirth of a more fully human culture. And when I hear you speak Jordan, about your lectures and you know what, what moves me deeply is, is the, the love that you have for the people who come to you. And I suppose I want to just conclude on a question, uh, about, I want to conclude on an optimistic note by, by drawing out what's in that love. It's that the potential that is, that lies in those, in each and every individual for deep transformation, for connection to the transcendent and, and, and, and, and, and, and just to talk about that, that longing, that seems to me that, that, that longing is overwhelming. And if only we can start to, can refill the fountains with water or build new fountains, that the possibilities are beyond our imagining for the point we're at right at

Speaker 2:          01:28:50       the moment. Yeah. That's what partly why this is an inflection point too, because so many things that are transforming the landscape of possibility is opening up to us in a way that it, it never has, partly because of our technological transformations. And so the importance of the particularities of our ethical choices are becoming more and more exaggerated because while we're going to build artificial intelligence and it's going to be a reflection of us, and so we better make sure that it reflects the part of us that we want reflected. And you talked about that care for people as they care for me is predicated on my realization that I prefer heaven to hell. Having done what I could to explore hell, let's say in my academic career and in my private life and in my, and in my clinical practice, and to see what's there that unnecessary suffering and not malevolence is like, well, it would be best to move away from that towards something better.

Speaker 2:          01:29:45       That's something I genuinely believe that it's, it's, it's for the best for everything that we aim up. And then when I see someone decide to aim up, I think, well that's, that's something that's one more step away from hell. It's not just the, it's not just the climbing up the hill painfully towards the city of God. It's move away from the abyss. And I think it's easier for people to believe in the abyss. It was for me to believe in the existence of malevolence and apocalypse and catastrophe. I mean, all you have to do study history to believe that they call. Not that anything, but that a way from that, while away from that is a morphous, right? It's, it's again, it's like Moses leading his people from, from the tyranny in Egypt. It's like, well, where are we going? Well away from that, well, that's into the desert and that's where we are now. Well, that's not so good, but at least it's a way from that. Well, that's something, but then there's something beyond that. It's like, well, what is it that we're striving towards and and well, we, we can each imagine that in our own way in some sense, but I would say, well, you start locally, it's like fix up what you can fix up. When you see a problem that announces itself to you, a small problem, that's your problem that you could fix. That's your one step forward. Take it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:59       Yes. It seems to me, in addition to that, that life of the individual, we'd, we need to think very broadly about the institutional life that supports all of that individual realization and freedom. We need to think about universities when you think about our architecture, we need to think about that is to say that, that the, the whole horizon that lies before us needs to be considered for the fullness of possibility that, that it holds. And that those possibilities are not realizable simply by, you know, this individual doing this and that and are doing that. But that they also require a kind of, um, it requires that we think about the whole and that we allow to give birth. We allow to come into being the kinds of institutional lives, institutional life that, um, upon which our realization upon which that awakening depends. And so it's simply can't be simply a matter of, of our living our lives and a kind of solitary way.

Speaker 1:          01:32:06       No. Or thinking about what do we know what to think about, what are the fountains on which, you know, if we're in the desert, it seems to me that, that, okay, so we're in the desert. It's a, it's a, it's a lonely and dry place, but there are the dirty of fragments or the narrative that the Israelites come to worship the false idols because the narrative fragments and that is the PR precisely the moment paradoxically at which we can rediscover ourselves, what our, what our nature, what our longing is for. And so it seems to me that we're at a time of astonishing possibility, but that we must take it up. Well, hopefully, you know, when you train graduate students and new train undergraduates, you know, you orient them towards the truth and then they learn to teach in accordance with that and that, and that facilitates the process that we're describing and that they regard the relationship with individual students as a of paramount importance. And see the teaching is something that's noble and the research as well. Yes, yes. The awakening of each particular individual. It's an educational institution is precisely what allows them to go on in 10,000 ways in 1,000 thousand ways throughout their lives to to to transmit and open up those transcendent possibilities. Thank you Jordan. Very much. My pleasure.
