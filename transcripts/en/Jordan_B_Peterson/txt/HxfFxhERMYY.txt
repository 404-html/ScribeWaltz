Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi everyone, I should really be editing my book today, but, um, I thought I'd take a bit of time to respond to something that happened in the media today in the aftermath of James Demaurice Google memo. I know the coverage it's received. A journalist named Steve Kovak wrote a story for business insider called Silicon Valley's liberal bubble has burst and the culture war has arrived in that article which discussed the memo. He characterized myself and, uh, Stefan Molyneux a well known youtube personality as far right. What is article said specifically was that, and I quote Youtube, which is ironically owned by Google and has become a hotspot for right wing v Loggers was they would let of choice for Demora himself. His first public interviews were to Stefan Molyneux and Jordan b Peterson far right figures who have built up large followings on the video site. And I felt that that was inappropriate, let's say to say the least.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Um, and so I tweeted that and emailed him and said that that was a mischaracterization and asked him to justify his claims. And so what I'm going to do is to read our email exchange to, okay, um, and you can draw your own conclusions from it. So the first email, this is my email, I said, dear Mr Kovach, you called me a far right figure in press. You don't have one iota of proof for that statement. And it is patently untrue. I've been lecturing, for example, about the dangers of national socialist ideology for decades. Find a single thing I've said that places me on the far right in the absence of a smoking pistol is that grounds for a lawsuit for defamation of character. Inquiring minds want to know if you want to talk, I'm open to it, but you should watch your words. I'm seriously unhappy about you're careless and false characterization.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Watch this, for example, and see if it's far right. I link to a youtube video of a lecture I gave on the temperamental basis of right wing belief. And so then Steve responded and he said, how would you prefer to be characterized? And then he said, just saw your tweets. Please let me know what you would prefer. And so I said I would prefer the truth. I would prefer that journalists such as yourself use absolute precision of language. It's not up to me to tell you what that is. It's up to you given your choice of profession. And this is no laughing matter, Mr Kovach as you seem to imply with quote, please let me know what you prefer. And I've been fighting an intellectual war against radicals on the right and left for three decades. I've been very clear and public track record with regards to my attitude to the far right. I spent a lot of time and for example, in my first book, maps of meaning outlining the psychopathology of national socialists and it made my opposition to such things known in a manner both public and widely distributed. The fact that I'm equally unhappy with the gulag type leftists generally ignored by the modern postmodernists does not make me far right. I'm seriously unhappy about being carelessly lumped in with people I despise and have spent my life fighting.

Speaker 1:          03:27          He wrote back and said, thank you for your response. So the article is truthful and accurate.

Speaker 1:          03:33          How would you like to be characterized? I said, I said very clearly you mischaracterized me as far right on what grounds whatsoever can you make that claim and having made it, it is your responsibility to either justify the characterization with some investigation or to withdraw it and apologize politically. I'm a classic British liberal. Temperamentally. I'm high in openness which tells me to the left, although I am also conscientious which tells me to the right. Philosophically, I'm an individualist collectivist, have the right or the left metaphysically. I'm an American pragmatist who has been strongly influenced by the psychoanalytic and clinical thinking of Freud young and the psycho therapists who have followed in their wake. There is simply nothing I've said or done that makes me far right. Quite the contrary. I've warned thousands of students over the course of three decades that the spirit of Auschwitz concentration camp guards dwells in their heart and that they should do everything in their power to recognize it's existence and overcome it. Every single lecture of my maps of meaning course, various versions which have now been watched or listened to by millions of people, make some variant of that point. I've also produced a series of individual self development programs now used by thousands of people to strengthen themselves as individuals determine their proper and honorable destinies and live productive, meaningful lives. You didn't do your homework. You cast a serious dispersion on my character. I don't deserve it in the least. I want you to do something about it.

Speaker 1:          05:10          He responds. Thank you for the clarification, Jordan. I will correct the story and identify you as a classic British liberal.

Speaker 1:          05:20          I responded. I wrote this one before. I received his response, but I sent it after so I'm keeping it in the order that it actually emerged rather than in the order that it makes precise sense. Dear Mr. Colback, do you really think that if I were far right, I could have placed 200 university lectures online and taught for three decades at Harvard and at the University of Toronto without someone making a devastating case for my ideological perversity? In what universe could that possibly occur? I'm a university professor, clinical psychologists, and a public intellectual whose primary goal is the psychological and metaphysical strength and fortification of the individual. I was still trying to clarify, um, how I would like to be referred to literally nothing about that as far right. I don't even care though that you've called me that name. In the last year, I've been called names by people who have made that kind of behavior, a well-practiced part of their professional specialty.

Speaker 1:          06:16          What I care about is the fact that the name is wrong, seriously wrong. You're engaged in a very important public debate, handled incorrectly. That debate will degenerate into conflict. When you make an error, willful or otherwise, you increase the possibility of catastrophe. I'm calling your attention to such an error. To put it bluntly, you are contributing to the dangerous political polarization, increasingly typifying public discourse. By vilifying my views and my character, it appears that you have done so either carelessly or to add some narrative punch to your story. Neither of these reasons are in the least justifiable post our email dialogue publicly if you'd like. Let the readers sorted out for themselves. If you want to stick to your guns, and then I thought and replied, that's okay. All Post the dialogue. Screenshots to twitter, which I've done. Steve Kovak responded, thanks for your help. The story has been corrected and without Mr.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Kovak went online and changed his description of both Stefan Molyneux and from, as I had mentioned previously, far right to the current description, which is right leaning, Stefan Molyneux and classic British liberal Jordan b Peterson, which I might point out is quite a substantial departure from the initial thought. Right. You might think I'd be pleased about the change and I suppose it's better the way it is then the way it was, but I'm not pleased at all with the fact that it happened or really with the fact that it was changed so easily. It's like it's not a straightforward matter. It's not a matter of no import to mischaracterize someone as far right, especially in today's political climate and it's indicative of what I would describe as loose journalistic ethics, uh, to put it mildly. To then be so willing to transform your terminology with no explanation to your reader and no apparent. Let's call it crisis of conscience or or serious consideration of the meaning of your options. Well, that's not good. Let's put it that way anyways. You guys can, apart from that commentary, which I couldn't stop myself from making. You guys can draw your own conclusions and then one last thing. I'm not exactly sure what to make of the alt right and

Speaker 2:          08:47          yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:52          and then one last thing. I'm not sure

Speaker 2:          08:56          what,

Speaker 1:          08:58          and then one last thing. I'm not sure how to understand the old right or to characterize it or even to know what to think about. It's hypothetical existence or my association with it, but I can tell you that I'm not in favor of people banding together in ideological groups and instead would much rather see people live fundamentally productive and meaningful and honest individual lives and in that manner be a light unto their neighbors, so to speak, to show the way to live in the world without undue ideological possession and to move forward things productively in that manner. I don't know of any pathway forward through this increasingly polarized political landscape that we find ourselves in that isn't absolutely rife with the possibility of conflict. And if I haven't made that clear so far, I would certainly like to make it clear now. So I would encourage those of you who are considering yourself say on the old right for that matter as well as on the radical left too, transcend your dangerous and impersonal ideological identification and start to live is true individuals in the world. Um, that's what I think and I hope that I've been communicating that. And if I haven't, well I apologize because that's what I've been trying to do.
