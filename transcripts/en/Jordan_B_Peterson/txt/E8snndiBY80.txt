Speaker 1:          00:00:09       Really,

Speaker 2:          00:00:21       you should have read by now. Well that little book that, uh, what's it called? Thought emotion and memory should have read the three or so papers in here. Maybe there's four of them. Four and also the first, well the chapters in this book up to the end of the neuropsychology section, which is basically to page 80. So that's what we've covered today. Yeah, sure. I showed you a simpler diagram of this sword last week and that's

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:08       The model of the known normal loud amputation. Let me show you a little cartoon here that I think is kind of funny. All right. So as far as I can tell that's a decent but simplistic model of what it is that you know, when you say that, you know, something with regards to its implications for behavior or its meaning, because remember, that's what we're, that's what we're trying to specify in this class, right? The initial introductory discussions hinged on the notion that when we map our environments as a consequence of active exploration, we mapped them for two reasons. We want to specify the sensory nature of the things that we encounter. And we also, more importantly, more fundamentally, perhaps not more importantly, but more fundamentally, we really want to keep track of where the meanings reside. Now this is coopera coded by something that we'll discuss to some degree today, which is that things aren't simply given in the environment.

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       I mean it's, that's the case with sensory things even although there's a lot of dispute about this. I mean that was coons fundamental point as far as I can tell him. His book, the sign, the structure of scientific revolutions in that what constitutes the object of objects seems to shift as we shift our techniques of exploration, which is why we have new scientific theories. I mean, theoretically there's something at the bottom of it all towards which were towards, which are ideas are approximating. But anyways, it's a difficult, it's a difficult idea, but it's much more clear in the case of our maps of meaning because how you approach something really does determine in large part, it's an effective significance, right? We can all, you can all see this fire for animals is dangerous, pure and simple, but fire for people is liberal, has been liberating. That's, I mean that's the most sort of the most dramatic example I can think of, right? You switched the motivational category of the object by altering your approach to it. It's dangerous if you let it burn you. If you control it, then it cooks your food and it heats your cae and et Cetera, et Cetera, and it's something I'll buy an alteration in your action. You've completely transformed the nature of the object, at least with regards to its utility and that's a big part of what we consider creativity.

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       Anyways. One of the things I've been trying to figure out is what's this? What is the structure of our knowledge when we say that we know something and that's this, the gnome and it's a bounded domain basically that's characterized by specification of the emotional significance of what's going on in the present, at least as far as that's interpreted and specification of what we would like to happen in the future and then the construction of motor plans to turn one into the other. Now I've appended or updated this diagram, someone from its original simpler form to show that, well, you were attempting to transform this into this things that you don't expect might happen, which is, and that's pretty obvious if you think about it, because fun expect that things didn't happen. That would mean that you knew everything and you don't know everything. So that means it unexpected things are always happening if you're undertaking a behavior that's designed to meet a certain end and something unexpected happens.

Speaker 3:          00:04:27       Well, hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       That activates a chain of phenomena that I described later that we're going to discuss today as the orienting reflects. But basically the bottom line is that anything unexpected is the UN in and of itself intrinsically meaningful. That's really, really important.

Speaker 3:          00:04:48       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       We don't assign meaning to things so much as we do restrict the meaning that they already offer us to it, to a specified domain.

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       And, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       if you think about that, that kind of reverses has a, as I've mentioned before, that reverses many normal psychological presuppositions, which is that we have to, that things are neutral until we discover it useful to them.

Speaker 3:          00:05:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       So I told you this story or you read the story perhaps about the guy who's thinking about his performance. At some meeting he's thinking about how well he's going to do and how he's going to dominate the meeting and so on. He runs and he runs into a number of obstacles on his way to the meeting, including an elevator that won't function and people who get in his way. And the reason I told the story in the book is to just to show you how this sort of thing operates in day to day life. It's a pretty boring story. I mean nothing particularly exciting happens I suppose until the end. Nothing exciting. Happens means only unexpected things occur, nothing exciting happens. Meaning means no emotion is released in the course of the story until the end because all of the things that are unexpected are trivial, unexpected things that all occur at the level of of minor lea plan.

Speaker 2:          00:06:13       So my guy is upset by the fact that the elevator doesn't come, but that's not such a catastrophe because he can always take the stairs and if someone's ahead of you on the sidewalk and you're in a hurry, while you can always go around them. These are pretty minor deviations and they're interesting and they do inspire a certain amount of emotion. But all they mean is that you have to shift from one sub goal to another. And then at the end of the story, well, events of a different magnitude to occur. And the idea there is that, well, the protagonist of this story that's outlined in the book, he's expecting a commendation for his performance in the recent meeting and instead he gets fired. And in a sense you could say, well, all hell breaks loose as a consequence of that because that information which can be easily denied, blows his whole world.

Speaker 2:          00:07:12       It isn't something as simple as an event that interferes with a particular plan, a sequence of behavior. It's something that demonstrates incontrovertibly. And this whole notion of the ideal future is impaired in some nontrivial manner. And that his viewpoint of himself in relationship to the world is dramatically and drastically flawed. Well, the thing is, you don't need to know a lot of the things that we've been talking about to start to make sense out of this thing. You know, that if you get fired from a job that's a catastrophe or something ochres to make you a really quick question, your own abilities or, or where you're going or, or where you've come from, that people find that very emotionally disruptive and well, the, the answer to, well, what does it mean by the fact that people find that emotionally disruptive is to say that well, things that aren't predictable have their own effect of valence and you render things predictable using a Schema of this sort. And if something comes along to blow your Schema, then all those things that you've rendered predictable with regards to your current patterns of behavior are all of a sudden unpredictable. And if they're unpredictable, most particularly, they're frightening. That's the first thing that comes up.

Speaker 4:          00:08:25       His reaction to the elevator and the traffic.

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       All right. Absolutely.

Speaker 4:          00:08:29       The distinction between, uh, uh, losing, uh, not the scenario now working anymore, like losing confidence in this scenario and losing confidence in himself as a scenario maker. I mean there seems to be

Speaker 2:          00:08:47       very, yeah, the perfect, perfect. Yes. That's perfectly reasonable be, is that a useful way? Because I was trying to go yes. Rotated. Just think it really different. No, no, that's a, that's a perfectly reasonable, uh, that's a perfectly reasonable comment. Exactly. The thing, think about Tom Punishments.

Speaker 2:          00:09:06       You know, we know that punishments produce pain, for example, they produce hurt. That's a, that's the effect of state, I mean formal punishments and we'll define what they are later. Um, the thing about people though is that we can generalize and, and in animals you can punish out particular patterns of action and human beings. You can punish out hierarchies of action right down to the level of the action that generates action. And that's basically what are the action that generates patterns of action. And that's what you're talking about. See if you really punish someone, then they lose faith in their ability to adapt. And well, when that happens, while you're depressed, well, you're not just depressed, be depressed, doesn't, you're not just hurt. Depressed doesn't just mean you're hurt. Depressed means while you're in pain. This is literal by the way, it's, it's not. It's not metaphorical.

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       About 70% of people who are chronically depressed have chronic pain syndrome, low back pain, migraine, et cetera. The two things look very closely related. Phenomenologically you also lose all hope, but what does that mean when all, we're going to talk about that a little later, but these aren't metaphors. Look, whenever you put in this box is a consumer Tory reward. It's a satisfaction by definition. This is what I want to talk about this a little bit more than the neuro psych section. We know about satisfaction, but there's four classes of motivationally relevant phenomena. There's punishments and there's satisfaction. Those are primary positive and negative reinforcers in somewhat archaic behavioral language, punishments and satisfactions, and then there's cues of punishments, accused of satisfactions and cues of satisfaction give you hope,

Speaker 2:          00:10:43       but they're always conceived of in relationship to some goal. You lose the goal. Well, you lose hope. That's what, that's exactly what happens literally. So if your goal has come tumbling down, and the thing is, the other thing you have to realize is that your goal is always conceived of in relationship to your conceptualization of yourself because you always view possibility in relationship to what you think you can accomplish. So these two things can't. That's why this is a system. You know, this cannot be conceived up except in relationship to this. And vice versa. You always construe where you're going with regards to your conceptualization of your current level of abilities and possibilities and so on. And you evaluate the utility and desirability of what you have currently in relationship to the best that could possibly be. So it's a system, it's a system. This is the known. As long as you're operating in this territory, you're aware exploration has already taken place fundamentally. So you're protected by your culture. That's one way of looking at it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:43       You're protected by your particular story anyways. That's assuming nothing really dramatically unpredictable is going wrong. So you referred to a scenario, so it would be right. Would it be right to say that whole thing is a scenario. I mean that's a story is absolute. That if that's something that that's a, we have a representation of it, then it's, and that's abstract. So in that sense we are a scenario makers we made. Yes. Right? Yes. And this is the thing that's interesting. I think one of the things that's interesting about that is that the scenario from a mythological perspective, that's the world. That's how, that's like myth from the mythological perspective, which is concerned with meaning and not with sensory qualities. The world is what you know, what you don't know, and the mediating process between the two and the mediating process, by the way, is what you were referring to because the mediating process is the thing that creates order out of chaos or upon occasion that turns chaos and door or order into chaos as well.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       It's the transformative process. Anyways. If you lose faith in that transformative process, that's the end of you. Fundamentally. I mean life comes to a halt and that's why, well as we'll find out many, many, many religious systems, if not all religious systems attempt to catalyze identification with the transformative process as their aid to the good life. Anyways. Um, okay, so this is a story. It's a story. The story is, well, things aren't so good now, but they're going to be much better in the future and this is how we're going to bring it about. That's just your straight linear story. That's a scenario and you have your particular story and do you have your particular story to the degree that you share cultures, there are some elements of your stories that are identical. So I was thinking the mark this other day, you know, like if you read in the newspaper that Congress is going to cut off funding to a cognitive psychologists who specialize in vision.

Speaker 2:          00:13:33       Then all of the cognitive psychologists who specialize in vision, to the degree that they share that story going to be threatened by that particular piece of news because it's interfering with their scenario. They're are going to band together as a group and they're going to do whatever they can to to Perry the threat. Now if you read that we'll all cognitive psychologists funding is going to be cut, then your reference group is all of a sudden expanded because you pulled in a larger number of people who share the presuppositions of your story and then you could say, well, if it was all psychologists, that would be a larger group and if it was all uh, academics, that would be a larger group and so on. And you can see that as, as the threats are more and more fundamental, the groups that are effected get larger and larger and well anyways because you're including more and more people under the rubric of the same story. If your country is under attack from foreign forces, then it's the constitution in a sense that's at risk and everything. That's kind of the trunk of the presupposition tree so to speak. And everyone's going to unite against that

Speaker 5:          00:14:33       threat or virtually everyone is going to unite against it. This is like a shared experience for normal adaptation, snare and can help. And thinking like people with anxiety disorders, like the ideal future would be to get on the elevator and know and that it would come and it would go down and there would be no problem with that. And that's the unpredictable, that's the big problem. Like so if the LDL number comes or they get stuck in the elevator or something, that's chaos. Like that's, that's the end. Predictable expense. So I was just wondering on this chart, like how would you map

Speaker 2:          00:15:08       oh well the, okay. The thing is is that any,

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:15:13       Phenomena have ambivalent meanings. And this is something that I referred to in the chapter. Neuropsychology, is it an event that can be construed with a particular motivational relevance from one frame of reference can be construed from a different frame of reference in, in a completely different matters. So let's say you're on your way to the meeting and you have an anxiety disorder soul, you're afraid of elevators. Okay. So the elevator doesn't come well with regards to the story that says, I want to go to the meeting. Then the fact that the elevator hasn't shown up, it's very anxiety provoking. And perhaps frustrating and punishing, but from fruit with reference to the frame of reference that says, well, I'm the kind of person who can't tolerate taking elevators. It's relief that not that the elevator not showing up brings about and then your neck motor output so to speak, is a function of the competition between between those two frames of reference. I don't know exactly how that competition plays out, but like virtually everything that you can possibly conceive of how has motivational significance is that vary with the frame of reference and you do this to yourself like you can look, this is really not complicated enough unfortunately, and I'll draw the map that we'll use later. This is just the note.

Speaker 5:          00:16:27       Well anyways,

Speaker 2:          00:16:30       this is actually more like how this diagram should look. You get the picture, okay. Now

Speaker 2:          00:17:02       these are more or less comprehensive stories and damage to the story can take place at any level of analysis. The higher up on the or the the more inclusive the place at which the damage takes place. The more behavioral adaptation is a rendered useless and the more phenomena are transformed. Once again back into chaos from, from from whence they came from the mythological perspective as you'll find out. Cause the next thing you're going to do is read the Sumerian creation myth and I tried to map it onto the kind of just descriptions that we'd been talking about, the Sumerian creation. I had a good dream about this last night. I'll tell you about it can benefit the Sumerian creation myth is particularly relevant because, well it's been said that history began in summer.

Speaker 2:          00:17:53       So in a sense it's the most ancient of creation stories that we have extent that it has been transmitted down into our culture along the line that our culture came from. Basically I dreamed last night that I told this class, although the class was like slightly different in my dream that we all have Sumerian skeletons. Just in a weird way of looking at what their point is. This, you know, it's only been, it's only about 5,000 years that separate us from the Sumerians and you had to take who are, you know, that's a long time. We have nothing in common with them. But there's a bunch of ways to look at that. Like that's only 60 80 year old men, so we're not, which if you think about that 80 years old and then another 80 year old man and so on, that's only 60 entire, moderately long lifespan.

Speaker 2:          00:18:36       This is nothing, you know, and it's nothing when the evolutionary perspective, because we'd been around as well as a, as a species. Exactly like we are for 150,000 years and something similar to what we are for at least 2 million, so like 5,000 tears. That's nothing. That's yesterday. We're still scenarios. When you read that creation myth where you want to think about it with relate in relationship to the things we've been talking about, the Sumerian say, well everything emerges from chaos. Like what the hell does that mean? Well it means it means most basically that everything that you understand comes from the domain that has not yet been explored. That's a chaotic domain cause he can't say anything about it. There's no distinctions drawn. Plus it has infinite motivational relevance. You can specify it. That's very chaotic. Ken. Those things that you haven't yet explored are simultaneously punishing, satisfying, and threatening and promising all at once and none of those as well. Anyways. So anyways, when, when I say things like, well, um, interference with a structure of this sort of reduces everything to chaos and that chaos is in some sense equivalent to the chaos that existed before the creation of things. That's what all that means is kind of the, you know, you just think about it as a metaphorical language, I guess.

Speaker 2:          00:19:59       Anyways, this is a better model. So, uh, you know, to use the university example, all cognitive scientist specializing envision would be here and all cognitive psychologists would be here and that all psychologists would be here. That's one way of looking at it anyways. Okay, so

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       recipe, yes. When you're talking to, you were talking about how much anxiety is caused by the absence of the elevator. Yeah. You're referring to it as a function of what your interpretive scheme is, but also how much of it has to do with a sort of more basic biological function of how much tolerance, I mean, given individual has or unknown. I mean that's a tough question. I mean it looks like there are all these, these four systems so to speak. Well that's the satisfaction, punishment, promise and hope systems. From the subjective perspective, they all seem to have thresholds for activation. So if your threshold for activation of your incentive reward system is low, it looks like you're likely to be extroverted. You're very happy and social situations, you smile easily, you talked a lot, et cetera. And that's something that's biologically determined. And the same with regards to your response to threat.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       You could have a high level, a high threshold or low threshold and you make dilla well, but then it really gets complicated because the problem is is that what you construe as threatening or promising depends on your framework of interpretation. Nobody knows how that plays into the biology. So whether those two things can be separated because well I think in principle they can be, because I think it would be possible. Say if I, if you and I both went into the lab, a lab, you could say, well, we're under the same, more or less the same set of precepts. We're governed by the same set of presuppositions in that laboratory circumstance. So say they give us both a goal directed task that's very bounded and uh, a set of phenomenal occurs and, and I get more, more anxious by physiological measures, then you do well, assuming that we've held the framework of reference constant, we might be able to say something about the intrinsic biological differences, but it's very, it strikes me as very difficult, isn't the interpretation.

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       We have pastors that are going to be dependent on what we imagined, how we naturally react anyway. I would suspect so. Yeah. So I, I don't know, like I really don't know the answer to your question. Um, I mean it's obviously the case that you can modulate the motivational significance of phenomena merely by shifting frameworks of reference. I think you can say, well, if you're very upset, save just a relationship you had is just broken up and you think, you know, while this is finally going to kill me. And so you have very temp temporally bounded interpretation of this, this is absolutely catastrophic and what am I going to do tomorrow? And then you think, well is this really going to mean anything in five years? And you know from that perspective like how relevant is this phenomena with regards to my five year plan, for example, it's relevance is going to shrink dramatically.

Speaker 2:          00:23:25       And you might say, well how much is it gonna mean to me in 40 years? And you think, well under those circumstances it dwindles to absolute triviality. And you can say, well what does any of this going to mean in a thousand years? And then you have an existential crisis. But the thing is, because you can, that's an, it's very interesting because you can modulate the motivational relevance of phenomena by shifting your framework of reference. It looks to me that paper by John Duncan, the first paper in here, me in a sense that's sweet. But he says the frontal cortex does, at least in part, is that I think, well, going back to the neuro psych, I think the near the frontal cortex says hijack the more motivational systems to give us increased adaptive flexibility like animals. Oh, this gets us into a big argument, a big disagreement about what constitutes an unconditioned stimulus.

Speaker 2:          00:24:13       You know, lots of behaviors think there are such things as unconditioned stimulus, which are just those things that you will respond to automatically. Like electric shock, you know, that's bad. It's anxiety provoking. While more particularly it's punishing if it's of sufficient intensity, it hurts. But the problem with that is is that you know, you can take a dog. Yeah. And if you give it food just after your shock, it soon, when you shock it, it wags its tail. Well that means that the effect of relevance of the unconditioned stimulus is at least modifiable by learning. And almost all I'm conditioned so called unconditioned stimuli, have that property. So, and we know that, you know, people, people have an immense amount of disagreement about what constitutes good goods. For example, like anorexics don't like food. And they starve to death. So it's a bad decision. But the point is is that even something as fundamental as food, the motivational relevance of that can be shifted by shift in the framework of reference.

Speaker 2:          00:25:12       So you can say, well the anorexic is caught in a situation where her unvariable present his, you know, my terribly fat body, although no one else might construe it in, in that, in that manner that's hers and her ideal future is I'm thin, thinner than anyone else and that there's an associate of network around fin so to speak, that includes beautiful, well liked, admired rich, you know, whatever the hell you want to throw in there. And in relation that makes food in relationship to the movement from here to here, something punishing and threatening because it interferes with it. So then it takes on the motivational significance of a threat or a punishment. And of course, well she still gets hungry. Okay, so there's going to be a heavy, heavy dose of internal conflict. That's an internal conflict. Means in part is you're internally conflicted about a stimulus. If it has one significance for one of your plans. And an alternate significance for another plan and you have an integrated the two plans into something that's into a higher order construction where there's no conflict. So that that's a problem.

Speaker 5:          00:26:14       You're saying how if you're too rude by your ideal future, crazy anxiety or if you're an, you don't have cause you sense of how the teacher and if you don't move. All right, is there some kind, and then even talking about about relativity perspective a year, four years, four years and is there such a thing as a balance because there's what four universally, what is enough of just sort of move you on?

Speaker 2:          00:26:41       Yeah. Well you know this is, this is one of the things we're going to hope cancer over the course of the whole course. I mean I said, well in a sense I said everything is relative because you can shift the motivational significance of phenomena by shifting your frame of reference. But also said that if you think food is evil, you'll start. So obviously there's those two arguments in a sense or in conflict. I mean it is possible for you to believe that food is a punishing item. But if you do believe that there will be certain consequences, like you won't be able to pursue any other plans because you'll be dead. So I'm interested in trying to resolve the argument that those two arguments are resolved. The problem that those two arguments set up on the one hand while we need to eat, although people can regard food as a punishment, on the other hand, you can switch the motivational valence of things by an with an act of will, so to speak.

Speaker 2:          00:27:33       So it strikes me that there's a high probability that certain phenomena will be regarded as satisfactions and we'll take on the aspects of consumer Tory rewards. One of those high probability items, for example, is food. You know, that's why I have a quote here. We'll show you this quote from Nietzsche. Nietzsche said, anyone who considers the basic drives of man, it's a very sophisticated idea. It's a 100 years old. We'll find that all of them have done philosophy at some time and that every single one of them would like only too well to represent just itself as the ultimate purpose of existence and as the legitimate master of all the other drugs for every drive one is to be master kind of attempts to philosophize in that spirit. So I've been trying to resolve this, all these dilemmas that are posing the dilemma, for example, that shock has this significance of an unconditioned stimulus, but it can be shifted.

Speaker 2:          00:28:31       It looks to me that what happens is that these underlying biological systems like the one that governs hunger, has the capacity to grip, to gain access to the representational system that constructs these futures. So for example, you say, well, you're basically doing your homework and you haven't eaten for a long time. So now your warp rating within a particular frame of reference. So you're, the action of doing your homework is a, it's a motor program that's part of a larger series of goals and sub goals, right? Graduation, career and all that. That's what you're busily pursuing, but you haven't eaten well. So what happens is that your attention starts to get diverted, which basically means that the system that's responsible for ensuring that you get enough calories has started to, has started to take control of the representational system and the constructs your ideal futures.

Speaker 2:          00:29:24       So you start thinking about food. It's like that's another, a fantasy that's making itself known in the theater of your imagination. And if you keep doing your homework and don't eat long enough while you're going to start feeling conflict because you're switching between these two control systems basically, and sooner or later in all likelihood, the system that mediates food intake is going to get the upper hand and you'll say, oh, to hell with it because that's your interpretation from the perspective of finishing your homework and you'll go to the fridge and get something to eat. So when nature says, all our drives a template, philosophize basically, see this is the way you fit. The reason I'm trying to tell you this is because it gets away from the notion of stimulus response because it's not, your hunger isn't driving you towards the fridge. It's not like it's gripping your behavioral output.

Speaker 2:          00:30:16       What it's doing is positive, a potential future towards which you can plan and it has the capacity to grip that future. That's Nietzsche's attempts of the drives to philosophize. So you'd say, well you think about this, so we defined pathology in this way. Often say, well if you're, if everything in your life boils down to food, that's your God. Say That's your ideal futures, you eating as much and as often as possible. Well then we would say somethings something is pathological about your scheme of representation or your behaviors. Something's pathological about your personality. While part of the reason we say that is because food is a good sub goal, it's necessary sub goal, but it's a bad ultimate master. While the question in part that we're going to try to address in this class is, well given that food saying sex and water and heat and shelter and all these other things are necessary sub goals, what would constitute the ideal master?

Speaker 2:          00:31:18       Well, you read this, you want to read this Sumerian creation myth with this in mind. So I say these are gone. So that's one way of looking at it. It's a little bit more complicated than that. Um, they, well, here's another quote. This is quite funny. I think too, this is from Eliana with regards to Sumerian mythology. It is true that man was created in order to serve the gods who first of all needed to be fed and clothed, not such a, you know, not such a foreign conception really. Well, the guards are construed as transpersonal processes that are eternal fundamentally, and a man mortal man is created in order to ensure that their needs are fulfilled. Anyways, of course, you're going to think at least some of you're gonna think that that's a bit of a leap. But it's quite interesting to read the, the Mesopotamian creation myth, and part of what it entails is hierarchical competition between the gods and the eventual victory of one God who's, as part of the movement towards monotheism.

Speaker 2:          00:32:19       And Marduk, by the way, is the one God who reveals himself as a, at the top of the hierarchy. And what more Martech represents is the capacity to explore. So the Mesopotamian creation myth based because Marduk it's very interesting. MARTICA carves tie mat up tire. Matt is a dragon. She represents chaos. She's also the mother of all things. Marta carves tie that up and makes the world out of her. It makes the sky, it makes the earth, makes the Zodiac. He makes one. In fact, one of this is very amusing, one of Mark's names cause he has like 200 names because actually he's a, he's a mixture of gods.

Speaker 2:          00:33:00       Mesopotamian culture was made up of a whole bunch of subcultures that mailed it over a long period of time. And all those subcultures had their own gods and they all got sort of mixed together to make Martech. So Murdoch had a whole bunch of names and one of his names, for example, was the maker of ingenious things from the combat with Tire Mat, which is very, very interesting. But anyways, the Mesopotamians figured out, although they didn't know they had figured it out, they figured out that the thing to which all these other drive should be made subordinate was the thing that was Marta and Martin was the thing that carve new territory out of unexplored territory because basically they manage to presume that if you didn't arrange your life so that you could constantly generate new information, everything would come to a halt. So everything should be made subordinate to this capacity to encounter the unknown and generate new information on it because all of the other drives were necessary dependent for their fulfillment on that particular function.

Speaker 2:          00:33:59       So it's, it's very, it's very interesting. It's once you understand, if you understand that, I think you understand something that's unbelievably important. That's part of the reason why I think I dreamt last night we had Sumerian skeletons because now there's more to it than this of course, because Marduk was also the ritual mortal of emulation for the Mesopotamian emperor, which basically meant that the Mesopotamian emperor was emperor because in a sense he was Marduk and only to the degree that he was Marta was he granted any sort of divine status and the emperors, the embodiment of the state, and of course our state now as a body of laws and not a, not a human body because we don't have a monarchy anymore. But the point is is that states only work too if they recognize that the property that Marta incarnated is, is the thing of most central importance, which is the capacity of the capacity for exploration. Anyways, that was a good digression. Alright, neuropsychology, but you have to bounce around these things in order to get a picture of them and now the question,

Speaker 4:          00:35:10       right, right.

Speaker 2:          00:35:17       Well they, well that that's the ideal solution at least as far as the Sumerians were concerned. And like we're going to explore the consequences of that solution as a solution because it has a whole, a whole series of important implications. It's a solution. Now I happen to think it's really a good solution, but we'll, we'll, we'll see how plays out. But

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       yeah, the thing is you're not determined so to speak because the stimulus doesn't control your behavior. Nonetheless. There are certain you are constrained, which is to say you have boundaries and I can say with a high probability in a broad variety of conditions, what you are likely to consider a conservatory reward. And I can say that because you're composed in part of specialized subsystems, each of which have a stake, each of which have their own job pluses, stake in maintenance of the whole unit, which is you. So they want what they want, but they also want you to stay around so to speak, because without you nothing happens. And that's what the Sumerians meant when they said that men were created to serve the gods. So the relativity is modulated by the fact that you have a number of competing tasks constantly to perform.

Speaker 7:          00:36:33       Uh Huh. So well that's why that's one way of construing it anyways. So question systems or these, can they ever, in cases of really extreme severe deprivation, can they directly grab control of the motor output or must they always go, they always affect behaviors

Speaker 6:          00:36:54       that, I don't know. I suspect, I suspect that there's probably, there's both operating like in situations that are so extreme that

Speaker 6:          00:37:07       thought would be an interference rather than an aide, then I suspect there's direct output. Um, but I, I can't say anything because that's the problem with trying to reduce the brain to one system of operations. There's evolutionary redundancy in the brain and often for a given type of response, there's more than one system that has the capability for that response. And there was some circumstances under which I suspect behavior is directed, directly controlled, but I think this is more relevant when you're trying to weigh potential alternatives. Like, let's say if you're hungry and thirsty and you haven't been engaged in a romantic relationship for like a year and uh, uh, your job is under pressure and you're not getting along well with your children, well then you have a whole nest of problems to solve and uh, an almost infinite number of potential solutions to those problems. And I think the role of the higher order critical systems is to modulate the fantasies that all of these underlying systems so to speak, might produce in order to construct the optimal outcome. And that's well here you'd say, again, this is a story I keep telling you. This is a story. Well, that's a vision of paradise. That's what's up here as the archetype of ideal future and a vision of paradise. Well that's the land of milk and honey, right? Where everything is bound to fleet provision where every

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       motivational system is, is properly addressed. While there's a problem with that viewpoint that Dostoyevsky pointed out and all of that, that is this, that well, if everything's perfect, everything's predictable and everything's predictable, then you're bored and bored. Boredom is not part of perfection. So perfection is not perfection and that's a big problem and that's not a problem. Hopefully that will be able to address. It's a big problem because it's a big problem because incentive reward, which is what the unknown producers, that's a cue for a reward incentive reward is a more potent driving force for people. I think. Then satisfaction and you think, think about this in with regards to your own behaviors. Like often those things say you have a goal in mind and you obtain sub goals with relationship to that goal. You're very, very excited. You actually attain the goal and it's nowhere near as exciting is participation in the process. That led up to the goal, which is to say you're more activated by incentive reward. Then you are by satisfactions and that's the thing about people. That's what we're like. That's why we like novelty. So static conceptions of the ideal future have an intrinsic

Speaker 4:          00:39:45       problem.

Speaker 2:          00:39:57       Well the problem is is that getting what you want is not enough to make you content because contentment is something that transcends the attainment of determinant satisfaction. So that would be, there's more to the story than the attainment of a goal that's conceived of as a final goal. And that has something well that, Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:40:31       Well no I think, I think you're making a valid point. I mean the [inaudible] and fair enough, I mean I guess what I'm talking about our systems that postulate like political utopian systems that postulate that there is a particular manner of organizing society that will provide a final salute, final static solution to all our problems. A lot of more or less simplistic utopia notions do in fact promise that like Marxism I think would be, that'd be a system that fits well into that sort of conceptualization. It's just reorganize the essential building blocks of society will inevitably produce a future that everyone will find ideal and that will be the final solution so to speak. So yeah, I mean if you know that incentive reward is one of the things that motivates you and and in a really profound way, again, as I've pointed out before, cocaine activates our incentive reward systems. People really like, okay, so the animals for that matter, Bill self administer cocaine. Until they die. They like incentive reward. We like incentive reward money is an incentive for example.

Speaker 8:          00:41:36       Bit.

Speaker 2:          00:41:37       Once you realize that a lot of things start, a lot of weird things start to happen because you say, well for example, a perfect world therefore would have to contain novelty. Now that's a strange thing to say because novelty also induces anxiety. So you've instantly said in the sense that a perfect world is also one that makes you anxious, which is of course not really in accordance with the kinds of things that we would normally consider a perfect. So

Speaker 8:          00:42:00       are you making the claim that ideal future is, is uh, is is a world of unlimited exploration?

Speaker 2:          00:42:09       No, not, not entirely Daniel. Because see, I kind of thought that in the past, but it's more a matter of balance. You say, well if this, if you can represent this as the known, which is the thing that's transformed necessarily by the appearance of novelty, it's also a precondition for the capacity to assimilate novelty. So you have to know something, which is to say that part of what makes you capable of exploring and assimilating new information is the fact that you're already composed of static structures of knowledge. So you could say the ideal has to therefore con be composed at least in part of a balance between what static and what's normal. So it isn't just exploration, it's also, it's also the security that makes known terrifying exploration possible and the security that gives rise to the skills that make creative exploration possible. So you get someone like Einstein, I think it was Einstein who said he could see so far cause he stood on the shoulders of giants. And that's a good mythological image because basically what Einstein said was that he stood on the ground that was prepared by his dead ancestors and that's why he could see so far. So it's a matter of balance and you know, that's what the oriental yen and Yang symbol basically states too is that you know, order is necessary and chaos is necessary. And the ideal is some balance between and that's where you're supposed to walk,

Speaker 8:          00:43:35       would that's, that's an eye that same uh, ideal mode of adoption. Yup. Which is answering, when you say ideal in that context, you're not talking about the box top runners.

Speaker 2:          00:43:47       No. Well then, okay, that's fine. Absolutely. That's why I said, well, in that, in their little story there's, there's a grammar of, there's a simple grammar of the story which is, which is the, which is this, which is, you know, this is your kingdom. Why is that or your culture? Well, you're a part of the same culture with someone else. If you share their story, it's as simple as that. And their story is the manner in which they have fixed motivational significance. Though I'm going to this including you as an on going in there and to the degree that you share that scheme of interpretation, they are, you are a part of that culture and that's because, well, it's quite straight forward. I guess that's it. If you and I share same vision with regards to the value of a goal and the means for getting there.

Speaker 2:          00:44:35       I can predict your behavior and you can predict mind knowing that you can rely on me and we can cooperate. So we've just drawn a magic circle around ourselves so to speak, that it eliminates the, the unpredictable and novel from our interactions except in very connected, very constrained matter. So you're a defined territory as far as I'm concerned. And vice versa. We are from the same culture and you can make very, you know, you can make very trivial distinctions within cultures. For example, we're both psychologists, but we're practicing in different domains. That could easily mean we could split it into some cultures depending on the event that's going on. Because if something threatened your room subgroup and benefited mind, instantly we fragment because our stories, what does the switch, so anyways, this is the law. This is the more comprehensive story because you have a story.

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       But then there's this story about how to transform your stories when that becomes necessary. And so this is a fixed story and this is another fixed story. You notice I've structured it so that this one's a square here in a circle here, which is the idea that this is the metal structure remains the same, but the details shift not to stage transition from the Piagetian perspective or a revolution from the Cuny and perspective. And uh, this is blown apart by the appearance of anomalous information. And you can think of anomalous information as the agent of chaos, particularly weird way of looking at it. But anyways, it's anomalous information that follows this structure apart. And in initiation rituals, for example, they catalyze this sort of transformation. I face you with something anomalous. I blow apart your story. You are reduced to chaos. But what does that mean?

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       Well, it means that you have all of the determinant motivational significance is that you have a fixed two events, including yourself and other people. That's all up for grabs again. So you're by turns, depressed, anxious, elated, et cetera. Your emotional systems are in flux. And the reason they're in flux is because the metal structure that kept them integrated has been destroyed. So you're now subject to the war of competing emotions basically. Yeah. So that's, that's a descent into chaos. And if it's an initiation ceremony, the members of your culture will give you a new story. Say this is the story for these things usually happen to men, but not always. This is your story for being a man bag. Well that's a new framework of reference that makes your new position now determinant. So then you're up here when you could say, well there are different ways of construing the ideal. If you're a patriot, you say to the degree that I identify with this, I'm perfect, I'm moral.

Speaker 2:          00:47:19       If you're identifying, that's one form of perfection and you can see the utility to that. Do people do that all the time? Even when they're identifying with football teams for there's a more profound type of identification and that would be identification with the process, with the capability to undergo this process identification with the capacity for transformation. And that, again, that that ties back with your earlier comment about viewing yourself as well as someone who's capable, not only of adhering to stories, but if generating and modifying them. That's a much, and again, well, I want you to read this next section on Marta with this sort of thing in mind because again, that's what the Mesopotamians positive as ideal. In fact, the k, the emperor of Mesopotamia, every new year when the year is regenerated, you can view this as the year, by the way, from the Mesopotamian perspective. Anyways, the king was ritually reduced to chaos and reconstituted at the beginning of every new year from the Mesopotamian perspective, that was equivalent to reduction of the world, the cosmos to its constituent elements and then renewal.

Speaker 2:          00:48:31       That's a comment that's the most common of mythological themes by the way. Okay. Uh, yeah, exploration is necessary because you and everything else is going to change whether you like it or not. Uh, then wouldn't, wouldn't be ideal, would be not necessarily active exploration, but exploration when you need to explore. Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. You're talking about the ideal is the ideal state that you are, the ideal future is wanting to make sure you're always actively, it's no or no, no, no, no, no, no, you're right. You're, you're alternative. Reformulation is more accurate, has its exploration when it's necessary, which is to say that you need to know what you know so you don't have to go looking for trouble necessarily or be an agent of change for the sake of being an agent of change. But if you detect an anomaly which which you do it voluntarily, that's the thing about how your brain is set up.

Speaker 2:          00:49:28       If something anomalous happens, you notice it. Once you notice it, then it's incumbent on you to alter your story, but it's not necessarily the case that you have to be actively going about that. While I would exhaust you, in fact, I think in some ways that's what happens too. Paranoid schizophrenia. You think this is, you might think that this is kind of another leap, but if you read graze article in this book, Gray has a theory of the neuropsychology of schizophrenia. What happens to schizophrenia is that novelty starts appearing over where it shouldn't, which is to say that the inhibitory structure that stops meaning from being experienced has been disrupted. So for the poor schizophrenia, meanings are popping up everywhere and meaning means this signifies something usually something threatening. It's something promising that attracts your attention to the poor schizophrenia. His attention is always attracted.

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       It's part of the reason that paranoid schizophrenia or hypervigilant and what happens to them is that I think is well if you, if something appears as meaningful to you, that activates your exploration system and that's dope and surgically mediated. Well that explains in part the hyper dopamine Nirjah, that's characteristic of schizophrenia and the hyper vigilance. But the problem with that is that if you're on all the time, you'll kill those systems. I think that's what happens to schizophrenia when they go into second stage schizophrenia, which is characterized by no flat out effect and, and uh, Parkinson light symptoms. So, uh, it's not so good to be on all the time. You know what's funny because a common, a common, mythological ideal is piece, right? I mean, and that would seem to be, that would seem to be specifically not upset maybe when you're here to to maintain peace.

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       Yeah. Yes. That's a, but then there's this the contrary argument. That's a perfectly valid point. But there's the contrary argument and I think this is an argument that the red queen and there wasn't wondering, I was, she said you have to run as fast as you can just to stay where you are. So which is to say that a static mode of adaptation is not, is no adaptation at all systems age all by themselves. So you have to stay very active in order just to maintain things the way they are. So what's, you don't necessarily have to be running, running all the time. I mean absolutely come to a sort of a peaceful existence with yourself and you're living in the woods or something. Yeah know and Y'all are in here and they were completely happy with it. Well you're not going to have to, you're not going to have to do a lot of active change in less.

Speaker 2:          00:51:54       Your situation changes or you change. Yeah, I think that, I mean it's a complex, it's a complex issue because you can also by expiration you can also produce a normal, he's, it's not necessarily the case that they just happened to you. So, but you know your, I've got no argument at all with what you say. It's a matter of balance. I mean the point is is that, well Egypt, Egypt for example, stayed stable for about 3000 years, which is to say that as far as modern archeologists are able to determine, there was a 30 century period where the fundamental substructures of Egyptian society state exactly the same. And the Egyptians were convinced as are many traditional societies, that change meant death. And you can understand that because any cultural innovation is all cultural innovations have the capacity to undermine the cultures that produce them. So many cultures off for restasis. But the problem is is, and three, because they think, well we have a good thing and that sort of play around with it. It's like biological mutations. It's a good analogy. Most biological mutations kill you. Can you think every innovation is in the cultural sphere and analogy to a mutation, but the one in every thousand mutations that doesn't kill you, it's necessary for the survival of the species. So it's a very strange balance. Does that, does that argument make sense? Does that didn't know what to you? Makes Sense. So

Speaker 3:          00:53:21       how do you explain things like marriage? Like why isn't the divorce

Speaker 7:          00:53:27       was seriously, or even if you love like a have a favorite song or like a rarity, the same person or decades that's got like that's gotta be boring after a while. I mean there's no,

Speaker 2:          00:53:38       maybe it does, I don't know if it has to be meaning you also have the capacity to shift frameworks of reference. It's also, right, so you, I mean especially with something as complex as another person, if you think you know someone else, that's only a delusion that you have about this, the extent of your knowledge. So if you, if what you see is what you have habituated to, then what you see is what you have habituated to, not what's there because you don't know what that other person is like. And perhaps they've fallen into the same damn game, which is they play out the rule you've specified for them. But that's your tough luck, you know? So that's, that's a good answer with regards to marriage anyways. So I mean with regards to simpler phenomenon, well you know, you can move from, from thing to thing and people do that. But so part of, part of the human capacity for expiration is also to see what hasn't been mapped. Where are you, where people think everything is understood

Speaker 5:          00:54:33       and uh, but her point, uh, brings up something interesting to me when you boil into chaos and then you go and then you go to any place, can you take part of the old system?

Speaker 2:          00:54:46       Oh, absolutely. I've looked, look with, this is another thing you want to read when you go through this next chapter because part of the, uh Huh. That Pharaoh, the Egyptian Pharaoh for example, who's a nice Mesopotamian emperor analog, although a little later down the historical chain, he was simultaneously the, the Pharaoh who had died and the new pharaoh always. And that meant basically that he was both ocirus and horace. This is how the Egyptians construed it. No, no, serious was the old pharaoh who basically was confined to the underworld. And Horace was the process that gave new life to the pharaoh or Cirrus who was confined in the underworld. So the new pharaoh was simultaneously everything that had already been learned, plus the process that allows you to make use of everything that's already been learned in a creative manner. So, hey, so of course this, that's why this is the structure is the same. So if this is composed of this, plus this, so which is to say that when you make, when there's a revolution in your thought,

Speaker 2:          00:55:49       what you use is everything you already knew, plus the information that has been in gendered by your contact or your assimilation up via normal ist information. So here, I'll just give you, this is kind of funny. I think this is often represented as a serpent, the serpent of chaos for the Egyptians. That was Adam and Adam. What was the most primordial of gods who ruled at the beginning of the time and who will once again rule at the end of time. So he's sort of the place that everything came from. It's a serpent anyways, when you can see, for example, the structure of the story in genesis of Adam and eve in this, in this little as well because, well, anomalous information, maybe I'm jumping ahead and man, I'll tell you anyways, anomalous information is often given a feminine form. So you'll see when we go through because, well, because anything anomalous, this is a hypo hypothetical state is chaos.

Speaker 2:          00:56:40       You can say it's, it's all the unknown that you haven't encountered. It can't say anything about that because it's not actually part of your experience. It's just a hypothesis about the source of all those things you don't understand. It's not those things themselves. When, when something anomalous actually makes itself manifest, which is to say that you're, you're, you're, uh, following your story and something unexpected happens, then something has something actually unexpected has happened to you. Well, it's in exploring that unexpected thing that you generate new information. So you could think of the unexpected that you experience as the Matrix of everything that you know, because it's the source. It's the source of everything that you know, you have to explore it, but it's still the place where information comes from. A matrix. I use that word because it said in the logically related to mother in any ways.

Speaker 2:          00:57:30       This is often given feminine feminine form. Yeah. The Matrix of things absolutely matters as well. Um, but anyways, so, well it's a complicated thing. The serpent gives the crude to even the story of genesis and producers of a complete collapse. That's the rise of self consciousness and the genesis story in Christian morality is the attempt to get from here back to here. Well in a sense that's, anyways, that's just, that's another example of how these sorts of things tied together. Let me just show you this cartoon because I might otherwise forget it. This is quite funny. This is, this is just a cartoon. It sort of illustrates how we do respond to things that we understand. Things that we don't know. The reason this cartoon is funny of course, is because you don't sit around the campfire at night and talking about the things you understand, right?

Speaker 2:          00:58:28       They don't have any motivation with significant steps. That's why you think you understand the tales of the note. It's also, it's also well in embedded in, this is also the notion that the things you have explored don't have a lot of effect of valence anymore. So they're not very interesting and it's unknown things that are interesting around the campfire and make it more effective to tell a story arc all around. Right, right. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Penn Penn rules around the campfire at night, right. Pans the God who lives, who lives in the forest and who causes panic basically. And uh, he's the God that inhabits the forest because the forest is unknown territory and unknown territory produces a seizure of ongoing activity is associated with anxiety. So,

Speaker 7:          00:59:24       so if you have this conception of the future, which is, you know, being perfect and happy and that has some goals of being successful and being an academic and being a psychologist and then something happens that disrupts you or your interest in or your faith and your ability to do cognitive psychology and so that, that particular style going, we'll get plunged into chaos. And you come back up with this idea of being a developmental psychologist. Right? Right. Absolutely. That without affecting your larger goal.

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       Sure. You just did it in that example. That's exactly what happens. Sure. That's fine.

Speaker 7:          00:59:55       I mean, does it, and can it ever happened in isolation, Justin and support?

Speaker 2:          00:59:59       Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Sure. And then it doesn't provoke that much anxiety. That's, that's why, well that's all the time, right? Like when all the time for the meeting and that's just a disruption. It was absolutely right. Absolutely. And that's a tree. That's the thing that's so neat about this and like a tree by the way, is a very, very, very common figure in mythology. The tree of life, for example. I really believe that's what it's referring to is this. It's the tree like structure that holds your motivational systems in check. So you can lose like minor league branches or you could lose things that are close to the trunk, which is a, that's a very big catastrophe spend you looms whole Schema is of actions in an interpretation, interpretations that whole entire sections of your experience in motivational check. So given that they have any priority significance, you're try to restrict that significance to some useful domain always when you're trying to do so, can you own it,

Speaker 7:          01:00:52       have adapt to things that affect some goals on some level, I you, because if you, if something happens that draws into question like let's say your most fundamental like the trunk of the tree, right? And you adapt from that or do you just,

Speaker 2:          01:01:03       that's part of what we're trying to address in this class. See, because you can say, well, the best story is the one that addresses the widest range of potential phenomenon, right? Say, well, mythologies, collect mythologies, distill the best story. So what we're going to try to do is to understand what the best story is because the best story is the one that has the largest domain of potential relevance. So you could say, well, what's the big problem? Well, the big problem for example, might be, uh, the fact of human mortality because that would be the, the, the anomalous phenomena, which puts the determinant significance of everything into dispute. So how can you adapt to that? Well, again, that's the question. Say That's at the bottom of Christian morality. You view it, I'm using Christian morality. Just as an example. If you view the rise of self consciousness, for example, one of the concomitants of the rise of self consciousness is the knowledge of death. And that the two things are very closely linked. If you're self conscious, that means you can conceive of your boundaries. That's what it means. And you have spatial boundaries and you know, they kind of bother you, but you can move from one place to another. So that's not such a big deal. It's the temporal boundary. That's the big problem. So the question is, well, can you adapt to the fact a temporal boundary? Well, obviously this is a very tough, very difficult question about talk. It's the sort of thing that we'll see. Part of what,

Speaker 5:          01:02:31       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:02:31       part of what I'm interested in trying to understand is why people get so horribly twisted as they mature. I mean, there's lots of reasons for it there. They're pretty much plainly evident. Like in many ways the world is a terrible place and there's sufficient reason all the time for people to get twisted off the path. And in fact, I think often it's more surprising that that doesn't happen all the time. Then it is surprising that it sometimes happens well,

Speaker 5:          01:03:00       well if you're growing up in a family that maybe doesn't have this normal adaptation, I've seen these things are, you know, caught up in stuff holds or maybe something traumatic happened that affects one of your fundamental Schema. That's prob definitely,

Speaker 2:          01:03:23       yeah, well the, yeah, but that in itself is not enough. Like I think that's it. That's a necessary but not sufficient precondition. So you can say, well, some people never like, if you're lucky you at least start here. Some people never bloody well even get here. They just, they were born and this is where they stay and that's terrible for them, but if it possible to stay there without being entirely insane, I mean because anyone who functions at all how good the Schema, because you have to have a go. I mean you are working toward something. I have no idea what it is. Not necessarily don't necessarily, you have to allow yourself the possibility that there may be something that you're working towards even if you don't understand what it is and that's the thing that you can hold on to in the darkness so to speak, something you don't.

Speaker 2:          01:04:04       That's faith from the religious perspective and he might, I'll, I'll, I'll get to you right away. You might say, well, what's that faith in the answer to that? And it's says possibility. He said, even if you don't know like this revolutionary adaptation, that's some, that's what this morning represents. You can say, well, this is an image of the hero from the mythological perspective to say, well, you may identify with that figure, even if you don't know you're doing it, which is to say that when you were here, you may say to yourself, well, it's possible that if I pay attention better things will come about. Well, I'm gonna say it's that what you're doing, whether you know when you're not, is identifying with the capacity to undergo this process. So then you'd say, well, even when you're in chaos, you still have a story. Well, that's true.

Speaker 2:          01:04:49       You do. But you don't have to like people. This is, this is the problem with notions like Joseph Campbell, for example. Most new age philosophy. They say, well, you know, follow your interests. Well, there's a lot of the, normally wherever your interest take you, that's perfectly fine. They say, follow your interest in. You'll get to hear, well, that's loaded. That's uh, uh, what would you say? A very over simplistic and naive conception of development. Because if you follow your interest and you hit a big anomaly, which you will, you'll end up here. And this is the, this is by definition, the most unpleasant place that you could imagine to me. And so it isn't just a matter of, well, things are pretty damn good now and if you're just real good, they'll get a lot better. It's well things or you know, however they are right now, I don't know how that, each person determines that personally.

Speaker 2:          01:05:35       And if you do what you should do, they're going to get a lot worse before they get better. So that's, that's part of it because you need an explanation, you know, it's like, why don't people do this? Why don't people pay attention to a normalcy information when it doesn't take that much cognitive work to realize that if you ignore something that's real, sooner or later it's going to cause you trouble. Well, why do people ignore it then? But it must be a reason because some interpretation is better than them, that's for sure. Even a bad one, that's for sure. That's for sure. Yeah, that explains a lot of the persistence of forms of psychopathology. So like you say, well, you know, when someone has, someone has a real cockeyed story and it's obvious to them that it's cockeyed because their story transforms almost everything into the determinant significance is off anxiety and pain. But they'll still hang on to that like a lifeline when you offer them an alternative story that would allow the motivational states of hope and satisfaction to emerge. Because even though this is terrible, this is worse,

Speaker 5:          01:06:41       I think it's at the new one, they'd have to go there right now because they're not being a hero. Like they're escaping. Escaping just perpetuates the anxiety. So if they're stuck in anxiety, pain, then

Speaker 2:          01:06:53       yeah. Well this is what, this is why I want you to read paradise lost because Milton's paradise lost is a description of, of uh, the, the feedback process that refusal to admit to a normally necessarily produces.

Speaker 5:          01:07:09       So question, is there a qualitative difference or a difference in the degree damage to the branch?

Speaker 2:          01:07:18       Well, it depends on how you look at it. Like though, if you look at it from this perspective, there's a qualitative difference because uh, damage to a branch would be damaged in here. It's just a matter of means. And then the qualitative difference, the qualitative shift would be damaged here or here. But if you look at it this way, it's really quantitative. And I think this is actually a more act by, by the way, Daniel Higgins helped me with substantial load developing this particular representation by talk. This makes it appear quantitative. And then the thing is you can, you could say, well maybe there's a qualitative, sorry, a quantitative difference between damage here and here, but there's a qualitative difference between damage here and here because anyways, that's how I, that's how I look at it. So it's a quantitative process that has the appearance of qualitative shift from time to, so

Speaker 4:          01:08:19       using this is a lot more difficult to handle. But I'm, I'm wondering why Maddie, if I'm part of the leap of faith is, is simply accepting that even if you don't understand what you're doing, you're doing it for something that the possibilities, it will still make you feel better. How exactly that maybe fit in there.

Speaker 6:          01:08:54       Well, often pain is bounded. So like let's say you're on, you're operating under a system of presumptions that always interferes with your interpersonal relationships. So they always end in catastrophe, but it's very predictable. The point of the story, remember the point of having a story is to render things predictable. Now, predictable pain is a hell of a lot better than unpredictable pain. And it is possible depending on your attitude towards anxiety, that predictable pain is better than unpredictable pleasure because the unpredictable aspect of the pleasure means anxiety. And then of course, whether you, whether where you would prefer anxiety to pain in a sense depends on how you construe your potential relationship to anxiety.

Speaker 4:          01:09:41       Unpredictable.

Speaker 6:          01:09:52       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:09:53       And that's,

Speaker 6:          01:09:58       yeah, it's intermittent reinforcement. Yeah. It's very hard to extinguish. Well, the thing about the thing about novelty, this makes it complex, is that it's an intrinsically, it's an intrinsically ambivalent stimulus. The thing is novel stimulus or not really stimuli there, their cloud, there were a class of stimuli and they produce both anxiety and incentive reward. So the circumstances of the problem, like the gambling d determined in large part, like whether it's incentive reward or anxiety that predominates and and that's very situationally situationally dependent. So in the case of gambling, this situation is set up so that at least for those who gamble, the incentive reward outweighs the anxiety. But they both produce it while a heightened state of arousal, for example. But lots of people won't gamble too. So that that would, that would have something to do partly with scheme of interpretation and partly with biological differences. So similar,

Speaker 7:          01:10:52       it seems it biologically that we respond more to it than to actual reward.

Speaker 6:          01:10:57       Well, I think that you can make an argument to that end. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:11:00       So would you say the same thing then for threat and anxiety versus punishment?

Speaker 6:          01:11:04       What would you say like, look, it's a lot easier for us to adapt to, to the fact of punishments. We just eliminate them like very rare that any of us are in pain, but it's not rare at all that were anxious. We haven't been able to do much about that at all. Partly because there's the existential aspect of anxiety, but whether, whether anxiety is more motivating than pain is kind of a moot point because it's situationally dependent. But it is certainly more difficult to rid ourselves of anxiety on any permanent basis. So for, for, for people who have already solved the problem of subjugation to pain and also the problem of most basic satisfactions and, and that that's the case in our culture, we're still very much governed and almost entirely governed, I think by anxiety and incentive reward. So there, it's funny because there are secondary reinforcers so to speak, but they're in some, in many ways, more fundamental than the primary reinforcers.

Speaker 2:          01:12:03       I wanted to go back and forth on for a second because I was thinking about this the other day and it, a board of them just doesn't make sense to me except in terms of not moving toward some goal or rather, because I was just thinking about this, if you're, if you're, uh, important, boredom is essentially results from being in a, in, in monotonous situation. But if, if in that situation you, you didn't have any, you didn't have any other goals, you'd be perfectly happy just sitting there. I mean I was just thinking if, if I'm, if I'm just sitting around, I'm sitting, I'm sitting alone in a room, in a chair with nothing going on. It's all only if that doesn't conflict with some other drive, like to go get food or something more complex or, or you know, I dunno, but only if it conflicts with some other drive. Am I going to be unhappy sitting there? Am I going to feel what people refer to as boredom. Yeah. Okay. Because otherwise if I don't, if I don't want anything in particular at the time, I'll be perfectly happy just sitting there, you know, if it doesn't conflict with some movement toward whatever ideal future I have, I'm going to be, I'm not going to be bored per se. Well, yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:13:15       Well here we are. Yes, we do seek out novelty. Absolutely. And that's partly because, well, it ties back with what I was describing earlier, is that if you have nothing better to do, seeking out some more information is useful per se. So not only for any goal that you, that you actually have, but for all conceivable goals that you could have. So if you're sitting around doing nothing, then that's worse in a sense. Then doing something new and generating new information on there was one of the, one of the most metal drives is simply to look for novelty so that maybe you'd be able to take sitting around for a while because I drive hasn't really kicked in, but you know, eventually door because you need a rest or eventually, but eventually you get restless and you'll go cruising around even if it's not, even if it's aimless, even if you have nothing particularly I did do just simply because of that drive. Is there just to cause trouble leaving often?

Speaker 6:          01:14:06       Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It's to produce, well actually it's to produce new information, I guess you could say. That would be the, that's kind of the, the final, that's the final explanation. So you will feed on information, right? Just like food. So it's not so much a question of not being bored is how long you can, you can wait before you get bored because you will necessarily, and there seems to be individual differences in that too. But novelty, novelty is very motivating and uh, well it's also, it's also anxiety provoking, so. Okay. Are there other issues or, yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:14:42       if I had, if I asked you what was the ideal future in the middle of the last century, you might have said that the ideal future at the cultural level, one that was that uh, the trunk of the tree, the all encompassing, the ideal future of that story. The answer might have been that it would have been identification with Christ or else it would have been getting to the new Jerusalem. Both of them seem, and the first one is the identification with Christ is the, the ideal as the way and the new Jerusalem would be a ideal as a static state, which may, which may be prolonged over time. And I came across, I came onto this cause I was wondering what, what, what's the implications for the ideal future if you throw away the five unconditioned stimuli as the unconditioned stimuli, because the new Jerusalem is the, is the five unconditioned stimuli

Speaker 6:          01:15:45       optimally dealt with, always

Speaker 8:          01:15:48       taken care of. Whereas the, uh, the Christ is, well that's a different one. That's, that's a more sophisticated ideal future. So what is the ideal future then, are there to decide?

Speaker 6:          01:16:07       Well, I mean it's, it's still a reasonable way of conceptualizing things mean you can look at it from a, within the system perspective, because there's a anthropological terms for this that I always forget and make an EP ethic. One means or within the system perspective. And the other means that between the system perspective and a well, so that you can construe your ideals either from within the confines of a particular story, if you accept the story or you can construe it in terms of always being able to update the story if necessary with the story.

Speaker 8:          01:16:36       This identification with Christ as the ideal future. It doesn't, is not surrounded by chaos.

Speaker 6:          01:16:41       No, no, no. That's not exactly, well, yeah, that's a complicated issue. It's surrounded by belief in the capacity to deal with chaos. If it arises in a sense that's what gets rid of it, or at least gets rid of the negative aspect of it so it doesn't eliminate it permanently. It just transforms it in a sense into something that can always be dealt with.

Speaker 8:          01:17:00       It's internal, so if you draw, if you the story, if you construct the story with identification with Christ as the ideal of future and you put a circle around

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       it, chaos is inside the circle. Yeah. Okay. I see what you mean. Yeah, well that, okay, that's a good point, Dan. Danielle. Well, that has to do with the, well, that has to do with put that whole scheme that if you were, if you can taste this as your model, what's your take Christ Cynthia, ideal future. Then that would put that, that whole diagram in yet another diagram. Okay. Yes, yes. Okay. Hey, yes. Okay. Hang on a second. First of all with regards to board of which we talked about earlier is the thing is, is that we know that that, that the problem with a perfect static state is that there's no novelty and that's a problem because all the incentive reward disappears. But if you want novelty, then you will then you necessarily take anxiety. So you could say, okay, so that's part of the argument. Then the other idea here is in part how do you deal in the final analysis with the fact that there are normalist events too, which you can't adapt like death. Well, the, the, the point that you're driving out in park is that if you got, if you think about

Speaker 1:          01:18:15       the

Speaker 2:          01:18:19       one way of looking at the ideal future is it's a place where there is no chaos, which is, that means it's permanently eliminated. Okay. Everything's predictable. Everything is random, unpredictable and theoretically perfect. The other way of looking at it just to say, well no, because that wouldn't be perfect for there. For things to be perfect, there has to be some chaos. So on the chaos might be the type, for example of this, of the anomalies that we can't solve. So then the ideal type of adaptation would be the construction of a mode of being in which the fact that there are permanent anomalies, even a very terrifying sort of makes sense and is acceptable. So hope so. And that's again, that's kind of, that's part of what we want to drive that in this course. I mean people find with regards to being twisted, people find the fact that very unfair and threatening and hurtful things constantly happen and that turns them against life because they think, well there can be no possible story, there can be no possible justification in which that category of events can attain an acceptable determinant. Meaning therefore life is cruel and unreal and unreasonable in its intrinsic aspects and deserves spot under those conditions. I can take revenge against it, which I think is what, that's a non simplistic explanation for anti social behavior. Because as psychologists, we tend to think about these social people, they like novelty and they like to break rules, but we never really get at the fact that they're like very hostile and very revengeful and they like hurting other people and so on. Because we don't know how to understand that category of emotions say

Speaker 2:          01:19:55       to, to start that sort of thing from happening. You need a story that says, well, yeah, unreasonable things always happen, but in some sense they're absolutely necessary. And what a story that's believable so that their effect of valence has shifted. So we'll talk about, there's this section later in this manuscript that talks about I then there's a section in the grand inquisitor or in the brothers Karamazov Ivan, who's an atheist, is talking to his younger brother Alicia, who wants to be, uh, uh, who's st like it wants to be a priest and Ivan as a committed atheist. And he says, he tells a bunch of stories about torture of children in, in Russia at the turn of the century. He says, I'm world, like there can be no god in the world like this. And basically what he's saying is that if you look around you, the valence of things is such to demonstrate unequivocally that things are meaningless in the final analysis.

Speaker 2:          01:20:48       And, uh, some people regard that that particular section of the brothers Karamazov is the most potent argument for atheism that's ever been constructed. And well, that's the kind of argument that you have to address if you want to deal with phenomena that twist people up. You know, if you beat someone and torture them when they're a child, it's not that surprising that they might turn against the world in regard to that something that should be obliterated so that, that, that might be the moral thing to do. So you need a story that can address those sorts of possibilities.

Speaker 8:          01:21:17       So are you, would it be fair then to say the pure asking us to, to modify our current state, our current view of the world, um, from one where we will do absolutely anything to avoid chaos into some, into one where we posit an ideal future which has, right. We'll do as the anything to avoid

Speaker 2:          01:21:39       as a necessary constituent element of it and can hopefully, and hopefully also that you will come to understand from the rational perspective why the existence of that is a precondition for the fact that there is existence. Because that's the, that's another thing that these mythological stories are very good at outlining. They say the cosmos is actually constructed of the division between chaos and order. If you obliterate that dividing line, then everything returns to this hypothetical state of no one being in which there is no pain, but there's nothing, there's nothing. So then the question is, is the fact that there is something, despite all its negative motivation will implications preferable to nothing? Of course. That's the, I think it was Khumbu didn't come who say that the only question worth considering is whether or not to commit suicide? Well that's the question. That's the same question is, is life in with its intrinsic limitations preferable to a state where there's nothing. Well that's, that is the bottom line. That's the bottom line question.

Speaker 7:          01:22:39       So I'd like to address this because I've been listening for the past hour or two. It seems like a lot, many attempts to, to reconcile an ideal future would just like a utopia perfect society or on Fox and static sense. If I just sit in the chair, when will I get bored with an ideal life, which is identification process or identification with Christ, which is not the same thing as ideal society.

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       Right. And somehow that those are not the same thing. Right. But that's what I hear people trying to do is to make an ideal society the same thing as an ideal life.

Speaker 2:          01:23:16       Well, people constantly confuse the state with the process. But this is also true as we'll see with, with regards to conceptualizations of evil because people presume that evil is a state rather than a process. And the state might be aggression or cruelty or jealousy or you know, we can list a whole bunch of motivational states that people tend to value negatively. So I say, well, you know, uh, people fight, people produce social conflict because they're aggressive and therefore if we can socialize boys in particular to not be aggressive, then the capacity for war we'll vantage, which I think is like truly an idiotic theory. But that's what happens when you confuse the process of evil with, with, with uh, what you make an idol of evil fundamental. And we say, well, it can be identified as this set of phenomena, which basically turns it into an idol.

Speaker 2:          01:24:11       Well, it's just as bad. It's just as significant a philosophical error as doing the same thing to good. And the reverse saying, well, uh, pieces good or happiness is good or contentment is good. It was, those are all context dependent evaluations. Sometimes happiness is very bad so to speak. Like if you're experiencing it well, uh, torturing someone else for example, which is certainly a possibility. So what we'll come to at the end of the lectures is a Mrs Taletha had slightly as a conceptualization, well if, if the conceptualization of good is the capacity to admit to the existence of an anomaly when it manifests itself and then to act accordingly, then evil is the precise opposite of that, which is not aggression or hostility or jealousy or anything that people normally sort of label evil but, but the process of refusing to admit that something has changed. So and you can say, well that leads to aggression in situations where it might not be desirable, it leads to hostility and so fine, but it's still a process, not a, not a state. So question

Speaker 4:          01:25:23       to the limitations, but actually not concerning it and still have something attractive.

Speaker 2:          01:25:46       That's why they like you see this in American movies very, very often. It's like the anti hero, the gangster for example, is actually viewed as a hero. Although his, his paths of action produce well, disruption and chaos, there's still something very, very attractive about that. So that's, that's one example of that as a, Yup. It's also the case that the agent that produces the disruption of this system can be viewed as something positive from this perspective, but as something entirely negative from within here, which is part of the reason you know, you know, people don't like geniuses very much. For example in science, no, there, there, there's a lot of resistance to truly novel theoretical formulations to truly creative activity. Well that we all presume like if we're evaluating how those in the past responded to creative genius, say like the Catholic priesthood responding to Galileo, we always make the presumption that we would have been on Galileo side had we been there because viewing the past we can take sort of a, uh, a higher order view point.

Speaker 2:          01:26:47       But the point is, is that for the Catholic priests who were stuck in this story, Galileo's discovery was the, normally at the highest order, it had catastrophic consequences. I think that's improper primarily because they actually misunderstood the import of the, of the information. But still from in here, Galileo looked like an agent of the devil. Now we would say, well, no, in actuality he was providing the kind of anomalous information that leads to this. But you know, I think at least in part thinking, oh, this is that the excesses of the Soviet Union could be regarded as the inevitable historical consequence of the process that Galileo set into motion because the Russians lost their Orthodox Christianity around, you know, in the late 18 hundreds that laid them wide open for an invasion of, for the invasion of rationalistic utopia notions and, and the death of the consequent death of 66 million people. And it wasn't as if the Catholic priests were entirely wrong. What Galileo had to say was dangerous in, in the, in the highest order has taken. It's how long since Galileo made his discovered 300 years, something like that. Does anybody know anyways? 400 years I can say.

Speaker 3:          01:28:06       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:28:09       Well, we all think that was just perfectly positive and understandably so. I mean, it's sad. It's sad that the real danger.

Speaker 3:          01:28:23       Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:28:24       Yeah. But you know, it's more complex than that because the Catholic priesthood and religious people in general ever since then have not been able to figure out what to do with Galileo was information. The perceived motivational significance was this is a death blow to everything that we believe in, and this is not trivial because as Nietzsche points out, clearly in Western society, at least our morality, which is our behavior, has Judeo Christian roots, has a Judeo Christian trunk, so to speak. If you chop off the trunk, then the rationale for the morality disappears. Now you might not know that and you might not accept it at a cognitive level, but that doesn't stop it from being true.

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       Now, I would say that the, the religious of Galileo's time in the modern times for that matter misconstrued the motivational significance of Galileo's discovery. I mean, because they were under the presumption that they're religious theories of the nature of the universe described the same universe that Galileo is describing. I don't think that's true. The religious stories, we're trying to describe how the world was constructed with regards to its implications for action, which is absolutely vital. You have to know that whereas Galileo was doing something related but different. So there they are conflict, a death conflict. Definitely conflict was seeing where one did not actually exist in sense, but they could scarcely avoided since the tumor had been combined right before previously. Right? Absolutely. It was inevitable. There wasn't any need to separate before. No and no methodology for doing so. So it's not surprising, but it's worthwhile to consider that some of the intelligence was in fact on the side of the Catholic priesthood in which is something we tend not to think about.

Speaker 6:          01:30:12       I mean they were at least for all of their flaws, which are the flaws of any organized system. They're on the side of a certain amount of stability, which is also necessary. So you can say what you want about the kind of stability that they provided. But the thing is stability always comes at a cost, always, always. So, okay. Um, I want to show you a couple of things. This is like, I would rather have the class go like this actually then for me just to outline during the lectures what you're going to be reading anyways. So we, I would rather use this as a forum for discussion of the issues that the reading brings up that would make it a much more participatory enterprise. So I got, what I would hope is that, you know, we could as a group get immersed in the material that we'll be discussing and hack away at it critically in, during the course of these classes.

Speaker 6:          01:31:13       I just want to end with a very brief summary of what I was going to discuss in part today. I think it looks to me like your brain is organized to react to the universe as if it's constructed of three things. And these are things that constantly are described in mythological stories of the nature of the world. And one of the things is the territory that you have explored and the other is the territory that you haven't explored. And the third is the process of exploration itself. And those, those, those three things you can regard as environmental constants, they're always there. As long as there's been human beings, those three things have always been there. And as far as we can tell, as long as they're human beings, those three things will continue to be there. That's right. Cause there's always things that you've mapped and things that you haven't, and there's always the process of doing the mapping. That's the world from the mythological perspective. And it appears to me also from the neuropsychological perspective. Um, I want to show you a picture, say from the neuropsychological perspective, you could construe us as specialized primarily for exploration and for the communication of the things of the knowledge that we've generated as a consequence of exploration. And to buttress this, I want to show you some diagrams of the representation of the body and the brain.

Speaker 3:          01:32:32       Nope. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:32:38       Here, that's, let me just show you where it is first.

Speaker 3:          01:32:46       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:32:48       This is the motor unit of your brain and this is the sensory unit, how the motor units is about half of your brain. And it's also the part that we haven't been able to figure out what does, we haven't been able to figure out what it does very well. Um, lesions in this part of your brain produce snow decrements in static Iq has, you will know if you read that paper by Joan Dunkin that's in the collection of papers for a long time. People weren't sure what this part of the brain does anyways. What it does is sequence abstractly sequence motor activity at least in part that's a big part of its role. This is the motor strip right there and damage to that part of the brain interferes with your ability to actually move your body and you could. This part which is the prefrontal cortex grew out of the motor strip during evolution and that provides a clue to its essential function.

Speaker 6:          01:33:36       As evolution progressed in that part of the brain gain in size, which you did in a tremendous to a tremendous degree, much more, he was, by the way, than any other form of animal. We became able to abstractly act and abstract action is very useful because if you can act abstractly, you can think your way out if novel situations without actually having to put yourself in them. And obviously that's useful because then you can get the damn information without getting killed. And you can also, you can also watch other people for example, and imitate them, which means you can get their behavioral wisdom without, without actually having to go through all the aggravation of learning what it was that they are encountering, what it was they had to. Well, they were formulating those patterns of motor behavior anyways

Speaker 6:          01:34:19       were specialized for exploration and uh, well let's take a look at that. This is how your body is represented in the motor and the sensory cortex. I want you, it's pretty similar really, but I want you to pay most attention to the motor cortex. All right? It's quite interesting because this is how what your brain thinks of your body in a sense from the perspective of you being a thing that can do things. All right, and as you'd suspect, well, what's a human being? Well, first of all, we're all thumbs. I look at that. I mean the thumb is bigger than the rest of the body by a substantial well, thumb and ham. They, that's the, that's what we are. And also Tom, that's the tongue there and face. Well that's what we're like. All right. Let me show you kind of have a better representation of this.

Speaker 6:          01:35:11       Um, oh, there is, this is, this isn't quite right does this is the sensory homonculus but you still get the basic idea. Okay. That's now the motor homunculus is even more exaggerated than this, which is to say that the motor representation throws even more weight on the hands and the face. Well that's our capacity to pick things apart and put them back together to manipulate the world. And this is our capacity essentially to communicate. You can't see the tongue representation in here, but we're creatures who are specialized to encounter things that we don't understand and to make of them something that we want, which is not the same as exploring them by the way. Precisely that we have another kind of a cockeyed notion about what expiration means. We tend to think that when we explore something unknown, we discover its properties. But that's a strange notion because usually what we're trying to do when we explore something is not so much discovered the sensory properties of something, but to turn something that has indeterminant significance, which means it could be threatening or promising into something that we can, that we can either ignore or use.

Speaker 6:          01:36:26       And well, you'll have to think through that argument I guess on your own because we don't have enough time to discuss it. But the point is, is that the universe that we inhabit is not entirely given. It's also something that we erect as a consequence of our actions. And there's um,

Speaker 3:          01:36:41       yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:36:44       which is to say that it's the process. It's the process of exploration, which is in large part linguistically mediated that brings into being the world that we regard as familiar and the world that we inhabit. And that's why, for example, in, well, I can tell you for example, in the Sumerian, most primordial of Sumerian creation myths, there's a god goddess sort of of indeterminate sexuality that represents chaos, who's divided into the male sky. And the female earth and who is separated. These two daddies are separated by the god of the atmosphere. So you could say, well again, from the Sumerian perspective, the universe is composed of the primordial chaos, then a masculine principle that in this mythology is represented by this guy and a feminine principle that's represented by the earth and the process that separates them or distinguishes between them. And that's the god of the atmosphere. And that's, that's a,

Speaker 6:          01:37:45       that's a wholly triad, basically father, mother and divine son. In Christianity, there's the doctrine of the logos, which is the word and the word is the thing that in gendered creation and the, the, the derivation of the logos, while the idea of the logo schools all the way back through Egyptian society into Mesopotamian society and reflects people's intuition that there was some integral relationship between the nature of the world as we inhabited and the process that generates that world in the context of exploration. So the myths say the capacity for exploration is a function of that which already existed. And simultaneously the thing that brings both chaos in order into being, so it's both, it's the offspring of chaos and order and the thing that creates them that we're not used to thinking in causal loops like that. But well, mythology could care less whether you can understand it.

Speaker 6:          01:38:39       That's basically the bottom line. It's just a representation of in a sense of the way that things are. So, uh, that x except even more exaggerated. That's what we are from the perspective of our brain. And you say, well, this might you think this might be a trivial, uh, a trivial statement. For example, you know, I just picked the motor strip in the sensory stuff. That's not a very big part of the brain, but you have to realize that the prefrontal cortex is the thing that provides abstract programming for the motor strip. So the prefrontal cortex is concerned with the programming of movement and the sensory cortex well is mostly taken up by the visual system.

Speaker 6:          01:39:19       So this is, this is a good picture of who we are. And I want to extend that argument by pointing out that people have made much of the supposed intelligence of dolphins and whales. And the reason they'd done this is because, well, your intelligence is dependent on part, on the area of the gray matter of your cortex. And we have about a meter of gray matter. If you spread it out on you, spread it out in a sheet, um, the more gray matter, the more intelligence roughly or new, or you could say the ratio of brain tissue to bodyweight. That's the encephalization. Quotion is a rough estimate of animal intelligence and dolphins have very high encephalization factors and tremendously convoluted cortex, isn't it? So people think, well, they're extraordinarily intelligent, but this, this is simplistic thinking as far as I'm concerned. Unless dolphins are doing something that we just can absolutely have no conception of, they don't have hands.

Speaker 6:          01:40:11       And that's a, that's a nontrivial difference because it's the hand that makes us in large part who we are, its primary exploratory tool, right? It's the thing by which we construct the worlds that we live in. And I don't mean this in the mythological sense. I mean it just makes us able to build tables and houses and so on and to modify to modify the environment to suit, to suit us and dolphins, whatever else you might want to say about them. They don't do that. And that's a non trivial difference and it's the difference is immense and all you have to think about it for a few minutes to to realize that well the snake, does anybody have any idea what the hell they're doing when all that brand? Not a lot that they can the same very complex songs and they also seem to use some of, well I don't know how that's how that's attached to the intelligence.

Speaker 6:          01:40:58       No is the answer as far as I can tell. So they are very intelligent. There's no doubt about that. You can teach dolphins to do lots of things, but you have to, you have to realize that your brain is not a disembodied spirit. I mean it's integrity attached to your body. In fact, you might even regarded as part of your body. By the same token, your body is the environment to which your brain has adapted and vice versa. And the fact of the structure of your body is, is very relevant to how your brain functions. And it's obvious that a dolphin and human being are very different in terms of morphological structure. It's not like they just have two brains that are the same, that could easily be transposed at the structural level. The, the organs are much, much different. So we're specialized to tear, tear things apart and put them together and to tell other people what we've done.

Speaker 6:          01:41:49       That's what we're like say, say well that's the process of exploration and that's the thing. Well, in a sense that's also the thing that mythology tells us that we should be doing at least when it's necessary. Now the other, there's another reason why I brought this up. And that's because art of the part of the question that sort of underlies this course is, is it possible to come up with a definition of what constitutes the good life, that source of stable across different cultural presuppositions? And, but one of the things that's quite interesting as you know, is that novel phenomenon are cues for satisfactions, which makes them incentive rewards and incentive rewards make us feel as good as we can feel fundamentally. They also have very analgesic properties, which is quite interesting. Cocaine is a profound analgesics and that basically suggests that, well, you're involved in the voluntary exploration of novelty from the aspect of perspective.

Speaker 6:          01:42:43       Your brain is functioning in a sense at its optimal level, at least from the effect of perspectives you're interested in things and you're also relatively immune to, to pain. So he can make of that what you want. But I mean we can just lower this, you know, down to a more pragmatic level of discussion, you know, perfectly well from your own experience that if you're involved in something you really find interesting that uh, well that's about as good as you can. That's as good a feeling as you can possibly hope to generate. I mean, basically what people tend to do I think is arrange their lives so that everything else feeds the possibility of them doing something that they really want to do. Although people will sacrifice that often because they are afraid. But, uh, well the reason I'm bringing up this discussion is because it has employee, well, it has implications for all sorts of things. And um, it's also curious, and this is something you might want to think about because it really, it's very strange for me. I think that the world that myth describes, so let people would say, look, if you had to make a distinction in terms of the description of reality between the scientific

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       description and the mythological description, while there's no contest, the scientific description is the description of the world and there's lots of evidence on that. To that end, right? I mean, science is a very poor, powerful technique, but the peculiar thing is, is that you would also say, say as an evolutionary biologist, that the world to which your brain has adapted is the real world. And from my perspective, the world that your brain has adapted to is the mythological world because your brain construes things as the territory that you've explored, the territory you haven't, and the process that mediates between the two. And you can see why that might be. If you think about where danger exists, for example, hello, I'll close this with one interesting fact that I learned long after I had figured out that

Speaker 2:          01:44:44       that tough people identify those from different cultures as agents of the unknown. The Egyptians, ancient Egyptians would not let foreigners into their temples because foreigners, we're agents of chaos and the temples were microcosms of the entire state and they didn't want the state disrupted by the presence of foreigners in the temples. Know. Lots of religions still construe the world in that matter today. I mean, think of marriage restrictions for example. But that's one interesting thing. The other interesting thing is that the Egyptians, and it wasn't just the Egyptians, he actually identify five cultures that did exactly the same thing. They use the same symbol for the dragon that ate the sun at night

Speaker 2:          01:45:27       and for foreigners for barbarians that an inhabited, unexplored territory and the dragon that ate the sun at night, by the way, it was the dragon of chaos. The daddy that rule prior to the division of the cosmos into chaos and order. So you could say human human word has a natural category. And that category is the category of all things that have yet to be explored. That's the unknown. And the unknown has a priory, motivational significance. It's frightening. But it's also interesting and it's, it's natural to us to not to associate foreigners with that category, but to presume that they occupied the same domain, which is even more fundamental. It's not like the Egyptian stock foreigners chaos equivalent. What the Egyptians thought was that these two things were the same thing. They hadn't yet been distinguished. It's more fundamental than a mere association is that the foreigner is the ancient of chaos. And that basically means that your response to the foreigner is going to be integrally tied into the manner in which you approach chaos as part of your, as part of the nature of your being. So your attitude towards the terrible unknown is the same as your attitude towards the stranger. Oh, that's something to think about. All right, well questions.

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       Oh, um, okay. What exactly do you want to know? Look all I'll tell you about it. Generally. I want you to pick something that is interesting to you. That's, and it's relevant to the topics that we've discussed in the course. And those are the two major criteria. Um, I don't just want a summary of what we've discussed. I want you to take what we've discussed and apply it to a problem that you find compelling.

Speaker 7:          01:47:20       MMM,

Speaker 6:          01:47:24       yeah. That's basic. I mean that's basically the bottom line.

Speaker 7:          01:47:27       MMM.

Speaker 6:          01:47:30       During the next class. Yes. Yeah. The dates are screwy on the syllabus, but the class times when they're supposed to be handed in. That's right. So next class is class four. It's going to summarize really quickly the way you just said in like two sentences. Okay. So the world is set up into, for us as a known, the unknown and the process which, which, which mediates between the two. Right. What we do after that process then is to, they will think is something we use in that process and things that we don't use for that process. Well, that the latter part of that isn't quite right. Basically what we're trying to do when we explore the unknown is to manipulate the things that we encounter so that they take on the effect of significance that we want, which is now what people would normally say as well.

Speaker 6:          01:48:18       When we explore something, we discovered their properties, but that's not exactly right because the properties of something depend very much on how you approach it, which is the example I used with fire and you say before people had mastered fire, it was something unknown and dangerous. Mastering fire means erecting a sequence of behaviors in the presence of fire that allow the fire to shift motivational category from intrinsically interesting and threatening to useful in some determinant manner. So when that's what we do when we explore, it's where assigning us fixed domain of motivational relevance to something that only exists as possibility. And we're doing that by rearranging our behaviors. That's what adaptation means. So you can see this too. For example, if you're trying to adapt to the presence of another person, the other person is a very complex and you can say, well you, you explore someone else, you get to know them.

Speaker 6:          01:49:12       But really what you're doing when you explore someone else is in large part matching your behaviors. If you, if you like the person matching your behaviors to their expectations so that in your presence they only manifest those phenomena that you want. That's exploration. It's not mere evocation of all possibilities. Like if I want to get to know you, for example, one of the things I probably won't want to know is how you react. If I put a knife in your foot. That's, that's one category of the phenomena that compose you that I'm not interested in eliciting. So it's not random. Our exploration is not random. We're attempting to transform what has in determining significance, which means meaning into something that we want, not something we expect, something we want. That's what they, that's what adaptation means. So most things I just tried to be neutral.

Speaker 6:          01:50:06       That's true. But that's, I would say in the sense we want lunch. Well that's also a failure because it's better to transform something into a satisfaction or a promise that into something irrelevant. Although that's the way that thing most things end up. So it's the best kind of failure, but it's still a failure. You know that because it's often the case. For example, if you're conducting an experiment, you define something as irrelevant and 10 years later someone else comes along and says, well no, that's not irrelevant if you treat it this way, it has this set of possibilities and well you know, so irrelevant is a dangerous categorization as well. Cause it probably, it may mean that you've overlooked something important. So I know that's how things turn out and you can understand why and all that. But still really successful adaptation means you turn possibility into desired actuality. Can you do that by rearranging your behavior or your scheme of representation? That's

Speaker 7:          01:51:01       so okay. And one of the other classes you told us a story about, um, it was talking about the drive that we have to explore new things. And you said like babies will fight for the chance to explore a toy on the floor they've never seen before. So they're not fighting for the toilet or fighting for the chance to be the one to explore it. And I was wondering how, well, how does that kind of change when you get to a level of an adult or a culture or something? And how has that affected by, well, I guess you'd have to know this is a presumption, but if it seems that we're running out of objects and things to explore, like aside from space, I mean we don't know.

Speaker 6:          01:51:36       No, I would say that's a presumption. We're not running out of things to it. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:51:40       yeah. No, I think the nature of the things that we're, that we have to explore is changing in some way. I mean it's like what we can explore now is more likely, I don't know, like the properties of the ocean or like we can fight about it appears to explore it now. It appears to us that that's the case. More of an idea. I mean, I mean it's, we recognize it as more of an idea. Like let's say that, you know, if rushton psychologists are studying one thing and American psychologists are studying, you're not as likely to physically fight over that as if we're fighting over the country or a territory or something that we can conceive as the object. It's like we're running on an object and we're thinking of more ideas. And even in the case of space, it seemed that we saw space. There's more of an abstract idea because space is something that it's not very likely to, to be, um, a dangerous unknown to us unless we go into it. So as long as we stay where we are, we can think of it as an idea rather than as a place. And so we had, you know, this little space race, but it wasn't, it didn't seem to be as, we didn't get as involved in it as we did in previous conflicts.

Speaker 6:          01:52:42       Well, okay. There's a lot, sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 7:          01:52:46       And through that, our environment is much more constructive. I mean, as much less that we have to worry about and mean we're exploring more of our own construction and you're billing, for me it's more of them because you don't know all the implications of that change sort of title anyway. I mean not to look at your lifespan and that the position that you're in right now, you're in a position where people try very hard to make everything was predictable for you as possible so you can focus on ideas, but that may not be what your life is like.

Speaker 6:          01:53:16       And it also may seem that in comparison to things that have been discovered in the past, the things that we're exploring right now are more subtle. But I think that's only because we have the advantage of viewpoint on the past to us because of those things have already been explored. They seem obvious. But to the people that we're exploring them, when they were still undefined territory, they were as obscure it to them as the things we explore art us with this mysterious. So yeah. Yes. Which is to say that if you answer a question, you answer a question, but you generate to new problems as a consequence. It's like the introduction of the computer.

Speaker 7:          01:53:50       Well, it seems like the things where it's going now are things that we're not as likely to see it as a competition for resources. Like if I want to study something, it doesn't mean that the other person can't study it. It's sort of like you want to own America, you have to fight the other countries and keep them away from it. Otherwise you can't be the one to the sport. But if people want to explore, you know, psychology, you don't have to keep other people from doing it. Oh yeah. Did your education, like other countries think academics is extremely competitive because you don't want somebody else who told us your idea. You want to be the one to define the terms to set the day with. The questions are, does that transcribed into the conflict? Do you actually try to keep them from studying it or is it just that you, you hope that they don't see? I mean, are we having cross generational congregation the, we don't fight each other, but we, yeah, but we do fight too. Yeah. But also has or cultural generalizations. The level at which is actually my skill level of the individual. Some people work with another country over. Those things are just over oil.
