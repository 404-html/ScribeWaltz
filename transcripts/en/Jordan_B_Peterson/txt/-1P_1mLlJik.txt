Speaker 1:          00:43          Right, no, it was like, ha ha ha,

Speaker 2:          23:52          please reasonable opposition. It's best to let the unreasonable opposition speak because they manifest themselves as unreasonable and then everyone can see it. So that's part of the reason that you want free speech because you want people. Oh well, at least the last, the back leg, Dr Peterson. No one's security can't help no matter what their job, no matter what they do, they're wrong. They're wrong. Cause trouble for any students, no matter who the students are, what you're doing there. Just about horse take care of themselves. All right, so I can tell you a little bit about why I opposed to build seasick and there's a variety of reasons. I think the most, isn't it? It's the first piece of Canadian legislation that's ever been put forward but actually requires people to use the particular center works. Now there is other legislation that does govern to some degree what you can't say.

Speaker 2:          25:26          So for example, you can't incite and crime and that's perfectly logical, reasonable restriction on free speech, but we've never had a piece of legislation ever that would require you to use a certain kind of vocabulary and regardless of what it is and the fact that it happens to be about transgendered terminology hypothetically is almost beside the point as far as I'm concerned, it's all focused on this, on a focused, on this particular issue to focus on some issue, but this isn't the issue that's at the bottom of it. It's just that complex things manifest themselves in very particular locations and this just happens to be the location that this is manifesting itself here. Now the other thing that I really didn't like it still don't like about bill cc is the surrounding policies that are basically part of what it's embedded in that were produced by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, which I think is an appallingly dangerous organization, not at least because they're terribly muddy thinkers.

Speaker 2:          26:26          One of the things, one of the things that's happened, but I think from a psychological perspective, is there anyone terrio soon likely in Canada. We're going to write into law an idea of identity. It's just radically insufficient. So let me give you some examples. So the way that bill see 16 is currently coordinated. If you take into account the surrounding policy documents, there's a. there's a proposition embedded in the law and that is that biological sex, gender identity, gender expression and sexual preference vary independently and the fact of the matter is that's not true and you can demonstrate it very straightforwardly. The first thing you observed is that virtually everyone whose biological sex is either male or female, has a gender identity of male or female. In fact, the the people who go into that category, they exist. There's no doubt about that, but they're very small minority.

Speaker 2:          27:29          The reason I'm pointing out with the minority because makes the claim that those things very independently and then you know to that most of the people who have a binary biological sex and the binary gender identity also present themselves in a manner that's the same as their gender identity in their biological sex. And so that's another indication of the non independence of the three layers of purported identity. And finally, you can see too that the vast majority of people, for example, men who are biologically male, who present themselves as male or who identify as male present themselves at male, are also heterosexual. Ninety five percent of the perhaps 98 percent of them depends on the statistics, but we don't want those. That event now, I think he is on top anyways. The reason that I think that this is a problem is because it's written into the law and the law isn't the place where you debate those sorts of things.

Speaker 2:          28:47          You don't instantiate a particular philosophy into the law, especially one that's predicated on what I would say it's. It's absolutely incoherent and not only that, like even if you're thinking about it from the perspective of someone say who's who's homosexual. One of the arguments that people who are gay very frequently used, if there's actually the biological underpinning to their homosexuality, what we're going to dispense with that, but what happens if we dispense with that? What happens if we dispense with the idea that there's a biological underpinnings of homosexuality that mean that it can just be changed and what are people gonna do with that piece of information except trying to change it. The people who are who've been fighting for homosexual rights for the last 30 years very frequently made the case that the reason that the rights were necessary was because there was a reality to the condition. Well, I'm not arguing for that or against it. What saying is that the law, the way it's currently constituted makes arguments like that completely invalid. It does the same thing with transsexuality and which are we don't know enough about to. We don't know enough about it to determine, say it's its manner of causal origins now it looks to me like, like I think it's premature to exclude a biological component and especially because of what we know about how gender identity and biological sex are instantiated in utero. So we know

Speaker 3:          30:08          it's an apple, that the standard human fetus has a female morphology. It doesn't matter whether take six weeks and then it's transformed into a male morphology with testosterone. Right, so the reason I tell them, you save your breath, we got all night. The reason that I'm telling you this is because there's no reason. There's no reason whatsoever you can presume that the laws are being put in place to protect the people that these laws are supposed to protect. Anything that remotely and as I mentioned when we were in the hall, talk to you about the letters that I've received from sexual abuse, terrifying about all of this. The vast majority of them don't want to be as invisible as everyone else wants to be.

Speaker 3:          31:37          Noisily by people who want to speak for them. So one of the things we really have to get over in a serious idea that just because you're talking to someone black or white or color, you're a member of a homogenous try and get the opinion that they happened to have the opinion that all those who are like them, there's nothing that's more racist than that assumption and I can predict everything that you are and everything that you think. Lots of terrible thing to believe and it's awesome. Patently untrue. You know, there's no reason to assume that any group of people who don't fit into traditional society for some rea or any more homogenous in their general makeup and your political views than any other group. In fact, all evidence suggests precisely so. Another thing I really don't like about it.

Speaker 3:          32:54          Talk about why it's important to be able to have this discussion. Well, I can tell. I can tell you these tends to shut people down or being made because you need to know this. So as far as I've been able to determine, this kind of protest is an expression of a philosophy that's grounded partly in postmodernism. Pardon me and Marxism. The postmodern element is basically this. There was no such genuine individual identity is this identity and you liked it or not only have the interests of your group and the whole world is nothing but a battle ground between groups of different interests. There's no dialogue, there's no parking between the groups. It's just a power stage. Combat has to take place, and so the reason that speakers with whom the radical postmodernists and the Marxists don't agree or deny the platform was because most people do not believe from a philosophical position. The dialogue can bring consensus and all that's left. If you forgo that particular principle, this is only where it start. You know the fact that you're all pretty damn setting. Thank God for that because if there were enough fools in the crowd, especially those who are intent on violence, this would turn out very differently. We do not want to go down that pathway. It's a big mistake. We've been down that pathway many, many years.

Speaker 3:          34:58          I would certainly not conformed to a consensus that was against my belief merely because it was a consensus in the group is wrong. The question was, if there was a consensus against my beliefs, what are you going with them and answer that would be well first it would depend on what my conscience said. What are we going to assume that the consensus is correct? The Nazis had a consensus, right? The individual has a conscience and you have to know when the group is made a mistake.

Speaker 4:          35:49          Jordan talked a lot in your personality clause, very confronting your shadow, your shadow. Do you find that people who care less about what other people think and care more about their conscience have integrated their shadow maybe more than people who care more about others?

Speaker 3:          36:09          Can you hear me at all? So there was a question. The question wise stemming from my personality class, I think that people are willing to abide by their are those who have integrated their shadow and I would say yes because you have to be a bit of a monster to stand up to the crowd, right? If you're too concerned with people to you and if you're to avoid conflict, then you're going to cave to pressure and you don't want to do that because if you let people stop you from moving forward, you just end up being something. And if you have someone who stopped, you've got no life in you and that's no good. So you have to get tough, but you have to give tough in a way that's controlled, right? It has to be controlled because otherwise you're the puppet of your worst impulses and that's a terrible thing to be. Pinocchio. Other questions?

Speaker 3:          37:18          The question was, we called the police and had them removed. Would've that been a failure? I think the answer is no. There's no reason to assume that this is a bad thing. It's noisy and it's annoying, but that's fine. You got to let things go to follow what you believe to be true. Don't worry about it, and then let things happen and see what happens because it's perfectly possible that if you're trying to do the right thing and you're trying to say that whatever happens around you and then it's a good thing. So we'll see. We'll have weeks after this event to analyze its consequences and so far all of those of you that are there to listen to me talk, you're peaceful and reasonable and you got a chance to show that to hundreds of thousands of people. This is a good thing. Not a bad thing.

Speaker 3:          38:25          How do we get these people to understand the dialogue needs to consensus cannot make people who don't listen, listen, they have to decide to listen, but you do that by listening, engage in dialogue and softened contract consensus among you. You live by example because there's no getting through this. It's an ideological war and the harder you push against it, don't worry about it, but don't. Don't get pushed around and don't let people in doctrinaire. There's clearly a liberal left bias on campuses. The documentation is very clear. If you go online and watch Jonathan Heights' videos, he explains it. Partly. The reason for that is that people are higher in openness. A trait are more likely to go to university and into academia, so there is some trait reasons, but over the last 30 years he's become overwhelmingly left wing.

Speaker 3:          39:55          Take your club. You know you're not under the control of the professors at university. You're here to educate yourself. Some professors will help yourself as you want to know about the peach. Don't enroll in the humanities paper citations. We also have no idea how widespread this sort of thing is. Maybe two or three percent, very tiny minority, but very well organized, very noisy. So the other thing you have to organize yourself, you get your damn arguments together, pushed back against them. You're pushing, but that's you're someone who's articulate so that you learn how to make powerful and that's what universities articulates.

Speaker 3:          42:33          So the question is, I've made a good idea to let your questionnaires, what happened, guide you. I'm not going to happen and you want to rely on. You have to make sure that I apologize. You're speak to you properly. Internal Guide, post. You have to be honest because otherwise that's a terrible mistake. So the reason that you don't lie against pathological, if you can't trust yourself, then you can have your political or you can have nothing and neither of those things are reasonable. Replacements went really well. Are you a chance to talk to has cut into video? A big fan, big fan out there is a chance to talk to him.
