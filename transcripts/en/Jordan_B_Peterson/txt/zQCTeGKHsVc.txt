Speaker 1:          00:06          Sometimes there's a glitch in the matrix where the limitations of the old operating system and laid bare and something new pokes through. There's been dozens of responses to the Jordan Peterson Channel Four interview already. What makes this one different? Well, I have a pretty unique perspective. In October last year I went to Toronto to interview Jordan Peterson, this home from where I came in from London last night. I turned the interview into the first full length documentary about Jordan Peterson's ideas. I was pretty sure he'd soon become a lot more famous and be recognized as one of the most significant public thinkers, but I couldn't possibly have predicted how he breakthrough to a mass audience. A few weeks later Peter's and did an interview with journalists, Kathy Newman on channel four news in the UK, a program I worked on as reporter and producer for 10 years. It was a sensation. Millions watched it online, tens of thousands commented and overwhelming majority felt. Peterson had been unfairly represented and in the week since it hasn't stopped, Peterson has been asked about it constantly on the most high profile online shows 12 rules for life. So without reading this. So what you're saying is sort of like there's only 12 things you need to know in like, right? That's it. Yeah. Well yeah. This, um, this interview that you just did with this woman kathy new mission was that in the UK it was channel four UK. So what does this glitch say about the state of mainstream media and the culture at large?

Speaker 2:          01:55          My diagnosis of what's actually happening is that people are moving further and further away from what is what thinking actually is at more and more into merely running a script.

Speaker 1:          02:09          And what does Jordan Peterson actually think? It's so controversial. You are misrepresented more than anyone I know, you know, weird way. You are villainized in a weird way where um, I can't believe that these people are honestly looking at your opinions and coming up with these conclusions. I believe this encounter struck such a nerve because it's a cultural watershed moment scene properly as Peterson would say. It's archetypal in that it contains layers and layers of meaning that go right to the heart of the biggest rift we're seeing play out in the culture over the next 50 minutes. I'm going to do my best to unpack it from the clash between new and old media. There's also why Youtube is going to kill tv because

Speaker 3:          02:59          television, by its nature, all of these narrow broadcast technologies, they re they rely on forcing the story

Speaker 1:          03:09          all the way down to the mythological an archetype or level.

Speaker 4:          03:13          I thought of videology says fragmentary mythologies. That's where they get their archetype will in psychological power in the postmodern world. And this seems to be something that's increasingly seeping out into the culture at large. You have nothing but the tyrannical father. Nothing but the destructive force of masculine consciousness and nothing but the benevolent, benevolent great mother. And it's uh, it's an appalling ideology and it seems to me that it's sucking the vitality, which is exactly what you'd expect. Symbolically. It's sucking the vitality of our culture

Speaker 1:          03:44          until off. How do we move forward constructively rather than just adding to the polarization. I've been a journalist for 16 years in the newsroom of the BBC and channel four and then making documentaries. I moved away from the front line of news sometime ago and started learning psychology, which is what first drew me to Jordan Peterson from a distance. I've started to see the blind spots of the establishment media much more clearly. I spent some of the best years of my working life at channel four news and have a huge amount of respect and gratitude to the program. But I'm making this film because I feel so strongly that if we can't have open conversations about the kind of topics Peterson is raising, we're in serious trouble.

Speaker 5:          04:31          My book went up to number two and on amazon.com in the u s the next day, right? It's number one in Canada. It's number three in the UK. All on Amazon. I couldn't have asked for more publicity. Right? And so I could also be sitting back and saying, well, you know, she tried to my a person who regarded herself as my ideological opponent tried to go after my philosophy and my reputation on national TV failed brutally and has been taken apart for it. It's like this is a good day, but I don't regard it as a good day. I don't think it's a good day.

Speaker 5:          05:08          I think that it's evidence of the instability of the times that we're in. It would have been much better for me and for everyone else if what we would have had was a real conversation. You said that it's actually a sign of the times where things could go really wrong for all of us really soon. Yeah, we're, we're playing with fire and what do you mean by this? Can you, can you elaborate? Well, things go wrong and cultures all the time, right? You get, you get the polarization increases until people start to act it out.

Speaker 1:          05:41          Peterson is one of the new breed of thinkers made famous almost completely by the Internet, not the broadcast media arts of a powerful new informal network being called the intellectual dark web and the mainstream media is based on an old model that

Speaker 6:          05:58          is being replaced by new media and new technology so quickly that it's false or becoming glaringly obvious. Fortunately, thanks to Youtube podcasting and however else you get shows like this one, the mainstream media stranglehold on information, which really is a stranglehold on your ability to think clearly about the issues of the day is crumbling at an incredible rate. Now the question is who and what will replace it? A few months ago, one of my favorite people to sit across this table from Eric Weinstein came up with the phrase intellectual dark web to describe this eclectic mix of people from Sam Harris to Ben Shapiro, to his brother, Bret Weinstein to Jordan Peterson, all of whom are figuring out ways to have the important and often dangerous conversations that are completely ignored by the mainstream. It's why I would argue that this collection of people are actually more influential at this point than whatever collection of cable news pundits you can come up with. If you think I'm being hyperbolic about the growing influence of this group, just check the traction that these people get on twitter or facebook compared to our mainstream competitors. Twitter may not be real life as I say in my twitter bio, but it is some barometer of what the Zeitgeists is right now.

Speaker 1:          07:08          What unites this group of thinkers is a sense that the set of ideas that have run western culture for years are breaking down and that the chaos of the moment is the attempt to find new ones. It's nearly all happening online.

Speaker 4:          07:24          Part of the problem that we have right now in our culture is trying to diagnose the level at which the discussion should be taking place and I think the reason that this is a tumultuous time is because it actually is a time for discussion of first principles and it's, it's that first principles are virtually at the level of theology, right? Because first principles are the things that you assume and then move forward. It's like, well, what should we assume while the dignity of the human soul? But start with that. You can't treat yourself properly without assuming that you can't have a relationship with another person. You can't stabilize your family. You can't have a functional society. So what does it mean for this human soul to have dignity? Well, the part of the idea is that you're participating in creation itself, and you do that with your actions in your language, and you get to decide whether you're tilting the world a bit more towards heaven or a bit more towards hell. And that's actually what you're doing. So that's a place where the literal in the metaphorical truth come together. And people are very, they're terrified of that idea as they should be because it's a massive responsibility.

Speaker 1:          08:26          They also argue that the central problem is polarization boosted by social media. Peterson's work looks at how people are hardwired to see the world differently.

Speaker 7:          08:37          A lot of what determines your political orientation is biological temperament, far more than people realize. So for example, left leaning people liberals let's say, although that's kind of Miss Misnomer, but we'll keep with the terminology. Liberals are high in a trait called openness, which is one of the big five personality traits and it's associated with interest in abstraction and interest in aesthetics. It's the best predictor of liberal political leaning and they're low in trait conscientiousness, which is due to fullness and and orderliness in particular. Whereas the conservatives are the opposite. They're high in conscientiousness, their due to in orderly and they're low in openness and that makes them really good managers and administrators, administrators and often businessmen, but not very good entrepreneurs because the entrepreneurs are almost all drawn from the liberal types. And so these are really fundamental fundamentally biologically predicated differences. And there you might think about them as different sets of, of opportunities and limitations and and certainly different ways of screening the world and each of those different temperamental types needs.

Speaker 7:          09:50          The other type, let's call this a diversity issue. If you start understanding that the person that you're talking to who doesn't share your political views isn't stupid, that's the first thing necessarily. They might be, but so might you be, no. Stupidity isn't. The differences in intelligence are not the prime determinant of differences in political belief. All right, so you might be talking to someone who's more conscientious and less creative than you if you're, if you happen to be a liberal, but that doesn't mean that that person's perspective is not valid and it doesn't mean that they wouldn't outperform you in some domains because they would. So one thing to remember is people actually do see the world differently. It's not merely that they, that they're possessively of of ill, he informed opinions. The whole point of the deal of a democracy is to continue the dialogue between people of different temperamental types so that we don't move so far to the right that everything becomes encapsulated and stone and doesn't move or so far to the left that everything dissolves in a kind of a mealy mouth chaos. And the only way that you can, you can navigate between those two scholls is by is through discussion, which is why free speech is such an important value. It's the thing that keeps the temperamental types from being at each other's throats.

Speaker 8:          11:13          In the aftermath of the trump election, that came as such a shock to most of the media. One of the most widely shared analysis pieces was from deep code. It describes how the establishment mainstream media perspective based around liberal values of openness and inclusivity he calls the blue church is being challenged by a new web based insurgency, a red religion based on the values of tribalism.

Speaker 7:          11:43          The Culture Wars of the 20th century was a decisive success for blue and a effectively a route for

Speaker 2:          11:54          red. So what we see first is that red was forced to move into a deeply exploratory phase. Second that it did this in a context where as it turns out, things were changing meaningfully, quite significantly. In fact, it from my perspective, they in a world historical level, the emergence of entirely new forms of communication and therefore entirely new forms of sense making and coherence.

Speaker 8:          12:23          He concludes that the blue church is in the process of collapse as its dominant ideology can't adapt to changing reality, but that a combination of the two sets of values of blue and red is essential.

Speaker 2:          12:38          We are conscious, yeah, and effective in the world in groups not as individuals. And the ingredients of those groups include aspects that are currently showing up as both red and blue. Um, I propose somewhat strongly that uh, either red nor blue is pure elements contain the ingredients necessary to actually be adaptive to reality. Um, this is a disaster. In fact, um, it's a little bit like mmm. Separating the hand in the eye. You know, you're the, I can see if the eye takes itself as being, the essence of virtue is separates itself from the ability to do the same thing with the hand. For most of human history, these groups have actually always commingled there necessary that they actually relate to each other in a deeply healthy, uh, and direct fashion. Uh, their separation into armed camps is extinction are actually,

Speaker 8:          13:39          do you live the values of red that you think blue needs to integrate or some way or to reintegrate? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          13:44          Oh Wow. That's actually pretty easy responsibility. I mean we've, we've actually even seen it, um, the ability to, um, make a commitment and keep it, um, which, which by the way ideologically shows up. Is that a duty or loyalty? But those are both ideologies. The, the, the deeper sense is that ability, um, responsibility both at the individual and the group level, the ability to actually really make a personal sacrifice on the part of the group. That's actually a deeply red value. Um, and I don't mean that by the way as politically ideological, uh, certainly there are people who, um, are currently part of blue who feel that deeply. What I'm saying is that, that that shows up much, much more intensely in red. And when you're feeling it in blue, you're actually feeling a red value and that's good. Mixing them is crucial. Um,

Speaker 8:          14:42          cause that's very Jordan Peterson asks to w how would you, how would you define Jordan Peterson or do you think the fact that the issue is that he is, is not within one of those

Speaker 2:          14:52          two camps? I think that's the point. I think that he grasps directly the fact that human beings can only actually make sense of the world by virtue of communication with other human beings. And this is all about the notion of ad mixture had that one must have a mixture of, of what I mean he uses the mythic poetic to make sense that the order order and chaos, uh, the way or the Taoist way is the al chemical admixture of order and chaos. And that's it. Like that's how you do it. And so if you bias towards orderliness, uh, you find yourself in a rigid non-adaptive, uh, noncreative not exploratory framework, um, which will die because the world changes if you buy us towards chaos, um, you, you eat your young and evaporate. Um, which also ties for obvious reasons, uh, and the key is to actually be enabled these things to be in relationship with each other. And vital healthy relationship with each other and I think that's the, in some sense, the essence of what he's focusing on and in sort of the core of what he's asking about it

Speaker 1:          15:57          in his heart for the broadcast media to get a handle on because the depth of his thought means he doesn't fit easily into any of their categories. The clash with Kathy Newman was his breakthrough moment where the new world met the old, to give the context from Kathy Newman side, she has to do dozens of interviews each month. Peterson is hard to get a grip on and he sure as hell looks controversial. She's also focused on getting soundbites for a five minute cut down of the interview for TV. Not a long conversation for online.

Speaker 9:          16:30          The interview was ridiculous. It was a ridiculous interview. I mean, I listened to it or watched it several times. I was like, this is so strange. It's like her determination to turn it into a conflict too. It's one of the issues that I have with television shows. Yeah. Because they have a very limited amount of time and they're trying to make things as salacious as possible. They want to have these soundbites, these clickbait soundbites, and she just went into it incredibly confrontational. Not Trying to find your actual perspective, but trying to force you to defend a non nonrealistic. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          17:03          Perspective. Yes. While I was at, I was the hypothetical villain of her imagination essentially. No. This is also why Youtube is going to kill tv because television, by its nature, all of these narrow broadcast technologies, they re they rely on forcing the story. Right, because it has to happen now. It has to happen like often in five minutes because they only broadcast five minutes of that interview. They did put the whole thing up on youtube. To their credit. Yeah, it, it, it hasn't ceased to amaze me yet. I think that they thought that the interview went fine

Speaker 1:          17:41          after the interview. Channel Four news found themselves at the center of an online storm, which included some nasty, a misogynistic

Speaker 8:          17:50          attacks.

Speaker 8:          17:54          It's understandable that they just wanted it to go away, but online is forever and as the center of gravity continues to shift away from traditional media, this interview is, I would argue, a slow motion and continuing car crash for Channel Four's credibility. So why did it happen? Partly the limitations of the medium of TV, but also because of the institutional political blindness of the mainstream media. I've always considered myself of the liberal left, but especially since the election of trump, I've been trying to understand what happened and I'm convinced that the polarization we're seeing is mainly driven by the shadow side of liberalism in particular, where supposedly inclusive social justice liberalism stops being inclusive and secretly judges and despises people that don't think the same way. The rebellion of trump and brexit was a direct response.

Speaker 10:         18:51          Yeah.

Speaker 8:          18:52          As Eerie Harris argues in this article in Colette, the new gatekeepers of the media have become a new bourgeoisie in forcing a rigid etiquette and using the rights of the oppressed as an excuse to put forward a vision of the kind of society they personally want to live in. On the surface level, it's about how a narrow social justice worldview embodied by Kathy Newman in the interview became the new status quo and how this institutional bias of much of the mainstream media means it can't see or understand the forces that are challenging this new consensus. The counterculture used to be on the left, but once it one the culture war, it left space for a new counter culture, the biggest manifestation is the red pill phenomena, which the mainstream media mistakenly assumes is the same thing as the alt right.

Speaker 11:         19:48          I was surprised to discover the overlap between, um, what I'm into a particularly like, um, Greek philosophy and stoicism and the old right. Who I'd always thought of, you know, if I come across from the tour, I thought that was kind of, um, squibb allied boogie man, you know, uh, completely unpalatable like extremists, uh, in their, in their basements. And then to discover that, um, you know, a lot of them were a lot of people in stoicism and also really into the old right. Made me wonder what was going on and why people like me. We're getting radicalized, kind of drawn into it. You're explaining what stoicism is for is basically an ancient Greek philosophy, which, um, with became very popular in the Roman, uh, uh, you know, we did the emperor marcus or radius was a stoic for example. And it's in some ways like a Western form of Buddhism. It's like a therapy for the emotions. It teaches you to take responsibility for your thoughts, to take a nearby, to take some control of your emotions. So in some ways it's putting forward a model of a strength and integrity and kind of resilience. Uh, I made adversity and rapid change. So for that reason it's become very popular in the last 10 years.

Speaker 12:         21:24          I think this is also why from my perspective, at least someone like Jordan Peterson is often looked from the outside as being aligned with the alt right because he has a similar message. But it's, there are crucial differences I think, between what we would consider. I mean, certainly white nationalism would be an essential part of the outright, I would say, of any useful definition. And that's certainly not characteristic of, of Jordan Peterson from my experience,

Speaker 11:         21:50          there's a crucial difference at least between stoicism and your right. Uh, even though a lot of old writers into stoicism ending that stoicism and maybe Jordan Peterson as well. I don't, I'm not an expert on him. Talk about the way to gain strength and maturity and power is internal. It's to take responsibility for your own thoughts and feelings. Whilst I think people, sometimes men white look for that sense of power and control externally by suppressing or, or, or segregating anyone who they feel threatened by, whether that's other colors or other sexualities or, or, or, or gender. So there's a crucial difference there. One is about kind of inner integrity, uh, and, and, and it just kind of, um, being strong within yourself. And the other is about trying to take control through the kind of exterior borders and fences, if you see what I mean.

Speaker 13:         22:49          Every public appearance that I've made that's related to the sort of topics that we're discussing is overwhelmingly, man, it's like, it's like 85 to 90%. And so I thought, wow, that's weird. Like what the hell's going on here. Exactly. And then the other thing I've noticed is that I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I'd be talking to, not about rights, but about responsibility, right? Because he can't have the bloody converse. What are you doing? You can't have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility because your rights are my responsibility. That's what they are technically. So you just can't have only half of that discussion and we're only having half that discussion. And the question is, well, what the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion? And the answer is what? You're leaving out responsibility.

Speaker 13:         23:36          And then the question is, well what are you leaving out? If you're leaving out responsibility? And the answer might be, well maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life. That's what looks like to me. It's like here you are suffering away. What makes it worthwhile, right? You know you're completely, oh, you're completely, you have no idea what you're you. It's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is. Responsibility. That's what gives life meaning. It's like lift a load, then you can tolerate yourself. Right? Cause look at your useless, easily hurt, easily killed. Why should you have any self respect? That's the story of the fall. Pick something up and carry it. Pick, make it heavy enough so that you can think, yeah, well useless as I am. At least I could move that from there to there. Well what's really cool about that is that when I talked to these crowds about this, the man's eyes light up and that's very like I've seen that phenomena because I've been talking about this mythological material for a long time and I can see when I'm watching crowds, people, you know their eyebrows lift, their eyes light up because I've put something together for them, not sweat, mythological stories do.

Speaker 13:         24:49          So I'm not taking responsibility for that. That's what the story is due. So I say this story, when people go click, click, click, you know when their eyes light up. But this responsibility thing, that's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that. It is unbelievable. It just blows me away. It's like, really? That's what's, that's the counterculture. Grow the hell up and do something useful. Really. I could do that. Oh, I'm so excited by that idea. No one ever mentioned that before. It's like rights, rights, rights, rights, Jesus. It's, it's, it's appalling. It's, it's, and, and I feel that that's deeply felt by the people who are, who are coming out to, to listen to these sorts of things, to there. They've had enough of that. So, and they better have because it's a nonproductive motive being responsibility. Man.

Speaker 1:          25:37          Peterson is part of the counterculture that he describes himself as a classic liberal and yet he's frequently described as right wing by the media. This is not limited to Peterson. James Damore is infamous. Google memo was described everywhere. There's an anti diversity screed despite him specifically stating he wanted to encourage more diversity in the workplace. Many believe that the channel four interview, it was a significant moment and exposing this mindset as dogmatic, reactionary and fixed.

Speaker 2:          26:17          So during the interview we see an example of a, um, uh, a delusional framework that is what appears to be largely incapable of perceiving, reacting to reality in real time. But much more interesting is what happened afterwards, which was the sort of the self healing and policing mechanism of the larger social consensus of how, when, how the Blue Church reactively goes about maintaining the integrity of its frame. Um, and so what ended up happening was there was a break in the frame, there was a glitch in the matrix. The, uh, mechanisms of the Blue Church reacted to endeavor, to control the frame and to convert it into a way of sense of, of, uh, making sense of the, what occurred that still maintained the integrity of its frame. And you can do, you mean when they tried to characterize it as a sort of abusive trolls and you'll write hero and all of that is actually exactly the sort of a, to use a military language.

Speaker 2:          27:19          It was a fall back position that was a reactive, almost instinctual and not all, most in fact precisely. Instinction was that pure habit. Uh, there was no, uh, thoughtfulness or even, um, strategic action. There it was. If if x, then y and in this case why is here's a set of things that one does to reestablish the dominant frame and now we're now we're two levels deep. You know, the first level was a sort of self evident disaster, but then the second level was also a relatively self avid disaster and there isn't really a third level, um, in this approach. So it ends up happening and this is again, we can kind of just think about this from ordinary psychology. Um, this is how delusions fall apart because try as we might, our desire to interpret reality to me, but we want it to mean at the end of the day will always be checked against what reality actually is. Maybe some time, you know, we're pretty good at, at, at, at making things up in pretending, but eventually reality is reality.

Speaker 8:          28:27          This isn't to say that Peterson is not controversial. He's saying things that challenge the most deeply held assumptions of the new establishment narrative.

Speaker 3:          28:36          I guess the other reason that people are on my case to some degree is because I have made a strong case, which I think is fully documented by the scientific literature, that there are intrinsic differences say between men and women. And I think the evidence on that, this is the thing that staggered me, is that no serious scientists have debated that for like four decades. It's that argument was done by the time I went to graduate school. Everyone knew that human beings, we're not a blank slate. That biological forces parameterize the way that we thought and felt and acted in and, and valued. Everyone knew that the fact that this has become somehow debatable again is just, especially because it's being done by legislative Fiat, they're forcing it

Speaker 8:          29:22          pause. Peterson's argument based on years of psychological research is that much of the political conflicts, uh, due to try to integrate the different political temperaments of men and women.

Speaker 3:          29:35          We were talking about the relatively, the relative evolutionary roles of men and women. And this is speculative obviously.

Speaker 4:          29:42          And, and because our research did indicate it's tentative research so far that that the, the, the SGS sjw sort of equality above all else philosophy is more prevalent among women. It's predicted by the personality factors that are more common among women. So agreeableness and high negative emotion, primarily agreeableness. But in addition it's also predicted by being female. And so I've been thinking about that a lot because, well men are bailing out of the humanities like mad and pretty much out of the universities except for stem, the women are moving in like mad and they're also moving into the political sphere like mad. And this is new, right? We've never had this happen before and we do. No, no, do not know what the significance of it is. It's only 50 years old. And so we were thinking about this and so I don't know what you think about this proposition, but imagine that, that, that historically speaking, it's something like women were responsible for distribution and men were responsible for production.

Speaker 4:          30:44          Something like that. And maybe, and maybe that's only the case really in the tight confines of the immediate family, but that doesn't matter because that's most of the evolutionary landscape for human beings anyways. What the women does it did was make sure that everybody got enough. Okay. And that seems to me to be one of the things that's driving, at least in part the sjw demand for, for equity and equality. It's like, let's make sure everybody has enough. It's like, well look, fair enough. You know, I mean you, you can't, you can't argue with that. But there's, there's an antipathy between that and the reality of differential productivity. You know, because people really do differ in their productivity. I think that the sjw phenomena is different and I think it is associated at least in part with the rise of women to political power and, and we don't know what women are like when they have political power because they've never had it. I mean there's been queens obviously and that sort of thing. Just being female authority figures and females have wielded far more power historically than feminists generally like to admit. But this is a different thing and we don't know what, what I've truly female political philosophy would be like, but it might be, especially if it's not being well examined and it isn't very sophisticated conceptually, it could easily be, well, let's makes sure things are distributed equally well. Yeah, but sorry,

Speaker 1:          32:02          fly. One of the Peterson's main influences is the psychologist Carl Young human psychology was built around the concept of the shadow, all the things about ourselves. We don't want to accept our anger, negativity, unconscious judgments, and how we need to integrate all those disowned parts to grow. I'm convinced that's what's happening on a vast cultural level since leaving channel four news. I've retrained as a counselor and started leading personal growth workshops for men on thought a lot about how these unconscious gender dynamics are playing out in the culture. One of the central concepts is Yum's idea of animus anima possession, or we each have both an inner masculine and feminine essence in a man. When he's unconsciously possessed by his feminine side, his Anima, he becomes withdrawn, moody and reactive. And when a woman is possessed by her male side, the animus, she becomes aggressive and dominating. And how many women are pushed into that by the nature of the modern workplace. The Kathy Newman I know is warm, compassionate, uh, successful and talented journalist. None of this is criticism of her, just the role she was playing in the interview.

Speaker 5:          33:24          I would say technically, and this is might be interesting for people who were interested in union psychology. If you want to understand what Carl Jung meant by animus possession, which is a very difficult concept then that that interview was a textbook case of having a discussion with someone who is animus, possessed life has been moving forward for three and a half billion years and it moves forward in these pattern matters, like the dominance hierarchy for example. So that's that. Let's call that the masculine archetype. It's part of the masculine archetype. In fact, youngest proclamation was that the female representation of the mail. So that's the animus is the dominance hierarchy. It's the patriarchy. So that's the, that's the unconscious archetype, which I think is extremely interesting given what's happened, say in the women's movement because that's what's projected onto men and, and it can be projected in a very negative way. It doesn't have to be, but it can be. And so an animus possessed woman treat a man as if he's the manifestation of the tyrannical patriarchy. He's a group. He's that group of men. Yeah, the group of bad band. Now actually you watch the Jordan Peterson Kathy Newman interview. What did he, what did he think? Thank

Speaker 14:         34:43          who I, my whole body contracted and I, I felt so sad for womanhood. I felt disappointed and um, I could see how the shadow part of womanhood was acting out. I could see how the collective rage was acting through Kathy Newman. And this is what happens is that when that's unknown and it's projected blindly on to whatever stick, whatever it sticks. And it was very clear that she already had an agenda and she already had a projection that she was just looking to stay. She was, she was just looking to have that confirmed. So I felt on behalf of women, I felt sad and disappointed because we to have intelligent conversations.

Speaker 12:         35:40          And I also want to say that this isn't, even though the, the specific example is the Kathy Newman Jordan an interview. It's not specific to, to Kathy Newman. I think the fact that that interview has resonated with so many people that has been so popular shows that actually something archetype was going on in that, in that interaction. And I think as well, why it's gone viral is a lot of people watching it recognize those dynamics. They're like, I've been in conversations like that. Yeah. I've been in this conversation when nothing I say works when nothing I say he gets through. Yeah. Um, so there's something sort of fundamental about about the masculine and feminine dynamic that is going on in there. What do you think that is?

Speaker 14:         36:22          I think Jordan Peterson, he's every man. Kathy Newman, she's every woman. I can tap into that rage like this. I know it in myself and women that say they don't, they just denying it because it is in the collective. So in that sense it just highlighted what, what's there. It's wonderful because here we really get to look at why is this so important? Why is it so important to listen to, to a thinker like Jordan Peterson and take it seriously and say, what can we do with it? It's just so obvious that it's needed because if this is where we are, if this is where society and cultures is, if this is the ability to have an intelligent conversations conversation than we are in trouble, I really feel that there is this collective, subconscious rage that is just boiling in women and it's coming up in so many ways.

Speaker 14:         37:22          We see, we see in the media and, and, and what's going on is this unknown rage that comes up in, in many different ways. Um, and on one hand it needs to come out. We need to clear it. It needs to be expressed. It needs to be acknowledged. On the other hand, it's not enough. This is only like this is breaking the ice so that the next step of evolution can, you know, consciousness can start coming through. And that's what I'm lacking in women. It's really to take responsibility for what we do as women in our manipulation, in our seduction, in our control. And, and it's so easy for women to say, but that's just because we're angry and mandate this and patriarchy, but it's, um, it's such a lack of responsibility and this women really need to know.

Speaker 12:         38:20          I mean that's the kind of shadow work is the acceptance that we all have shadows that men certainly have a shadow. There was a shadow around masculinity, but there's also a shadow around femininity. And while part of the cultural now is toxic masculinity and everyone knows what you mean by toxic toxic masculinity. If you talk about toxic femininity, everyone still knows what you mean, but you can't have that conversation. Yeah. Which is, it's, it's interesting what is allowed to be said and what is not allowed to be said at the moment. And that, that I think is, is very dangerous that certain topics, certain conversations or off or off limits. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         39:03          And this is where we see where, where we see the victim, persecutor dynamics activates it because women become the become the victims and we make ourselves the victims and we persecute men. But in that aggression, in that rage, and when we are the victims, we are in perfect control. We become the persecutors because we say it's all about blame. Did this and men need to take responsibility. But in that we've become the persecutors. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         39:34          And it's also very difficult as well because one imagines that that combative attitude is something that has served her well in the past. And it's something that she's maybe felt forced into because of the nature of the society that he's operating it. So it's a kind of catch 22 situation for the many successful women because they feel that they're pushed to be more masculine. Yeah. And then when they're more masculine, they get judged for being more masculine.

Speaker 14:         40:01          It's, it's very sad. And, and, and I can see that dynamics being played out. Absolutely. But I think the only thing we can do is to take responsibility and say, okay, I'm doing that. Do I really want to compromise my femininity? Do I want to compromise my integrity? Do I want to compromise my gender and play that or is there another way that I can be powerful without being aggressive, without playing a power game, but resting in my natural power, resting in my natural dignity, resting in that deep rootedness that we both have in our agendas that when we are at peace with it and when we acknowledge it in ourselves, it's that as a natural thing, and this is the thing, I don't want to make this personal about Katherine Newman because it's, it's in that potential is in every woman, but it's because we are persecuting our own femininity. What's being played out that we are doing it to ourselves because we don't trust that it's good enough to be a woman. We don't trust that we can have conversations that come from the felt embodied perspective. We don't trust that we're connected to truth because these, these masculine ways have been, have been very strong and women have been denying their own power.

Speaker 15:         41:17          In my work over many years of working with this, I find that very few women grew up in households which really loved, admired, respected on or heard, cherished the feminine. And so there is for so many of the women who've grown up in the, I dunno, the last hundred years that say, um, uh, kind of devaluation of the feminine that gets taken on and of course, and as well as abuse, aggression, all sorts of things. So very many women out of an intelligent strategy to survive, develop their masculine side as a defense against that devaluation for the feminine. And over time they become very identified with that mask on side. The male equivalent is anima possession in Anima possession. It's the loss of relaxed confidence in the groundedness in the masculine and is overwhelmed by his own inner feminine side. And it creates a passive withdrawn, moody, Bitchy, complaining, not showing up kind of guy, which I think is really so much what feminists are angry about.

Speaker 15:         42:33          The don't see them as really angry about the masculine per se, but the way that males behave. And you know, I have quite a lot of compassion for that because for myself and most men that I know, we weren't really shown how to be as men. We didn't really get initiated into it. And so, and then the strong thing comes from feminism and we feel like it's, it's maleness that's wrong. It's not, it's not maleness that's wrong. And I don't even think feminists, feminists hate the masculine. It's like what the call is really for men is to develop their masculine strength, presence, courage, be relaxed and confident, be protective and be strong. And under this kind of assault, which has come from a lot of animals, possessed women, a lot of men have retreated. And I think gone into feeling guilty about being men and have become passive indecisive. Um, and in that way a kind of feminized man has emerged.

Speaker 10:         43:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          43:45          Lacy's follow eight pieces and store recognize his analysis goes all the way down to the bedrock, to the archetypal structures of consciousness itself.

Speaker 4:          43:54          The thing that I really see happening, and you can tell me what you think about this in Norman's book consciousness, which is masculine, symbolically masculine for a variety of reasons, is, is viewed as rising up against the countervailing force of tragedy from an underlying co feminine, Symbolically Feminine unconsciousness, right? And it's something that can always be pulled back into that unconsciousness. That would be the microcosm of that would be the Friday and eatable mother familial dynamic where the mother was so over protective and all encompassing that she interferes with the development of the competence, not only of her sons, but over daughters of her children in general. And it seems to me that that's the dynamic that's being played out in our society right now is that there's this and it's, it's related in some way that I don't understand to this, to this insistence that all forms of masculine and authority or nothing by tyrannical power.

Speaker 4:          44:47          So the symbolic representation is tyrannical father with no appreciation for the benevolent father and benevolent mother with no appreciation whatsoever for the tyrannical mother. Right. And that's that cause I thought of videology is as fragmentary mythologies. That's where they get their archetype in psychological power, right? And so in a balanced representation, you have the terrible mother and the great mother as as noise and laid out so nicely and you have the terrible father in the great father. So that's the fact that culture mangles you have to death well. It's also promoting you and developing you. You have to see that as balanced. And then you have the heroic and adversarial individual. But in the postmodern world, and this seems to be something that's increasingly seeping out into the culture at large, you have nothing but the tyrannical father. Nothing but the destructive force of masculine consciousness and nothing but the benevolent, benevolent, great mother. And it's a, it's an appalling ideology. And it seems to me that it's sucking the vitality, which, which is exactly what you would expect symbolically. It's sucking the vitality of our culture. You see that with the increasing demolition of, of young men, um, and not only young men in terms of their academic performance, which like they're falling way behind in elementary school way behind in junior high and bailing out of the universities like mad. And so, and I,

Speaker 16:         46:08          well the public school education has become completely permeated by this kind of anti male propaganda. I mean, and to me public schools I just a form of imprisonment, you know, right now they are particularly destructive to young men who have a lot of physical energy right now. You know, I identify as transgender, Gay Mike Myself, right? But I do not, I do not require the entire world to alter itself okay. To, to fit my particular in the self image. I do believe in the power of hormones. I believe that men exist and women exist and are biologically different. I think that, I think there is no cure for, I'm the cultures ills right now except if men start standing up away and demanding that they be respected as men.

Speaker 4:          46:52          Here's the problem. You know, this is something my wife has pointed out to. She said, well, men are going to have to stand up for themselves. But here's the problem. I know how to stand up to a man who's, who's, uh, unfairly trespassed against me. And the reason I know that is because the parameters for my resistance are quite well defined, which is we talk, we argue, we push, and then it becomes physical, right? Like if, if we move beyond the boundaries of civil discourse, we know what the next step is. Okay. That's forbidden in, in discourse with women. So I don't know, like it seems to me that it isn't men that have to stand up and say enough of this, even though that is what they should do. It seems to me that it's same women who have to stand up against their crazy sisters and say, look, enough of that enough man hating enough pathology, enough bringing disgrace on us as a, as a gender.

Speaker 4:          47:46          But the problem there, and then I'll start my little tirade, is that most of the women I know who are sane are busy doing same things, right? They're off. They have their career, they have their family, they're quite occupied and they don't seem to have the time or maybe even the interest to go after there. They're crazy heartbeat sisters. And so I don't see any regulating force for that, that terrible femininity. And it seems to me to be invading the culture and undermining the masculine power of the culture in a way that's, I think fatal. I really do believe that.

Speaker 16:         48:19          I too, I too believe that these are, this is symptomatic of the decline of Western culture and, and we, and, and it will just go down flat. I don't think people realize that, you know, masculinity is still exists in the world as a code among jihadists. Okay. And when you have passionate masculinity, okay. Circling the borders, like the huns in the vandals during the Roman empire, that, that's what I see. I see this culture rotting from within. Okay. And, and this all link itself, literally,

Speaker 5:          48:53          we have this bit of combat. Let's say it produced a scandal. Now we actually talk about it. Yeah. No tricks. Just to conversation and then everybody wins. Right? Because I can admit whatever mistakes I made, she can admit whatever mistakes she made, we can drop the persona. So you're saying the polarization that we're seeing right now that we are speaking out, it's not in the future. We will x out that polarization if we don't, if we keep accelerating and especially if we keep accelerating it with lies. Yeah. You know, and, and this, this whole, um, channel four rats, nest is like 90% lies. Yeah. Maybe more. Yeah. And I'll, you know, a lot of it's ideologically motivated lies, but it doesn't matter. It's still lies. Like Kathy, as I said, there was virtually nothing she said in that interview that was actually coming from her, like, like a deep part of her soul, of her persona. It was all persona. It was all persona and, and, and all use of words in a, in a expedient manner as tools to obtain. I think probably probably status, dominance, status and reputation. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          50:14          I mean what advice would you give to people too, to navigate this new world? The first is a free your mind. Be Aware of the fact that the habits of the Blue Church and and how it works, um, don't work anymore. Recognize that your way of making sense in the world that used to work don't work and you really, really need to set yourself free to begin learning a new child's mind, beginner's mind. Um, second, um, this by nature must in fact be exploratory. So swim do not make sense prematurely in spite of the fact that the world feels dangerous instead of the five that you may want to protect yourself in this dangerous world I'm doing. So to quickly, uh, does not allow the natural exploratory approach to do what it needs to do. Really just listen and learn. Go all the way that back down to human base. Turn it inward. Learn how fear shows up in you. Learn how not to allow fear to drive the choices that you make. Learn how to listen to the whole way that all of you perceives what's going on. Become more integrated with your own body. Go out into nature, spend a lot of time not connected to the chaos that's going on. And a lot of time reconnecting yourself with your fundamental capacity to perceive reality in all the different modalities that human beings have the capacity to do.

Speaker 2:          51:48          Then relearn how to use other human beings as allies and figuring out how to make sense of the world. I mean that really relearn like we have been abused and a constrained by institutional frameworks that remove us from our own native capabilities. So relearn that, understand how to be a friend and an ally, how to have a conversation with somebody where you're really listening closely to get a sense of what their perspective brings to you, where you're not obligated to agree with them. We are not obligated to move out of what you feel is right to form some new, uh, consensus, reality. But where you're actually authentically recognizing that their perspective has some capacity to bring richness to your perspective. Just by the way, is almost exclusively possible in person. And what we're doing right now is an o cavers and epic need. We'd be very mindful of the fact that a linear broadcast is bad and even interactive bandwidth like this is not good enough.

Speaker 2:          52:49          You know, you've got to learn from raw physical and get yourself into places where your consensus reality and your habits are willfully destroyed. It to human, to human conversations and, and get as far with ideology as you can. Your job is not to know what the fuck is going on. Your job has to be absolutely certain that you have no idea what the fuck is going on and learn how to feel from raw chaos, from raw uncertainty up then, and only then are you finally able to begin the journey of beginning form a collective intelligence in this new environment. That's my advice.

Speaker 1:          53:29          This is why we've created rubber wisdom to host these conversations, to try and unpack what's going on and through our workshops and events start to build this collective intelligence for the future. To see longer versions of the interviews featured in this film and our full length documentary about Jordan Peterson.
