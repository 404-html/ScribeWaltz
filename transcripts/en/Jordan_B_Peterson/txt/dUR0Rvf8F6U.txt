Speaker 1:          00:00:11       Yeah, this does my reproduction piece from the conceptual level between group identification, whatever stage of moral coming after it, and the idea here is think of this initial stage is childhood. It goes a horse presumptions of did undergo a horse disintegration adolescence, I suppose mostly for biological reasons, which is to say that cause a physiological changes, the environment to which someone has to adapt changes dramatically. And adolescents, the world isn't the same place, so whoever you were as a child has to undergo mark revision in order for you to become an adult. But the problem is that half the age of 14 or so, you're not really ready to become an adult, so to speak, whatever that means and the intermediary intermediary process, there's trying to draw between that and the notion of an apprenticeship and then the final stages.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       Another accomplished by means of another as a consequence of more than all this information in all this information and hits this time would be the fact that that there are more than that. There was more than one group. I guess that might be the simplest way to describe it. If you're a traditional Jew for example, that's not such a problem unless you have to share a territory with traditional Christian, in which case the fact that group identification, the mere fact that then becomes a form of anomalous information that requires a solution. The solution can be obliterate your enemy, which is I think, denial of anomalous information because the problem with obliterating your enemy is that you're making the presupposition that all of the things that we had to offer you were worthless and I think that's probably an error of the mid size everything is that just because you get rid of someone, you tend not to get rid of the ideas that they represent.

Speaker 1:          00:02:48       Right. Those ideas pop up again, sometimes in the form of schismatic movements within your own culture. If the culture, if an enemy culture is being successful, that sort of indicates that it's come up with ideas that are good and the chances are that you're not going to get rid of those ideas if you get rid of those people. So it's a pretty, it's a kind of a temporary solution. Vast. It might also be really counterproductive in the long run because the things that your enemy knows might be things that you need to know, but maybe not right now. It's always possible to that they know some things you don't. So I think that there's, I mean ways, I guess what I'm trying to say in the sense, because I think it isn't an analogy on the sociopolitical level between the repression of enemies groups and the process of repression of anomalous information at the level of the individual.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       So that's a, that's an analogy that I'll keep much more often than the last part of this course. Well, the question is where do you go from group identification? And the answer to that seems to be what the next stage, or at least an insulary or auxiliary stage, is to know that there's a process that characterize as the construction of groups themselves, which is, I think if you think your group is valuable, it's very difficult to make the claim that the process that made the group isn't more valuable. You see you're sort of, you're sort of trapped by that precept position right off, right off the bat species. If your group's valuable, the process that created it is more valuable. I think that's, that's a necessarily logical conclusion. No, I told you, I don't know if I told you this story before, but there's was an interesting example of this sort of argument in the New Testament which I actually quote later in this [inaudible] where the Pharisees are attempting to trap Christ into staying something heretical so that they can totally prisoner killed him and he says to one of the, essentially you're the sort of person who would have killed the prophets who constructed the group that you mentioned, which was really maximally effective installed and also absolutely true.

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       Now contacting the way, I don't remember which book that at the moment, I kind of read that as the comment that more or less sealed his fate section essentially credible in salt uses a variant of that as well, which I don't remember it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:34       Stay in here, which is your group identification. You forfeit this process. And the problem is is that the process that constructed the group is more valuable that the growth, so if you identify with your group as an authoritarian structure, then you necessarily sever your connection with the process that the group and that constitutes a form of spiritual death. So in terms of constructing the appropriate hierarchy of values, when you realize that there's something wrong with the answer of group identification to the processes of life are to the questions of life, the next stage is to recognize that there is the possibility of identifying with the process. That's what this diagram is trying to represent.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       I would say in primitive primitive cells first new aren't confined. This position is the sharman stay going through their own individual process of initiation. It isn't necessarily the group foster, and I was thinking about that this morning. It's also the case that the show, and this is interesting showman's for example, the Siberians have a working vocabulary that's many times greater than that of their compatriots who aren't shauna because they're the repository of the entire world tradition of the tribe. And which means they have the bill of rights because they're not, they're not. They don't. So it is the case that the showman is not only someone who's an individual in the true sense of the word being outside of the group, although necessary part of it. He's also the master of the group to a much greater degree than any of the people who were normally identified with it. Well that's a good lesson because what it says is 50 get here, you really have to be in there, which is something you pointed out last week that you don't get like we think, I think we think in the west, and this is one of the pathologies of primitive self help psychology that you can get from here to here. This is used to be vaguely construed without without this. And we have, of course, we love any of these intermediary stages.

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       That's a big mistake because this is literally somewhere beyond this and that means it has to be everything decision plus something else.

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       So okay, so you said in the class that we can pass on wisdom regenerations right. We think we passed on through conscious of attraction or whatever, you know, through all lot of different processes. So it seems that if it can be passed through, through, uh, through the spoken word at three stories, it seems like people don't necessarily have to go through chaos to advance to another identity. If they, if this stuff can be passed on,

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       we'll go with it. Well, the fact that the information is there, it doesn't necessarily, as you were pointing out, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're in contact with him is traumatic. Okay, hang on. I have another diagram. We'll address that problem. That's again, depends on the level at which the anomalous or current school curves basically. And there are more and less traumatic lemons. I mean, I tried to tell you a little bit about that before, the notion that, you know, if you're going somewhere and one of your ways of getting there as blocked will, that constitutes in the nautilus occurrence. But if you're going somewhere and then the place itself disappears, that's a completely different class of the dance and events in the first class. While they're all listening to this. And the second class are no homeless, but obviously having to switch plans is nowhere near as traumatic as having to switch ideals. Right? So you might think about as a qualitative difference, that's when you go up. It's not that simple. And we'll take a look at most a tree like the tree to cut it, right. It's very much, it's very much like like, like like the tree. Okay, so this is what we were discussing last week.

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       No,

Speaker 1:          00:09:52       it's obvious that people can tolerate a certain amount of normal information that's equally obvious. Then there were severities of anomalies, so to speak, that people construe as intolerable. And one of the things that we need to do is to construct a conceptual model. It will help us to determine how under what circumstances and normally is how to determine the relative, our effect and intensity of an anomalous occurrence, I guess. Because obviously some forms of normally they're trivial in some are major and it would be good to figure out under what circumstances they are trivial and maybe what circumstances their major, what are the things I want you to keep it in the back of your mind because, and this is really useful even for those of you that are interested in psychopathology, say on a scientific level here. Here's why. You know, if you develop a phobia, the theory for the development of the phobia is exposure to the thing that caused the phobia.

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       That's right. The most safe for you're afraid of mice. So, uh, but the problem with that theory is that the cure is exposure to has been very difficult in the behavioral literature to figure out why exposing yourself to the same thing that causes your problem. Curiously, when it was exposure to that thing to begin with, the doors of the problem. This is a very difficult problem. But you know, there's two types of [inaudible], two basic types and one hero is where are you accidentally and counted them knowing and then you die. And none of your myth is where you come in voluntarily and then you live. And that's the difference between the kind of exposures that creates mythology and the kind of exposure that creates healing. Because if you're a behavior therapist for example, what you do is you set up the circumstances so that the person you're trying to treat voluntarily encounters counters the anonymous experience.

Speaker 1:          00:11:37       So basically you cast them, you're doing playing her own ritual. And in the ritual you're casting the movie of the rule of the hero who's willing to encounter the enormous information voluntarily. And this isn't just a trait rereading of psychopathological literature and exposure. We know we that if you take someone who's afraid of an elevator into it, the elevator, and they avoid, because people will do that. So even if you get them in the owner, they'll not look at it if you can, if you can convince them to take the risk of really exposing themselves to the thing that they're afraid of, which basically means, obviously means to explore it and to construct a new behavioral pattern as a consequences. But then they get better. If you're agoraphobic and you're afraid of a mall and you go to the mall and your symptoms come up and you run away, and that makes your problems worse, not better.

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       If you go to the mall and your symptoms come up and you stay there as a consequence of your own choice, your symptoms, I'll hit a plateau of like an intense plot help. It'll be good. It'll deteriorate over time. And that cures you so well, Mrs Mrs and Wesson for again, I want to point out Freud's eat improvement. That's a failed hero myth because need to put some counters. He sleeps with his mother in that screening and assessment, that's accidental and he blinds himself as a consequence. So Friday. And I would say that you, that it's reasonable to make claim that Freudian psychology is a form of religion. It's based on a failed hero myth, which is as opposed to most religions that have lasted for the time material always based on successful here are immense because successful here wasn't means that application, if you don't follow that pattern, and I'll say it again so it's not successful then in the end, the eatable mint now Friday and well I don't know what, I don't know what necessary conclusions you can draw from the fact that Freud kicked the deployment and it's a fail hero myth.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       No, I don't think so. I don't know. I don't think so because like Freud thought that the homeowner was the actual mother, but that's often the case for someone who is severity neurotic with let's say the top. Let's say that when you Reutemann started from, from observation and reason and then using that analogy. Yeah, he didn't start with, he didn't start with the integral mix men. No, he started playing out there on the implications lives and then just saw in the story, but he still said and then saw the, the mythical stories that seem to map onto the experiences of the patients that he saw. But he did say, me and me, if that's the central problem of life, that's the central problem. Like, and it's universal for Freud, every culture in every culture, that's the central problem. Now that's been criticized on anthropological grounds, which aren't really relevant here, but I still think that it's more than just more than just a historical fluke, the things or manage themselves that way.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       Because he also have to realize that when Freud and Jung Split, the reason that they split, for example, it was on the question of whether or not religion survey and useful function now on Friday taking a myth. Well that was a myth of failure in a sense and said, well that's, you know, that goes to the central problem to that application. So it wasn't a premarital sexual aspect of that. Yeah, it was. But see the thing about mythologies that it represent sexual union with the mother asked the incest motif and Freud thought of that as something literal. He thought, as Freud tended to do, he offered a literal translation of something that was involved. He said that's actually what it referred to a, he was using it as an analogy that he was taking a more concrete level, which is always good in his approach would be to take the, like you said, to start with the fuel said sectionality and mythology with symbol.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       Freud said symbolism and mythology resection, right. Said that symbolism and mythology was sexual and viewing said that sexual symbolism and mythology, the sexualities mythology, the symbol that floyd was tackling sexual assaulted not. Well, yeah. Again though, that's not precisely true because it was, it was for Freud in the Victorian patients that he encountered, it was, sexuality was problematic because it was contaminated with a no, it wasn't problematic because of his sexuality. It was problematic because it was unexplored territory and unexplored territory for the Victorian neurotics half of the primary and sexual in origin. So he saw a sexuality as the presenting problem, but it wasn't. It was unexplored territory if it was any problem in the guise of sexual dysfunction. I explored territory in the consulting where it comes in all sorts of forums and it might come in the form of an unresolved relationship with your mother who is a form of God, so to speak when you're a child and you can say that for the struggling neurotic saying that this is a person who has a dependent personality disorder.

Speaker 1:          00:16:44       There is struggle with the parental situation is an analog of the process of adaptation in the world. So the parents, when you're 25 30 your parents should no longer be parents. They should be other. They should be other people who you've had an intense relationship with, but who are other people? Your parents should be someone else. By that point, if your parents are still your parents, then the battle you should be playing out in the world, it's still being played out for you and your family and Freud's neurotic patients were like that. They never got, they never made it. They never made it of here. He never made it to here much less to here. You know, they were still struggling with, well, how, how do I deal with the childhood environment?

Speaker 1:          00:17:34       The thing is that, uh, the adaptation to what we're talking about here is as it certainly seems to be appraised and our most fundamental biological systems than any, any concept, any story that you're used to talking about it. Because on some level, right to talking about the same thing. So in that sense, of course they were talking about the same thing they're talking about the most basic, right? Right. That's, that's it. Good. That's a good comment. I mean that's, that is one of the characteristics of stories that Freud cold calls the fact that his story is meaningful on multiple levels simultaneously. Now that's a good, that's a perfectly good introduction to the next diagram here. Okay. You remember though, the old diagram, you'll see the analogies here. You know which one I talked? All right.

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       Okay. So before what we had, we were a bunch of arrows here, right? This being the ends and these being the means to get there. But that's not a sufficient way of looking at the problem and since you already have mastered that way of looking at it, so we'll introduce more difficult level and that level is that all the ways of getting to an Anne are also structures that are like the whole structure, which is to say that when you're doing anything, when you engaged in any activity, you're engaged in a whole nested hierarchy of goal directed behavior and the NASA thing goes all the way down to the lowest level of analysis and all the way up to so a kind of Maine, how do you construe this while you're sitting in this class and you have a certain year and trying to attain certain goals in, in just this lecture and this lectures nasty in this class and this class is nested in your educational curriculum and your educational curriculum is nested in your, in your career goals and your career goals of nested in your culture and your culture is to then, well then it gets a little bit more difficult.

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       What's your culture has to, well, I would say it's nested in religious presuppositions. What do they nested parts, an estimate, philosophical presuppositions. Then in religious presuppositions, then in behavioral place up positions and so on. Knows how far and also down how far and even within the domain of the class, the single lecture while you're doing anything in particular that's a subgoal tenacity inside of the class like you're taking notes because this point has relevance at different levels of analysis. There's all sorts of procedures that you undertaking as the class continues anyways. Now there's different ways of thinking. This is vague by the way. This is going to be a vague lecture because some of the things that I'm talking about, you talking with you about today, I'm trying to figure out because there was some errors in my original presuppositions. I'm trying to clear them up so if you have any comments that you think are particularly insightful, I'd be more than happy to hear them say you can think of this as a corporate structure to the whole corporations going off to do something and these would be vice presidents sort of equivalent status and then each vice president would occupy a domain.

Speaker 1:          00:20:56       He has underlings and they have their particular story to, to act out in the domain of the corporation and they govern some other people and so on and so forth, all the way down to the bottom level of analysis. And even a thing like the corporation. If you think of this as a corporation or any other, any other structure for that matter. Again, corporations are nested inside of political structure that's nested inside it philosophical structure. That's why people pay. Businessmen are generally advocates, at least at least explicitly of the free market because their whole story only maintains its validity within the context of a whole network of philosophical presuppositions. Right? So, and that's the case at every single level of analysis. You know, I guess part of what we're interested in is like what's at the highest level of analysis, what's out there at the edge.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       I just wanted to ask you if you would point out where you making corrections as we go along. If one, when you said you were going to make, you said this would be a little vague because there's some mechanism corrections and measured and there's only, yeah. Well, this is slightly different than what we're basically did it with chapter four here. The idea is not necessarily different, but diagrams. No, it's still [inaudible] I'm still in the same ballpark. I'm just trying to, this is still the same. If there was any breast story, behavioral story are at odds and then you're neurotic. No, I mean that, I mean, yes, it has to be hierarchical and all this has to be subjugated to ask the question, what does it have to be subjugated to? That's why I put this, this diagram up.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       Well look, there's going to be lots of situations where you can have a story, a story B and they're going along in parallel and there's no problem whatsoever. Just like there are lots of cases where culture, Asian culture be occupied in the same territory more or less, no problem. But then now and then a historical event and that event points out those areas where those two parallel stories actually conflict. So look, for a most of us, most of us Westerners so to speak, are the educated population. There is a conflict for us, I think between how we act and our moral presuppositions and how we conceive of the universe. From the scientific perspective, it's a big conflict. Well, most of the time it doesn't make any difference, but now and then it makes a big difference. And in the, when we only, when you say that someone's psychologically integrated or when you say someone, when you see someone who has an impeccable character, that might mean I'm looking at it. What you see is the fact that all their stories take one story because they're not working at cross purposes. So you can be offering different stories.

Speaker 1:          00:24:04       Well, superstructure, if you're an integrated, you have a superstructure that I think is relatively explicit to which all your other brands are made subject, which is the credit. And then the question is what constitutes the king? You could look at this at Lawrence of different levels of analysis. Okay. You say, well, all your different motivational subsystems have to operate in harmony, right? So each of them has to take all of the others into account. The vice presidents. Well, that might be one way of looking at it. Sure. I mean there's, I was thinking more in intro psyche and speaking. You have to eat, you have to sleep, you need social contact, et Cetera, et cetera. There's all these basic preconditions for your existence that have to be mad, all of those, and you have specialized biological subsystems that are responsible for ensuring that one of those particular needs is math and the way those systems ensure that is by, I think by gripping your fantasy when something within you is out of kilter.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       So for example, if you're in this class, you have need for five hours while I'm talking intrusive thoughts about what you might need afterwards are going to pop into the theater of your mind because that's the subsystem that's responsible for maintaining your caloric intake is not being satisfied by your current state of goal directed activity. Your job to adapt is to organize all those motivational subsystems into a unit such that none of them conflict and so that all of the more towards the same man so that all of them get what they need. Well. Also paying attention to the fact that every other one gets what it means. Now, the same thing exactly can be said about your relationships with other people, because you could say just as you have to take all of your needs into account, you're operating in a social environment and to take all your needs into account also means to take into account the needs of everyone that you come into contact with.

Speaker 1:          00:26:08       So it's also the, it's, it is the case. Even that when you're trying to modulate the environment so that you get what you have to get a lot of the environment that you're modulating his other people. So there's a nice amorphism between the way you construct your internal hierarchy and the way that the social hierarchy round, he was constructed, unnecessary isomorphism networks all the way up. Now, the Mesopotamians, they asked, they asked the question, who should be king? And on the mythical level, that means who should determine destinies. And what that means is how it should behave. They're operating under what ages and the Enuma Elish, which is their creation story, says all gods should be subordinate to Martech. Martech, the garden goes up to the unknown, creates the world, and that's what this diagram is about, right? That's your group identification. So that's a provision, lance to the problem with that adaptation question is though, what should everything be subordinate to including your group?

Speaker 1:          00:27:08       I think medication, which is your particular solution to your motivation problems on that's everything should be subordinate to the process that generates new inflammation out of the encounter with them and updates known territory. That's okay. So then to, to get right back to your question, all your stories should be arranged in a hierarchy such that the highest story, his allegiance with the process that engages in creative contact with the unknown and to the degree that that's not the case, then you've deviated from the path. So for example, there's another new testaments during their crisis, it's more theirs. He's driving on a cart with the rich man and rich man says, what do I have to do to get into heaven and crisis? We have to sell everything you own. And all the disciples that are just flabbergasted by this, you know, they don't like this.

Speaker 1:          00:28:01       I said, well, if that's the case, there's no hope. No one's going to do that. And then of course, as well as easier for account and go through the avenue in which men and they're having now the reason for that, it has nothing to do with money. It has nothing to do with money. It has to do with the relative importance of goals. He says, if, because this young guy is so preoccupied with this wealth and maintaining it, which is this, but he won't risk this to do this, and so all that that story is pointing out is that if you want this and you won't risk this to do this, then you don't get this, which is what you really want. Even though you don't know it's your money is just a proxy for that. It's false security.

Speaker 3:          00:28:48       There's a copy machine right outside the door for one second. Okay. I think we could write notes on it. Would you consider that?

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Look, one of the things that need cheap ass, late 18 hundreds was our, their neurosis of health. And by that he meant can you be properly adopted to pathological circumstance of [inaudible]? Yes. It's like when you say crime of obedience, what you say is adherence to this and the sacrifice of this. That's why most people are a little bit before. Well, it's also looked like it was like, you know, one of the things that the 20th century is having struggle with is the notion of crimes against humanity. It's right because the Nazi would say and and accurately would say, look, I'm a trivial individual. I'm just doing my job. I was following orders that move down the hierarchy. It wasn't my responsibility. No. Normally, not only was it not my responsibility, but I wasn't doing what I should have done. And you can say, well, those people were just rationalizing their behavior.

Speaker 1:          00:30:02       But the point is, is that they're making a valid statement. But the Nuremberg trial says, look, for reasons we don't understand, which is to say for for reasons we can't make explicit, there are certain rules you can break even if you're, even if you're morally operate from this perspective, which is to say there's certain rbc you can't fall. I think that's tough, isn't it? Because if you're a soldier in the war time and your commander say three or four levels of hierarchy up says, you know, shoot these villagers and you don't shoot them, your dad. But the number of Charles says, tough luck. Basically there are, um, there are certain orders you can't fall. And then the question is, well, what does that mean? There are certain orders you can fall. Well, it means that there's something outside of what you can define explicitly or what your culture is defined explicitly or it doesn't mean anything. I would say, well, the crime against humanity, this is the definition. You do what this says instead of what this says. And that's the definition.

Speaker 4:          00:31:09       Perhaps it just means that to, you realize,

Speaker 1:          00:31:19       okay, in the in the tire, which would be the person who gave you the order? Yeah. In the first one it tells you that you shouldn't well enough. They don't know why. Fair enough. Although I like I, I think that, I do think that the Nuremberg trials were, I don't think that it's reasonable to construe them as, as the response of one tire need to, the excesses of enough. I don't think so. I think there's more to it than that. Even though you know, for the person who's caught in the middle, I mean they're in trouble or it looks the same. That's true.

Speaker 4:          00:31:53       That's true. How do you go?

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       Well that's the whole last half of the course just because that's what I'm interested in is like, because of these isoboards isms exist. But I mean, the simple answer to that is that your, your personal response to anomalous information in a way that's not trivial determines the course of your culture in a way that like, which seems complete. That seems like a completely ridiculous statement,

Speaker 4:          00:32:20       but I still think it's true. So

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       culture that's made up of people who take the character logically negative stairs towards it, homeless information back. So that's a fascist state. That's why well thing about a fascist state and Scott, just the structure, it's a, you have to remember that our current states, our bodies of law, which means they're, they're explicit descriptions of behavioral patterns that when put into operation are actually embodied. It's right there rules about how to act, which is to say what a state is, is this is a description of an ideal personality. All the laws in this state constitute the description of an ideal personality. Because what the law says is at least you can't do this. So in this it defining is what you should be by exclusion, right? And all those things that you can do, well that makes up the ideal citizen and everyone who's the member of the same culture is a duplicate of that ideal citizen.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       So then the question again is what's the ideal citizen? And someone who's bureaucratically and client will say, well, the ideal citizen does exactly what the hell you tell him to do. And that makes everyone predictable. But then there's this leap above that morality which says, well, no, the ideal citizen knows what to do and what not to do according to the rules. But when the circumstances change or when the circumstances call for it, then there's another morality that supersedes the group identity on upon which group structure is necessarily maintain. That's the thing that's so interesting has been the harder you try to ensure that these boundaries are impermeable, the more likely you are to kill everything that's inside here.

Speaker 4:          00:34:12       Just social around the identity was the hardest question for anyone who is, what should I do? That's what so is it through the goal?

Speaker 1:          00:34:24       Well, yes. That's sure. Sure. Look, we do not want to ever make the mistake of presuming that there are tremendous advantages to staying inside here. I mean it's, there's no anomaly. What? What's the problem? Well, there's no interest. I mean because if you are by definition, if you exclude novelty, you exclude incentive reward. So what happens is that you get protection at the cost of, of all the interest in life. Now what this alternative route says, well, if you do, if you face the anomalous information, there's enough interest generating there, which is enough hope so to speak, that that in itself will provide a barrier against all of the negative potentialities. They don't occur as a consequence of doing this, which is to say if you're willing to take the leap outside, there are phenomena that you will encounter there that will protect you from all the negative things that you've encountered.

Speaker 1:          00:35:18       So here, everything is predictable but sterile. That's why mythology and it kingdom ruled by a tire and everything dries up, right? The river's disappeared, the trees died, the grass dies. Everything's dad and everything's old. But as you just pointed out with the Nuremberg trials, that's not necessarily true. You jump outside, you're quite likely to end up dead depending on what, how, on how strong the of the people who are trying to learn bird didn't jump outside. No, but I mean you, I was referring back to the elephant is the fascist state. You were discussing the person, if someone four or five levels up orders you to kill these villagers. Yes. If you don't do it, you're dead. I mean, and that's joe and that's jumping out. So I have to read the second volume of the Gulag archipelago because that answers that question and there's no simple answer to it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:03       So because let's say if you want to start the book, there's a chapter at the end which you protein in the personality texted last year called the soul and barb wire. And this is exactly the issue that Solzhenitsyn discusses that says when the price for stepping outside of his death, then what? Wow. Read the book because it's the only, it's the only book. I know that there have been other books written like that. I mean he really address either, I mean, either you die or you or you stay in well, well, well is not, not necessarily because the thing is the threats for stepping outside their real, it's like this, this chaos might've been death. I mean this is a real thing. You know, it's not just the, it's not just a circle. That's right. It's fun just to see a glow in the mall might kill.

Speaker 1:          00:36:55       I mean, people get depressed and then they should themselves, you know, it's like this is really dangerous and one of the things that might have to use might get killed. That's why in one of the standard features of a hero mythology is the negative encounter with the group, right? Quality in the New Testament story of, for example, Christ is exposed to this appears all, all who've said, kill him. And so that's the price for stepping outside, even though theoretically he's, he's the embodiment of the process. That revitalizes group last week you talked a little bit about the MTA, right? Right. Well, that's what this is trying to represent.

Speaker 1:          00:37:37       What's the motivation for fronting that much? What is it that motivates someone to step two? Well, I would say, again, it's anomalous information here full. I see it's full of this, but why don't characterize it motivates a movement. Yeah. Well, you know, the simple answer to that was faith. One of the things that human said that was useful, the voter religious tradition and the use of religious traditions and psychotherapy, isn't it? If prior to the dawn of empirical medicine, um, uh, cultural, uh, medical personality, if you were suffering from a particular disease would tell you a story about a god who had the same problem and your mythical participation in the adventures of that God would constitute and curative ritual. Some of these rituals are very, very elaborate. Now you could say that the purpose of a religion in the sense is to provide you with a body of images that describes how this process works and then points out in the sense that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it's like identification with that image can sort of provide a barrier against all the chaos that's outside of the group.

Speaker 1:          00:39:07       So that's what I identification with the central figure of a given religion. That's what that's supposed to do. So it's, it's almost, look, here's an example, vampire movie vampires hate crosses, right? There are a vampire is a symbol of the unknown. There's some sexual contamination there as a general rule too, but it's a night creature. The Sun destroys it and you can be protected against it by the cross is one of the things that works in horror stories. And I frequent the occurrences. This backfires after a priest and he holds up across in, it's glowing when he's out of there and then the priest gets afraid and the glow goes away and the vampire eats them. It doesn't exactly the same notion. Takes his bloody way. Well it's ident well anyways, that was the best answer. That question I think. Okay. So the first thing I want to say is that, so you, you call the second level up their identity identification with the group, right?

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       It's adolescence because that's out of the license. Now you said that even when you do, when you try to be an individual, you still part of a group of people who think that they're individuals. So I would say it would be possible to, to think of that the top oval as identification with a group who's, who's, uh, main motivation is the process. Yeah. I think that's still possible. And the second thing I want to say is, um, what is it? That's a perfectly reasonable way of looking at it. Although it's a group composed of people whose job is to revive my screws. So it's not a group, it's not a group. It's a medic group. [inaudible] group. No, no. This is an important point because one of the things that I brought up yesterday or last week was there's two types of primary philosophical question in a Samsung scope relative.

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       First question is, what is the good, and that's a question, but then there's a medic question, which is what is the nature of the process? The provides answers to the question, what is the good? Now a group answers the question. So what is the good being an arts? What is the nature of the process that allows you to answer the question? What is the good, well, that's identification with them. That group and [inaudible] group is the group of all individuals whose job is to revitalize the group. So I think that is possible to fit in that that, okay, fine,

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       fair enough. The second thing I'm going to say is that I don't think that it's possible for everyone to attain that level. Although I'd like to. I don't, what do you mean not possible? I think that some people, uh, temperament wise or not. So you say that the top level, uh, um, no, the monsters you encounter. Exactly. You're so right. Right, right, right, right, right, right. Okay. Right. So, but you've said that Shamans, you said Shamans are people in that upper oval, right? I would say. Okay. So now the, the Mayans and Aztecs do believe that not everyone can be a showman. That's true. That only certain people with certain, uh, unconscious, uh, you know, it's just of unconscious strength could be one. And so I think that it's, you know, some people just have a,

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       okay, again, I want to go talking and say, well, that's a perfectly reasonable objection in a sense, but it's also the case that heroism in the sense, so curves and different levels of [inaudible]. Right. So let's, I want to show you another dining room.

Speaker 4:          00:42:43       Well, we asked, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:53       Oh, well here, let's do a simpler one first. So there was this side here, right? That's how your plans are actually organized and under some circumstances, you know, planning your plan B and they're both more or less what this is as good as the other. That doesn't really work. But it's a reasonable way of, because almost always you do plan a because it's better than plan b. At least they think of it. So we didn't, it occupies a position that's higher up in the hierarchy and you'll shift down to plan B if you have to. So that's where I've said, well you have two alternative plans and this would be the representation where, well, no, you just, it's only one plan. This and ask is ultimately you can only do one thing at a time. That's the problem. That's the problem. That's right. That's why, that's actually why we have interests.

Speaker 1:          00:43:40       Like in conflict, I think we have one output apparatus and a dozen input around says and only one gets control at a time. So that's the nature of quotes. Like this is when a motivational system, they say run like hell and motivation be just to be, to say, well, let's get something to eat and motivational system C is saying, well, we should actually go visit our friends, so that's conflict and there's all to get all this record. It's one on foot. That's right. That's an effective just regulation and went up with a service. That's true. That's true. That's what we're hoping for. One output that serious, all goals fall. All of those are valid. That's what we're looking for. What behavioral pattern best satisfies all conceivable motivational goals in a social context composed of individuals who are doing exactly the same thing, but that'll have to be completed over time.

Speaker 1:          00:44:36       There's more, there's more to it that works over time. It's stable enough to maintain itself and flexible enough to readjust. That's the criteria for the southern shit that's missed it in. Yes, temp temporality makes a big difference because what works. That's why authority. Another traction for authoritarian societies is they work but not for very long. They're not very good at, don't have very good at power transitions. When the king dies, all of the people that he squashed or just squashed paypal does not make very good kings, sort of makes the authoritarian state the client. So, okay, now let's look at how you actually maybe choose between different alternatives. Now this is, this kind of touches on some of the things we discussed yesterday. If you know, this is a, this is an interesting question. You fail a test and uh, well that blows your course goal. Let's say your core school was getting any, now you're going to get a seat and maybe it has some trends, even effects on your educational attainment, some even more trans effects on career. Okay. The Valence of the normals, inflammation, which is the b minus shifts with your framework of reference, right? With regards to this course, it's a catastrophe. With regards to my education, it's an inconvenience with regards to my career.

Speaker 4:          00:46:09       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       It's tricky with regards to my life. It's a nonentity, right? So you can switch the valence of, uh, an anomalous, the valence on the anomalous piece of information shift with frame of reference. That's a useful thing to know. Okay. So here's the idea. If you're trying to get from here to here and you have a plan but it doesn't work, right? So within that larger frame of reference, you undergo a small descends into chaos and you can come up with another plan. But the chaos here, this deals with some of the issues you talked about. If you me at one time too about the idea that the chaos that was outside was also inside. Well that's how it works as far as I can tell, is that the effect of valence of this particular anomalous piece of information is bounded by a larger story. Okay? So the thing is is it's a drag that you get a b minus from the perspective of the course. But if you pop by the valence of that anomaly is bounded by the fact that it's really not going to hurt your education goals that much and then it's not going to affect your career at all. So you have, there's a domain, there's a domain in which the anomalous inflammation is actually valid and there's a whole bunch of domains where it isn't.

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       Now, the problem is sometimes you encountered anomalous piece of information who's Valence is unbounded and blows apart whole structures of stories. So let's say this is a bit of a different circumstance. You're hovering on the edge of it except for filigree. For medical school, it's like one more b minus your over there. So you have a professor that everybody gets along with except you can you get a d minus for, you know, this is the end of medical school plus there's this other residual mystery leashes. Why does everybody except you get along with this person. Maybe this is also something you've noticed it on the classes. It's like this particular piece of anomalous information. The domain is very unbounded, right? It blows the chorus. It blows the educational table. We'll say all you are going to university for us to be a doctor. That's it.

Speaker 5:          00:48:24       It's like the rest of it. It was a means to an end and that's it. You're not interested in biology. Have no alternate. That's right. You don't have any other legs to stand on. That's right. You've sacrificed your own interest even, which is a dangerous thing to do in pursuit of this bound donated stability that's gone well. Then you have a piece of anomalous information that's here. It just below his whole sequences of stories and you're depressed. So the larger the area inside each of these, sorry, these are the turtles all the way down in the Roseville firmness and the turtles go all the way down anyways.

Speaker 5:          00:49:04       Anyways, the broader the domain that the anomalous information destroys, the more of your life falls into pieces. So that's why. Well, you can think of in terms of group behavior, to the degree that you and I share a goal, a threat to that story will unite us as a group. So let's say the Republicans hate universities. We both like universities. Well, therefore us, for the purposes of that particular event, we constitute group. But if the Republicans hate, no, let's say we go in the university administration, the Dean hates science, but really likes the humanities and you're in the humanities and the sciences. Well, we're two different groups all of a sudden. That's right. The anomalous information has a different valence for us. Our goals determined, which are because we've identified with a group or goals are going to determine the information. Also from cards, the kids in group.

Speaker 4:          00:50:01       This is easier to understand that there's all kinds of information that complained you into despair that don't seem to be directly related to any plan of action.

Speaker 5:          00:50:17       Okay. Next Diagram. No, this is how this is really good. I just, because there isn't any accident. It's not a golden record. That's right. That's the, that's the brief answer to that. Look what this story does. What

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       a story does literally is provide all the events that you encounter with determinants significance and they're all construed. The significance of any event is construed with regards to its to its perceived relationship to a goal. Okay. Say that it's the loss of your mother. That doesn't seem to affect any story that you can say you put your finger on. Okay. Well then the question is, look, this is tough. This is a really tough issue. I'm glad you brought it up because a lot of the stories that we participate in aren't explicit. We can't state what they are. You know, for example, I may indication you, you can think about it. If you think this is accurate, you take something like the American constitution. Okay. That's an explicit body of rules that defines a state so that's a bounded, don't make mistake but it's predicated the first of that chapter he pointed out in a Thomas Kuhn, no current go down and sending them any assistance internally.

Speaker 1:          00:51:26       Coherent and complete isn't necessarily is predicated on preset positions that can be proved for wind from within the system. Okay. He's talking about this. I think this infinite regressive systems say, well you can look at, you play the geometries example except the first five axioms. Then you're in the story in a way you go but you have to accept those axioms on faith and I would say, well those axioms are actually nasty in another story and that story in term is nested in another story in and so on and so forth. As far as you want to look. The American constitution for example, is predicated on these on natural rights. That's how I read it anyways, is that, which is an national rights are a brief description, some exquisite, some implicit of what it means to be human or what being human means. It means lots of things.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       It means that you're equal before God. That would be the most fundamental presupposition and that's a weird question that deals with your request and to some degree about the capability of everybody to get to that highest level of achievement. While the constitution is predicated on the notion that everyone has that capacity, everyone universally equally, but everyone has the capacity to follow. They go back, but not necessarily to go to a certain level. That's true. The level of the activity is individual specific. That's why you have individual interests. That's right. That's what makes you individuals, those things that appeal to you and your domain of competence is unique, but still the capacity to engage in this process at some level, we don't care what the problem is as long as you're an to find with the process you're identifying with the process. Anyways, back to the idea of the constitution.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       Well. So it's predicated on these presuppositions that I think have religious, they, they're derived from religious presuppositions, especially the idea of equality of all individuals. Before we go on like that, that idea is when its explicit form that's 2000 years old. Before that it sort of hung around. The Egyptians thought that the higher level of aristocrats who are perhaps equivalent to the pharaoh in terms of their potential for a motel, but it wasn't made explicit till about 2000 years. So it was implicit. So it was the kind of story before it was explicit. It was in some other form. So the question is, we're not conscious of all her stories, which is for me to say what I mean by that is that although we have stories some of the weekend, we don't know they're there. We can explain what they mean. Some of our stories and the best we can do is transmit them in images.

Speaker 1:          00:53:57       Some of them that we know even less, well the best we can do is act out. Okay. Does that, does that make any sense? It's like we had religious stories. They'd guarded their behavior. They constituted the basis for our unions into groups. We had these stories, but we didn't know what they meant. So the story was it encoded in the form of image and action and not coated in the form of any sort of explicit content. You couldn't say what it meant. So you're also saying, hey, we've got a nice story. Tell him, well, that gas, that's exactly the case. At least that our stories, it's a causal loop, right? Where does he tell the story? Modifies the behavior, but I would say to the degree that you can draw a temporal influences, the behavior precedes the description of the behavior at least as often as the description proceeds in the behavior it needs.

Speaker 1:          00:54:48       You pointed out then like most most western or just sort of have this assumption that we construct it more rules than we follow. Nature said, Donald, we have more rules than we're embedded in our behaviors. We observe the, we told stories about them. Then we dissected the stories and we came up with general principles. Then once have you formulated the general principles, we turned around and said that the fact that the general principles existed were the reasons for the behavior wrong, although north completely, because once you can tell the story and once you can make the most explicit, that can change your behavior, although it's not so easy.

Speaker 5:          00:55:27       Yeah. You were saying that this case, do you think that that would be stage?

Speaker 1:          00:55:36       No, because usually what, what what religious means is it means dogma, norm spirit, right? The reason that the church and the state were separated but I think was quite simple. You have to make a distinction when you talk about religious structures, the explicit beliefs and the spirit that moves the entire religion. It's the same distinction that Dostoyevsky was turning, making the crab, the dogmatic, pardon? The Catholic Church is tyrannical, absolutely tyrannical. All it is concerned with is the position, but then there's this other part. This signified a Dostoevsky story by Christ. When those two cards come into contact with them, the dogmatic aspect attempts to kill the creative aspect, but in Dostoevsky story entirely, let smoke the back door, which is again, that's why that's a brilliant story. So the problem with the state and religious because then the religion becomes dogma and that's, and I think part of the reason that the church in the state are separated, your part is to stop, is another barrier stopping that from happening.

Speaker 1:          00:56:42       But I would also say that the American state, it is religious as Protestant and it's structured conflict. Right. You know what I said about organized religion being designed to prevent you from having a religious experience. Right, right. Well, yeah. So that's, that's where the dog with us and a good thing too, it's a good thing because prior to the adolescent stage, you don't want that sort of experience. Like you don't want to expose your child to the unknown if you want to expose them in very measured doses, under controlled conditions, in a secure environment. And then only when, only when you can't do that anymore. You say, well, you're on your own. And the reason you say that is because it's true. It's like you know, your mother can get dates for you. That's just a condition of life, eastern intention. That's just reality. So, right.

Speaker 1:          00:57:34       We were talking about implicit stories. So let's look at how these stories get constructed. This is an idea. Yeah, this is, okay. So here's your nasty story structure, right? All the way down. There are stories. Well, how did the stories come about? Well, they come about empiricism. Why put that in? For reasons we can argue about that. These are all different ways that we figure out how to behave and sometimes we figure out how to behave here and we moved back here, but sometimes we figured out how to behave here and we move up here and each of these levels in forms and alters all the other levels for those stories that are most profound stories that we really understand poorly. What's happened. Well, if you put four people on an island and they can't talk, they're deaf and dumb, they're going to organize their behavior into a particular structure and that structure takes into account fee.

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       Right now we're assuming that it's a a healthy society. People say, well, that's relativistic, right? There's lots of different sorts of healthy societies. I think that's a crock by the way, but anyways, they're going to, they have a set number of problems to solve and the problems are how does each individual fulfill those tasks they have to fulfill in order to live in the presence of the other people who are doing the same thing in a domain that's bounded by whatever resources happened to be there. So there these people who can't talk can't use language. We're going to modify each other's behavior by an exchange of information,

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       reinforcements, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishments like we always modify each other's behavior in every social interaction by gesture and look and attention and inattention, they're going to construct a way of being that has this structure. None of them are going to be able to say what it is say now take that analogy is just an idea in imagination and extend that to groups that can boast thousands of people who'd been interacting over hundreds of thousands of years. It's all that social behavior from all that social behavior emerges as a pattern in so far as the culture is successful, we imitate behaviors that we see as successful. We play with the invitations and ritualize the play and dramatize the rituals and then we collect our information about how to behave it damages. We formalize it into myths.

Speaker 5:          01:00:21       Once you have a religion established, which is a codify description of acceptable behavioral patterns, you can start drawing general rules from it. Then you can start criticizing so forth and so on. Each emergent level of abstraction alters the function of all the previous levels and that's how we construct our stories. Now the danger of course is that having abstract and up the story, they part of the story, you can criticize it and destroy it without even understanding what it was. The dealer then you were destroyed. We knocks and I think that's what we've done. Once we go up to this level, all of these levels we were storing to behavior and analyze it. We developed a scientific methodology and said, that's not what the universe is like. Bang everyone. All the stories.

Speaker 5:          01:01:18       Well, it's just the stories philosophy. Well because, okay, well the bridge from philosophy rationalities isn't too too, it doesn't seem to be qualitatively different. I mean science was originally called, right, but look what are all I would say here. Is that up to this point, right? Yes. That's why I said I didn't know if I should put this in. It is confused. Absolutely. Then that's probably the problem with this particular diagram. Something happened here. What happened here was that from here to here when we said knowledge of the world, what we meant was knowledge of world pots, knowledge of how to behave. When we got to hear what we said was that the world was a place where fact that the world was a place of facts and we saw that the world of facts wasn't constructed. The way the world that you act in was constructed in our images, which is to say there isn't a garden handling devil man.

Speaker 5:          01:02:30       Isn't that the center of the university? From a factual perspective and all these, and from the empirical perspective, it seems very unlikely that the world was created in seven days and so on and so forth. And it looks like there was evolution and that really played havoc with this whole sequence of stories. The problem was these stories were about the world as a place to APP and not about the world as a collection of facts. So made a category error here, I think, and undermined our belief in our accumulated how old shoe without ever understanding explicitly. So that maybe shouldn't be there, but it does come at the end of the process of abstraction, I think from an historic perspective. So does that help you still have a residual concern now?

Speaker 2:          01:03:23       I think the enthusiasm that you have, there's empiricism criticism that that everyone else thinks is empiricism. Empiricism that that you would like us to attain.

Speaker 5:          01:03:32       No, sorry. No, you shouldn't get that complicated with this. I mean I just put down, I just put that here because it looked to me like it was at the end of the historical chain of development. But it's qualitatively different in some ways than these things. Okay. This represents a store like, well part, it's complicated because you shouldn't have stories. But I would say yes but, but it's not, it's not so simple because we had religion at only afterwards. No, no, that's the problem. That's why it's, no, no, no I didn't. There should be arrows back and forth all the way off but okay, so because that's what I said, every time a new level emerges, it modifies all the previous levels and all the levels that are in front of it. So you get, you get this Lupo cutting a multi dimensional causal loop of phenomenon. But it does also seem to be a certain amount of historicity to it. Which is to say that rational philosophy or even philosophy say that at least as an emergent property, maybe of complex language you use, it's only been around for 5,000 years possibly. So it seems, it's hard to say. Do is what pre empirical Sharman engaging comparable to philosophy? Well, I don't know either and there's a lot of arguments about this. I'm not thinking of this as a simple historical progression, but there's a historical aspect to it I think.

Speaker 2:          01:04:55       Whereas here it is a qualitative, um, la, it's a hierarchy because it seems like in is a point at which you can, you can talk, you can start experimenting with not only objects and facts, but also with, with myths. And you can start talking about religions in the, in an objective manner I guess, which is what you want to be able to do with what you're teaching. Well, that's possible. So, but your philosophy

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       is, is thinking about these ideas of behavior. Empiricism is actually testing out these ideas and behavior and subject to when you have a philosophy that some of what Moses, a formulaic way, I mean it's clear a lot of play back and forth. I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have put this in here because when you've used [inaudible] instead of what it is in terms of what it does to the things that came before it. That's true. That's true. That's the match space of food. The reason that it's in there is because it does. That's a very good point. It has an effect on because each of these emergent abilities has an effect on everything that goes before the new imperialism has, has uh, has a dramatic effect on our, on our ability to believe. The stories that were constructed at this point is with regards to the historicity of it.

Speaker 5:          01:06:06       It is the case that we organized our behavior before we understood how we did. So our, our capacity here in here seems to be filing genetically more ancient than our task is farther on down the line. They also seem to be more linguistically depending on as you move down the chain, it's right. You get a lot of inventory of behavior and invitation with primates a lot and they can move a lot of information around that way. Lord, Cultural Information and certainly it's the case that much of the information that we get from each other, hookers it down a level and I think that's fine. Genetically more ancient Merlin. Donald, you're never heard of the dorm. He was here for a while. I was a visiting scholar. You gave a quote a couple of years back. He wrote a whole book on about a third of the book is called the evolution of the motor mind on the role of imitation.

Speaker 5:          01:06:53       My nieces, he calls it his culture constructing role. These are place that communicating information about behaviors about, yeah, that's right. That's right. Okay. That's what they're what? Not only that their ways of constructing stories like Elliot, he points out, for example, in the Polynesians go fishing with a polynesian goes fishing and feminine are Pretty Empirical Polynesian. He adopts the guys of the ancestral hero who first fish for the Polynesians. Now Eliana has pointed out that if you go back three generations in pretty literate cultures, all the historical events that occurred before that are sort of telescope into the time that existed before the present time and all they remember is the things that they should remember, which is how to act and how to act. Which in this case is how to fish, is to imitate the ritual model efficient, which is all the Polynesians collection of successful behaviors.

Speaker 5:          01:07:52       About how to catch fish that had been stored and transmitted down the generations using this sort of process. They imitate, say, well, maybe they are. You can imagine the Polynesian children playing out the fishing routine. It's a ritual as well. Who knows? And that culture, maybe it's also something that's dramatic. I don't know. So I think more more than a historical chain. This is a chain of obstruction and it increases as you go down, and I think it's roughly analogous to this behavioral information moves from here to here to here. First we are, then we make images of reduction. Then we tell stories about the end of this, of the action.

Speaker 5:          01:08:37       Then we use words to describe the images of the action that is a store. So when I read your Shakespeare in play, I'm using words to activate memories in your imagination of behavioral patterns and that's where the inflammation is. It's not in the words. That's why people have said that Shakespeare knew everything. That for ideas for example. That's how I tried to think it explicit. Shakespearian still implicit still. I would say most of your information scale here and this system is just killing me. That's what you do with the kids too. Anyways, the point of all of this was to kind of describe our stories be constructed and you'd asked the questions wrong stories that are implicit to me. You're saying anomalous event, old curves and you say, well frank the mother and uh, you can't say what story disrupt. Well, I would say that's in large part because as you move out to larger and larger scale structures of stories, in a sense you moved back in a sense you move backwards in time.

Speaker 5:          01:09:46       God, well, yeah, because the, the stories get more and more archaic and less and less explicit. So I, you could ask the average undergraduate what are the presuppositions of the American constitution and they might be able to list off the rights and then you say, well, what's outside of that? Well, the English Libertarian tradition, English new contribution. Okay. That's philosophy. That's outside of that. Well then then you might get the answer. Well, it's the Judeo Christian culture in the western tradition. Okay. Things are starting to get pretty vague at that point, which is to say that the outer levels are still mostly implicit. And then the question is what does implicit me? And I would say, well what it means is that the information there is still lodged mostly in image and in coded in behavior, but not explicit. So here's another example. There's a group of two year olds, pre verbal, two year olds, because I grew up for two year olds.

Speaker 5:          01:10:52       They're all acting in a very complex manner. And you go in there and you study, you're trying to derive rules like piaget for their behavior. It lists all these rules, say the children are behaving according to those worlds, which is wrong. They don't know the rules. They can't say that. Now if you say they're behaving good rules, what you're saying is that there are rules that can, that can be followed but not stated. The polls described. Yeah, but okay, okay, fair enough. And I would say, well that's what we're doing to the rules described our rules and describe our behavior, but the behavior precedes the rules. So in what form are the rules? If they're not explicit, like the children are acting out patterns that you could use words to describe as rules, where are the patterns? What are they, where are they? Well, they're certainly in the children's behavior, so I would say they're coded into procedural memory.

Speaker 5:          01:11:53       How do we get there? The children, the children watched their parents act and imitating and played with the invitation plus in their social intercourse, not only with their parents but with their parents. Their behavior is constantly being modified by the exchange of reinforcers. So that constructs a pattern which you can use rules to described. You can use words to describe where you can tell a story about the child's behavior, which is what you very [inaudible], what he would spend all day studying kids and he went home. You'd said, I saw the cutest thing today. Then you tell the story and that would be a way of getting the information about this behavior out. A few levels of abstraction you can codify it to, I'd say you're engaged in this process, so as you go out levels of analysis, you go back in time. That's one way of looking at it. You also moved from the explicit to the implicit increasing. So when you say an anomalous event occurs and I can identify the story, it affects, I would say, well, it's having an impact out of story level of it's not explicit.

Speaker 5:          01:13:03       Absolutely. Absolutely. It's unconscious. It's coated in these images. It's coded in the myths. We're not aware of just telling stories and we're acting it out. We're, we're acting it out. But look, if if, let's say you're severely psychopathological and you go in, you see a psychologist and you say, this is my ideal future, but this is always what keeps happening. Well, I would say there's no isomorphism between what's happening here and what's being stated here, which is to say the person's actions act of a story that the person does not know explicitly, which is why union said you should know the myth that you're lending to me if outbreaks here and here and Mcclellan has noted the same sort of thing. I think it's something that is very much analogous. He says that that's why he looks at the thematic apperception test your explicit statements about who you are and what you want.

Speaker 5:          01:13:58       Do not match your episode with representations and if you want to predict behavior, this is to point anyways. You look here, not here. So when he's looking for things like need for achievement, which I think is really interesting cause that's Carol and long cultures that have a lot of need for achievement, like themes in their children's stories have higher socioeconomic status and that's because those are here in this, the coding here, people act them out there, talk to the kids. It's all unconscious. Then the question is what is unconscious mean? This is what it means. It's coated in behavior or it's an image. It's not yet explicit. So this is also a way of kind of trying to address the idea of the collective unconscious in a more differentiated manner. See what it might be. Sorry, but back to my mother. Yes.

Speaker 5:          01:14:54       Every, anything owe my entire life. Takes all the energy out of your options in notes, listen way, I can't tie it in. And did you go there? There was nothing that I was going to do for that I can't do no right or that I shouldn't do. Now in school serves a purpose just date, which implicitly includes your one goal as a state. Well, it also, it also might, mortality is a good, a good issue because the problem with with the, the dramatic demonstration of mortality is that it's the form of, it's a form of anomalous information that can Noriko your highest levels of stories that I heard. There is severe repercussions because I'm faced with my own mortality.

Speaker 5:          01:15:41       I have no, I would say that this is more and more, more particularly the severe repercussions are because the story that you've been telling yourself no longer maintains its validity in the light of an event. That's not dramatic because I would say what? That's an indication that the story you've been telling yourself does not include the fact of mortality as a constituent element and is therefore vulnerable to bad as an intrusive event, which is to say you don't have a story that makes sense of mortality and most of the Times shall we go with go ahead.

Speaker 3:          01:16:12       Okay. I was just going to say also I think a mother is a culture of other is the guy for how to behave in the face of the night.

Speaker 5:          01:16:22       That's certainly the case officer.

Speaker 3:          01:16:23       Well, that way if you lose a mother, you've really lost. You've lost your means of knowing how to behave right in the face of anomalous information.

Speaker 5:          01:16:33       No, that's the last of the process because you can't go back to your mother and find out how to deal with new information here. Here's an example. That's a very good point. That's much simpler than the way I was. I was going about it. Agoraphobic women often experience a dramatic loss in the pre developmental period of their pathology and agoraphobic people, I think are people whose stories that collapse completely for fear of, it's basically fear of leaving any place that's viewed as secure. So when you used to be called fear of open spaces, but it's more like it's fear of being away from security, fear to Ventura, fear of being away from hospitals or doctors or actually figures of authority is really what it boils down to. So you're a 45 or 50 year old woman, your husband dies, your developmental history is, you're a dependent child. You married at the age of 17 you relied on your husband to make his decisions and he's divorced. It's like what's happened is your culture has disappeared because your mode of adaptation was normally what does my husband, so it's recourse to authority. So there's a little authoritarian drama going on in your family and the tyrant and became just die a your own thorough information. Specific goals under what circumstances?

Speaker 5:          01:18:02       Either. Yeah, either. It's a huge, yeah. So either it's a huge impact because there are some super story implicit in which having your mother is a big part. Right. Realize this, find that story somewhere or you've lost your mode of adaptation, which is that's another cost, which is the process. Your ability now to take Allen's information guide and then reintegrate. You feel you've lost that, right? That kind of grant. That is literally the case with children. Right. If they lose it, their parents, it's like because they're motivated. The childhood mode of adaptation is authoritarian more or less. It's like if something anomalous happens, I asked mom and dad and they tell me what to do, so when you lose a parent at that age, you literally do use, do lose your process. It's an authoritarian process, but it's necessarily most of them to kids do some exploratory.

Speaker 5:          01:19:10       Yeah, well I was just speaking roughly politically. It's just rich. It's like there are different modes of adaptation. Three of them actually I think one is recourse to authority. One is decadence, he just give up. The other is the pattern that we're trying to outline and society's waiver between the first two because sometimes the solution is authoritarianism. There's too many. Like there's, there's too many refugees, let's close the borders and enforce uniformity. Or our culture is threatened by forces that we can, we can't tolerate, well we'll just give up the parish. And I think that's what happened. [inaudible] enrollments for example. It's like when they were fighting over the gun, they had an army to do this perfectly sufficient to repel the invading forces being too many gods and died of indigestion. So, and then so then the Dallas would say, well if your culture is out of whack, it's because there's too much chaos, furthers, too much order.

Speaker 5:          01:20:05       It was too much. He ended or there's too much. You have to put the balance back yet. And then the proper mode of adaptations walking down the line. And then that's another example of what we're trying to lay out. Can I just say something maybe coming on this other thing. I mean it seems to me that what, what this is to say this whole picture to put quite simply is that we are creatures of habit and your story, which is the domain of the known includes well is really everything and that is experience which includes all of your history and your mother is one of the most fundamental constituents of your entire history. So even if it doesn't have anything to do specifically with any of your higher level goals, it's still blowing holes in your, in your story, which disregulates your some of your stories for sure.

Speaker 5:          01:20:56       But I mean the stories I was going home for Christmas to visit her mother for example, is pretty much that little thing that's there. The larger, the more trauma it's going to cost when it's gone because the more you're, the more you count on it, right? The morning depends on absolutely. And that sees because the question we're trying to answer is here is what can you depend on when there isn't anything to depend on? Right. It's like if you lose a little of the coastline, it's not so surprising, but if something drops out of the middle, it's very peculiar.

Speaker 5:          01:21:34       Kind of reminds me of that. It seems to me girls do tend to go from here to here without descending to this level. Therefore, the more of an influence on the adolescent female. Well, I've never really, I've never really thought about, I never considered the possibility of sex differences in this process. And I'm sure that there are sex differences. Well, I'm not even sure what the main, so you say, you said there are three months, what do you call that was used term for Nietzsche called to power, which I think was basically what he was after. I don't know, call it the camel. The child. Right, right, right.

Speaker 5:          01:22:40       So, um, I don't know what you'd call the third way is, I mean there's descriptive terms of all sorts of business to be used to describe it. It's also, you know, you see books alluded to this at the time, all the time, like the razors edge by Somerset Mall. That's it. That's another image of this path because it's balanced between to balance between chaos and order basically to raise money is literally amazing. Sandwich summer stuff. Mom's book is about something that you've discovered that I go into. The East is the hero culture. So what, what? Well, I wanted to show you the notion of these nested stories and also the idea that anomalous inflammation can occur within any bounded domain and range and that's something that's very interesting. George Kelly said it's also the case that anomalous information range of effect and there is a, there are occasions where you encounter a piece of anonymous information.

Speaker 5:          01:24:01       It might take decades to recuts have off on all the levels of analysis that it's actually a challenge because you have to figure it out. I just think something like, let's take your example again. If a parent dies, there are implications for that at all sorts of different levels of analysis. Some of which might not become evidence for for years told them this story. I was thinking about this more particular both niches, notion of who definitely gone every time one of these levels of analysis collapses and that's up. Danny definitely gone so to speak. The God that rules, no, the ancient Romans, they used to think that every different room that had it go off and I guess in a sense what they were alluding to was the fact that you have different patterns of goal directed activity in every specific contexts and they should be doing, and I read you that that India met the other day about endless cycles of embedded creation and destruction and that's what these, each of these stories goes through this process of descent in reconstruction at every different level of analysis when you encounter something really anomalous that Lowe's who knows how many new story.

Speaker 5:          01:25:12       That's the thing. I guess the only way to think about that as in terms of the contact of cultures that had appeared before the isolated. So they did their whole developmental history has been separate. Then they come together and some terrible catastrophe usually. Well, it's a catastrophe or to me, this opportunity ends on the circumstances with regards to automation for social confidence is the thing that people are motivated to avoid. Above all, the outside thing are involuntary high level challenges to stories, so they're were very much motivated to eliminate or ignore or repress or otherwise obliterate any evidence that suggests that are higher level structures about or insufficient because when we lose those, we lose everything. That's nested loop. That's the anomaly. An anomaly that's relevant at one level tends to demolish all the levels that are inside of all those levels inside of dependent on that store.

Speaker 5:          01:26:40       Next class we're going to talk about some of them. We're going to talk about some of the ways that anomalous information manifests itself and the basic, the easiest way to conceptualize that is that anomaly can occur at any of these levels of analysis, so the mere presence of someone who behaves differently, for example, can constitute a challenge to the integrity of your stories. The stories that someone tells us that the Ford, that's another example of that. We'll be here. Alternative miss can wreak havoc on your culture. Can have. Certainly the case when you think about that in terms of the clash of religions, new ideas can blow your stories. And all of this information comes in all of those guys as and their stories about their stories, about his appearance, each of those guys. So we're going to talk a little bit about how anomalous information manifests itself and then the core switches into the last half, which is much more focused on the movie.

Speaker 5:          01:27:50       So we have time well, but at the same time there are individual differences. I mean you've ever, every individual's episodic and procedural memories. Yeah. Well I think, I mean I think, I think it's gender roles and the West are becoming more and more for many cultures. There's a strict distinction between the sexes. There were native native American cultures where the men and the women spoke different languages. So it depends on the culture, but it certainly, there are many cultures where, where women live that that's, that's the case where we're women had a domain of activity that was their sacred domain and the same with the men. And there was no cross talk to speak of women to a traditional domains of women have been closed cloth making pottery and agriculture three nontrivial domains. Yes, yes, absolutely. Of course. Yeah. I was thinking more specifically cultural issues. So yeah. And then I would say, well yes, the procedural memories. Well just to a certain agreement.

Speaker 4:          01:29:17       This is there in terms of their habits. Richard Cory story pretty different. Well,

Speaker 5:          01:29:31       like I said, this is something that I have agreed work though cause I don't know, a lot of the feminine images in mythology seem to me to be representations of the unknown rather than representations of the individual. And like Newman would say, well the feminine feminine consciousness construed as the hero is masculine. Symbolically it doesn't, it has nothing to do with gender except I suppose perhaps that the aztecs temps for the Aztecs, a woman who died in childbirth went to the same heaven. The warriors when two if they were killed in battle. Well, so I would say even there and that's, that's pretty much good. Even the bylaws, the most biological aspect of a woman's role was construed as heroic in that in that particular case. So as as equivalent to two more.

Speaker 4:          01:30:32       What about the idea that the myths that are part of our culture, it's Disney or something would you showed us how to bless her prince charming figure who identifies with the hero and it goes out and conquers this dragon whatever for the principals or rescues the princess and so that people will identify along gender lines. Men are taught to identify, her boys are taught to identify with the friends and to what extent women are taught to identify with the sort of the Barbie doll with the princess or the the sort of,

Speaker 5:          01:31:04       well this is another issue. It's like I think one of the reasons that the fairy tales tend to port. This isn't nice. Nice idea. In light in the Aztec notion that fairy tales tend to portray, we even say us dependent. So for someone to rescue them. Well, I would say the reason for that is because this is my own personal interpretation, is the in more traditional cultures, which I would just say, or cultures that don't have access to reliable birth control, women aren't necessarily put into a dependent position by the biology and the, and the notion of heroism that those tails sort of portray is voluntary acceptance of that rule and voluntary acceptance of the necessity for a protracted period of dependence. And it's reasonable to construe that as a form of hero is. So that's why the Aztecs had this particular attitude. Biology, Freud, biology is destiny.

Speaker 5:          01:32:01       Well, that's true and not true. It's not so much destiny when you have the birth control pill, but without it, there's a big chunk of destiny there. So, and it's voluntarily facing the things that have to be faced that constitutes Hiro is so that, I don't know how that applies to our age in an age of birth control. Still the matter of taught to be here at the women I've talked to. Well, first of all, there hasn't been enough time for our stories to the change. And second, in many ways things haven't changed. Like if you, if you have a baby, there's a year. It depends. You can do with lots of ways you can, you can put the baby in daycare. Well that's a solution of a trump. All that means is that the dependency stage is transferred to someone else. It's still there. It's just be moved usually down the socioeconomic ladder.

Speaker 5:          01:32:50       But anyways, if you don't choose that you have a one year period where there's something that's absolutely dependent on you to the degree that it would be really useful for you to be able to be dependent on someone else. So to the degree that child rearing still is a feminine role and I think it's going to be a long time before that that changes. If it ever changes, who knows what will happen. The notion of voluntary dependency still has an aspect of truth. That's how I look at it. And it's dangerous. Like there's lots of people who've wanted to rewrite fairy tales. No, because they have sexist things. But Shelly pointed out something interesting in her last essay. Tell you the three little pigs, you know, they keep building houses and you get stronger and stronger. The wolf closed them down, but finally they build a stone house or a brick house and the wolf climate through the chimney, but he falls into a bowl of water and then the pigs eat, cook, and eat him.

Speaker 5:          01:33:48       Well, she always pointed out that in the sanitized versions, Wolf just pops down the fire decisions his tail, and he goes back up through the chimney and he gets away. She meant, she pointed out, well, the fact of having constructive this fortress in the proper manner allowed enough of the external unknown, symbolized by the wolf to enter. We can be prepared and to simulate it. Now you say, oh, this is a violent story. The poor wolf. Well, it's like you're thinking here about something that's all encoded here. So you mess around with, you say, well, it'd be much nicer if the wolf gone away. All right, fine. But there's no story that we just like the reason you built the stone house, it's so that you can cook any the wolf. Well you lose the graphic imagery, you lose the story. And that's the problem with messing about with traditional tales. I mean I can understand why people want to do it and there's lots of traditions perhaps than artists, so beneficial. But it might be good to understand that before they are trans transformed. The other thing is is that we do not have an answer to the question. What constitutes a valid feminine idea?

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       Um, well just about the feminine part of the wanting to say. It seems to me that what the feminine, the Feminine counterpart of exploratory behavior is endurance of the rather than exploration feed meals through myth are taught to endure. Not necessarily dependency I don't think, but just just to endure it, to sit there and write it out. And um, it seems to me that that in fairy tales, Gannon mythology, that's what the four females have to do. They don't get to actively explore the and just endure it. And that's how they, we come here because the thing is if you have a problem, there's two things you can do about it. You can either change how you're accurate.

Speaker 5:          01:35:43       Right. I do think it's the case among human beings in general are view down is both more necessary. I'm more expendable, both at the same time. So I met Andrew sent off to war foods, got a lot of useless side less than men hanging road. Well, that's a good thing for them to do and that's basically how society worked. Boys, all boys fight wars, they're expendable. The thing about something that's expendable is then it can also be something that's very creative because exploration is dangerous and if you lose a few adolescent males while they're off exploring around, well, okay, you know, tough luck. Whereas women, well you to have them around.

Speaker 3:          01:36:28       Well that's all that goes to my question that I asked you yesterday. Can there be too many heroes? It seems to me there's only a certain amount of creativity that any society can endure at a given time. If you've got everybody out there trying to bring the end.

Speaker 5:          01:36:44       That's why I mentioned today that there are three patterns. Adaptation. There is recourse to authority. That's the authoritarian. There's whatever we're talking about and there's decadence and decadence occurs when under the guise of constant creative behavior, everything he's on the fine, but it's the case. Your old man says when you explore, you bring your culture along with you and that because you're right, you're absolutely right. I mean constant heretical activity. You mean the Catholic church in middle ages burned heretics. So why was that? Well, because you couldn't say there was that anytime and feeling you're going to give them any, we'll touch you. There's like 250 religious visionaries wandering around. Well, they followed them to establish a religion. Well instantly you have 250 countries all fighting with one another. The Catholics, they didn't know and we still don't know. How do you mediate between competing moral claims knows suppressant.

Speaker 5:          01:37:41       Why? Cause you need to order. Well, Darren was their attitude and it's understandable and you saying well the inquisition and so on. Yeah. Well, no kidding. It's a terrible thing. I'm not saying it's not a terrible thing to bunch of order is a catastrophe and so was too much chaos come too much. Cannabis is generated by careless, creative back, careless activity that runs under the guise of hero, but that's why they miss safe. You're going to be here and you master the culture first before you and you're buying it because otherwise he might do something careless that you think is creative that blows everything is like a minor example is the modification of that 30 day. So keeping them being, telling them I'm fairy tale for God only knows how long and someone comes along and chops the ending off. It's like, oh, this isn't violent. That isn't even at the point. That's careless. The SEC, so not is definitely a danger. When I said the Romans died, it digest it. That's not a joke. It's like they expanded like math collected all these gods. It's like their morality was, was was decimated. They didn't know how to, I'm getting more so in nature. That's a neat unity. That's the morning of European is full been in cultures. So that's why we're at war with ourselves

Speaker 4:          01:38:59       historically and cultural constructions of gender or simultaneously like, um, the mother or like the source of all things and yet the unknown. Right. So it's interesting to look at the woman and say, you know, how she sees herself rough, how she says your story because yes, she had one, one, one or scratch. She is the source of all things. And the other respect she has dean. And you can look like culturally, like when you talked about the inquisition, like at that time, the woman, we're all being witches because, um, basically they were trying to uphold the tradition. Um, so they were all good, just, you know, doing these crazy rituals and they were the threat. They are the enemy. They were the know. Whereas like, um, which is something we'll start rolling through our history. The woman is, which can cure danger, you know, and you know,

Speaker 5:          01:39:54       yeah. Well that's the split. The split of the archetype is the archetype of the unknown is feminine and Feminine Femininity has two positive and negative and positive. The medieval culture that was sort of wrapped up in symbolism around the Virgin Mary and the other counselors sort of more occupied this territory of the witch. So is he going to do, so I'm just reiterating your point. You that applies to fit females is very complicated because you have all these different aspects. The embodiment of the unknown plus the capacity for her rote behavior be more than than, than, than creative and exploratory behavior. And those two things are hard to me. There are

Speaker 4:          01:40:37       two stories that are very different on the woman tells her story, the story that she's trying new things and then she's a witch and she has to integrate that because you have to understand yourself or stories you, when women were separated during that stretch,

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       nope, they had to incorporate that into who they were. You know, they were danger that. So there's two different stories and I think that's ultimately left the store of a problem, understanding who you are, the middle also, all three, all three pieces of the entire world, both, both you and kill you. Right. So if that's true, that's true. That's true. That's true. Well, I don't like, I don't know how true that is. I suspect that, I doubt that it's true because, well, here's an example. If you want to predict the education status of a child, the best predictors, mother's level of education, farthest of the two parents, father's level of education does not correlate well. It correlates with the mother's level of education. So that's true, but it does, doesn't, is not anywhere near as good as good a predictor for the child's development in his mother's lap.

Speaker 5:          01:42:00       So, and I think it's reasonable to say that in large part, women are the primary socialization agents. At least they have been historically for the first two years, three years, maybe even longer than that. So I don't, I don't. Plus I also don't think that women's role in history has been nearly as subordinate. And as people generally claim, it depends on your, on your standard for defining subordination. I'm not saying that there's, there were that at every level of analysis, functionally quality range. Cause that's not true. But I also think that women and men, men doesn't impact on the course of giving them, develop their contributions.

Speaker 5:          01:42:44       I don't think, I don't really think that we might have been session male structure. You are just like that. The fact, for example, their men are all the sacrifice, but nor is one example of that. That tends to be overlooked in peaceful times. Well sacrifice. How well fairly fair enough. I mean there are problems in gender relationships and an adaptation everywhere in peaceful times. Maybe men have the upper hand, but more the situation, at least historically these movers directly voted to take it was through the perspective of mail, written history, tradition, and sort of develop the idea of freedom because they're the ones that had kind of freedom. I think women have been powerful. Yeah, so I agree with you, but I think they've been written into history from the male perspective and that could be us or women have had a huge, their story has been written by now. Stories are written by people who have leisure. That's right. Our primary child care, especially if that also shortens your lifespan. Women's influence, maybe large and implicit in what the stories and the items are. All exquisite needs. You said that one of the reasons western culture was so powerful was because his philosophy was written by bachelors.

Speaker 5:          01:44:25       Good observation, observation. But it does take leisure. Leisure. We started the course. Yeah. Well one of the things I was trying to do at the beginning of the class was to out how an explicit story puts 4 million, can fund your mind. A whole sequence of implicit stories. That's really the notion behind the conflict between miracle stories. Really explicit. You can grasp once you accepted. I've been thinking about why it is, I'm a singer and I see a lot of a lot of homosexuals in the art scene and stuff like that. And I was wondering why, you know, why is it that they tend to, a lot of them tend to go into the arts and, and, and are very successful at it. And I was thinking that maybe because they are forced to a lot of times to um, to partake in a group that they aren't necessarily a part of our, at least for us in that heterosexuality is adolescence.

Speaker 5:          01:45:48       And then have to have to fight out of that had to have a really huge internal struggle if they ever do make it out of it. Um, and then at that point they are able to add, they're able to add more to the group through things like our creative processes, sorry, builds up creative ability or that they advanced at an earlier age because they have this, you know, the saying that they want, and this is by the way, this enormous anomalous information I thought about sometimes in terms of the necessity for people who are homosexual to integrate different gender roles. And so I thought they could serve the people in that position because the fact that homosexuality is very peculiar from an evolutionary point of view, it's hard to account for its existence from the blue. And I thought, well maybe we need to do a particular cultural intermediary between the sexes possibility or, or in between the mental logic in the meetings with the masculine and feminine, you have another hypothesis. You know, sometimes one of the best niches if doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. Sometimes best trade you can have really cool because if you overcome it well, then you've got something. Although you might die. Just the downside.

Speaker 5:          01:47:07       Okay, so next week we talked about, no two weeks.
