Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, a professor at the University of Toronto. I'm a clinical psychologist and author of the bestselling book, 12 rules for life, which has sold more than 3 million copies worldwide being translated into 50 languages and which I have lectured live about 150 cities all over North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. I've also produced a series of popular podcasts which will now be featured weekly on the Westwood One podcast network every Sunday, and which I will be hosting with my daughter Mikayla Peterson. If you want to understand yourself and other people far more deeply and keep abreast of the latest scientific discoveries and philosophical ideas, then the Jordan would be Peterson podcast on Westwood one might be just what you're looking for. It's a call to individual responsibility, courage, and truth in the face of the trouble and tragedy of life. Listen and subscribe for free today.
