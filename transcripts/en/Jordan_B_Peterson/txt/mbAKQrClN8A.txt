Speaker 1:          00:00          Earlier today, Conrad Black wrote an article in Canada's National Post and the article was called Jordan Peterson speaks, for those of us who refused to follow the great liberal deathwish. Now, for those of you who don't know who conrad black is, I'll read you a little bit from his wikipedia profile. Conrad Moffat. Black Baron black of cross harbor was born on the 25th of August, 1944. He's a Canadian born British, former newspaper publisher and author. He's a non affiliated life peer, black controlled Holland, your international once the world's third largest English language newspaper Empire, which published the Daily Telegraph in the UK, the Chicago Sun Times in the US and the Jerusalem Post Israel as well as in the National Post, the newspaper that he published this article in in Canada and hundreds of community newspapers in North America. I'd like to start this by thinking lord black for his support. But I would also like to point out that despite his supportive stance, um, there are things that are important that he didn't get right.

Speaker 1:          01:17          And I think it's reasonable to draw people's attention to them. So the first thing I'm going to do is just read what he wrote and then I'm going to comment on it a little bit and I'm going to do so in a manner that I hope does indicate that I do appreciate his support and I'm not trying to be, um, pr frivolously critical in any sense. And then I want to read a response that a lawyer has prepared as well, just so that you understand all of you who are listening understand this a little bit more clearly. Conrad Black Rights. I have just endured the sobering experience of watching the always very intelligent and professional Steve Pakan chair a panel about the transgender controversy that centers on University of Toronto. Professor Dr Jordan Peterson. That was the. I had an appearance on TV, was the agenda with Steve Pakan a couple of weeks ago where the Pronoun issue was discussed.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Lack states. I had vaguely followed the story as it percolated up in the press, much of the fraud things in which must usually be taken lightly. It was I fear a piercing glimpse into what great and venerable statesmen of my youth, such as Winston Churchill, Dwight Eisenhower, Harry Truman and Louis St Laurent called days that I shall not see. I did not until now grasp the fine balance between gratitude and wistfulness in their invocation of that phrase, as a young person, I thought at the license of the great to engage in Histrionics and I now claim it as the right of lesser yet aging people such as myself, black states for those who have sagely duct or otherwise being spared exposure to this controversy. Dr Peterson rejects the right of his students to require him to address them if they are trans people, I eat in some state of flux between the male and female polls of gender identification, not their orientation, whether they are homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, or asexual, has nothing to do with it. Otherwise then in a way that concerns them to the cluster confines of being male or female. No. See, this is one of the things that's interesting about, about Mr. blocks

Speaker 2:          03:20          call them.

Speaker 1:          03:22          He obviously considers this issue of sufficient importance to address it, but there's an that he can't eliminate completely from his mind the supposition that this is absurd, but it is observed in many ways, but here's the mistake. Just because something is absurd, it doesn't mean it was trivial and I think this is where Mr Black makes an error in his column. Yes, it's absurd. That's why he says that people have sagely ducted or otherwise being spared exposure to it because it's been a ridiculous controversy and I think. I think there's no question about that. It's surreal. I found the whole thing was surreal, but you know, back in the 19 thirties when the Nazis first made their appearance on the scene, everyone thought they were observed to and and concluded that that meant that they were trivial and they were not trivial despite their absurdity, and this is not trivial despite its absurdity. In fact its absurdity. I think in some sense points precisely to the fact that it is anything but trivial because something that is on the surface of it so absurd is being made so much is being made of it. It's been classified if refuse, we'll use pronouns, for example, is being classified as a hate crime that's not trivial, although it is observed

Speaker 2:          04:37          now

Speaker 1:          04:40          z for he and or she and Zack are in place of his or him are the sticking points, but what is accumulating behind these imbecilic distinctions is quite sinister. The tape, Steve Pake and ran up Dr Peterson being reviled and shouted down and physically intimidated at the University of Toronto was distressing and we may be on the edge of a defining moment in our jolie and progressive Canadian civilization. Dr Peterson sees it as a matter of freedom of expression and believes that others do not have the authority to require him to address them in a newly hatched vocabulary devise to oppress the gender binary conventional practice. While his opponents profess to believe that in refusing to do so, he is committing a hate crime punishable by human rights commissions or tribunals. These hurry headed monsters and black is referring to the human rights tribunals, who's agregious tryst trespasses on freedom of expression in the name of despotic.

Speaker 1:          05:31          Political correctness has been heroic. They didn't successfully contested by my friends Mark Stein and as relevant and others does not prescribe imprisonment under the articles invoked by Dr. Peterson says assailant, but if fine is possible, yes, and we might also point out that it's a very large fine that is possible in New York state, for example, failure to use the requisite pronouns brings with it a maximum fine of $250,000 in case Conrad goes on to say as if to assure the least possibility of a quiet end to this preposterous issue, Dr Peterson has declared that he will not pay a fine and if in prison for not paying it would embark on a hunger strike. Now, this is another place where black confuses absurdity with triviality. He believes that my response to this is an overreaction and that's part of my refusal to bring this preposterous issue to a quiet end.

Speaker 1:          06:26          He's suggesting that I'm exaggerating and that as a consequence, he's implying that I'm at least in part, responsible for blowing up something that's merely observed into something. I'm blowing up the importance of something that's merely observed anyways. He says, well, my sympathies are with Dr Peterson. This is an unjustified hypothetical escalation. So remember that he says this is an unjustified hypothetical escalation if it came to that, the authorities would attach his bank account or his income in to collect the fine and Batman or rather than imprisoning him and provoking a hunger strike. Yes. Well, we'll see about that. Okay. So the first thing that I want to tell you, listeners is, here's, here's the powers of the social justice tribunals. I pulled this from their own statement about their power. So this is one point six. This is section one, point six, powers of the social justice tribunals in irrelevant, um, Ontario legislative document one point six.

Speaker 1:          07:27          You have to listen to this very carefully. The tribunal will determine how a matter will be dealt with. That's a matter brought before them, say a matter of discrimination or harassment defined by their policies, their appalling policies and may use procedures other than traditional adjudicative or adversarial procedures. Okay, so I'm going to repeat that. The tribunal will determine how a matter will be dealt with and may use procedures other than traditional adjudicative or adversarial procedures. Okay, that's one point. Six, one point seven. In order to provide for the fair just and expeditious resolution of any matter before it. The tribunal may a limit the evidence or submissions on any issue so you can consider that for a while and I'm going to skip to w take any other action that the tribunal determines is appropriate. Now you, you've got that they've actually written a clause into the policy documents that describe their powers that states that they can take any other action they determine as appropriate.

Speaker 1:          08:29          Well then I would say that's gone beyond absurd. Um, or I would say that's still observed, but it's by no means trivial and my sense that this is extraordinarily dangerous legislation is correct. Whereas dark Mr Block's insistence that I'm exaggerating, the seriousness of the situation is incorrect. Here's three point one, three from the same document where a party has been notified of a fair hearing and fails to attend. Tribunal may take any other action it considers appropriate. So that's a duplication of the previous statement, roughly speaking with, um, where the human rights tribunal takes to itself the power to do whatever it wants fundamentally. Now, here's some other things to consider. Notice that these tribunals, including the Ontario human rights tribunals, there's eight different tribunals. They're called social justice tribunals. Now, that's not an accident. Consider what that means. The term social justice is a code for political correctness and equity oriented political philosophy.

Speaker 1:          09:30          People know that this is why the radical left activists are parodied as social justice warriors. Now the social justice tribunals operating in Ontario or quasi judicial instantiations of the politically correct authoritarian creed, and they're designed by their designers to operate outside of the normal parameters of the law. This is why they attribute to themselves the powers to use quote procedures other than traditional adjudicative or adversarial procedures. Think about that. It means that the standard British common law approach to the issues brought before the tribunal can be suspended. Now, why would they do that? Well, it's rooted in politically correct, the underlying politically correct Marxist and postmodernist philosophy. You can consider it this way. If the fundamental presupposition is that the, uh, that, that, that Canadian civilization as well as Western civilization in general is a corrupt patriarchy. Then what's the problem with suspending it's rules of procedure when you're pursuing a justice the tire than anything that's a represented inside that tradition?

Speaker 1:          10:33          Well, that's exactly what they've written into the, into the laws attributing to themselves power so you can see, you can think for yourself and decide just exactly how dangerous that is. Now, back to black Dr Peterson's approach is so inflexible and so entirely righteous without much using the powerful weapon of ridicule that is available to him. He may not have tracked the full range of support. The virtue of his arguments and his personal courage deserve so funny sentence because I can't tell exactly the terminology that my approach is so inflexible that I may not attract the full range of support. The virtue of my arguments, my personal courage deserve. Um, I don't really think that I'm being reflected in flexible. I'm merely refusing to use the language that's made up by politically correct radical left wing authoritarians. And that's not inflexible. It's reasonable. Why would I use that language?

Speaker 1:          11:32          I don't agree with the philosophy. I think the principles upon which it's predicated are not only factually incorrect, scientifically incorrect, but malevolently motivated and extraordinarily dangerous. That doesn't make me inflexible, and so the terminology there is wrong. It makes me committed to not using that language, but on the substance of the issue. Lack continues. He is of course correct. We must always be wary of the majority Darien tyranny, which has preoccupied mini civil libertarians, including the principal authors of the constitution of the United States, especially James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, who agreed on little else about the transgender community is less than one percent of the population, as I've written many times in many contexts, over many tiers rights do not exist only for the numerous and a litmus test of legitimacy of a society is it's observance of the rights of minorities, including especially minorities. Have one. The jurisprudence of all great democratic nations is replete with famous cases to this effect.

Speaker 1:          12:33          Captain Dreyfus, Dr Samuel Mudd, who was prosecuted for treating the assassin of Abraham Lincoln. Though there was no evidence that he was involved in the plot and even the British Archer Shia fair made famous in the drama, the winslow boy, the Peterson affairs threatening to cross the double white line. All people must be treated with respect equally, but there are only two genders to sexist are species and all other mammals are gender binary. While I would like to point out to Mr Block that that's now illegal under bill [inaudible] and its associated sister legislation and that might be observed as I mentioned before, but it's not trivial idiocy written into the law unfolds into the idiocy of enforcement and obedience and that's not trivial and as we will soon find out, lot continues. All people may state their sex and if that is contrary to physical appearances, that remains the right, but no individual or group has the right to invent a new vocabulary and a new cool co equal gender because of a state of ambivalence or confusion about which sex they are.

Speaker 1:          13:34          Yes, Mr Black, they do have that right and that's precisely what bill see. 16 instantiates and it's already written into the human rights codes, human rights codes of the majority of Canadian provinces. It's also, uh, it's also an act of hate speech to dispute it. So individuals and groups have precisely the right to invent new vocabularies and not one but many co equal genders up to 70 in New York state for example, black continues, every legally competent individual has a perfect and absolute right to declare their sex, but not to create a new legal status and legally require the use of a new vocabulary for those influx between the only two sexes we have mercilessly binary throw their finite number may be well the same argument applies there. They do have the right to create a new legal status or many new legal statuses and to legally require the use of a new vocabulary that's already written into the law that they have that right.

Speaker 1:          14:29          And I would say as well that, uh, Conrad blocks comments on that are also now illegal. The individuals in that condition may change the registered sex each day if they wish, but not treat anyone who declines to address them in terms that debunked the gender. Binary world has guilty of a hate crime punishable by imposable fines. How about six months ago, I wrote a column in this space about the acceptance by the Supreme Court of Canada to hear an appeal of judgments from well-reasoned local courts or request from a British Columbia band of native people, numbering 900 who claimed that 25 years of consultation was constitutionally inadequate over a proposed ski area that an elder of their band was super naturally advised and after a lapse of some years told his people would drive off the spirit of the grizzly bear that was central to the religion of that band.

Speaker 1:          15:15          I concluded the column with the shabby polemical device that I only rarely employed a rhetorical question in this case. Are we all mad? Of course we are not and we still live in a country where people can self identify as they wish, even if it diverges from apparent realities, but we're almost at the point where people who declined to be legally forced to acknowledge the warning, plausible applications of this right are subject to persecution by social justice warriors and quite conceivably the government. We're not almost at that point, Mr Black, it's already written into law. We're terribly finally reluctant to impose normal rules, free discourse over the agitation of people who are using an imagined unlimited latitude on sexual self description to gag, dictate to and prosecute reasonable people exercising their rights to free expression. It is another manifestation

Speaker 1:          16:03          parentheses of which the hyper hypocritically respectful limitations about the Stalinists desk bought Fidel Castro or another and parentheses of what my late friend Malcolm muggeridge called the great liberal death wish. The great majority do not want to go along for that ride. And this time the great majority must be heard and obeyed. All right, so I told you what I thought about Mr Black's comments and uh, and now I'm going to read a legal opinion about them. Uh, Mr. Block, I regularly read your articles with interest. I have interest in many of the subjects that you seem to devote attention to including US history in presidential politics and behavior. I have further enjoyed your recent appearances on CNN with respect, respect to the trump phenomenon. I was motivated to write to you in this instance with respect to your article in the National Post today mentioned in the subject line of this email, a right not to detract from your main thesis regarding Mr Peterson and those aligned against him, but rather to identify potentially ms dot point of importance. In your article, you call into question the volume of Mr Peterson's rhetoric. My words not yours as being disproportionate by identifying that imprisonment is not the punishment that he faces by disregarding the gender neutral ideology and any resultant orders from a human rights tribunal. While you may be and hopefully are correct that in prison, it meant is not a Mr Peterson's future. The path to prison remains clear.

Speaker 1:          17:28          The key point being that the human rights tribunals can and regularly do order nonmonetary remedies in addition to the typical and well known monetary awards well, failure to pay a financial penalty can result in imprisonment. It is admittedly a long and winding road not entirely related to the unpaid penalty itself. That being said, if a tribunal war to issue its standard order, it wouldn't necessarily include some variation of the following. Number one, a declaratory order requiring Mr Peterson not to misgender someone again or use the wrong pronouns. Number two, a gag order requiring him to refrain from discussing the subject in public possible given his academic status. Number three, a publication ban requiring him to refrain from publishing on these subjects possible given his media presence and number four, to take mandatory sensitivity or anti bias training if Mr Peterson were to breach these orders. For example, by refusing to participate in the training and guess what I would do?

Speaker 1:          18:28          The typical recourse of the tribunal is to pursue a contempt of court which inevitably results in prison. Section 19 of the Statutory Powers Procedures Act, Ontario states that an order of the tribunal is an order of the superior court. Section 13 of the statutory powers Procedures Act says the tribunal can pursue a breach of its own order by bringing an application to the divisional court superior court on that application. The divisional court employees rule 60 point one, one of the rules of civil procedure which states that when faced with contempt of a nonmonetary order of the Superior Court, the court can order imprisonment for an indefinite period and finds the civil courts send people to prison for breaches of nonmonetary injunctions, non defamation orders with some regularity. Furthermore, human rights tribunals have a history of imprisoning persons for breaches of non monetary and monetary tribunal orders. This happened most notoriously under the recently repealed section 13 hate speech provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Code, of which Mr Lavato and Mr Stein quietly performed Yulman service for all Canadian citizens and having repealed.

Speaker 1:          19:40          While the likelihood of prison remains highly contingent and remote, it doesn't depend to a great extent on the benevolence of the public servants that staff, the tribunal and the courts keep up the good work d dot jared brown, lead counsel, deed, Jared Brown, Professional Corporation, Toronto, Ontario, www dot brown, law dot, ca. Well, so there you have it. That's the pathway to imprisonment for failure to use the proper pronouns. And so let's not be confusing absurdity with triviality and I appreciate your support, Mr Black, but I'm, I'm afraid that you're treating the issue in some regard as if it's. If it as as at least elements of it are beneath contempt and then it's being blowing blown out of proportion and I'd like to say as clearly as I possibly can, this is not being blown out of proportion. This is the state of current state of Canadian law.
