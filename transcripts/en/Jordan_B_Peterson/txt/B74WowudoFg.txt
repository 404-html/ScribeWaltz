Speaker 1:          00:00:15       Last time we spoke, it was not so long ago, but you've been in the headlights even more since the, since the release of the book and uh, and also the, a beautiful interview with Katherine Newman.

Speaker 2:          00:00:33       Yeah. Well that seemed to start a whole new plateau, let's say, of interest. Yeah. And I thought that yes, I've been in the headlines a lot and rather an settling amount I would say.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       Yeah. And I don't want to dwell on the cat thing, human interview too much because, uh, you've, uh, you've been, uh, made to talk so much about it, but I think you're probably tired about it, but just one thing that I think you demonstrated very clearly, uh, about yourself and also about, uh, saying that patience is a virtue that you actually, in the end you want out, uh, because you stayed calm and you explained what you actually meant. And in the end she liked words and I think that actually was an inspiring example to a lot of people.

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       Yeah. It seems to have been in, although it isn't clear why was. It isn't, still isn't really clear to me why it became so incredibly widespread. I mean, I think the interview itself on Youtube as something approximating 8 million views, but if you add the commentaries to that, lots of people have cut it up and commented on it. I think it's, I suspect it exceeds 20 million and there was something about the interview that really attracted a tremendous amount of attention. So it's very interesting. It's obviously part and parcel of the political tension that's, that's odd that it seems to underlie virtually everything right now.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       I think it's from the platonic ideal states, like this is the interview that illustrates the cultural world where everything that's wrong about not taking your opponents seriously, uh, then you can always show that interview. So it's a great, a great way to just introduce people to what's wrong with the political discourse. I think

Speaker 2:          00:02:48       I have. I have a hypothesis to run by you. Well, so imagine what's happening. Is this the. We're in the midst of a technological transformation and the online video services are displacing network and cable television. And the online print services are displacing the traditional print media, so let's say that, okay, so there's increasing desperation on the part of the traditional media and so then let's say that as a consequence of that, that did that additional nervousness and instability. First of all, many people are leaving, second budgets are being cut and third there's increasing desperation for to hold on to market share. And as a consequence of that, more and more articles are polarized because they attract more attention and that that's driving the political polarization in part. Does that seem reasonable to you?

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       Yes, I do think that seems reasonable. And I do think

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       you also have a greater need for the established media to debunk a sort of the, the people who are popular on Youtube or podcasts

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       free free from

Speaker 2:          00:04:14       the big thing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       Yeah. Also some of the TV channels.

Speaker 2:          00:04:19       Yeah. So you think it's also direct competition? Yes, but I'm not sure if it's

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       a sort of a conscious effort. I think also it's incompetent

Speaker 2:          00:04:29       sometimes. You never, never underestimate everything together like a life extremism, populism, and they have a very hard time discerning what sort of

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       the real Nazis from just people

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       having legitimate ideas and legitimate. That's another issue, right, is that it's in the radical left interest to lump everyone who opposes their ideological attempts into a single terrifying category because if, if they had to contend with the fact that you can be reasonable centrist or even reasonable center leftist and dispute the validity of identity politics as a framework for conducting a political discussion. If you have to accept that reasonable people can do that, then you have to accept that reasonable people can object to your ideology and that implies that your ideology isn't reasonable. So there's every reason for people on the radical left to not only assume that their opponents are reprehensible, but to make the case that they're reprehensible without ever bothering to scratch below the surface. So I think that's happening too. And then of course, I never wanted to let the university's off the hook. And I think the fact that the universities have allowed and encouraged the growth of radical leftist ideology in the humanities and the social sciences is absolutely completely inexcusable. So I might even prove fatal to the universities we'll see about that, but it wouldn't surprise me. Universities have been around a long time though.

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       Last we spoke, I was doing a piece on how radical feminism had been mandatory for a course at Lund University. And we spoke about that. The professor was a mandated to include you in this course and I continued writing about the universities and it goes much deeper. It goes even if you look at the grants, if you look at, we have 10, 10 billion kroners which are being distributed from the state and uh, they, they are the, the gender mainstreaming that's taking place in the university universities when it comes to courses and uh, the, the reading lists and the professors. It's also when it comes to the grants. So you have to include a gender perspective or at least you have to specify why you don't have a gender perspective.

Speaker 2:          00:07:30       Right. Which is probably fatal.

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       Yeah, exactly. So one of my, a friend of mine that I got to know him via his dog because I have a dog and so our dogs became friends and then we became friends. So he made his phd about trouts and wild and wild trout. And uh, and um, how do you say a domestic trunks? No. Yeah. Yeah. So the difference in behavior sounds very boring, but it's actually kind of interesting when he was about to not get, not get a grant because he didn't think religion perspective.

Speaker 2:          00:08:12       Yep. And so, well, I know now

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       10 years ago and now it's spreading. And so I'm, I'm getting a lot of stories about that. So it's crazy. The universities or really it's shifted into second gear here in Sweden with this.

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       Yeah, it's the same. It's happening everywhere in the west, I would say. Um, our, our government just handed down a budget and every, as far as I can tell from the initial response and every government program has to include a gender perspective now in the same manner. And so our government is deciding to solve a problem that doesn't exist. Well, what's happened is that we've accepted equity, we've accepted equality outcome as the measure by which we're going to judge the fairness of, uh, organizations, um, operations at the same time when the social science research is stacking up on the other side of the distribution to state ever more clearly and with ever more with ever less doubt that as you, um, as you flatten out the sociological landscape so that men and women are treated more equally, that the difference in their occupational choices widens, become crystal clear.

Speaker 2:          00:09:29       And the, the response to that from the radicals is that pseudo science, even though the people who are doing these studies aren't conservative, there aren't conservatives in the social sciences. And so people do these studies and they're shocked by the results they publish them because they're good scientists. Not because these findings buttress their ideological position and plus who's ideological position wasn't to wish that as you flatten out the sociological and political landscape, you make men and women more different. Who is hoping for that? No one was hoping for that. So as, as the science stacks up the legislative and political attempts to silence it and to mount an ideological counterattack, multiply

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       what do we need more, more general science because the differences are accelerating. So now we need even more, more of the same. But I would like to jump into the, um, uh, to the book and see what I'm. Because I read your book or I didn't really read it, I actually listened to it, which was I can really recommend to people because you, you did a fantastic job of reading the book by yourself. And so

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       I was looking at the reviews on audible and there's a performance review and a content review. Performance Review is higher than the content review and I don't know what to think about that. I don't know whether I should be happy about that. Are Not happy about that. It's not much difference, but I thought it was comical.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       I think you should stop writing and you should just be a narrator of books. I think that's the takeaway.

Speaker 2:          00:11:21       Well, I'm going to do an audio book version of maps of meaning. Yes. That's great. Yes, that's coming that be like 25 hours long or something like that. Probably more so.

Speaker 1:          00:11:34       That's the first book I read, uh, as an, as an audiobook was better angels of our nature by Steven Pinker, like 50 hours or something. So it was a 25 hours. It's not so bad.

Speaker 2:          00:11:49       Abi Bout too because it's a long book. I'm probably, I'm probably the amount of time we'll see

Speaker 1:          00:11:58       in your book. I think the first room stand up straight with your shoulders back. I think that's a really. When you read the chapter, it's a really good chapter. But I, uh, as last time when I spoke to speak to you, I went into the Jordan Peterson found groups in Sweden and uh, I've, I asked them what, what do you think I should ask you? And then they, one of the guys was, he said, I really liked the book, but when it says stand up straight with your children's back, I think you should explain more how to do it. And then a lot of the helpful other guys in the threads started giving him physical exercises, how to strengthen the muscles between the shoulders, how your shoulders back. It was like a long thread on how to, how to build your chest up. Like, and then in the end, like after 20 or 30 comments like somebody suggested that maybe, maybe you didn't mean it. Literally. He also meant it figuratively. So, but it was no, no, no meanness or anything. But then it wasn't that, it wasn't a physical advice. It was mostly sort of a psychological advice,

Speaker 2:          00:13:14       a good place where the metaphorical and the literal meet. Actually the important part of that chapter, I think a part is that I was really trying to make a case and this is a case that needs to be made over and over and over until people understand it. Uh, there's a book I would recommend that was recently written called the great leveler, like Walter Shy Dale. And it's the study of inequality. And it's a brutal book because one of the things she does is he calculates inequality coefficients, like the Gini Coefficient, which is a measure of inequality, economic inequality, and he looks over the empirical data to see if there's any relationship between the the left or the right wing nature of a government and the inequality in the society. And so what you'd hope because inequality is actually a genuine problem. You'd hope that left wing governments were better at regulating inequality than right wing governments.

Speaker 2:          00:14:13       You'd hope that there's no evidence for that whatsoever. So I'm making a case in chapter one that hierarchies exist and because hierarchies exist, inequality exists, or at least the two things are are indistinguishable at many levels, but that you can't blame the existence of hierarchy or inequality on something proximal like capitalism or Western society. Inequality is the rule all the way back down to crustaceans. And so when the Marxists complained about inequality and how intractable it is, while they have a point, but when they blame it on capitalism, they're not taking the problem seriously. It's way worse than the Marxist. Think inequality is genuinely a problem. Now, but it's a problem in, in a bunch of ways. The first is, is that those at the top tend to get more and those at the bottom tend to end up with zero and zero's really not good.

Speaker 2:          00:15:16       Now you might say, well, in the capitalist society, in modern industrial capitalist society, people tend not to end up at zero so much and that seems to be true. It is definitely the case. And, and I think pinker has done a good job of outlining this, uh, that people that human progress.org are doing a good job of the two. It's definitely the case that our modern societies are making the poor, much less absolutely poor. So we've, we've decreased poverty worldwide between 2000 and 2012 by 50 percent a massive accomplishment. We should be partying in the streets about it. It's an amazing accomplishment, but inequality is still a problem. So, so that chapter's about how deep the problem is. Now, the suggestion is is that to compete in a world where there's unequal outcome, your best bet is to take the full tragedy of being full frontal, essentially, right?

Speaker 2:          00:16:12       To open yourself up to the catastrophe of existence and to move forward with courage and and and with nobility and with with truth on your tongue. That's your best bet and I do believe that. Now I can give you an example of that. We did research on a program called the future authoring program, and it's a part of the suite that's offered at self authoring dog come and we did the research. The idea was to produce psychological interventions that were very cost effective that could be distributed to many people, but we wanted to test them because you never know if you're an idiot. Intervention is going to do something good or something bad. That's like rule number one for a serious social scientists. Assume your idiot intervention will either be useless or harmful because those are the most likely outcomes. Right? And any social scientist who's truly credible understands that those who don't are not educated properly.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       So anyways, we tested the future authoring program and we mostly tested it in Holland and we did some stratification by group, so in Holland, this was at the Rotterdam School of, at at the Rotterdam School of management at Erasmus University. We had thousands of university students do the future authoring program where they laid out a plan for their life and they tried to optimize their lives along. They want to consider their friendships, intimate relationships, career choices, educational choices, mental and physical health, use of drugs and alcohol and use of time productively outside of work to optimize across all those levels and then to avoid catastrophic pitfalls. So you write about what your life could be like if you could have what you needed in three to five years and then what, right about what your life could be like if everything fell apart on you and and things went bad. All right, so they all did this exercise.

Speaker 2:          00:18:04       Now, before the exercise, the Dutch women were outperforming the Dutchman, let's say the Caucasians and the Non Western ethnic minority women were doing worse than the Dutchman and the non western ethic minority men were doing worse, the worst of all, four groups, about an 85 percent performance detriment compared to the Dutch women two years after the intervention. They were doing better than the Dutch women, right? Man, it blew us away. We couldn't believe. And that's research published with mckayla shipper and and, and, and some other colleagues that from Holland. And what was so interesting about that was that a psychological intervention seemed to remove the barriers that were produced by what was hypothetically associate logical barrier. It might be that if you're an immigrant to a country that you don't have your story straight because it's so complicated. Yeah. So you need a better plan. So. And that's part of standing up. It's like, okay man, make a plan for the future, plan a good future and move forward towards it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:13       And also one thing that I took away from, from the chapters and take yourself seriously. Otherwise no one else will. If you don't stand up for yourself, you will get pushed down and pushed over and not be taking notice.

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       Yeah, well, I think the way you take yourself seriously as you start to constrain yourself as a player in the catastrophe of the world. Now the world, and this is a motif route. 12 rules for life in many ways is a very dark book. Although it has a very optimistic central message. The darkness is life is tragic and tainted by malevolence, but the optimism is there's a hell of a lot more to you than you think and I think that's a message that's really good for people because everyone knows that life is a catastrophe that's tainted by malevolence. Everyone knows that even if people don't want to admit it at the bottom of their heart, they know it and I think they also suspect that there's more to them than meets the eye. So and so. So the, the, the trick to taking yourself seriously is to understand that your errors count. They make things worse. Like it really is the case that it matters whether you get your act together at least because if you're fragmented and disillusioned and resentful and angry and working to make things worse, you really can make them worse. The school shooters are a good example of that. People who become so nihilistic and desperate and then angry that no, they, they, they slaughter the innocent in, in a, in a fit events fullness. Like that's sort of the bottom end of, of the descent for human beings. It's really terrible

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       because you, you, you, um, you deal a lot with Christianity and Christian thought with both, with mostly with the old testament but also with new testament in the Christian motifs. But you get the sense from your book, from your, your teaching when you talk about this, that we can really create for ourselves in this world when we have no problem with creating a variety of health for ourselves and for others. So that's within our, our,

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       in our grasp. That's exactly right. Is that hell is definitely within our grasp.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       And uh, and I think with our engineering we can invent many kinds of health. But I would also, do you think there's a, do we have the capacity to create paradise on earth? You think that within our grasp,

Speaker 2:          00:22:14       I think that that's what we struggle upwards toward. You know, I was thinking recently about this image came to mind of St Joseph's oratorial in Montreal, which is a huge religious building. Um, it's one of the biggest cathedral. I don't think it's a cathedral because I think it's an oratorial, although I don't know technically the difference. Um, but it's one of the biggest religious edifice is in the world and it was built in the latter half of the 20th century, which is quite interesting because most buildings have religious significance work built that late. But anyways, it's up on Mount Royal, so it's up on the hill. And so it's the city on the hill, right? It's the universal city on the hill. It's an image of perfection. It's a lot. It's like stonework lit, like the interior of a forest devoted towards the glory of being in God.

Speaker 2:          00:23:05       So it's an image of, of, of, of paradise we could say. And then it's at the top of the hill and you climb up to it as a consequence of a very large staircase set into the hill and pilgrims went there quite regularly in the 20th century who were often physically disabled and so they would struggle up the hill on their crutches or or or, or with their, with their, with their damaged limbs and with their illnesses. And so they would struggle up the hill towards the heavenly city essentially. And that's what we're to do. That's correct. That it's a drama that people were acting out. Now, St Joseph's also happens to be full of crutches that people left there for. Which is quite interesting to see. But, but that doesn't, that doesn't matter in some sense. So much as the symbolic meaning is all these damaged people who were carrying a terrible load, like they weren't just subject to the normative tragedy of being.

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       They were also physically disabled would go there and struggle up these hundreds of stairs as they were trying to send instead of descending. And it's like, well, we can certainly believe in hell if we have any sense. If you don't believe that human beings can create hell, then you're a child, you're a naive child, you know nothing, you know nothing about history or yourself and you say, well, can we, can we bring paradise into being? Well, no, but maybe we can at least walk up the hill away from hell and who knows what we could do if we took it seriously, if we took our, the idea that we needed to shoulder our burden and with truth, if we took that seriously, as serious as the hell should make you take it. Who knows what we could accomplish? You know, as I said, we've lifted, you've reduced the poverty rate in the world by 50 percent from the year 2000 to the year, 2012 and something like 300,000 people are being attached to the power grid. Now worldwide. I don't remember if it's a week or a day, but it's either of those metrics is still pretty good. Fastest growing economies are in Africa. Like, you know, we, we've made amazing strides in the last 50 years and they seem to be accelerating and so I don't know what the upper limit for us is if we don't dissolve ourselves into idiot identity politics and, and, and start a civil war. No. So

Speaker 1:          00:25:25       I think one of the reasons why very, I certainly do. I think people in general do as well. I'm a very easy time imagining horrible, horrible things and daydreaming about horrible things, horrible things that could happen to you or things that you could do and uh, and, but it's very hard to imagine a heaven. For example, look at Dante. Oh, inferno. It's a, I think he wrote about heaven as well. I'm not a really boring book. Angels, angels in white singing and stuff like that. Then it's, it doesn't sound like heaven to me. It's a but hell sounds like hell

Speaker 2:          00:26:15       right. Interesting. Because, you know, um, I would say mainstream Christians, especially on the Protestant and have tried to force hell out of the human imagination over the last hundred years, maybe as a way of making Christianity more marketable. Although I don't think it's worked, but I do think that belief in hell, metaphorically, let's say, although I tell you if you're in one of those situations, it feels eternal, so that's something to keep in mind too, but I think it's unbelievably salutary because even though we can't imagine heaven so clearly, we can certainly say, well, at least it's not Auschwitz. Right. Totally agree on that. Whatever it is, it's as far away from Auschwitz as you can get and that's. That's a direction you know, it's, it's, it's not as specific as you might like it to be, but that's also why I've been suggesting to people that they think about this locally.

Speaker 2:          00:27:12       It's like, okay, we're not so sure what the utopia might be and we know that collectively, presuming a utopia also seems to be a dangerous thing, but there are stupid things that you're doing to make your life and the life of people around you more wretched and miserable than necessary, and it's hypothetically the case that you could stop doing some of them, so there is a good place to start. It's nice and humble. It's like you're less than you could be and you know it, and there's things you could do about that and you know it. So, so maybe maybe it would be okay to take a step in the right direction,

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       think you say in the book, and you open the return to the, uh, the, the basic truth, and you say that you arrive at this when you contemplate the horribleness of the 20th century with Auschwitz and the Gulag and the life there is, life is suffering and you can't, you can produce the way the pain of existence. And uh, there is no totalitarian that can reduce the way that

Speaker 2:          00:28:22       you can just forbid it in Venezuela. Now it's illegal to last list the cause of the death of a child as starvation in the hospitals. That's convenient. Oh yes. Isn't that something? Isn't that something? So there we go. Now we've got the utopia. It's now illegal to die of starvation in the hospital in Venezuela, or at least to have it listed. And that's exactly it, man. There is a little slice of hell for you.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       One of the. It's easier to move away from, it's not easy, but it's, it's easier to stop doing, causing harm and causing suffering. Then too, uh, Ryan at bliss, that's sort of a basic way. We are very bad at a pretty bad, uh, having eternal bliss in this life.

Speaker 2:          00:29:20       Well, yeah, it's not easy to conceptualize what it would be. I mean, you do, you do taste it at times, you know, you tasted with music. And of course that's why there's imagery of angels and, and the heavenly hosts singing, you know, because people do get a taste of what paradise might be like when they listened to music, which is why music is so powerful for people because it speaks of a kind of transcendent harmony of the, of the layers of being. And it engages a person in that. And you get that as well when you're engaged in what you're doing, deeply engaged in what you're doing and finding meaningful but mean stepping rapidly away from hell might be a form of bliss. You know, to know that a minimum, you're not contributing to the terrible suffering of the world and maybe you're doing something to to lift the, to lift the burden in a positive way.

Speaker 2:          00:30:09       I mean, it's really complicated because you don't want everything to be easy. That's not a good idea for utopia. Everything's blissful, uneasy, and all you're doing is laying back and eating peeled grapes. You know it's. There's nothing to that that would last more than a week. You need and need an adventure and you need a struggle, but perhaps we could have the adventure and the struggle without the pointless suffering and malevolence. We could at least aim at that and then who knows what we might transmute that into at least we might be able to transmute it into lives that are meaningful despite their suffering. That would be a good start and I do believe that that's a. I believe that that's an attainable reality. I believe that that we are strong enough as in our essence to rise above the tragedy of existence and to live normally and with purpose and honorably. I believe we can do that, and so that's why I think 12 rules for life is a fundamentally optimistic book because I also think that that's a believable message. No one's going to say, well, we believe that. Well, we're going to eradicate suffering and malevolence. It's like, no, I don't think so, but we can constrain it within the confines of our own being. And that's good enough. That's a good start.

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       Rule number eight, you say, tell the truth. You should tell the truth and you're right, that it is our responsibility is to see what it is before our eyes courageously and to learn from it, even if it seems horrible, even if the horror of seeing them, which is our consciousness and half for instance. Uh, and then I just thought about that for awhile. And, uh, during the, when Isis invaded Iraq in 2007, 14, I think it was 2015, 2014. And, uh, I was one of the few who wrote about following that right then because nobody thought it would take over such a large part of Iraq. And then I was watching loads of videos of mass killings and the capitations and murders, and I was seeing, I had contact with eyewitnesses via a journalists whose names Newark Newer Keno, and it was horrible, really, really horrible, horrible, the most horrible thing I've ever seen.

Speaker 1:          00:32:45       And because I had contact with neuro Akina, whose father had had family members down there, Assyrian Christians who are being murdered and driven from their homes. And this was even before the same jar where they took this sex slaves and they murdered the whole people use the CDC app. So it was really horrible. And so for them, I mean, of course that's the big deal. Uh, but I, I felt I had the responsibility to see this for myself, get not just listening to journalists who hadn't seen it because I was writing about it a lot myself and I could feel it changing me because this is the absolute as close to absolute darkness as I've ever come come. Because it was, it was, it was not historical. These for people, uh, some younger than me, some older. But it was happening as I was watching it. Uh, and then I thought about the quote by nature, if you gaze into their business, their business also gazes into you. And I really felt that I was thinking about this when I read your book for the. I would ask you that. How can you be certain that you can defeat the, the darkness that when you face that, I mean it's a.

Speaker 2:          00:34:12       I don't think that you can be certain that you can say, well, if you go to face the dragon to get the gold, it wouldn't be a dragon if it could meet you. The issue isn't that the issue isn't that you're certain of success. The issue is that you don't have a better pathway. And so if you're going to confront the dragon of chaos, say and dare to attain the goal, then you have to put yourself on the line for it. But paradoxically it seems the more you're willing to put yourself on the line for it, the higher the probability of your success. Which is also the part of opening yourself up to the catastrophe. Knowing. That's why Christianity has increasingly occupied the theater of in my imagination, because there's this idea that you know, even speaking psychologically that whatever Christ represents, whatever that image is, it is in part the call to accept the catastrophe of existence, to accept it voluntarily because the fundamental story is that Christ went to his torturous betrayal with his eyes open, right and well, that's a hell of a thing.

Speaker 2:          00:35:24       It's no wonder that image has never left people's imagination because that's the reason you can't ask any more of someone than that and you might say, well, is it okay that everything will be asked of us? And the answer is it doesn't matter because everything is going to be asked of you like you're going to die. You're going to have to accept that in one, in one form or another. The question is how well the answer is what? You have to open your arms. You have to accept it. You know when there's an idea in the new testament that if you can, if you can love fate deeply enough, you can transfer, you can transcend your limitations of your mortality. It's something like that and you know, that's, that strikes me as a plausible possibility. Now you said when you were watching all those things that, that changed you. You mean what did, what did it change?

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       You realize what's your facing something real if evil has, has meaning, if there is evil that is evil, and what if that was sort of then you have a terrorist attack in Sweden and in your, you started sort of thing. What would I, what would I do if I were in that situation? And you speak to people who have, who have relatives there and you realize that, uh, you're very lucky but you living in Sweden and not there because I, I, I think would not be very hard to take up arms against these people. That's the thing is that you realize things about yourself if you, if it gets to that device.

Speaker 2:          00:37:15       Well, you know, the terrible thing too is, and this is a Motif, again that also runs through 12 rules for life, is that, well, let's say when the, when the. I'll give you a personal example. So when I heard about what happened in Cologne on the new, on New Year's eve and I see I had a situation where my son was mugged a number of years ago and he was mugged by a gang of, of kids that were brought into our neighborhood as a favor to them so that they can play basketball in a local boys and girls club. And there was about six or seven of them, 18 years old and they mugged my 13 year old son and took his, his, um, I think they took his cell phone and he came home and he was shaken up mostly with anger because he couldn't believe that six, 18 year old young men could be so cowardly that they would gang up on a 13 year old kid.

Speaker 2:          00:38:09       Like. So for him it was a betrayal of humanity apart from being afraid. But mostly it was anger on his part and I was absolutely outraged. So I contacted the police and I contacted the nearby club that had sponsored two kids and I said, look, this is what happened. And they did nothing about it. The club knew who it was and wouldn't release the names because of confidentiality and all sorts of other nonsense and I had this fantasy that went on for weeks about standing outside the boys and girls club and waiting for those kids with a lead pipe because I was not happy, but you know, I was and I couldn't pursue it with any degree of legal. I couldn't pursue it to the degree that I wanted to in the legal framework because at the same time my daughter was very ill and that was taking precedence.

Speaker 2:          00:39:01       But you know, I had these terrible fantasies come up over and over the very, very dark fantasies and I talked it over with my son because I told him what was happening in my imagination because I want it to let them know that this really bothered me. That he was attacked and that I wasn't going to put up with it. But I also understood that that's not. See. I would have been. I think I would have been a very weak man to not have had those feelings. And then you think, well, lots of times it's the better man that takes up arms, but it isn't necessarily the best man who takes up arms because maybe there's a place past that you might say, well, it's naive it and cowardice that stops you from defending yourself, you know, and then you transcend naivety and cowardice and then you become dangerous. But maybe you can transcend dangerous. Maybe there's a place past that. And well, let's hope there is.

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       I'm not sure if it's in the book, but the, you said it before, you have to develop some teeth because you can, you shouldn't mistake a weakness for virtue.

Speaker 2:          00:40:19       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:40:21       And, but in Christianity, and one, one thing that I struggled with, Christianity is the meek shall inherit.

Speaker 2:          00:40:29       Yeah. But you know, I read, I learned it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       The other world of Christianity that I find very. I'm not sure if it's a temperamental.

Speaker 2:          00:40:43       No, it's a mis translation. I looked that up. That's a line that always bothered me. And I, when I did these biblical lectures last year, which I'm going to continue by the way, as soon as I can possibly manage it. Um, I looked up that line, there's a couple of lines that really, really, I couldn't forget them. I'm the poor, will always be with us. That was one, um, to those who have everything more shall be given from those who have everything from those who have nothing. Everything will be taken away. That's a rough one. And then the meek shall inherit the earth. But meek is the wrong word. Has slipped over time. It doesn't what it meant. If you go back into the original, if you go back the original texts, let's say here's a better translation, um, those who have swords and know how to use them, but keep the machines will inherit the world right

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       on the cheek in Christianity.

Speaker 2:          00:41:53       Yeah. Well that goes along with that. Resist not evil, but look, look, I can tell you some things I've learned about that too. So I'll give you two examples. So, you know, there's been a lot of points for me in the last 18 months where things could have gone badly wrong. So for example, I went to mcmaster university about a year ago or thereabouts and there was a big demonstration and it was quite obnoxious. I mean there was about 200 people there that were just see me, came to see me in about 50 protesters likely and they drowned me out completely. And, and, and there was a handful of them who were really, I would say really not good people, like most of them were just foolish kids and foolish self righteous kids who were diluted by the radiant professors and by their own resentment. But there were four or five people there who would have been perfectly happy in that crowd that you described that descended into Iraq.

Speaker 2:          00:42:51       And I can tell who they were by looking at them. They, you know, they were people that, that just, they just, I perhaps I'm wrong. But I, I, I believe that I could see what they were. And there were two of them behind me, woman and a man. The woman wasn't quite so bad, but the man was pretty bad and they were blaring air horns at me, an air horn apnea and close enough to damage my hearing, which I was not the least bit impressed about. And I told them, I said, look, you can blow your Damn Air Horn, but if you get it too close to me. Well I went and I went and had a word with the police at that point, but you know, so, so it was quite, it was quite provoking and, and, and pushy, but I just, I knew that most of it was foolishness and I mostly watched and I tried to give my talk and it was completely drowned out and then we had to leave and I gave the rest of my talk outside.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       But you know, all of that was filmed and then it was put up on youtube and all of the consequences of that holding my temper, all of the consequences of that was positive. And that's one thing I've really learned and it is associated with this idea of resist not evil and also of turning the other cheek. It's, it's not like you can't respond, it's that you don't. And then without Kathy Newman interview, you know, it's the same thing. It's a good really good example of that is that no one, maybe I managed it because I have had quite a bit of experience now dealing with hostile people and hostile press let's say, but I, I was able fortunately to stay detached and, and with, with maybe with even with a bit of a sense of humor during the interview and not take it personally and not get offended by it. Even though what was happening was deeply wrong. There was an element of being able to be detached about it and that worked, you know, like I didn't really fight with her. I didn't allow her to set the linguistic agenda, let's say, but I didn't defend myself anymore than was absolutely necessary. You know, it's minimal necessary for something like that and that was overwhelmingly, it was overwhelmingly well received.

Speaker 1:          00:45:28       When you, you're in a public situation, it's sort of a, it's a different. It's different when you meet someone in streets, if you're one on one stuff to you or if you're at a dinner in a personal setting or something, but when you're in a public setting it's basically a, your receiving so you can, you can be detached because it's not really the whole you, is there an Avatar of yourself, a speaker or a role you inhabit so you can have it, you can have patients, not you, you, but, but I mean as a person you don't have to take it. So personally I think people make that mistake.

Speaker 2:          00:46:15       Yeah. Well that's, that's the thing too is like, it's not easy to know when you should take something personally and when you shouldn't. Like I didn't give you a good example of that too from politics like years ago. Who was running for. I think it was Mondale. I think so, I might have this wrong, but he was um, he was governor of Massachusetts now. Who was that? Who? Who ran for governor of Massachusetts. Oh. Anyways, I wasn't Monday, I don't believe, but it doesn't matter. He, he was governor of Massachusetts and he had released a, a prisoner or or his or his prison system and released to prisoner who immediately raped someone and he was being raked over the coals on a TV show about, about the fact that this has happened. I think the rapist name was Willie Horton, if I remember correctly. Dukakis was. It was Dukakis when Dukakis was running for president and a journalist asked him, well, how would you feel if, um, Willie Horton had raped your wife or your daughter and your CAC is gave a very, I would say placid answer, and it, it was one of the things that insured, he was not going to be elected president president.

Speaker 2:          00:47:35       And what he should have said was my imagination would immediately go to the darkest possible place, but because I'm a civilized person and understand that that pathway leads to nothing but may have, I'd be willing to let the legal system take that moral obligation from my shoulders because otherwise everything gets worse. That's the right response. The first response is mess with my family at your peril. And the second response is, yeah, but I don't get to start a feud. I don't get to destabilize the entire society in my pursuit of what you might regard as justifiable revenge. Right? And so that's part of that idea of having a sword, but keeping it, she's right and it is the opposite of, of, and I talk about that in rule 11, don't bother their children were going to skateboarding, which is in part a a, I suppose a bit of a diatribe against the idea that the way that you make men good is by making them weak. It's a really uninformed and and naive, uninformed and malicious idea. All of those things. At the same time, you make men good by making them unbelievably strong and dangerous and then asking them politely to hold themselves in a band at all times

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       dangerous. It's just being strong. Something. If you are strong, then you have the capacity to be dangerous, right? Something separate from being strong. So people have misinterpreted sometimes when they heard you that they think you're calling for sort of the British, a hyper masculine men. But that's not what I heard you say, I heard you say, is that if you have somebody who's confident and strong in your convictions and you speak the truth and you're not afraid to, uh, to protest when something is wrong and stand up for yourself and stand up for people a week and then a protection, then you're strong and then you can be dangerous. Uh, but yes. So, uh, have you starting a testosterone or something? I'm not sure.

Speaker 2:          00:50:19       Right? Well, of course, that's exactly for people who are afraid of who, for people who are afraid of or hate competence, like to confuse it with tyranny. And you know, the mean Joe Rogan is kind of an interesting example in that regard because, and so is this guy named Jocko willink who's got an increasingly popular podcast and willing because he's a very tough guy, you know, he's very physically intimidating and I would say psychologically intimidated

Speaker 1:          00:50:51       comic book character looks and what he has done in real life.

Speaker 2:          00:50:56       Exactly, exactly. Well, there's also that. That's exactly right. He's articulate and all of those things and you know, and he told me quite clearly that he could have easily been like a hyper delinquent when he was a kid, but decided that he was, because he's, you know, he's, he's, he's an aggressive guy and he decided he was going to be a good person instead and you can't be a good person without the capacity for malevolence interestingly enough. And you know, maybe that's one of the reasons if you think about it metaphysically, let's say. I mean, one question is always be, well, why? Why is there evil in the world? And I mean this is only a partial answer, but it's possible that you cannot fully develop your capacity for good without also developing your capacity for evil because you have to be able to do things even if you will do them. I mean, even if it's a matter of learning how to withstand temptation and until you're in a position where that temptation is real, you're not withstanding anything. So you know, if you're not sleeping with 100 women a year because they're not lining up to sleep with you, that doesn't make you moral. It just makes you undesirable.

Speaker 1:          00:52:09       Yeah. I also think this is perhaps one of the reasons that the bad guys or so or so people want to be the bad guy and the band guys. Interesting in movies and TV series and also this is part of the is actually a part of Christianity which I think is very interesting, is that the protocol sheet returning to the herb and the protocol and and you, you find that in the most awful criminal who's starting to have doubts then that's an, that's a great one of the best characters in movies. I mean the, the awful villain who's having second thoughts and then in the end turns out to have a heart of gold. Yes, yes, yes. But if you, if you are the lamb that's much more, that's a boring movie. Like, like the lamb who's, who's never done anything wrong. You can't because you can't.

Speaker 2:          00:53:24       Yeah. Well there's an. There's an interesting scene in revelation in revelation, which is a very strange book. It's like a hallucinogenic. It's like a hallucinogenic trip. In fact, I think it probably is a hallucinogenic trip. That's my suspicions. So Christ comes back with a sword in his mouth and he judges humanity and so he's very merciful in the gospels, but in revelation, he's the ultimate judge. And the reason for that is that any ideal is a judge, right? If you hold something up as an ideal, then you are reflected poorly in the mirror of that ideal. So it's instantly a judge and there are far more damage than saved in, in, in the revelation story. But Christ tells people when he judges them, um, I'm, I'm paraphrasing, but, but, but the meaning is, is, is appropriate. Um, if you're hot, that's okay. That's commendable. If you're cold, that's okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:25       But if you're lukewarm then I'll vomit you out of my mouth. That's the line. And that's so interesting because it, it's, it's, again, it's an echo of what you just described, is there, there is no virtue in, in non commitment, right? There is no virtue in week harmlessness in fact it. And you see that too. I mean when, when, when Hannah wrote, wrote her, her book on Eichmann in Jerusalem, it's Eichmann in Jerusalem, I believe the banality of evil. She talked about Eichmann and Eichmann was one of these characters who was a lamb, right? He, he, he was, he wasn't, you're spectacular cartoon book villain. He was the harmless kind of soft guy next door who sort of went along to get along and he happened to be in a hierarchy where the goal was to eradicate the Jews. But who is he to question the hierarchy? No one. So she titled Her Book The banality of evil. And I always thought she had the titled Backwards. It should have been the evil of banality.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       I haven't thought of that.

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       Yeah, that's a deep thought.

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       I've read a couple of Christian critique. So your, your, uh, your thoughts and your, your book and one of the, uh, one of the critiques was that you, you think that because people have within their grasp to do good and evil by themselves, uh, your committing to a Christian heresy called pelagianism.

Speaker 2:          00:56:15       Yeah. See, I don't really believe that. I don't really believe that, but it's very difficult

Speaker 1:          00:56:22       because eastern orthodoxy then you can only do good because of our sinful nature. You can only do good by the grace of God. So we are, if we have, if we are not sinful in our nature, if we deny that, then we are basically, uh, uh, having, uh, committing vanity because we think we are so struck by that, that that's a claim that I've seen being thrown a critique that I was a thought that I would like to hear you respond to them because

Speaker 2:          00:57:01       yeah, it's an unbelievably deep problem. So the first thing I would say, you can only speak metaphorically about such things in some sense. So I would say the Christian claim is that Christ's sacrifice redeemed us. And so I would say that's true, but we still have to do the work. You might say, well, how can both of those things be the case simultaneously? And the answer is, well, it depends on your view of time. So and I can't explain it any deeper than that, so I'm not going to because it would take forever. But I would also say I do believe that you should step forward to do good. Humbly. I do believe that if you're going to step forward to do good, that you should do it well guided by the, by the divine images.

Speaker 2:          00:57:58       I do believe that you're likely to err in your judgment of what's good, which is why I entitled the chapter, don't tell the truth or at least don't lie. It isn't obvious to me that you can discern the truth, but it is obvious to me that sometimes you know when you're lying and you could stop doing that. And so I think that those critiques are now, but then I would also invert the criticism and I would say that part of the danger of modern western Christianity in particular. I don't think this is quite the same with the Orthodox Christian types is that by assuming that everything good is done by the grace of God, you reduce the burden of the imitation of Christ. The question is, what does it mean to believe in Christ? Let's say, and one answer to that would be to say, I regard this statement that Christ's crucifixion redeemed me.

Speaker 2:          00:58:58       I regard that statement as true. Say I'm a Christian. Okay, well that's one definition. Here's another definition. Pick up your cross and walk up the Goddamn hill and that's the proper definition as far as I'm concerned. And so and this is a nichey and critic criticism of, of institutionalized Christianity, which is that it lifts, it made moral board burden to light because the burden is supposed to be confront evil constraint in your own heart except the tragedy of being pick up the load of mortality and walk up hill. It's like, God, that's rough man. So and then young wrote about that, you know, because he was interested in the Nietzschean critique and he said, look, you got to understand that you can be cynical about the Catholics and their idea that you've been redeemed by an external source. Say it's not that it's not precisely that clear will parody a bit for the sake of argument and maybe you can also be.

Speaker 2:          00:59:59       I'm cynical about the idea that you can go in and confess and receive absolution and walk out sin free, but you have to understand is the church is somewhat merciful and its endeavors because it's trying to also free people from the intolerable consciousness of their own insufficiency. You know, cause I couldn't say to you, well, you need to bear the weight of all your transgressions. It's like Jesus really with no mercy. That's how we're going to play this. Who could tolerate that? And the Catholics at least say, well look, you're fallible. You're going to make all sorts of mistakes. It's going to happen over and over. At least can go in and have the burden lifted from time to time. You're supposed to play it straight. You're supposed to go in and actually confess and repent and try to do better in the future, but at least you don't have to drag your catastrophic cell past self along with you every step of the way. So anyways, I'm not trying to elevate human beings to the status of demi gods, you know, but I guess I am suggesting that we can at least participate in that to the degree that we're willing to hoist our own burdens. And I do think we should do that with humility and without thinking that we can see the way forward. So clearly. I do think we can walk away from Auschwitz though.

Speaker 1:          01:01:19       Yeah, I think so too. I know. No, this was, uh, this has been a recurring question for you. I'm not sure if I asked you the last time really it's about truth and how you return to the Christianity. Some parts of Christianity. This has been true. You said like the truth of the individual, I think you said, and how. My question is how can, how can be true and, and um, four for cs Lewis when he, when he started like accepted that Christianity was true for him, it was like a mixture. He was a talked into it by talking and I don't remember that guy's name with one other friend and he said the combination of a myth or a dying God, he always loved the dying like diagnosis and um, but, but, but in Christ it company combining the dying God wrote with an actual historical figure. He actually set that this is a, it's not just a myth. It's true. It's true because it's also historical. And then he said that, and then you distinguished. If you, if you watch from the outside and analyze it, well of course you can see that it's, it's just so you can see similarities as a scientist, but from the inside because if the truth. And so that was his, his view of it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:03       Here's, here's the strange possibility. One of the things that's happened to me as I've delved farther and farther into religious stories is that I've found continually that their depth is inexhaustible. And at some point it becomes less impossible that they're true, then it is impossible that they're not true. Something like that now, okay, now I'm not. So there are, there are, there are truths in genesis that are unfathomably deep now and I've outlined them to the best of my ability in the biblical series that I did. Now I don't know how to reconcile those truths with, with, with, with the scientific view of the world that the view, the fact that the universe is 14 billion years old and that we've crawled our way up from the sludge and the mod. I don't know how those things coexist precisely. I know that there are truths that guide behavior and there are truths that describe the material world, but I certainly don't think that the truth that we have that described the material world, our final truths, because I don't think our material is few point is accurate.

Speaker 2:          01:04:18       It's accurate for some purposes obviously. Um, and I am a practicing scientist and, and, and uninformed one, I would say, um, I don't believe that people act as if they confronted material reality. I believe that people act as if they confront and infinite realm of possibility, one pole of which is having and the other pole of which is held and I believe that we treat each other as if that's the world that we live in because we upgrade each other for not upholding our moral duty and we understand what that means and we upgrade ourselves for being less than we could, and so we confront a world of potential and we don't have a good model for that and the mythological descriptions describe the human being as the eternal confronter have a world of potential and there's something about that. It's accurate. Now, with regards to this Christian stories specifically, I do think the idea that that eternal myth was made historically concrete is one of the things about Christianity that's unalterably powerful.

Speaker 2:          01:05:21       I don't know what the limits are, but let's say that what you're called upon to do until in life is to open yourself up to the tragedy of being completely to. To accept it, to welcome it, even even to love it. If you can do that, and that's no easy thing you watched Iraq being invaded, there's no easy way of loving. Now, there's no easy way of saying yes to that, but your job in some sense as a, as a incarnated finite creature, is to say yes to the possibilities of being in every possible way. The question is, well, what's the upper limit to that? Like what are the transformations that are possible as a consequence of doing that? And the answer to that is we don't know. The Christian story is in part an investigation of that is if you're willing to accept your. If you're willing to accept the brutality of the mob, the betrayal of your friends, the torture of your existence and your unjust death. If you're willing to accept that and welcome it, what happens to you? And the answer is try it and find out just the scenario though. Well, you did that in part, you know, when you, when you were, when you decided to immerse yourself in what was happening in Iraq, you know, you could have looked away. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:52       Four. I often find that the, my, uh, my role as a journalist or I'm not a real journalist, I'm more like an editor. I'm an editorial right, that, but it's sort of a missed between me and some reality, so I could, I can, I can do it as a

Speaker 2:          01:07:13       take on my,

Speaker 1:          01:07:15       my jackets and then I watched the reality through that Lens. So it sort of shields me from some, some of it. But

Speaker 2:          01:07:24       yeah. Well that's the advantage of having a well developed persona from the union perspective. You know, you put on an image like, like Clark Kent, Superman puts on Clark Kent. That's why superheroes always having a normative alter ego, right? They have to be able to live in the normal world. Right? So you need to have an element of yourself that can, that can exist. Well, they can act as a mask between you and the world. I suppose that's what a persona is. So, but I mean to the degree that you're able to open your eyes, you know, neat. You also said you could determine the depth of a man's character by observing how much truth he's willing to tolerate. Right? Right. Which is, you know, you think, well, how can that be associated with the idea of the truth will set you free. It's like, well, it might set you free, but it will take you places you're not sure you want to go first.

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       Yeah. In the movie matrix when neo wakes up and he's flushed down the drain pipe, woken up to this awful, awful world. And that's reality. That's the truth of the underworld and it's an old truth. Uh, hopefully the truth is not all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:08:54       Yeah. Well, you know, there's an old. Well, the funny thing is that there's an old Christian idea too, that when Christ was crucified, he went and harrowed hell before he rose to heaven. It's like there is this idea that you don't go up without going down. And I really do believe that's true. And I think that maybe see, one of the images in genesis that's really hard to understand is that when God throws Adam and Eve out of paradise, he puts an angel at the gates of Paradise with with flaming swords to borrow the way you might think, well, why would God bar the way to paradise with with flaming swords? And maybe the flaming swords cut all the dead wood off before you step through the gate. And if you're all dead wood, then there's nothing left of you. Once the flaming swords are done with you and to observe what you observe with the Iraq invasion, that's a set of flaming swords. You know, because what you're watching is what human beings are like and you happen to be one. And to the degree that you're like that, that's you doing that. That's a hell of a thing too. That's a hell of a thing to realize. You think, well, what's the right response to watching that? And I would say to stop being an evil person and now it's no simple thing.

Speaker 1:          01:10:07       One of the things with these people that met goes there and during the Icelandic state, they're evil, they're just, a lot of them are evil. Of course they are psychopaths and are, and if you are a psychopath and you really want to do violence, that's a great place to be and you can probably do great there. But there are also people joining the error. Really. They want to do good. They just really a really twisted sense of what's good. And that's one of the most depressing things about, uh, Islamic state is that some of the people that go there, uh, they do horrible things and then they regret themselves. But I mean, how could you let them back into society after what they've done?

Speaker 2:          01:10:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:11:03       Yeah. So, so it's the power of ideas is you can, you can convert people that under others circumstances would have done, done good.

Speaker 2:          01:11:15       The tools so evil and stuff. Well, this is partly why I tried in some sense are allowed, in some sense, 12 rules and my lectures as well to be so harsh because imagine that there are many young men who are looking for an adventure. They need an adventure, right? They need an adventure, and maybe their normative life is sufficiently soft and undemanding so that they could recede into a kind of domestic unconsciousness as an alternative, but there's nothing in that except a prolonged prolonged non-existence, self contempt and bitterness, right? It's not good. You need to be called to an adventure, and so I would say, well look, this is what etiologies offer young people is the call to an adventure, but it's a false adventure. I would say instead, look, you want an adventure is open up your eyes, open up your eyes to what the world is really like, and then take your place in it as a productive, awake, attentive, and truthful being and see how far you can walk up hill.

Speaker 2:          01:12:20       That's an adventure. It's the alternative to the call to war, right? Because the call to wars and adventure, William James said a 130 140 years ago, we need a moral equivalent to war and, and, and, and it touches on exactly what you're saying is these, these kids who are lost, let's say, and maybe somewhat bitter and resentful as a consequence. They see in Isis a call to adventure. Well, you know, I understand that. I saw this kid once in Montreal and an outside shopping mall. He was about six foot five and he was dressed up like a punk rocker, you know, and he was standing on the corner with two pink shopping bags in his hand and I thought, what a ridiculous figure he cut because he was all dressed up like a viking. Right? He was ready to go out there and have his damn adventure.

Speaker 2:          01:13:13       And what he was doing instead was standing in an outdoor shopping mall with two pink shopping bags. It's like, come up to a kid like that and you say, hey, you want to go get into some trouble, some interesting trouble. He's gonna like throw those shopping bags away and come with you instantly. It's like, okay, well you need some interesting trouble. Well, what could that be? Well, here's something. Get your act together, discipline yourself, look at the world, see if you can find a problem to solve, grow up. You know, when. What's so interesting. One of the things that's been so interesting to me to observe as a consequence of what I've been talking about is just how many people are starving for that message. You know, I have after my talks now say I was in La and about 700 people lined up afterwards to have a book signed and they, all, the vast majority of them have a story to tell and so the little exchanges I have with people are very intense, you know, because they want to have a minute to tell me what's happening and, or 30 seconds even and they say, look, here was 10 things going terribly wrong with my life and I've been trying to aim up and say what I have to say it.

Speaker 2:          01:14:25       Everything's much better. Thank you very much and I thank God, good work, and then the next person comes up and says the same thing and I've got like 25,000 letters that have said that since August. And so, you know, there is a way of calling people to an adventure that perhaps isn't destructive. They have enough right in front of them to have a great adventure if they're, if they're willing, let's say, to try not to lie and to tell the truth and to aim up hill. Maybe that adventures right in front of us. Maybe that's part of, maybe that's part of the process of engendering paradise, to find the adventure in, in, to find the proper divide. Excuse me, to, to find the divine adventure in every individual life. That's the, that's that union of the divine and the historical and Christianity too, right? It's to make the archetype real.

Speaker 1:          01:15:23       Number six, set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world. I think that also you begin, you begin with yourself and you start to be, be the change, so to speak. And that's, uh, a way of, um, being bitter against the world, at least not to begin with.

Speaker 2:          01:15:48       At least that's right. It's a start. You can say to yourself, look, everything looks pretty terrible to me. What the hell? How can it be this way? But then you can take the next step and say, yeah, maybe I not everything I could be. So how about if I try to be everything I could be? And then think about it again later and it's the right. That's because the alternative to that is just a catastrophe, right?

Speaker 1:          01:16:17       That's the key to dignity, right? Can Be dignified. Even if you're, you're not the best, strongest, most beautiful love. If you, if you set yourself in order and you take yourself seriously, then you can have dignity and other people will notice it and you will notice it. That's a great place to start from and to strive for, and that's one of the most. One of the best things about your book really, that you, you bring dignity into, I think, bring to people's lives with this book. Go with your lecturers. One of the takeaways I have from speaking with people, because after the last interview I did and then people read the piece I wrote and then people, a lot of people thank me for introducing you to and then that's been one of the recurring themes. I feel so much a strongly themselves, so some of them at least.

Speaker 2:          01:17:23       I think that's a great. That's a great observation. I mean, you know our society's week because we think about happiness. Why don't we think about dignity? Why don't we think about mobility? Why don't we think about truth and responsibility or beauty. All of those things there. They're much. They're the values that sustain you through suffering. Happiness cannot do that. Not that happiness is is to be to be what? There's no, there's no utility in contempt for happiness. Thank God if it comes, but dignity mean we can't even. When is the last time you heard someone talk about that? Even part of the public discourse and it's so crucial.

Speaker 1:          01:18:14       It's not something you strive for it too much. You won't get it.

Speaker 2:          01:18:19       Do you mean dignity or happiness? Happiness. Definitely. Well, you might say if you strive for dignity and truth, sometimes you'll be rewarded with happiness. Right. That's a grace of God that that happiness, that's not something you can conjure up on your own. Good luck trying.

Speaker 1:          01:18:41       So I think I've taken up almost two hours of your time and we write the piece, makes the interview with the book and also just I was writing this piece and it was 18,000 characters and I was just so stressed out and I was telling my wife, it's like fighting. It hydrates, new heads coming up all the time and she was just laughing at me like, oh, you read too much. He's invaded your language either.

Speaker 2:          01:19:19       Well that's a terrible thing with regards to architectural stories is that once you hear them, there's no getting rid of them.

Speaker 1:          01:19:25       My wife has also read your book, so we're talking. We've talked a lot about you.

Speaker 2:          01:19:29       Well say hello to her for me and maybe we can bump into each other when I come to Sweden. Yeah, you should really come in the fall.

Speaker 1:          01:19:37       I would love to meet. I'll stay in touch with, with regards to the. When I'm done with the text and everything,

Speaker 2:          01:19:46       great. Nice talking with you. Nice talking to you, kate. Bye. Bye.
