Speaker 1:          00:21          Dear a Dr. Harris, please forgive me and this goes for whatever audience this video might attract for reading this, but I need to make this quick and coherent and this is the fastest way of doing so. I want you to address some of the issues that I believe made our discussion both more trying and less valuable. That might've been a problem that many of the people who now listened to it rightly identify. I think that our discussion would perhaps would be more productive if we started from the realization that we're both trying to address the same problem. What is the relationship between science and ethics?

Speaker 2:          01:02          Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:03          you see, ethics is nested inside scientific realism. Now obviously that's a contentious claim, which is not the same as it being wrong, but the fact that it's contentious re David Hume and his problem with deriving an art from an is means that there is a real problem there. I see scientific rate realism is nested inside Darwinian competition, at least potentially, not necessarily. I could be wrong, but I am trying to address the real problem and I think the fact that you're addressing the science slash ethics problem indicates that you see that there's a real problem there too.

Speaker 2:          01:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46          I also think we only got to the problems with my formulation, not the problems with your solution. For example, the problem with measuring wellbeing, you consider the enhancement of wellbeing, the proper and of ethics. However, the psychological measures of wellbeing currently used are almost only trait extroversion minus trait neuroticism. That's happiness minus sadness. Well that's how well being is currently defined. Well, that proposition is faulty in every way. It's a big problem. It's a measurement problem. It's a scientific realism problem. You might say, well, we need better measures of wellbeing, and I would say, well exactly, and those will have to be nested inside the Darwinian conundrum. How should we act in the world?

Speaker 1:          02:36          Here's an answer individually so that the family thrives at the family level so that society thrives at the societal level so that the ecosystem thrives and and not just today, tomorrow, next week, next year and across time. That's the problem. The developmental psychologist John Piaget was trying to address when he studied the moral development of children. Piaget was interested in solving the problem of the relationship between science and ethics, and he looked how he looked at how ethics in children emerged and transformed into adulthood. That's what drove his entire life. He was trying to formulate a scientific solution to the problem and ethics, and I've drawn a lot of my thinking from that.

Speaker 2:          03:21          Okay,

Speaker 1:          03:22          now I'm going to jump to a level of analysis, and when I do so, it will make many think I've gone off the rails of this argument. I ask for your indulgence. While I tried to put things together that have not yet been put together, this means that I have to present many ideas simultaneously as if looking at a picture or as if describing a picture, which is how these ideas have frequently been represented. The individual who acts in this equilibrated manner is the mythological hero. It's the mythological hero who confronts the attention, the unknown, with a tension and intent to communicate. It's the archetypal hero who obtains the gold from the eternal dragon, the dragon of chaos. That's an evolved representation of the predatory but promising domain beyond the safety of the tree or the campfire.

Speaker 2:          04:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:18          It's the archetypal hero who distributes the goal that he, that he obtains from the dragon to the community. It's him who rescues the youthful virgin from the predatory reptile that Saint George, it's the oldest story. We know it's in the Enuma Elish, the Mesopotamian creation myth upon which the opening lines of genesis are founded. Can't you see an evolutionary relationship that's the archetypal hero. That's first a way of behaving. Second, it's a representation of that way of behaving. Third, it's a way of organizing society itself around that action and representation forth. It's that society that then selects through masculine competition for the best contender to that representation and finally, it's what is selected for by women who peel off the top of the masculine competition. Women outsource the impossible cognitive task of mate selection to the male dominance hierarchy. Hero emerges at the top of the competition. He gets all the girls. It's that what's it's that which is selected for and he human females perform part of the selection process there. Mother Nature, the selection apparatus that choosy maters it. Female chimps or not.

Speaker 2:          05:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:44          The archetype will hero might be regarded as a super meme in Richard Dawkins terminology, it's been around so long that we have adapted biologically to its existence just as we have in every way to the presence of the 300 million year old dominance hierarchy, which is more permanent, more real, even from a strictly realist perspective than such evanescent phenomena as amphibians, reptiles and mammals. It's even older than trees.

Speaker 2:          06:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:15          The closer you are to that article hero, the more likely you are at least as a male to when the dominance hierarchy contest that makes you attractive to women.

Speaker 2:          06:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:27          If Richard Dawkins who formulated the idea of the meme was wiser, he would have been Carl Young. An archetype is the ultimate meme.

Speaker 2:          06:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:37          In my opinion, we need to have a real conversation. Not An argument. It's not that I think you're wrong, it's that I think that there's a real problem here, which we both recognize and are both trying to solve.

Speaker 1:          06:50          If none of this makes even the least bit of sense, if it doesn't at least peak your curiosity, if you can't see that we're obsessed by the same problem, then we won't be able to talk and that would be a shame. You're very sharp and precise, but I think in patterns somebody said, listening to us was like the right hemisphere of a single brain talking to the left. That's a good metaphor. There wouldn't be so many people trying to get us to talk if we didn't have something to discuss. The relationship between science and ethics is vitally important. If we had a real conversation and no fault is employed on your part, we might be able to further the solution to the problem. Thanks for listening and watching.
