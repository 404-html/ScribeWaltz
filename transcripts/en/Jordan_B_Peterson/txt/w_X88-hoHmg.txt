Speaker 1:          00:00:03       No, I use this picture to represent my class. You might not know anything about this picture. It's a picture of Jonah being thrown out of a whale's belly after spending three days inside. It's an old biblical story. It's a myth. It's a fairy tale. That's. That's one way of looking at it and and I don't mean that in a derogative manner. We know for example, that somebody gribbins brothers' fairytales are perhaps 50,000 years old. It'd be traced back. The really, really old and old stories are strange and they're strange because only been told generation after generation after generation, so you can imagine that something retooled over such an expansive, expansive time has been reduced to its just many, many times and nothing in the story anymore. It's all meaningful in some sense. Sort of like a a story that's one way of thinking about imagine that you took 100 books, hundred adventure books, and you had to extract out the central features of an adventure.

Speaker 1:          00:01:17       For now it's hard to do that. It's like you're averaging across the or something like that. Instilling them in some manner. You get up Amanda and denture and it would be like a myth upon which all adventures are based and this story is actually one of those stores, and I'm going to tell you what I think the story means, and I'm not saying that this is all the these, because most stories of this sort are in some sense in exhaustible, just like great works of art are inexhaustible there. There's more information in them than you can possibly articulate. That's what makes the profound. That's why you go look at them, because otherwise someone could just tell you about paying and that would be the end of that, but that doesn't work. So, so Jonah is being stood up by this whale and of course on your face, if that's an impossibility, because live inside a whale, that's why it's impossible.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       Now, you may remember and likely do that. You all know a story about someone who is inside whale. That's Pinocchio, right? And uh, you know, you go to that movie, maybe even as an adult, you watch that movie and Japan goes down there and the whale and doesn't mean quote this big cavernous inside. You don't really care that that's, there's a bunch of things you don't care about. You don't care that these are drawings and not real people. You don't care about that and you don't care that inside of a whale isn't a cavern and you don't care that Pinocchio's a puppet for that matter. None of that matters to you all. And that's because you're really strange creatures and you don't even notice when you're doing something out. And that's one of those times when you are. But if someone taps you on the shoulder and says, you know, when you're just watching drawings of a puppet operates can really move the condom asleep and now he's at the bottom of the ocean.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       You have no idea why he's going to rescue his father and you're just sitting there and all you're okay with that. And you'll say, shut up because I want to finish watching the movie. And so that's interesting. You see that. Tells you something about your unconscious. If you're a psychoanalytically minded because you're doing something that you cannot account for now, you might say, well, it's enjoyable. Well, that's deep, man. You're really going a long ways with that. The it is a why is it comprehensive? Will be why is it enjoyable? See just exactly what are you doing better and you think that whatever you are doing there is so valuable that you will actually pay to do it. Weird. Very, very weird. And you know when you read about let's say the archaic ritual of tribal people and you ask yourself just what are they up to? You might think, well, they're up to the same thing that you're up to when you go see a movie. So then you might also notice that the most expensive artifacts or among the most expensive artifacts that human beings create our movies, it's been hundreds of millions of dollars on and we consider that a good deal. And you know, it drives our technology too because the high tech movies like the marvel movies that require so much computer animation, they actually drive the demand for high end graphics chips. So our technological, it sounds forward, is actually motivated in part by her desire to represent things fictionally in evermore spectacular manner. So John, well let me tell you the story of Jonah

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       and I'll tell you why I'm going to tell you. This is from Camille Paglia, who's a critic of the modern university and very brilliant woman, I would say, very controversial, credibly rapid speaker. She can think so fast. It's just unbelievable. She's really fun to watch it if you like, that sort of thing. Vicious adversary in an argument. She says, the number one problem in academia today, it's not ignorant students. Professors let's substitute narrow expertise and theoretical sophistication of foster's turned for breadth and depth of learning in the world. History of art and thought our isn't interconnected with work. A fabricated tradition, overconcentration on any one point, isn't distortion. Here's, here's the problem. I wrestled with this one. To understand some of the things that I'm going to teach you about, there's some things that you kind of have to grasp as a whole. You know, sometimes you have a flash of insight and a bunch of things that you didn't know were related. You haven't done that. That's supposed to happen in psychotherapy when you link different disparate patterns of behavior together because you've linked them saying with a single cause and you get this like cited feeling of illumination and possibility

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       and there are forms of communication that require the simultaneous Lee, the simultaneous realization of a multitude of disparate.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       So now I'm gonna move. You can be like that. You know, you listen to a movie, you watch a movie and then you don't know what the hell's going on and then something happens near the end and everything fits together and it's because you started seeing the thing as a whole. And a lot of the things that we. A lot of the ways that we interact with the world that are mysterious are like that there. And this is what Pega is referring to is that. And this is a psychoanalytic proposition. I would say our romantic proposition,

Speaker 2:          00:07:39       wow,

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       no, no idea roughly is that

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       way out in the periphery of reality or all those things that not only do you not know, but you don't even know you don't know, right? Eric completely blind to their existence and then there's unknown things that you have some suspicions about him and there's unknown things that you can start to imagine and act out and dramatize, and so all of that is on the periphery of our knowledge. Lots of psychoanalytic dictum. Where do thoughts come from? They're just getting dreams are the birthplace of thoughts. Fantasy. It's not that surprising. Fantasy is the birthplace of ideas. You know, thinking about what you're gonna do in the future. You enter into a reverie of dream state and you contemplate multiple possibilities and then you start thinking through, use your imagination to search beyond where you are and the collective human attempt to do that is our mysterious humanistic artistic tradition, which is very difficult to justify from a formal articular point of view. What good is dance?

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       What is it that you're doing when you're dancing? You don't care because you like to dance. Why? Well, you don't know. You do spill into you music. Music's a human. Universal cultures used music to organize themselves, right? They use music to catalyze their identities. They use music to unite around. No and more archaic societies. Less differentiate societies, let's say no. A mask to represents part of the family tradition will have a particular design and there'll be a particular song written for it and he'll be a particular dance about the song and the dance or something like the symbolic representation of a mode of being in the world. Like maybe the mask is a wolf mask and so we locked out the wolf and there's music that goes along with that and you think, well, what are you doing when you're acting out the wolf? And part of that is what you're trying.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       We're trying to understand both it. It's an event. It's imitation in part and you know if you live in the natural world and if you have attended, if you're preyed upon, then understanding the things that you're hunting and preying upon is useful and there's also perhaps perhaps useful things to learn from them and so we play this strange symbolic game with the world like children's pretending. That's another way of thinking about it and we do that to act out and to begin to understand things we don't understand like how it asks us. For me, the most important question in life is not what the world is made of and in fact I would say that's a relatively new preoccupation of, of humankind. You know, we didn't really formalize. You could say that the ancient Greeks originated, laid the groundwork for the emergence of an empirical science

Speaker 3:          00:11:04       and then

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       it emerged more formally with Bacon and Descartes Newton 600 years ago. Not very long, like a blink, blink of the eye in human terms

Speaker 3:          00:11:18       for that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       People were engineers. They can build things and so forth, but they didn't know how it. They weren't scientists. They didn't really conceptualize the world as an objective place. We do that automatically because science seats so far into our

Speaker 1:          00:11:37       set of presuppositions that doesn't make us good scientists by the way, but it does make us believe that the fundamental reality of the world is an objective real and I'm not going to dispute that you get early, but leaves one set of questions are answered probably by its nature because it wasn't designed to answer the question than that. The rest of us. How should one conduct oneself in the world and that's an important thing since you're alive and academically, you rather stay alive and while you're alive, you probably don't want to suffer anymore than you have to and no more stupidly than you have to and it might also be good if some of the things that you wanted actually happen and so you're motivated to know how to act and people are always telling each other how to act. We're sending each other information all the time about how to actually do that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       What are the expressions on her face? And of course when we parked the people, we always look at their face and that's because their face tells you what they're up to. No. If they're smiling, paying attention to you, well then you can assume that you're doing something right. And if they're looking annoyed or discussed it, that's a particularly bad one. Then you might think you might take a hit from that, especially if you know three or four people are doing it at the same time. And so we're reflecting, reflecting some ideal for one another constantly. And the more attentive you are, the more likely you are to act in accordance with that ideal. And the more like you like who you are to move towards it, you may not even know what the ideal is in an articulate sentence. In fact, you probably don't. You know, you could come up with a while.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       I get no good person is nice and friendly and cooperative. Yeah, yeah. That's all just cliche. But you don't know your conception might be very hollow. It's very likely that it's very hard even though he may be back in a minute. All right, so anyways, this is a story I'd say historic, it's, it's what would happen, collected a bunch of stories and then you extracted out of the story from and it's sort of a story about destiny and it's couched in a religious language. Um, but that's okay because most of these distilled stories are formed. The foundation of religious texts and religious texts and Agnes and myths and stories are, as I said, part of the outer perimeter of our society. They have a, they have a coherent nature and it's all form a foundation and it's on that foundation that everything that you take for granted risks, even if you don't understand the foundation.

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       So I can give you an example. There's a metaphysical idea that underlies western civilization and that metaphysical idea is that the individual has transcendent worth. That's, that's the idea from which the notion of natural rights is derived. And of course, our legal system is predicated on the idea that you have certain natural rights that are enshrined in the bill of rights, for example, and you're in the states, wouldn't have built the bill of rights was being formulated within the legislation. Original legislation that founded the state is being formulated. The formulator said, we hold these truths to be self evident. What does that mean? They're axioms of faith. They're propositions and there's no proof for them. They're their mode of operation in the world and so the hypothesis is something like, well, if I treat you like there's something about you that has transcendent value, implicit intrinsic value, whatever that might be, there are stories, vocab, and we'll talk about and you do the same to me, and then we set up a body of laws that recognize this, the sovereignty of the individual so that the law itself has to act with respect towards every individual.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       Even if that individual has done something reprehensible, which is very weird. If you think about it, then our society will work better and well, perhaps that's true, but for better or worse, that is what this society is predicated on and that's a very, very, very, very, very, very old idea. It's an idea that people came to with great difficulty because it was over thousands of years that people learn how to take their little tribal groups which are always squabbling with one another. As human beings. They're very violent and tribal groups are by no means civilized. There's no noble savage like the Europeans thought. You studied tribal groups in the world today. The murder, the death rate by violence is unbelievably high, so something that unites a tribe within a tribe, it's often kinships, but then tribes come together to form larger civilizations and they have to determine some sort of method of principle that guides them so that they can cooperate and come together without destroying one another and they have to extract out of principle by which the society might function and that has to work and then as societies get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, they have to bring more and more of these diverse traditions together and extract something from them.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       It has power and functional utility and that allows people to unite. And so this is one of the stories that talks about that. It's a storybook individual responsibility and what happens when it's not heated, so you know, because we could say you are a social creature linked to the core and of your environment is other people and those other people want something from you. You want something from them. So you're going to play games with them. You're either going to be good at it, you're going to bad, but you're going to play games with them and so the game might have rules where you sophisticated and you'd expect that because as behavior more and more approximates an ideal student sets a thing exists, then more and more sophisticated than the nature of the ideal is perhaps more and more complex and physical can understand. You get a hint of that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       We can get a hint of this because you will see if you pay attention to your own soul, your psyche, your unconscious, you will see that there are people that you admire and the people that you have contempt for it and that's, and it doesn't necessarily. Then you're 100 percent accurate in your judgment. You know it's not such a bad idea to criticize here first impressions, but those states exist and so there's a reason you admire someone and there's a reason you have contempt for someone that may be multiple reasons and that's a hit to your intrinsic value structure. It's a hint about your intrinsic value structure. You wouldn't admire someone unless there was something about them that you value and perhaps that you would also like to be able to do and you wouldn't despise someone or have contempt for them if you didn't feel that something they were doing was wrong and that it would be wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       If you get it too, and so you're bringing to bear on the situation and implicit morality, then you have to do that because as I said, you can act without a morality because if you're going to act, you're going to try to make things better that otherwise why bother and if you're acting to make things better than some things have to be better at. Some things have to be worse, and that's a value structure, so you have one. All right, so Jonah gets a call from God and God tells him that there's a city, Nineveh that's falling into moral disarray. Now, what does that mean? Well, it's a universal story. It's like all cultures are always falling into disarray. It's their nature. Just entropy does that, right? Things change. The world changes. The environment changes in the culture doesn't keep up very well, and then of course it has corrupt the elements and so it's an interior eternal story.

Speaker 1:          00:20:35       The individual is always placed in relationship to a culture that somewhat corrupt and then the question is well do about and if the answer is nothing, well then it'll just get more corrupt and if the answer is be corrupt too, then it will just get more corrupt. So the answer has to be to host the corruption because that's the only way it's going to start. Now God threatens to destroy this city because of its corruption and I don't think you need to presume anything particular the metaphysical about that to understand that it's very straightforward that the more corrupt the culture is and the less trust is possible between individuals, the less productive with the culture is going to be because why do anything? If some person is going to come and take it, you know it might even be these different culture is so corrupted. If you aren't good for something and you produce resources, you're actually more likely to get killed because you have something of value. So like there's just, you're just not going anywhere with that. And why would you work if you didn't have any sense that you know you could store up the value of your work for some reasonable time in the future. So if this society is corrupt and there's no trust, it's degenerate. Might live for a while, but he isn't going to last very long. And so that's the idea. Corrupt society. He's collapsed.

Speaker 1:          00:22:08       Stephanie is open. What corruption means anyways, Jonah fake snow, no bloody way. I'm not going to that city. It can go to hell as far as I'm concerned and that's really what he thinks and why in the world should I do anything about it anyways? And these are good objections. It's like, why would you do that? And you'll face this, believe me in your life, you will face this. In fact, you've already do always, constantly, continually in small ways perhaps when you're interacting with people who aren't treating you properly when you're acting, and those might be your parents, they might be your friends, they might be people that can work place, they might be professors,

Speaker 1:          00:22:50       they're playing a crooked game and you don't like and you know it's crooked. And so then the question is, what would you do about, well, if you know your credit, no, it's crooked. It's not so good to play along with it. I mean, let's say that you know it's crooked by your own standard, devalues it. D degrades you to play a long winter, you to stand up and oppose it. Well, no, probably not. You're probably gonna do Jonah did you don't want to ship and get the hell out of there and you know, now it's a logical thing to do, but it doesn't solve the problem. And I think this has something to do with human ethical responsibility because there are other old stories, and I'll tell you one like me were the son of the king, the lion king, the son of the king.

Speaker 1:          00:23:44       He goes and he's pathetic, adolescent, and then he shamed by the reappearance of his old girlfriend and him turning into something vaguely useful and he opens his eyes and he goes back and he fights scar and no, it's a scene of hell, right? Because there's fire everywhere. He fights scar, scar killed. His father, casts him into the pit, roughly speaking, and then the rain comes and then you know the movie returns to its beginning. Fundamental Paradise, Paradise lost, paradise regained. That's the movie, and and that's the story of human beings. You know you're in a place that's working out pretty well. Something happens to knock you off your perch. You're down in chaos for a good amount of time and maybe you never get out, but maybe you learn something down there. Maybe you strengthen your character, then you pop up to a new place and maybe it's better and better.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       You. Now, I'm not being overly optimistic about this. I know perfectly well that people encounter impediments during their life that they find almost impossible to recover from, but it's the best shot you have. So anyways, Jordan runs away, but God is very happy about that because it's actually Joe, his destiny is necessary for Jonah to repair the city so God sends a storm and the waves were high and I think what that means is because the water is often a symbol for the unconscious and that's because things learned down there in the water and then you could pull up that are useful monsters, things that you can pull up, their useful. You can fish for the fishing in your own being for answers, which is what you do when you try to think. You ask yourself the question and maybe you can answer appearance. It's like, where did that come from? You didn't know what the answer was before it appeared, when it just popped into being an nowhere. Who knows? So you finish.

Speaker 1:          00:25:55       So anyways, the waves come and the bolt's going to be knocked over it and that's what happens. I think when know when you know you should do something mean everyone has the experience. I believe perhaps you would be willing to put up your hands if this experience is foreign to. Okay. There's part of you telling you you should do something and it's hard to do it effortful and maybe you're afraid of it, and so you don't do it. You just procrastinate, right? And so how do you feel about that? Good. I mean, so what? You feel that you're betraying yourself, your anxiety actually gets worse, not better, even though you know you can put it off moment for moment, but that doesn't help because every time you put it off, the anxiety just grows a little bit. You're proud of yourself. You have a sense that you're making things more chaotic than they should be known. If you do that long enough, I'm sure many of you have not experienced. If you do that long enough at that becomes habitual, things will get so stormy around you. Then you will fall right into this feed, to the chaos, into the watery chaos, and maybe you'll drown. So it's not a very good idea to run from your destiny. Let's say

Speaker 1:          00:27:12       whatever that might be and you need an estimate. You need it because that's what gives you meaning and you need meaning in your life because life is hard. So you know you need something to boxes yourself against that. So anyways, we make Jonah. Jonah says that's probably my fault because like I'm running away from something I'm supposed to do and you know on gardens very happy about that. So why don't you just throw me over. Overboard. Crew is very happy about that, but the waves are really starting to come up with Joan is pretty insistent that he's the cause of the problem and so maybe draw free draw lots and Jonah is chosen and so they decided to collapse it into the ocean and immediately everything's calm. So he's a center of chaos because he's not doing what he's supposed to do. It's fine. Well then a whale comes up and swallowed the whale for three days.

Speaker 2:          00:28:11       No,

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       that's a weird thing. Well, that's the way all the dependencies in drag, it's that thing that you have to go out there and conquer, get something of value. Now, when you made an error, when you

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       fallen off the path where you deviated from what you know you should do, you produces a state of internal chaos and worried and concerned. You're thrust into the unknown. You're thrust into unknown territory and chaos. You don't know what to do and that's often symbolized by have you encountered with a monster, like a dragging somebody that lives under the water. That's I think the reason for that is as far as I've been able to tell is that human beings, because we'd be prey animals for forever in her battle with carnivorous lizards, for example, and alligators and even dinosaurs because there were dinosaurs around at the time of our most distant ancestors. There was even a cap at one point that was. It was adapted with pierce human skulls, so it had a head that was exactly shaped and grab you here through the back of your skull.

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       So like we've come through some rough times. Man. We have a system in our mind. It's a threat Predator detection system. That's the thing that makes little kids thinking about monsters in the dark, right? Because while there is monsters in the dark, parents always say, well, there's no monsters in the dark. It's like that's not true. Dark is full of monsters. There might not be any in your room right at that moment, but that doesn't mean there aren't monsters in the dark crimes. Take place like criminals don't get up at six in the morning and like, you know, have breakfast and go rob a bank can do that sort of thing at night. People do the things that are fit for the night tonight and lots of predators are nocturnal and you can't see very well in the dark and kids aren't stupid. They've evolved to stay pretty damn close to the fire because of the kids that wandered away from the fire kicked off by hyenas and lions and crocodiles and whatever else the hell it was out there to eat the unwary. So

Speaker 1:          00:30:44       the circuit that we use to defend ourselves against predators. As we've evolved cortically, that circuit has come to represent what we don't know in general because the predators, a person count don't know. And so evolution is a conservative forest and we'll use the circuits that to representing new things. So the unknown, the chaos is often represented by a monster swallows you up and pulls you down. I didn't know when you're feeling terrible, you know what I'm saying? Well, I'm feeling hot. I'm feeling down well, why is that? Well down is worse. I guess you're flat on the ground when you're down or you're in a hole or something like that. You're hiding in a hole. You know it's down and you're threatened by something. If you're threatened by your own inadequacy, that might be part of it. Maybe that's partly what you imagined as a monstrous force because you know your proclivity towards oppressed procrastination and your weakness of character is part and parcel of why you happened to be in the underworld.

Speaker 1:          00:31:53       And that's the underworld of mythological underworld. That's where you go when things fall apart. And if you understand that, if you know that that's what that means, thank you. Have One of the keys that opens up ancient stories to you and you understand things you, your life can be organized going very well. And then something comes up and everything changes. Some axiom that you were living by it. It might be the existence of a partner might be a job that maybe your health, any of those things go on and you go somewhere, you go somewhere. It's a state of being. You're still in the same world, but it's not the same all anymore. Everything about it is different. It's all negative and dark. You don't know what to do. You're confused. And so what do you do down there in the underworld when things are falling apart, especially if hope is it's more possible case scenario and you realize that you actually had something to do with your device that's really annoying.

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       You know when something bad happens to you and then you know you grind yourself into bits trying to figure out what the hell happened, and then you realize that, well you were playing a causal role. Now sometimes you're so depressed. You assume you're playing a causal role and you work. It's not an easy to figure out by any stretch of the imagination and it isn't the one who chose something terrible is at fault for it, but sometimes you find that you are off the path somehow and maybe even that you knew it and didn't attend to it, and that's why all of this kid and so then down there in that chaos, you decide that you're going to do what you're supposed to do instead and then maybe you get to rise up again, renewed. If you're locking and then you can go fix the city and that's what this story's about and that's why I picked the image to represent the course. Because really what happens, you see it with the psychoanalysts,

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       the road due to health. If you're not doing well, which means that as you act in the world, you're not getting what you want. There's something wrong with your match between your presuppositions and your actions, habitual and the way the world is responding to you so it's not turning out for you. And the question is, well, what can you do about that? And one answer might be to examine yourself for presuppositions and action patterns that are not serving you will find out what they are and what to do about. Maybe some of that is maybe you're not moving forward because of fear. That fear is grounded in terrible experiences that you've had in the past that he's never been able to understand and maybe one of the ways of gluing yourself back together and expanding your personality so that you could in fact live properly in the world, is to go back to those terrible events and untied, straightened them out and understand the and drop them, and that's what psychotherapy is about. In large part, psychoanalytic behavioral doesn't matter. What are you afraid of? What are you avoiding? What are you finding to develop maybe from fear, maybe from avoidance, God only knows maybe from discuss.

Speaker 1:          00:35:21       How can you get over it? How can you reclaim those parts of your self? I sent in the first lecture that I was going to try to provide you with Schema into which you can place the theorists that we're going to discuss requires going down deep. To do that, your presuppositions, my presupposition, and this is a psychoanalytic presupposition, it's predicated on a poetic tradition, I would say rancher tuition. I learned most of it for breeding young was Carl Young. The help me understand that we're nested inside a dream. I guess we don't know everything. We have to take things as givens and things that be taken as given to nested inside stories and we accept the stories and then outside of the stories is the absolute, you know, and that's partly. The stories are tricky, you know, if one of the classic stories, Very Jonah's story I would say is

Speaker 1:          00:36:48       St George and the Dragon Story was represented in renaissance and your immediate thousands and thousands of ways. It's like the story of St Patrick who chased the snakes out of Ireland. Same idea. And the typical say George story is hobbit or Harry Potter. So in the second volume of Harry Potter, correct me if I have any of these details. Roger, remember there's that snake, the Bass lisc. So there's this magic castle, right? You guys have no problem with magic castle. No problem. Here's an artist. He was an orphan. He goes to the magic castle to learn how to be more than normal with the models. He has a muggle family, were not too happy with them. I'll go family like as representatives of normal people think they have some blacks now. Of course, the reason for that is that, well, that's what teenagers often feel. Both your parents elt is this.

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       These could really be my parents. I must have some other parents who were like together. Those are like magical parents, right? Parents that live in the sky, and of course Harry Potter has earthly parents. Thoughts. Mongols nervously I think is the kid. He's at one. He's a wonderful piece of work. You know, it will form a spoiled, the old form selfish very far from the ideal. He's a foil for Harry and of course he's appreciated. Doted on and Harry is actually punished for his virtues. That's a classic story. Him To be punished for your virtues. If you look at the story central story in Christianity, the central story in Christianity is about someone who is precisely punished in the worst possible, waiting for the highest possible virtues. That's what it makes it an architect of the story because there isn't anything more unfair than that, and so it's a limit in a sense.

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       It can't be worse than that. Being punished for being, you know, unworthy. It's like, yeah, I will at least make sense, but to be punished because you have your act together and you're a good person. That's real punishment. That's what happens to Harry. So luckily you find out things magical like convenient and off he goes to wizarding school and you know that's actually like taking. That's actually like going and studying the humanities. I mean it was when they still were. No, because it's through the humanities that you, that you made contact with the magic of your culture and that makes you more than merely the child of your parents because you are more than married the child of your parents or the child of nature and you're the child of culture and until you understand what that means, understand that you have two sets of parents, like the divide here always has two sets of parents.

Speaker 1:          00:39:44       You can't construe yourself property as an individual. You're not situated properly in the world, you don't know what your responsibilities are, you can't orient your values property and you will suffer for that because as far as I can tell, because life is so difficult, you have to do something that's truly work while in order to justify it and so on. That's what all these stories tell you. That's story of Jonah is telling you. It's like you have an ethical duty to straighten things up and if you don't do it, you're going to be soaring and that story's apple everywhere. Well now, St George. Well, let's go to Harry Potter. We're talking about. So he goes off the magic castle and he's learning to be a wizard and he's kind of an interesting character because he's not really good and we find out what I think that's because because they have a piece of all the marketing.

Speaker 1:          00:40:49       Isn't that what happens? Yeah, and that's what that means is that to be good, truly good, you kind of just follow the rules. That's, that's very clear in the merit order store and you also have to be able to understand malevolence and in order to understand malevolence so that you can withstand it. You have to understand that part of you. That's because if you don't, you're naive. If you're naive, you're easy pickings and so that's a union idea too and the union idea is that part of personality development is to understand your shadow and the shadow is those things about you you do not want to admit to and you could learn about your shouted by reading history. You can read about Auschwitz, you've been redeveloped the concentration camps in Russia and you can imagine yourself as a garden instead of as a heroic rescue robot, unfortunate victims, which would be very, very unlikely.

Speaker 1:          00:41:55       And once you can imagine yourself as a guard, which is a terrifying thing to do, then you understand something about yourself. And I actually think, and I think this is also from students, got a young but you cannot have proper respect for yourself until you know that you're a monster because he won't act carefully enough. Or you think, well, I'm a nice first night, never do anyone any harm. It's like, you know, safe. You can be sure of that and the harm that you do. People can come in many, many ways and so if you regard yourself as harmless, inoffensive, nice, well where do you have any reason to be fearful? You're like a teddy bear sitting on the shelf. Even if you throw it at someone, no one's going to get hurt, but that was the one that your life, because you're a human being and human beings are some vicious creatures and there's utility and knowing that because it's also the case, you know when the Harry Potter series very could stand up against fool to learn and understand and speak his language because he was effected by him to some degree. Very, very interesting idea. Anyways, in the second hand, the reason I tell you this, and this is where thinking about how long were each of those 500 pages here longing and there was how many of its seven and how many were sold. I mean, how many of you read every Harry Potter book?

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       Right? That's how many of you read at least one. Okay? How many of you saw the movies? It's like you're all in a cult. You are. I'm telling you. Really, that's the truth. It's really the truth. So in the second volume, there's a snake that zipping around there, the bass list, right? And it lives in the underground. That's chaos. That's chaos, and that's because wherever you are, you're on thin ice and underneath your thin ice as chaos. And here we are in this unbelievably civilized environment and everyone's getting along perfectly, but you know the lights, the electricity, sewage system is working. No one's hungry. It's like you can be peaceful, but if any of that fell apart and it could easily fall apart because it's a bloody miracle it ever works at all, then the chaos that's just underneath the surface is going to come up right now.

Speaker 1:          00:44:27       And it's useful to know that because it makes you properly grateful. If you really understand it, it makes you properly grateful for the bloody miracle. It is that you can be here in peace. So anyways, there's this snake that's underneath the surface and it's no joke, it's vague and it's ancient. It's always been there. And what happens if you look at it, it turns you to stone, right? You're paralyzed. Well, that's the, that's the Gorgon, that's Medusa. The woman with the head of snakes. And if you look at her, it paralyzes you. What does that mean? Well, you're walking through the jungle and a snake appears. What do you do? You freeze and no bloody wonder because you're a prey animal and that's what they do when they see things that are going to eat them. And so the snake, well, lots of people still die from a snake bite.

Speaker 3:          00:45:25       And

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       our ancestors were, I don't mean our ancestors like you know, tens of millions of years ago when they were living in trees and were very big, they made a nice snack for a snake. And there's a woman named Lynn Isabelle, who's an anthropologist at Ucla who's correlated the presence of carnivorous snakes with the acuity of primate vision. And what she found was that the more snakes around the pattern of primates could see. So, and we're particularly good at picking up patterns like snake camouflage in the Lord half of our visual quadrant here, when people generally don't like snakes, you can learn to handle them. No snake fear appears to be a native to native disease and it tends to increase as you age rather than decreasing. You can overcome it. Well, my daughter had snakes and one day versus the spinner, it was a fairly big snake

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       and she hasn't paid attention to it for awhile. So it nailed her. And from then on she had had very difficult time grabbing the snake. It was like once shy permanently. She also told me years later she had nightmares about snakes all the time when she had a snake in the room. You know what? I think it was probably the smell. So anyways, so Harry Potter decides he's going to go after the Vassilis Greg, he's going to go out there and face the thing that he's most afraid of. So does that way down in the dance. So it's like Joan up going down into the depths and he faces the task list kind of bikes and you know that's. That's right, because if you go down into the depths, you can get fit. It's no joke. I mean this is a hero story, but the thing about the hero stories, it's actually real. The thing that you're facing is actually dangerous. And even though facing it voluntarily might be your best bet and is likely your best bet, because that's the central story of humanity. That doesn't mean you're going to succeed. It's the thing. So anyways, he gets bitten, right? And he's going to die. Now he's rescuing Jimmy. So that's the St George Story. If you go after a dragon, dragons like to capture virgin, God only knows why. I think it's how it goes.

Speaker 1:          00:47:52       I think it's because one of the things that male humans have done from the beginning of time just chase the damn predators away. And I suspect that the males from God only knows how long ago who were particularly good at that we're rewarded with female attention and why the hell not so. It's deeply rooted inside of us, that idea of facing the unknown and freeing the woman. So the idea there is that if you. It's a male idea in large part I can talk about central female myth and then we'll proceed. Idea is that if you're the sort of person who can stand up against the unknown and the frightening, then you're also likely develop into that sort of person. Then you're also likely to develop into the sort of person that other people will find attractive. So you know, and that's why you don't believe that the inside the shadow was the anima, which is like a female finger.

Speaker 1:          00:48:55       So his idea was something like, you don't. If you look watch movies as long as this data male guy, is there a romantic movie you said he's a nice guy and he's a friend and you know, the woman tells him everything that she has liked him a bit. She likes the guy who's like got an edge and who's capable of, I would say ma'am, but at least of aggression. That doesn't mean she wants him to be aggressive, but it does mean is that she wants him to be able to be aggressive. That would be good, and so he's the romantic target and so he's the person that's incorporate shadow. He's suddenly respectable and perhaps useful and so. Well, that's a very little storage.

Speaker 1:          00:49:50       So let's, let's think about this for a minute. I've already offered you a proposition. I think it's an important proposition. I'm offering you this proposition so that you can make sense of art and literature and mythology and religion and dance and all those strange ritualistic things that human beings do, which seems central to us, including included not least, the ineradicable tendency. I've asked to seek out stories of heroes when I should finish the Harry Potter. Harry Potter goes down there to rescue Virginia, but is that. There's a formal name, Virginia anyways, which is very virgin. So it gets just. Yes, Jeanette. That's it. It gets better and the bite is poisonous and so there is dying. This doesn't seem to be so good. And then what happens? And again, you guys swallowed this. It's no problem. So what's his name? The dumbledore character. He's got a bird, right?

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       So he's the wise old man. He's the ruler of the castle. He's the ruler of the magic castle. He's the magic king. He's like God the father as far as Harry Potter is concerned. And he has a bird. What kind of bird is it? Is a phoenix. Right? And one of the things that's very strange, but phoenix is that, well it's a mortal, but in a strange way, you know, it may have some as I think 100 years and it gets older and older and then one day the burst into flames and turns into an egg and then you get a new phoenix. So that was a symbol of transformation. It's a symbol of transformation. The burden is a spirit or psyche. And so here's what it means in part, you know, you know how when you learn a lesson in your life that that's not very pleasant, right?

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       It's not like when you learn something important, it's the best day of your life. It's often the importance of what you learned is often proportionate to just how wretched it is to learn it. You know, you learn things the hard way. You learn things by getting hit because obviously if you're doing is working, you can get what you want and there's no learning in that and that's happy. It's when you're doing something and you hit an obstacle and Nydia bloody well hit it hard and then you know, you recoil and then down into the depths you go and you have to sort your out. You realize that you're, you know, this particular kind of idiots and that you should probably fix that and that's really annoying and difficult and you know, and maybe you're down in the dumps and anxious for quite a while and then you get it repaired more or less than, you know, you put yourself back together.

Speaker 1:          00:52:45       That's the Phoenix who into flames, Bang a new you. And so you know, that's the ability to learn. Human beings are very strange creatures, right? Because we're very malleable compared to most animals. Like grizzly bear is now in prison bears. A thousand years ago it was like whatever. They are the same thing. They do the same thing, there's no transformation, but human beings we have this massive brain and you know, it's a pain because if he'd have to take care of human children until they're 40 and that's a big burden and so, you know, we pay a big price for it. It also makes child birth very difficult and, and it's costly. You have to eat a lot because we have a big brain, uses a lot of energy and so you know, you pay a price for it, but the advantage is your plastic you can learn.

Speaker 1:          00:53:44       Now learning is a strange thing because you can take a minute of just acquiring more information. You could also think of it and this is more accurate as finding out something that you're doing wrong. So that's sort of built into like a character caring element of your character, presumption of your perception or a deep habit really built into you. So neuro structure, right? It's a lie and you have to kill it because it isn't working properly and the pain that you go through in part when you're suffering because he did something stupid, is something like you're, you're. The neurology can never get this quite right. It's the pain of the depth of that structure and that could be a huge chunk of, you know, if you really have to go through a massive revision, it's like the person that comes out the other end might be the same at all.

Speaker 1:          00:54:42       You know, that happens. For example, if you're trying to combat alcoholism, which is just, you know, ratchet thing to do because well, all your friends are alcoholics in your family drinks too much. The only thing you know how to do when you're socializing is to go to the bar and drink too much. You know, you spend like 20 hours a week on it. It's like, it's not just that you're addicted to the substance. It's like that's how you live. And so if you want to stop being an alcoholic, not only do you have to stop drinking alcohol, but you have to stop seeing all your drunk friends and maybe you've had them for your whole life and you have to have continual battles with your drunk family and then you have to figure out something to do with that 20 hours. It's now like hanging around your neck like an albatross.

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       And so you have to live that whole part of the personality die and a new part has to spring forth. And that's what the Phoenix is. Phoenix is the capacity of the person to transport. And so when Harry gets bit by a snake and the threes is him, he gets seriously injured. The Phoenix comes in Christ, some tears in his wound repair, some May. He's back to life. And the strange thing is, that's okay with all the viewers. Why would that be? There's nothing about if it's rational, nothing. Magic castle that's not rational. Giant snake underneath it. That's a little more rational turning you to stone going down there to face it, being rejuvenated by a phoenix. It's like, yeah, yeah, that's okay. We can watch that little swallow. It will be completely engaged in it. Then the reason for that, because it's a myth, it's about how people. It's a medicine about how to act, how to conduct yourself in the world, face the things that you're afraid of that would otherwise paralyze you to let the depth of what is insufficient vote you will occur, and then to wait for the rebirth. Okay, so science is about what the world is

Speaker 3:          00:57:06       and

Speaker 1:          00:57:10       myth and drama and dream of young parents. All of that. Let's say the aesthetic and artistic and fantastic side that's more about how things should be. It's more about how to act. There are lessons in how to act and they're abstract lessons. People are capable of abstraction, right? So you say, well there's something new and there's something about you and there's something new and it's not about you. And so we'll take all the good things and make one good thing on that and you take all the bad things and make one batch of that. And then we sort of understand the difference between good and bad. And we get better and better and better and better at that over the centuries as we distilled out. And then we have a figure of ultimate good and if they of ultimate evil and that helps us understand what those two things are. Those are the hostile brothers. That's a very common mythological motifs. And you could say, well they're at war inside you. And I think that that's a universal truth. It's an existential truth.

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       The domain of ethics and morality is how are we in the world and what should we be? What's the good? And the reason I'm telling you, oh, this part from the fact that you should know it because this is what you should know if you go through university, is that the bears directly on issues of health. You're trying to accomplish something. Say if you go see a psychotherapist, you know you can see what I'm trying to help you, but you know, that's not really what you're trying to do when you go see your therapist is get your life together. And that's not the same thing. You know, like mostly when I'm acting as a therapist, it's not like I'm directly treating mental disorders, mental disorders aren't. They're just not neat little boxes. It's not like someone has a fully functioning life but they have an anxiety disorder and then you bring them in, you treat the anxiety disorder and he go back to their fully functioning life.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       It's not like that at all. The disorders tangled out into their life. You know, if you're depressed, well usually either workplace isn't going very well and your relationships with the people around you are damaged and you know you're connected in the actual with all of these things and so when you come to see a therapist, you have to work on putting your life together in a sustainable manner and that certainly not just removing the mental illness is very rare now. And then you see someone who's depressed whose life is together and they're are just depressed because something's gone wrong probably biochemically and so with someone like that. Have you been asked to give them an Ssri? I can't give them to you, but I can recommend them. Recommend they go see a doctor anyways and that's sometimes just does the trick because you know their life is actually pretty good.

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       They just can't see it, but that's funny. Rare man. It's usually the case that someone comes and sees you with things that are in a serious state of chaos and all of that has to be addressed in some of it's psychological and a lot of it's just practical. It's embedded in there in the world. That's what the behavioral psychology, behavioral psychology is particularly concerned about. So anyways, psychology, especially the clinical end is predicated on necessarily predicated on the question, how is it that we obtain good, good, and what would that be? One of my clients first come to see me. One of the things I often ask them is, okay, well let's say you look a year ahead. What do you want? What are we aiming at? What would, what would your life isn't the way you want it to be? How would it look if it was the way you wanted it to be these parking that way and we ain't get them right. When we look for impediments, psychological impediments, fears, avoidance strategies, that sort of thing, and we developed strategies and we try to move towards that. I would say ideal. Do you understand the categories?

Speaker 1:          01:01:10       You have to understand something about the nature. Now categorization is a tricky thing and we're gonna run through some complicated ideas relatively quickly. You know, you think you put things in the same category because they're similar, but the problem is is that first of all, that's not an answer. It's just the restatement of the initial proposition and second of all, you can put things in the same category that are by no means identical and you often do that. And third, it's things are things that are similar, are often also importantly different. And so peggy, which element of similarity, you know, like let's say you have a group of books, will, are they the same will obviously no because they're all the same book, but the category of books, it's a pretty strange category because the content that the book differs completely well when you could still make a group of books and you pick some arbitrary element that unites them.

Speaker 1:          01:02:17       And consider that grounds to make a category. There's other categories and more scientific categories in scientific categories. 10 actually contain things that are very, very similar across multiple dimensions. Protons are like that as far as I can tell, there's nothing that distinguishes one proton from another. Same with electrons. And you know, the set of triangles is like that because you can define it precisely, but most of the categories that human beings aren't so neat. And the problem with that is that unless the categories are neat, like scientific categories, it's very difficult to investigate them scientifically. So for example, you might do research on a group of people with anxiety disorders, but the problem with that is that the anxiety disorder category is so heterogeneous that it's almost impossible to identify the commonalities across all the people are in that category. And that's part of the category isn't actually a scientific category. It's a hybrid category. It's a practical category. I can give you an example of that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:36       Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:03:46       No, I can't say it anyways. Many of the DSM categories. So these are categories for second pathology require. If you're part of that category, imagine there's seven symptoms that you could have read symptoms that you could have put you in that category, like social personality, eight symptoms. You still kick, you hit you bite, you know you're abusive. I don't remember the category categories precisely, but you can be in the category. If you have symptoms two through five and you can be in the category. If you have symptoms six through eight, they aren't the same symptoms, but you're in the same category. Do you think? Well, how they. How can that be? Well, that's a family resemblance category. Roughly speaking. Lots of the things that we use our family resemblance category. There's a prototype and then if you have enough of the features of that prototype and the prototype has 10 features and if you haven't six of those features, you get to be in that category, but it means that the categories are actually quite diverse and that's one of the problems that plagues

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       how psychiatry as a science and clinical psychologist and science really big problems because if the categories are homogenous and it's very difficult to draw conclusions about the members of the category and the psychologists and the psychiatrists that those are scientific categories but what they're not and they can't be hard because they're aimed at the classification of health or ideal versus non health are not ideal and partly because they play multiple roles. You category isn't there just to provide neat demarcations for scientific study. The categories there to give people a language to talk about certain symptoms to diagnose because you know when you come in and you have a set of acceptance, you might want to know what they are so that you also know what they aren't. It's really a relief often to find the diagnosis and then of course the diagnosis has certain implications for treatment and for billing and for all of that, so the category has to play all those roles, so there's multiple types of category and the categories that we're talking about in relationship to the apology, art, scientific categories, their categories and vote the world construed as a place to act, so here's the way to think about it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       You're always looking at the world through a framework of reference and you have to do that because there isn't very much if you can't see the whole world at once, and in fact the amount of the world you actually see is so small, you can't believe in the central part of your vision is zipping around, producing a pretty high resolution representation of exactly what you're looking at, but outside of that center, like if I look at you, I can't see her eyes. I can see your glasses, but barely. I can't even tell whether you're male or female. The person passed that. I can't see it all. Now, you don't notice that. No, you don't notice that you're not blind because your central vision is always popping around illuminating that tiny space that you sit down blind. It's just mind boggling, and I'm sure some of you have seen the invisible gorilla video where a gorilla comes into the video and you don't notice, which is somewhat shocking because you would think that you'd notice the gorilla, but what happens is that you actually don't notice something unless it interferes with what you're doing and because what are you going to do?

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       Notice everything. You can't do that. If you've heard of no one say anything. So what you do is you pick something to focus on using something that you value because why else would you focus on it? So that means that you're telling the system determines the direction of your perception. Bloody well, think about that for a minute. That's a Buddhist idea, right? People, people live in a kind of illusion and sometimes that illusion causes suffering and they can transform the way they look at the world and that can release them from their suffering. But the idea that you do live in an illusion, well, I don't know if it's exactly illusion bucket. You certainly do live within a framework of perception that's determined by your values. Now that is so weird because we never think of the world and something that reveals itself through our values, but of course if a course it does because you look at you want you it what you want and once you pay him, the world lays itself out for you.

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       And that's exactly how perception works. That's why this way you're always somewhere that's point day that somewhere in some place in some time and you're always have some notion about what you want to have happen next. You know you're going to go to the next class. Maybe you've got a plan after this. In this class, you have a plan. You're hoping to learn something about presuming you have a goal with regards to a grade and that's nested inside your desire to get a degree and that's nested inside your desire to be educated and have a career and, and, and, and have a successful life. So attending to me at the moment, the reason you're doing that is because all of those values exist within you simultaneously focusing your attention and so you're attending to me and knocked to something else, assuming that all of you with your Computers Open Art, surfing the web, which you might be, but assuming that you're focusing, whatever you're focusing on is directed by what you value.

Speaker 1:          01:09:23       And some of that can be unconscious. In fact, a lot of it is unconscious because you know, it's very difficult for you to get control of what you pay attention to. You know what that's like. You're trying to study kind of a boring paper. Christ, your attention is just like everywhere, you know, maybe you'll vacuum under the bed instead of doing the paper, you know, you can't get a grip on that thing. So your attention has an autonomy and that's another psychoanalytic idea, you know, because you kind of think, well, you're in control. It's like really ever tried telling yourself what to do. Does the, how does that work for you? I'm going to go to the gym three times a week, right? Sure. I'm going to quit eating sugar for a month. It's like how long does that lasts? Fifty minutes. Three chocolate bars. So you're this, this, and this is Freud central insight.

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       I would say you're an autonomous group of spiritual agents, let's say personalities and they don't really get along very well and you ego will say is by no means necessarily in charge and that's a very strange thing to realize, but you can really realize that by noticing how little control you have over your attentional focus. Okay, so you've got on your pointed a, you're going to point b, you're always doing that. We'd have it as structure of value and it changes what the point a to point B is, but the structure itself doesn't change it. When you're looking at the world, what you see is not objects, tools, and they make you happy. Those are things that facilitate your movement forward and you see obstacles and those are things that make you unhappy. Then when you encounter an obstacle, one of the problems is as well, you don't get to where you're going and that's a problem, but the other problem is if you encounter an the frame might be wrong, right?

Speaker 1:          01:11:16       Because you never know. It might be just something that you could easily might be a fatal flaw in your whole plant and so obstacles have this dual nature. They get in your way, but they can also take your planned down and so they can reduce anxiety. So my point is this, there's a book called visual ecological approach to visual perception was great book. Alright Gibson, Jj Gibson, Urd member correctly, and this is, although I thought of this while back, I realized eventually that it wasn't very intelligent. His theory when he believed was that when people looked at the world, you still have value first, project second. So for example, for Gibson, if you're standing by a cliff, you don't see a play off and then think about the fact that you might fall and then feel free to use a falling off place. And part of the seeing of that part of the act of seeing is being afraid of that because your eyes are connected right to your emotional system and part of what your eyes do is count the articles, but your eyes do all sorts of other things like they comparing fractions, it prepare you for gripping, be preparing for emotion.

Speaker 1:          01:12:30       None of that actually requires the existence necessarily the existence of your perception of the object. So people who are blind sight and if you show them so they think they can't see, but if you flash them an angry face, they'll show a skin conductance response. And that's because the visual pathways to the Amygdala, which does face facial emotional processing and still be active. These are people usually have a stroke so your eyes are okay, but they've destroyed the visual cortex. So.

Speaker 1:          01:13:01       So anyways, it's perfectly plausible and at least at one level of analysis, when you look at something, you see it's utility first. So you see a chair and you might say Cheddar is an object, but I wouldn't say that beanbag chair and the stump is a chair and they don't share much in common except that you can sit on it and so you know the chair is the chair is basically conceptualized by its functional utility and when you look at a chair, what you perceive is its function utility and the chair tells you what to do. It says sit on me and so and there are people who have pre frontal damage and they engage in something called utilization behavior. If they're walking down the hallway, a door open, they have to walk through it. It can not do what the object tells them to do. That's called utilization behavior. So that's how the world is laid out. And I would say inside that don't mean you're in a predictable world. You're in the world that you understand that, that you know, and then if you hit an obstacle or if you're outside that domain, you're in the unknown. You're in unknown territory.

Speaker 1:          01:14:07       In the mythological world in the world, for you could conceptualize the world as a stage for an option

Speaker 2:          01:14:17       and

Speaker 1:          01:14:17       this is a shakespearean quote that sort of sums it up quite nicely. All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players, they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts and you might say, well, is that really true? And the answer to that is only depends on what you mean by truth and now really is the answer because there are different ways of defining truth. So,

Speaker 1:          01:14:49       and it isn't self evident that there's only one way of defining true that's appropriate. You know, the truth might be more like a tool and you know, we are a tool using creatures and reading. What we're trying to do with our conceptions of truth is to work through the world successfully. So even science is supporting it shouldn't be subordinate to our use of the world as a tool because if it isn't useful tool, like what are we doing with it? You know, just generating technology that might destroy the world. That seems like a bad idea,

Speaker 2:          01:15:22       so,

Speaker 1:          01:15:25       so I think that the world has to o is actually the fundamental sort of truth and I think that that's a Darwinian idea, right? That to our notions about the world have evolved through a Darwinian process and that it's appropriate for us to regard as what is most real. Those things that reliably ensure are a continuation of our life and the probability of our propagation and if you're a true Darwinian, I don't think there's a way out of that argument and it isn't self evident by any stretch of the imagination that seeing the world as well as objects is the way that our brain works. In fact, I don't think it's the way it works at all and I think that that's why we're so wired for stories, right? It's a mystery. You know, like you won't line up for two hours to go see a lecture, but you'll line up for two hours. Maybe you'll even camp overnight if you're mythological imagination has been seized for God only knows what reason. By Star Wars and you know that's a source of mythologies. It's the mythology of the modern person and it fills a gap and that's why people do it

Speaker 1:          01:16:49       so that to me speaks of men, the manner in which our psyches are constructed and that's a union idea. That's the idea of the archetype essentially, that to be human is to participate in a certain pattern of being and that that pattern of being is acting out socially. It's not individually, but it's also part of your structure. Even your perceptual structure as a as a living organism of your particular type, and it wouldn't be the case at least depart for the hero myth which is go out where no one has gone before. Face the terrors of the unknown, gather something of value and return is the central story pub. It's not the only central story, but it's. It's out there in the top three. Many of the dram and if you engage yourself in are variations of that story. Can you watch it over and over and over because you're trying to learn how to do that. If that's what you need to do to live.

Speaker 3:          01:18:03       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       okay, here's the, here's your Nike.

Speaker 1:          01:18:11       What's common among people? Well, the self conscious, we know of our own existence that we know have our own limitations and so that means that he has a certain innate terror and fragility. Our, our, our existence is a problem to us and in some sense what we're trying to do when we search for meaning is to search for a solution to that problem and that can be security, but it can also be molded. So for example, being engaged in something worthwhile seems to be a good medicine for being fragile, you know, because it's like, well I'm doing this. It seems worthwhile and the fact that there's a price to be paid for it and things can be followed me. The darn good I'm willing to put up with that because what I'm engaged in seems to be appropriate. A sufficient significance to justify all that. We all become self conscious and we're all trying to do something about that. Figure out how we deal with it. So there's a landscape that we inhabit, I would say within which that takes place, the human being self conscious job, too tragic and doomed to be aware of the human being has two elements and that's the element that seeks to go. Then there's the other element that seeks, I would say

Speaker 1:          01:19:29       revenge and destruction and we have our reasons. You don't. If something tragic happens, students tragic and unfair, and it really brings the low probability that you're going to become resentful and want revenge is extraordinarily high and no wonder and you know the archetypal representation is not as evil itself and the archetypal representation of good if you could do is the hero. And so those things in habits, permanent elements of the human psyche and then what else is universal to us? Well, we live in a society. You can say that's deep, that's deep. It's not just human society like we've lived in a society forever so you don't. Lobsters don't have the time and they used their serotonin system at least in part to keep track of their dominance position. And so you can use antidepressants on lobsters when they get defeated. They don't feel so bad for being defeated in a fight, and so you just think about that because any depressants do the same thing to us.

Speaker 1:          01:20:32       We're so bloody social that the circuits that evolved 300 million years ago when the lobsters in us headed shared ancestor are still operating at the base of your brain. Now, my status is so important to people and reputation mean that serotonin system governs your emotional regulation. How people respond to you. Okay, thank you man. That matters. That's why you're on facebook all the time and checking your texts and obsessing continually about your online presence. As soon as soon as you're doing that, you know, contacting people frantically and seeing what the updates are. It's like where are where? How are you held in the esteem of others? Very, very important and that's because it determines your emotional regulation. It's really important. So we exist in a society always and this society as to elements, the tyrannical element of the society that would be the tyrannical king. Roughly speaking a very common.

Speaker 1:          01:21:30       Here's the logical theme. You see that in the lion king to right? If that scar and of course you see it in the real world almost continually and then the benevolent king who is the source of all the good things about culture, you know, and you can see these things play out August mythologies in political terms. So I would say for example, continually harping about the oppressive nature of the Patriarchy is part of a myth. And the myth is that society is oppressive. It's like, well, yeah, obviously you know because you have to be quite a bit like you and you have to be quite a bit like you even if you're not so that you can get along great. Everybody sacrifices a tremendous amount of their individuality to the common, to the common motive being asked. There's a tyrannical element to that, but by the same token, it's the basis of cooperation and the stability of society. And then the final element is perhaps often represented in a masculine manner by the way, society. And I think that's because our primary domicile structures, given the creatures we are like chimpanzees. The primary structures of dominance are masculine and then outside of what's known is the unknown.

Speaker 1:          01:22:55       And we always have to contend with that and it's wonderful in that it's the source of all new things and it's terrible in the place where all the things that destabilize you've come from.

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       And so this is a good representation, although not the only one. So that's the feminine nature, that's the masculine order and that's the individual who's destined to suffer in the grasp of those two things. Finish this next time. Yup. All right, good enough. We'll see you next time.

Speaker 2:          01:23:50       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:23:50       So today to begin with, we're going to finish the last lecture and then with any luck, we're going to start the next one fanatically late anyways. Well you know what? All the lectures for the next call for the whole course, hopefully we'll be thematically linked it to some degree given the knowledge, they're about the same topic, but some are more types of late. So I started telling you last week about this idea of the voyage to the underworld and I want to tell you a little bit more about that young in particular, conceptualize the voyage to the underworld as a journey into the unconscious and the unconscious. For the psychoanalyst is a place of fantasy and dream and implicit presupposition and habit. That's all crap. There is an unconscious and it's perfectly reasonable to conceptualize it that way. That's the big difference, I think, between the psychoanalysts and the later more empirical scientists is that the psychoanalysts sort of envisioned your psyche's as a place of living partial personalities instead of cognitive computational systems that they took into account.

Speaker 4:          01:25:23       The fact that you're alive and the parts of you are alive and you know there's a neuroscientist named Gavin. They don't know how to say his name guys in India. That's wrong. Does that, is that and go? Yeah, I think that's it. Anyways, he did some of the earliest experiments on split brains and so sometimes if you have intractable epilepsy, which I wouldn't recommend by the way, I'm one of the surgical procedures for mediating gets negative effects. There's something called a cut the corpus callosum and it's very large number, a very large structure in the brain that connects the two separate hemispheres. And No, it's not obvious why we have two separate hemispheres, although I'll probably do a little bit about why I think it is, but anyways, they do communicate. And uh, what is that Nigga demonstrated was that you could tell one hemisphere something without the other one knowing that both hemispheres we're conscious and that the consciousness was somewhat independent.

Speaker 4:          01:26:31       Really strange. It's very interesting. It makes very interesting reading, reading, you know, because it suggests that fragments of ourselves, you can think of, you have fragments of yourself within you that are like low resolution representations of, you know, and the, and the psychoanalysts would think of those more as they're kind of like, they're kind of like one giant. That might be a way of thinking about if you were thinking about it in a fantastical way. So there's the angry you and you know, you all come into contact with the angry you. It's a rather rigid. That's the first thing you might say about it. It's impulsive than short term. It doesn't take much about the past unless it's bad things about whoever you're angry at, in which case it makes them a lot. It's not too concerned with longterm future consequences and mostly at wants to be right and you know when angry you disappears and normal view, assuming such a thing exists, reappears.

Speaker 4:          01:27:33       You can be perfectly shocked about how angry you behave and in fact sometimes if angry you really gets out of hand like it might in a battle and the war. It might do things that you just can't imagine that you would do. And under those circumstances you can reveal parts of yourself to yourself that are so foreign and so horrifying that it will leave you with posttraumatic stress disorder because it is the case that many but not all. People who suffer from post traumatic stress disorder especially it's battlefield related, get it because of something they did rather than something they saw or something that happened to them. And that's really we're thinking about. You know, I mean there's a lot of weird potential nested inside people and you know, you don't see it under normal circumstances because the circumstances are normal and part of the reason that we like the circumstances to be normal is precisely so that we don't see those parts of people we don't want to see.

Speaker 4:          01:28:46       And that's really, you were knowing. It's really worth knowing because that's why people are so identified with your culture, why they need a coach. You know, the terror management theorists types. It kind of think of culture as a mechanism that inhibits anxiety. Think about it psychologically, like it's something inside your your hand, let's say, um, and it gives meaning to advanced and stops you from collapsing into chaos and protects you from death anxiety. But that isn't done right. It's sort of right. But that isn't what your culture is. Your culture is a set of value Laden presuppositions that you orient yourself in the world that match the set of Value Laden presuppositions. But everyone in your culture has and acts out. And so what that means is that when you believe something and you're among your own people, you believe something implicitly, the way you look at the world and the way you act things out, you act about everyone expects you to act the bowel, they're happy about it, in fact.

Speaker 4:          01:29:52       So there's a match between what you're doing, what you see and what you're doing and what other people expect. And it's that matched, that regulates your emotions. It's not the belief system, it's the match. And so part of the reason that people are so tied to their cultural identity is because their cultural identity regulates their emotions and in a profound way like this is no joke. You know what I mean? One of the things that stabilizes human nervous systems is that you have a domain of competence. There's many domains of competence. And of course in some of those domains you're completely incompetent, but they met me not matter because you don't go into that domain. So you have some area of specialization which you might think of as your sub tribe. You know your university students. And so some of you are lower status by the rules of the university game and some of you are higher status by the rules of the university gate by the tribe.

Speaker 4:          01:30:51       And so the higher status people tend to be the ones who fit into the academic environment, you know, and, and find it conducive to their mode of being and all who also do well and their serotonin levels rise. And you know, the neurochemicals that moderate mood particularly are serotonergic. It's Serotonin, it's lots of other things. It's an oversimplification, but that'll do for now. As you become dominant in a hierarchy, your serotonin levels rise. And what that means is that happy things make you happier and sad things make you less sad. Tunes your nervous system. So if you're down at the bottom of the hierarchy, you have your failing. It's like, Hey, hardly anything makes you happy and everything makes you nervous. And it's no wonder because it's not very good down there. So the, the societal structure which which is an elaborated dominance hierarchy, regulates your emotions because of the match between your expectations and the behaviors of the people within that structure, and then your position within the hierarchy regulates the rate ratio. Let's say empty intensity between positive and negative emotion, so you mess with people's status at your peril and you disrupt their culture. They don't like that and no wonder because when it's disrupted, they fall into chaos and chaos is just anxiety. Anxiety is bad now, but it's not just anxiety because when you fall into chaos but things fall apart for you.

Speaker 4:          01:32:28       Of course you're uncertain and anxious because you don't know what the hell is going on and you don't know where you are and you don't know what to do. Pants, anxiety provoking and maybe you can't even understand your past property and more of that. As I said, that happens with people could be trained and so you fall into this state where nothing is certain. The way you construe the world isn't certain and even the way the world is no longer certain because you don't know how to act or your actions aren't working, and so the world is presenting itself as something that's chaotic. It's not just psychological. The chaos is a weird intermingling of the chaotic world and the chaotic south and that's what happens when you get unemployed, like devastated, right? It's devastating to people and if you could say, well, that's psychological. It's like, well, yeah, but they're unemployed.

Speaker 4:          01:33:20       That makes the world far more incomprehensible and uncertain. It's not just psychological, it's psychological and that's bad, but it's also real and that's even worse, and then those two things can spiral, which they often do because you know if you don't set your expectations properly for a drug search and assume that you're going to get 49 rejections for every interview, which you really need to know because if you get 49 rejections, it's not because you're useless because the baseline for rejection is 98 percent and that's okay because the base rate for rejection for everything is 98 percent. No matter what you do, but you need to know that so that you don't feel that it's like something wrong with you. And of course you only have to get it right once that India had the job, that it's a lottery, but you have to set yourself up.

Speaker 4:          01:34:10       You have to take, okay, well, I'm going to look for a job. I need to. How many resumes can I tolerate? Sending out a day? You know, it has to be enough so you don't feel like other useless moron and it can't be so many that you're overwhelmed by the burden. So and I help people do this sort of thing all the time. So maybe you decide, well, you're going to send out 10 a day and you're going to work two hours on it and it's going to take six months, and then you know you've got your parameters set properly and you would know what to expect in the world. And your emotions are regulated and so, but the state of being unemployed, it doesn't just produce psychological consequences. So the distinction between the psyche and the world in some sense is quite arbitrary. And the psychoanalyst, I think, err too much on the side of the subject.

Speaker 4:          01:35:03       They came to think that too much of you is inside of you and too little of us outside. When part of the reason I believe that it's because of my clinical experience. I love the psychoanalyst map. They're brilliant, they're brilliant or deep. They grappled with real problems like with the problems when people have real problems and I need profound problems. There really profound moral problems or problems of good and evil really know there are things going on in their family that are so terrible that well the terrible. There are some times fabled lie upon lie upon, lie upon lie for decades and decades and decades.

Speaker 3:          01:35:45       Awful.

Speaker 4:          01:35:53       And that's not exactly inside them.

Speaker 4:          01:35:58       It's out there in the world and lots of the people that I see, very famous critic of psychology, I can't remember his name, but I probably will criticize practice of psychology quite effectively in the believe in the early sixties. The Myth of mental illness by Thomas sat as zed, a s zed. It's classic. You should read it if you're interested in psychology reading like it's. It's a classic and he basically said most people have problems in living. They don't have psychological problems, and so I've experienced, despite my love for the psychoanalysts, very frequently what I'm doing as a therapist is helping people have a life that would work. You know, and you can parameterize that. It's like, what do you need? How about some friends that will kind of like that? How about an intimate relationship with someone that you can trust that maybe has a future?

Speaker 4:          01:36:58       That'd be good. How about a career that puts you in a dominance hierarchy somewhere so at least you've got some possibility of rising, some possibility of stabilizing yourself and their schedule and a routine because no one can live without a routine. You just forget that if you guys don't have a routine, I would recommend you get one going because you cannot be mentally healthy without a routine. You need to pick a time to get up whatever time you want, but pick one and stick to it because otherwise you've disregulate your circadian rhythms and they regulate your mood and eat something. In the morning. I had lots of clients that anxiety disorders are one client who was literally starving. Very smart girl, cheat. There's very little that she liked. She kind of tried to subsist on like half a cup of rice a day. She came to me and said, I have no energy.

Speaker 4:          01:37:51       I come home and all I want to do is watch the same movie over and over. What is that weird? And I thought, well, it depends about rj work, you know, it's weird, but whatever familiar is looking for comfort. So I did an analysis of her diet. It's like three quarters of a cup of rice. It's like you're starving, eat something, you know, you'll feel better. So she modified her diet and they're all or anxiety went away and she had some energy. It's like, yeah, so schedule. That's a good thing man. And your brain will thank you for it. It will stabilize your nervous system with a bit of a plan. That's a good thing. You need a career. You need something productive to do with your time. You need to regulate your use of drugs and alcohol. Most particularly the alcohol because that does eat a lot of people in your family, like the family, you have your parents and all that.

Speaker 4:          01:38:56       It'd be nice if you all got along. You could work on that. That's a good thing to work on. Then you know what? You probably need children at some point and that's life. That's what life is and if you're missing, you know you may have a good reason to not be operating on one of those dimensions. It's not mandatory, but I can tell you that if you're not operating reasonably well on four, I think I mentioned six, if you're not operating reasonably well on at least three of them, there's no way you're going to be psychologically thriving and that's more pragmatic in some sense than psychological. Like human beings have a nature. There's things we need and if we have them well that's good and if we don't have them well then we feel the lack. So behaviorists, behavioral psychologists concentrated a lot more on that sort of thing.

Speaker 4:          01:39:49       No. What's practical strategizing? Make a career plan, figuring out how to negotiate because that's bloody important. Figuring out how to say what you need, figure out how to tell the truth, figuring out how to listen to your partner in particular because if you listen to them, they will actually tell you what they want and sometimes you can give it to them and maybe they'll return the favor and if you practice that for like 15 years, well then maybe you don't constantly giving each other what you want. Well Hooray. That would be good. And then there's two of you. Under most circumstances, it's better to have two brains than one because people think differently because of their temperament mostly. And so the negotiation is where the wisdom arises and it's part of the transformation, the psychological transformation that's attendant on an intimate relationship and one of the fundamental purposes of a long term intimate relationship. Anyways. When that falls apart, chaos ensues and that's why is represented so continually and myths and stories, and I'm going to walk you through a bit of that more today. I talked about the story of Jonah. Now, here's something to think about.

Speaker 4:          01:41:10       The internal representations of language meaning evolve partly from our pre linguistic ancestor's knowledge of social relations like modern monkeys and apes. Our ancestors lived in groups with intricate networks of relationships that were simultaneously competitive and cooperative. The demands of social life created selective pressures for just the kind of complex, abstract, conceptual and computational abilities that are likely to have proceeded. The earliest forms of linguistic communication. Although baboons have concepts and acquire propositional information from other animals, vocalizations, they can articulate this information. They understand dominance, relationships, and matrilineal kinship, but they have the words for them. This suggests that the internal representation of many concept relations, an actual action sequences does not require language and the language did not evolve because it was uniquely suited to represent the thought. Well. You know, you can think without laying well, take the case of someone who's deaf and mute. They have no language. Well, they can operate in society, they learn how to represent other people and they do that with image. Now, the postmodernists who I despised would be a reasonable way of putting it, have this proposition that there's no meaning outside language and it's a powerful argument by the way, but it's seriously wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:42:39       There is a meaning network outside of language and it's what language is grounded in and that's this pre verbal comprehension of the world. It's an embodied comprehension. The world animals have lobsters have it, you know, this particular scientists say far talks about our shared history with higher primates. That probably goes back 20 million years, something like that slip from the common ancestor with chimps about 7 million years ago. Um, but you know, lobsters have dominance hierarchies. They are, they have a nervous system at all, which is partly what you're studying quite extensively. And so they have a social structure and they understand it. Like at one lobster, you're a lobster to be quite a shock to you. If it happened and you were fighting with another lobster and you lost, you would remember that. And the next time you saw that lobster, you'd scuttle off somewhere else and you know that.

Speaker 4:          01:43:42       And all the lobsters and an area. No, who's taught lobster and who isn't. And Pop lobster gets the best bloody place to be. And the best food. So this dominance issue, this cultural issue, the fact that we live in a social environment is far deeper than people usually consider it. It's also worth considering. This is what you might think of from an evolutionary perspective. You know, you think of natural selection as producing evolution, right? Well, random mutation with natural selection. But here's something to think about. And Darwin knew this, but Darwin was really smart and the biologists who followed in his footsteps, even up to now, I've only expanded out a fraction of what he had the same. You know, he was very interested in sexual selection. Now one of the things about human beings that's unique is that human females are picky majors. You're choosing a.

Speaker 4:          01:44:42       they're also sneaky because you cannot tell when they're articulating and with many other female animals, you know, so they have hidden ovulation and their choosing and they tend to choose men who are more successful in the dominance arch. Well, there there is a shock. I mean you have a choice. Why don't you pick someone who's at the bottom of the competence hierarchy, all that's probably not going to work out very well for you and since women bear the burden of reproduction, it's perfectly reasonable for them to search out someone who's going to be helpful, so productive, fair, generous, and you know when you think of a dominance hierarchy, you might think, well it's the powerful guy. The aggressive guy say that rises to the top of the dominance hierarchy. That's not true. It's not even true among chimps. Like you can get a chimp tyrant, but then what happens is other chimps ganging up on him and tear him to pieces and they don't do it nicely.

Speaker 4:          01:45:41       They don't do it nicely. And the chimps that tend to maintain their dominance for long periods of time have a pretty wide network of friends. Roughly speaking with whom they engage in reciprocal interactions like grooming and they actually pay a lot of positive attention to the female chimps who have their own hierarchy by the way and to their offspring. So they're like baby kissing politicians. And so the idea that it's raw power that produces dominance is a, it's just wrong. It's wrong. Now, you know, tyrants pretty damn of unstable business being a tyrant. There's lots of people who want to kill you. Plus, you know, you tend to rule over something approximating Pale. So maybe that's why we're better than being a subject in hell, but it's not much better. So anyway, so this social social now, so what this means, think about this for a minute.

Speaker 4:          01:46:33       So imagine, imagine what I tell you. Bear some resemblance to the truth. I think there's quite a lot of evidence for it from a, from a biological perspective. I mean, this choosy mating thing occurs with lots of species. You know, here's this bird called the bower bird. You've got to look up bower birds, man. Those things are, you just can't even believe they exist. And so when the Mayo Bower Bird, he makes this really complicated nest that's close to the ground. He weaves it. It's really quite nice. You couldn't make one. So. And then he sweeps this the yard in front of the nest and then he runs around the forest or flies because he has a bird finding pretty things. So maybe he'll find a nice collection of red leaves. And so they'd helped take the red leaves one by one and fly back to his front door and make a little square.

Speaker 4:          01:47:24       You know, he's a bird so it's not a great square, but it makes a little patch of red and he takes a look at that and then he goes off and find something blue and had he decorates it, makes a little piece of abstract art in the front of his nest. And a lot of male bowerbirds do this all at the same time. And so then the females come along, they hop on something nearby and they kind of look at it like this, check it out. And if they're happy with it, well then things proceed. But if they're not, they'd fly off to someone else's piece of abstract art and if a mail piece of already rejected by like three females in a row, he gets irritated and brushes it all off with his weight and then he makes another one. It's like, well, they obviously have a sense of a very well developed sense of beauty.

Speaker 4:          01:48:10       It's so cool. You know, and I guess the idea is that who knows what the hell the ID is, the female birds, like artistic mail, something like that. But if you're thinking about it biologically, maybe it's an indication of intelligence, right? It's a marker of intelligence. It's certainly the case that female humans prefer creative men. So wonder horse. We wouldn't be creative if that wasn't the case. So that imagine that there's two primary forces of evolutionary selection operating on us and they're not really the natural world, which is what people always think like the environment, you know, the animals and the trees and nature. But it isn't nature that selected us. It's to other things. Partly it's two things. So one is the dominance hierarchy. The male dominance hierarchy is one of the primary mechanisms of selection, so it's like, oh, women are faced with a hard choice.

Speaker 4:          01:49:08       Which guided laughter, right? That's a hard choice. Well, so they do the same thing that people do with the stock market. They outsourced the cognitive problems, the computational problem to the male dominance hierarchy. Then they just let the mail sort themselves out however they're going to and then the appeal from the top and so what that means is the dominant male dominance hierarchy itself is a selection mechanism because if you fail at it, then you don't leave any offspring and so what that means is at least in part, is that we have adapted to be better and better at attaining status in dominance hierarchies. God only knows how long a period of time and that doesn't mean just power. You know what it might mean? Cognitive flexibility because you could imagine, do you want me to its hierarchy a dominance hierarchy, b dominance, hierarchy seeds. Okay, so if like if you're really successful, you've climb up dominance hierarchy a right, but you'd be in seat. No. If you have the landing, those you just be a failure, so then you could say the ideal human being as someone who can climb to the top of a dominance hierarchy, no matter what the dominance hierarchy is, right? So we've evolved to.

Speaker 4:          01:50:24       We've evolved such that success across the set of possible dominance hierarchies is the target and I think that's why we have general intelligence because general intelligence is a general problem solving mechanism and it's a single factory, but there is intelligence is a single factor. It's not divisible despite what people like Robert Sternberg and Howard Gardner falsely played. So and then from the female perspective, females are the next gate keeper and that's why they're often. Mother Nature took me a long time to figure this out. Why the hell is it nature? Feminine, multiple representations, so very various. It's extraordinarily common mother nature. You don't think a father of Mother Nature. It's like why? Well, nature brings forth new forms, so that's feminine.

Speaker 4:          01:51:25       Nature selects in fact, that's the definition of nature. From a Darwinian perspective. Nature is that which selects women select their nature and that's partly why far more men than you might think, like far more terrified of women because to be rejected as a romantic partner by a woman is to be classified as vaguely acceptable life form. Huh? No value in propagating. All right, so it's a major, major rejection and no, I've had some clients and many, many people write to me whose primary problem is that? They're so careful. Women, they can't even approach them. Very, very, very cool. So alright, I'm going to show you this little triangle thing.

Speaker 3:          01:52:26       Cool.

Speaker 4:          01:53:34       Okay. So your no nonverbal, right? Nonverbal. So what happened? Well, here's mother triangle. I'm guess mother triangle has circle as a child and triangle is maybe a friend, but not one that's very welcome. According to mother and a child circled was trying to play with triangle filed and mother doesn't like that. So she goes out there and pecks the hell out of them, chases them away, pushes child circle back into that hole, goes into the that. And then Charles Circle isn't very happy about that. Running around causing trouble and it manages to escape and then bad child train shows up and they play together and run around and run around and run around and run around with mother chasing them and then they will. Maybe they elope. Who knows, and then mother triangle has it fit and blood was in the house, right?

Speaker 4:          01:54:47       Reasonable. Would you consider that a reasonable story about what happened? Perhaps you had other interpretations, but I suspect they were vaguely along that line, but the point here is the point of this experiment is how much information do you need from which to derive the narrative and the answer is like none. It just. It's just immediate. You can watch some triangles moving around a box and instantly you personalize it and that's because that's what your life and the reason you're like that is because your environment isn't nature. Your environment, these culture, your environment is other people, other people, and that was even more true for chimpanzees and so forth that especially animals that had a limited diet like gorillas, they pretty much all eat leaves. You know what? Chimps spends like 12 hours a day chewing and that's where they have got like this. It's like you can't eat leaves, you know, have you tried, they have no nutrition, so if you're going to eat leads, you have to eat a lot of them and then it takes like three months to digest.

Speaker 4:          01:56:01       And so what we've done, and this is pretty cool because smart is that we've traded gut for brain and that's what we're so spelled and the way we manage that it appears is that we learned how to use fire to cook things and that meant that we had high quality nutrition much higher. It's easier to digest things especially neat. And so because we invented fire, we didn't have to have so much in test items. We could spend a little more time on the brain. So human beings really are fire users. We invented fire or discovered it or mastered it at least a couple of million years for a long time. So that's all pretty cool as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker 4:          01:56:47       So that's partly how we think and that's naturally how you think. You think a certain way. And so we'll say that your fundamental architecture is social cognitive, you tend to view the world as a persona. And the reason for that is that the world in which you emerge as a being was primarily social. What you needed to know was who's the big primate, who's the little primate, who's related to who, you know, among chimps. If a big chimp is threatened by a small chip, well, you know, the big chimp just care this small chip party, but the big chimp will back off if it knows that the little chimp is associated with some really big chimps. And so the little chip can bowling the big chimp because it's part of a dominant family. And that's because the nervous system of the big gym doesn't respond to the little chimp, like a little chimp. It responds to the little chimp, like it's a little chimp with four great monsters attached to it because it's true. So it's nervous system is actually responding to the network around the champion. And so that's exactly what you. Well, it's not exactly what you're like because you're not chips, but you know, it's that kind of platform that constitutes the evolutionary underpinnings of your psyche. So what does that mean? Well, it means this is like perfectly fine to us, right? Can animate things. Rabbits are people. No problem. We'll go along with that.

Speaker 4:          01:58:20       You remember Roger Rabbit, I presume most of you watch that. So this is the detective who's name I don't remember. He asked to go to toontown because there's cartoons and there's people and they share the same world. And you could go into toontown the. It's kind of annoying because cartoon figures, they're kind of annoying, like slapstick types and so he's very happy to be there. And this is what it looks like. Everything's animated, meaning alive. Anima means soul underway. So everything has a personality and you know when you're reading books to kids, his son has a personality, train, has a personality, Jeff has a personality. It doesn't matter what it is, it has a personality and that's because the child is learning to understand the world using the architecture, social, cognitive, architecture and so. And the thing that's really interesting about that, it's just blows me away, know evolution is conservative and so once it's produced something it has to build on it.

Speaker 4:          01:59:17       It's like dos the operating system. It's like really? It's still there. If I remember correctly, under windows 10 you can get rid of the damn thing because it's part part of the structure down and it's like the keyboards we use, which are actually designed to slow typers down because with mechanical type writers, if you type too fast, the keys with jam. So they divided device, the keyboard to slow you down and we still use it, which is stupid, you know, you want the high frequency letters close to your middle fingers. That's what it's like at all. But we can't change it because everyone uses it. So your body plan, that thing has been around a long time, man. If you look at mammals particular, anybody even lizard, there's so much like us in their, in their skeletal structure that is just mind boggling, you know, enroll variants of the same symmetrical four legged.

Speaker 4:          02:00:16       How here structure. And so you have to build a what you have, and if you have a social cognitive architecture, then you have to first understand the world through the social cognitive categories. And what sort of bloody strange about that is it actually seems to work. We actually seem to develop a coherent representation of being. I would say I'm being. That's not the same as nature. It's not the same as the world because when we think of the world we think of the objective world, and I'm not talking about the objective world, I'm talking about the world of human experience. And we see that through social cognitive filter and it makes perfect sense to us and it works. That's so strange. So anyways, everything's got this animated nature and we don't have a problem with that fact. We actually find it quite fun. No people go visit the Disney toontown and participate in it to have fun with it.

Speaker 4:          02:01:14       And so that shows you as well how, how natural it is for us to view things this way. You know, cars have faces, right? Designers know that. They know that people don't want a car with three headlights because like who wants to be associated with the three eyed monster? No one. It's like two eyes. That's something you could be comfortable with. And so cars have faces, BMW's and the new ones, they really look cat like you know, and they have sexy curves. They do, they do. There's been MRI studies of that. So if you show man photographs of attractive women looking directly at them, there's a little part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens that lights up because to have someone look directly at you, especially if they have like a smile. It is interpreted as an invitation to approach and women, they have the same damn problem because with women, because if you go into drugstores saying you look at women's magazines, they're all the same.

Speaker 4:          02:02:14       They've all evolved to the same endpoint. They all have an attractive woman on them, all of them, and they're looking right out. And so when women see that, they actually see it as something to approach. It's an ideal. And now you know, people say that those beauty ideals are oppressive to women. All ideals are oppressive, but the empirical research, some of it down here suggests that interacting with those images helps the performance, the psychological function of helping the woman to equate yourself with the ideal and in most cases that actually produces a pop and elevation in mood and you know, think about it. You're really going to go to the magazine store when you're just looking for something to do and you're going to buy something that makes you feel depressed and the oppressed. It's like, no, you're not going to do that. Magazines that do that to you, they will die because no one will buy them and there's a reason they all turned out the same way. It's like they're just responding to demand.

Speaker 3:          02:03:10       So faces.

Speaker 4:          02:03:16       Oh yes, with regards to the sexy curves, so woman who looks woman's picture looking right at us, man, we'll produce this activation in the primary reward system. Cocaine produces the same response and Sodas, sports cars, especially curvy red sports car. So that's why you often see an attractive woman sitting on a curvy red sports car in an APP because it's, you know, if there's an ad for beer on the side, it's like, hey, everything's perfect. So, and you know, those are all primary reward representations that may produce attraction because part of positive emotion, the Dopa beneath filament, urgently mediated element of positive emotion isn't approach emotion. It's not a satiation satisfaction emotion. It's all good. There's something good here I can move towards. And that that is what happiness is. That's directed what happiness is. It's not attaining something because that just puts you in a whole new problem. You got to figure out what to do next. All right, so I suggested to you

Speaker 4:          02:04:23       that one of the problems that we have, that problem, I would say is not what the world is made out of, but how we should be in the world because we're alive and how we should be. Well, it's fairly straightforward. Not so much pain would be good. That'd be good. Not Too much anxiety. Hey, we're on board for that. I'm little pleasure down then some stability, uh, not dying. That's a big one. That's a big one. And then let's say from a Darwinian perspective, propagate. And so that's what Raymond out. And the reason we did that is you just think about this, it's so amazing. So every single one of your, of the relatives you have in your ancestry, every single one of them successfully produced a child who successively successfully produced a child all the way back to 3 billion years ago. It's bloody unbelievable.

Speaker 4:          02:05:24       Like the probability that you exist. Well, it's 100 percent because there you are, but the probability of predicting that you would exist, you know, if you tried to get predicted, it's like the chance that the chances that you're here so infinite testable, that it's just absolutely mind boggling. Think about that unbroken sequence of success over literally over billions of years. God, it's amazing. And so you have to, obviously you have to think that there's a pretty strong proclivity for that to happen. I mean, some of that, obviously it was a necessity, but not only that, I mean it's necessary that impregnated females have an infant. It isn't necessary that they keep it alive so you can account for that continuity. Mary, from necessity, you have to interject at least a small amount of consideration that the care that's associated, especially with taking care of infants because they're, you know, there are a lot of work that's there to say this.

Speaker 4:          02:06:30       It's actually, I think it's manifested in the personality trait. Agreeableness looks to be like agreeableness is one of the dimensions were admitting women very most substantially. Agreeableness looks to be like the manifestation of the maternal instinct. Now men can be agreeable to because of course male human beings to take care of children. You know, you're a grizzly bear female. You just chase the damn mail away because he'll kill your cups. That's not so helpful, but they're not maternal at all. Quite the contrary. But you know, human manner are pretty damn maternal. They're not as a wait a minute on average, although some women are less maternal than some men because you know the curves overlap. But on balance, how are we in the world? Well, we're aware of our own vulnerability, who are aware of our own shortcomings, let's say, and that's I think that's partly from being a social being because people are always signaling your shortcomings to you to such a degree that you even say go your shortcomings to yourself because while you might as well fix them before someone else points them out, that's guilt and know when Freud called that the Superego, the superego is kind of like the internalized representation of the judgmental father and culture I think is represented as a father figure.

Speaker 4:          02:07:46       God, the father dies say because it's actually. It's actually quite a bit like there isn't all CNI and it's all of these watching you. It's a really, really intelligent way of conceptualizing it because the group which is more or less eternal is watching you all the time, all the time. And it's judging all the time. And we know that if you put people in a room when you put a pig eye on the ball, you know nick, you give them an opportunity to cheat on some little cheesy thing. You know, nothing too important. If they're in the room with the big guy, they're less likely to cheat if they're in the room with no light at all, so you know, and what do you do? You keep an eye on your kids and the reason you do that and so they don't misbehave and we keep an eye on each other and so we have a representation of that and as far as I can tell, we represented as a transcendent figure of judgment and just like. Yeah, Hey, that's a pretty good metaphor. So one of the.

Speaker 4:          02:08:53       This is a major intellectual about the major intellectual and it's raging in universities. It's basically a battle between post modernism and traditional and tradition. I think that's the right way of thinking about it for the postmodernists. Human beings have no nature. We're blank slates and everything that we are as inculturating, so we're completely malleable and all elements of our identity or going on the other side are the traditionalists who are, I would say grounded more in biology on the one hand, but also in historical humanities tradition that suggests that people have in nature. I explained some of that nature. Most people want to have friends as part of your nature, you know, most people want to find love part of your nature and you suffer without it, so you know, he could say those are all social constructs, but you can say you can say anything so you know, and no one ever trust someone who has one explanation for everything.

Speaker 4:          02:10:05       You know, how much intelligence does that take? You got one explanation. You just try to note for every phenomena, this is an alternative. Now, here's what happened in part nature. Back in the late 18, hundreds was very interested in the disillusion of traditional faith and in the West we fell out of our myth. That's a way of thinking about it. You start believing in its fundamental axioms was he stopped believing that there was such a thing as a transcendent deity. For example, if you didn't mesh well with the emerging scientific viewpoint, and so in the late 18 hundreds, Nietzsche announced the depth of God, which sounds fairly presumptuous, but it wasn't something. He was celebrating the full quote and I haven't gotten it exactly right. His thoughts here, we've killed them and we'll never find enough water to wash away the rivers of blood like that.

Speaker 4:          02:11:01       It's a lot different than what you see scrawled on bathroom walls and meet you. Apply that in the 20th century. Millions of people would die in the conflicts over what values we're going to reign as an alternative to that tradition, and he particularly brilliantly pointed to communism. He said that's where it's going to be, and dusty, she did the same thing and so since then there's this been this battle and the battle is kind of like this. The battle is on the one hand between social construction, social constructionist utopians who believed that human nature is infinitely malleable and that with the proper transformation since society, you can bring the part about the perfect state in the perfect human being and and traditionalists and you and I think is the classic example of this who believed that there is a human nature and it's deeply embedded within us and that the culture is we set up, have to manifest themselves in accordance with that nature or they will fail.

Speaker 4:          02:12:13       Oh, young believed in the existence of a narrative, the hero myth, roughly speaking, and he explained his connections to various religious traditions, staggeringly brilliant manner. Camille Paglia, who I would recommend that they picked already told me that you know, she, she's already concluded after going through a radical feminist period early in your life, that the proper way for society to Orient itself is within a mythological structure and that that's part of what the humanities provides and the alternative is rational arguments over what values are going to dominate and it isn't obvious that rationality can solve that problem. I don't think it can. That's humans point. David Hume said, you can't derive an entrepreneur is right. You cannot use science as a guide to behavior. So what do you use?

Speaker 4:          02:13:09       Instinct, instinct, manifested in imagination and the evolution, the evolved structure of your organic cultures, something like that. Do they have a structure? That's the question. Okay, so you ask yourself this question, what is it that every human being shares regardless of place and time, so any universally comprehensive language that would be a Meta narrative, a myth, the hero myth. Let's say a myth about what a human being not only his life but shouldn't be asked to speak to us about those aspects of experience that we all share because otherwise we just kept the damn story. Now we go to how we go to the stories that we understand that all the time like star wars and it really doesn't matter what country, you know, everybody gets it more legs. So obviously there are stories that you can understand and mutually, you know, we understand the law of stories. We understand stories of conflict, we understand the stories of betrayal, we understand stories of anger. And that's because we can feel jealousy. We can feel love, we can feel anger. It's his party. It's right there. We even know where the circuits are, you know, and then you're like other animals, they feel that too. So very similar emotions as far as we can tell.

Speaker 3:          02:14:22       So

Speaker 4:          02:14:26       here's, here's, this is derived in large part from you, but not only, um, here's what we share, natural world social world and the fact of our existence as an individual. And that can be represented different ways. It can be represented as you, the known and the unknown or it can be you culture and nature, all the same representations and the cultural representation tends to be male. That's gone. Father, let's say, and they representation. The Feminine Representation tends to be female. This is the known culture apollonian control that's associated with the sun son consciousness, the cane, the patriarch, the cloud because it pushes up the earth. The Phallus obviously order and authority and the crushing weight of tradition, the wise old man and the tyrant dogma, the day sky, the country down the iron heights, the ancestral spirits, the activity of the death

Speaker 4:          02:15:40       Captain Hook. He's a tyrant and that's why Peter Pan doesn't want to grow up to become him and that's why Peter Pan doesn't grow because he thinks that adults are pirates. Why is captain hook a tyrant as a crocodile? Laid his hand in the crocodile has a clock in its stomach and the reason for that is that the crocodile is time and time's over and he got a piece of Captain Hook and he's not very happy about. He's bitter and resentful and too radical, and when Peter Pan looks out adulthood, that's what he sees and he thinks, why should I sacrifice the potential of childhood for the singularity of tyranny? And so we stay as immature his entire life and he's king of the lost boys. Jesus break. There's a porn star named Jeremy. Can't remember his name. Really good guy. He didn't miss it. Something funny. I was watching a documentary about him and he said the funniest thing.

Speaker 4:          02:16:36       He said, alright, with that hero to people who think people like me are heroes. Hey, what a drag. I mean, he's just in this horrible situation. He doesn't admire the people that admire him, but he gets inspired by them all the time, but it's sort of like Peter Pan. It's like, well, he's kicking the lost boys.
