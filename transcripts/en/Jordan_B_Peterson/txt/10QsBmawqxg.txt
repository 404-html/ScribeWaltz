Speaker 1:          00:00:19       Hey guys, what's up? Welcome to answer them. My name is [inaudible] and I'm an editor for a stout which is the largest Dutch web luck in the world today and once again joined by a man and no longer needs any introduction. Dr Jordan Peterson. How are you doing? Thanks for sitting down with us again. Nice to see you again. Uh, the last time we sat down for a talk in our studio in two weeks. That will be exactly one year ago. And then with us and it was the first time you responded on video to the aftermath of the, of the getting human interview. And we also did a discussion of my distillation into five points of your philosophy for the people at home for the people watching. You can find a link in the description if you want to, if you want to check it out today.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       I again want to do five things and I'm going to run through it. And before we start, we're going to do a year review of 2018 in which I just want to hear how you look back on last year. What you've been through, what, what, what were the defining experiences and then we're going to discuss how in identity politics, a collective narrative substitutes the individual experience, and then we're going to leave the physical world and go metaphysical. We're going to discuss the movie gladiator and why it is so ingrained in my generation psyche more so than any other movie of it, and then we're going to discuss how to become sorry, out to become something approximating the male archetype or we don't to focus especially on the human notion of individuation and delve into that. And five and final point, we're going to discuss the idea, the idea that the artist is a portal between the dream world and the collective unconscious on one hand and consciousness. On the other hand, I wonder if we should reverse the order of the fourth and fifth. So start with art and then individuation. Alright, I can do that. Noted.

Speaker 2:          00:02:11       Yeah, I think that'll make a better flow.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       Alright, we'll do that. Well, without further ado, let's delve into it year review. I've always wanted to do that. I'm sorry, 2018. What were your, what were the defining experiences for you? How do you look back on it? You visited over 100 cities. One on. I can't even name 100 cities, so that's impressive.

Speaker 2:          00:02:36       Well, I did visit a couple of points so but I think it was 115 lectures and so 100 cities. The defining features of it. Well, back in January, that's when my book came out and it was at that point that I started to thoroughly realized that there was enough of a market for what it was that I was talking about to risk experimenting with large scale venues and I, I found that out because of my experience to experience this year before I had done a series of biblical lectures on Genesis and I rented a theater in Toronto more out of curiosity than a good sense, let's say to see if there might be an audience for such a thing. And the theater held about 500 people and I get 50 lectures over the course of a couple of months and every. It's sold out every time so that.

Speaker 2:          00:03:50       Well, that was, you might call that a data point was interesting because it wasn't obvious that a discussion of something as Arcane and archaic and hypothetically outdated as the book of Genesis would draw an audience and the audience was also primarily composed of the people who you would least likely to come and attend to such a thing. And that was mostly men and they held you in like a rockstar. It was like plus when you entered stage yet I. well, I guess it's a strange thing to see actually, that's for sure. Especially in the context of the discussions, you know, so. So then, well then I went to London. I think I've got the itinerary, the timeline correct. I might have mixed up except for a couple of things, but I went to London to talk about the launch of my book because it was published their first and I think it was published on January 23rd, so that's almost a year behind us now as well. And the publishers, they're wanting to arrange a public talk and so they first read it, that 300 seat auditorium theater and it's sold out instantly and so they moved it to a thousand seats, if I remember correctly. And then to a very large venue of the Apollo, I think that was in January. Although as I said, I'm not exactly certain that might have followed my.

Speaker 2:          00:05:25       Yeah, I think that's right. So, so that was extremely interesting as well. And that went very well. And uh, my. After I came back from London, my daughter and I decided to try to do the same thing in La at the orpheum. So we contacted them and of course they were very skeptical and they had every right to be because they didn't know who I was and I wasn't represented by any organization or if you have sold out to, these are all theaters of about 2,500 pasty. So they're fairly large scale. Well, at the same time, around the same time, interestingly enough, I was contacted by an organization in La called CAA creative artists agency. And it's the largest,

Speaker 3:          00:06:20       um,

Speaker 2:          00:06:21       it's the largest agency of its type and I suppose the most prestigious, I was negotiating with another one at the same time or as an alternative, but they contacted me more or less out of the blue it said that they would like to represent me and they were associated with live nation, which does theatrical bookings for performers of all sorts all over the world. And so things just fell into place. Christie, oddly enough, my daughter Mckenna pushed very hard for my, uh, my enrollment with Ca. She thought after multiple conversations with them that they were very competent, which they have turned out to be. And so things just started to roll from there. And we, we hit major cities, the major markets first in the United States. And that went very successfully. And so we extended that to Canada and then into smaller markets. US and 115 lectures, I think about a hundred of them sold out completely. The other ones did well sometimes those, we're in markets that I returned to a few months previously. So. So those are highlights. I mean, the highlight though really is the fact that the lecture series has been so positive, you know, the events are unbelievably causative. They're not political. I wouldn't say they're fundamentally psychological.

Speaker 2:          00:07:55       They concentrate on individual development. I speak about politics from time to time, but more from a psychological perspective, outlining the temperamental reasons why people might lean to the left or to the right and emphasizing the necessity of both perspectives, let's say, and, and the what med necessity of them engaging in continual dialogue in order to keep the ship of state sailing, sailing upright and, and, and oriented towards the proper destination and say, what else? Well, at the same time it was still a tremendous amount of media attention, often negative, sometimes positive.

Speaker 3:          00:08:41       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:08:43       a lot of contentious interviews with journalists. Uh, interestingly enough, the more contentious interviews like the Kathy Newman interview, but more recently an interview I did with Gq tend to attract the most attention on youtube. I'm also the most stressful and difficult of interviews and something that, for the sake of my own psychological stability, should probably be somewhat avoided. Takes me about three days to recover from an interview like that, and then also the overwhelming success of the book, which has now been, we have contracts in place to translate 12 rules for life into 50 languages, which pretty much does all the languages where there's reasonable publication market and um, it's so two and a half million copies and in hardcover trade paperback, primarily hardcover. That also includes ebooks and kindle downloads and that sort of thing. The English language world and maybe another half a million in the countries where translations have appeared.

Speaker 2:          00:09:51       Those so far I would say. So there's a huge market for unpacking old stories. Well, apparently there's a huge market and there's a huge market. More importantly, I would say for a discussion that centers on the relationship between responsibility and meaning, which is also something that I'm working on delineating in my next book, which I'm writing right now. In fact, I was writing it just reading, uh, a central chapter, chapter six, which is called a notice. That opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abandoned. And one of the things I noticed in the lectures is that whenever I talk about the relationship between responsibility and meaning, the lecture hall always goes dead silent and that's very significant, especially because it's happened more than 100 times and I really be watching this. So I read that most specifically that there's a void in our culture, I think produced by nonstop discussion of rights and privileges and that void has to do with the necessity for the counterbalancing discussion, which is a discussion of responsibility.

Speaker 2:          00:11:05       Thing is is the conservative people tend to market responsibility as duty, right? Sort of as should or should not often, should not sometimes should. And that's perfectly reasonable because we have duties and they're necessary because we're social creatures and we have to engage in reciprocal interactions with others, but it still misses the point. A point which has also missed by people on the left who were always, I would say collaborating about rights and who are entering hierarchical in their fundamental orientation. Most of the sustaining meaning that people find in their lives is a consequence of them adopting responsibility. And, and that's, that's something that's very much worth deeply considered to be audience goes Thailand because somehow it's encoded into their psyche than if they adopt responsibility. Something good happens to them. Well they know. Yeah, they definitely know what they ever heard it articulated. If there's two things that people usually tell me when they come up to me, which is another thing that's happened a lot in the last year, like I was just out yesterday, walked down to the gym with my wife, which is about five blocks later. So when I was probably stopped by 15 people or so on the street, you know, 15 minute period of time, no one. And that happens pretty much wherever I go now regardless of the country, which is also extremely interesting and a testament to the insane breach of, let's say youtube and podcasts.

Speaker 2:          00:12:55       People always tell me one of two things, you know, they say that they've been listening to my youtube lectures or watching them or podcasts or reading the book and that that's been useful to them in terms of finding direction and purpose and an affirmation even though that's a word that should be used very cautiously now because it's sort of being mouth to death, a strength, let's say an encouragement. Those was a better words or they tell me that it found words to describe things they always knew to be true but didn't know how to say. This is also extremely useful for people and perhaps the fundamental purpose of intellectual adventure and discourse on the humanities end of the distribution, right? To articulate truth, ancient truths and to bring it up to date and that's very useful for people and see. I kinda Kinda laid out a fairly standard argument in some sense in the lectures.

Speaker 2:          00:13:56       The first a set of propositions and I try to make them inviolable in some sense propositions that no one would disagree with. The first is that life is very difficult and rife with suffering and contaminated by malevolence at every level. There's natural level. That's the proclivity of nature to try to kill you, and there's social malevolence and individual malevolence and um, and that worsens the essential tragedy of life. And so the fundamental truth as religious types have always had this, life is suffering. The consequences of that is that you need to sustaining meaning to, to help you avoid bitterness. And then the question is, well, where is that sustaining meaning to be found? If it can be found at all? And the answer to that seems

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       to be not in rights and privileges, sending pulse of freedom and instantaneous gratification. Not In any of that, but in the adoption of responsibility for the appalling conditions of the world at all of those levels. And then the determination to do something about that. And I do believe that people, as soon as you tell people that they understand it, and it's partly because I, I, I speak to people about who they spontaneously admired because aberration is the instinct for imitation. Let's at the themes in gladiator, by the way. Yes, definitely. Definitely. Yeah. Well, it's one, it's one of the themes of leadership per say. Hypothetically, a leader is someone admirable and someone admirable is someone that you follow to follow, is to imitate, imitate this, to practice a mode of being so that you can undertake that motive being autonomously. Yeah. So if you look at who or what you spontaneously admired, you could get some sense of what constitutes that, which is a value and it's inevitably, I believe inevitably the people who are admired are people who take responsibility and the more responsibility that they take, the more admirable they become. And so I don't see how any of that is, is disputable in some fundamental sense.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       Let's develop this further when we get to glare. I think that's a good. That's a good point. Um, what I wanted to ask you, you were quite recently actually, you are in a breitbart event and turning point USA. And I want to just ask you a straight question about that. Where are you? Are you comfortable there?

Speaker 4:          00:16:43       Well, it wasn't a Friday. It was a turning point USA event and I was interviewed by Breitbart, but

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       I thought it was, I thought it was a dual event. It had both Breitbart and turning point on the, on the posters.

Speaker 4:          00:16:57       Oh look, that could be, that could be. It's not an indictment, but I just felt comfortable there. Well, yes, no, I mean no. Uh, uh, I find American political events, like I tend to view that to some degree from the perspective of an anthropologist. The American political scene is very, very different than the Canadian evangelical element to the American political scene that's completely absent. I'm kind of a circus element and being critical, like there's some real enthusiasm nearby, but you could really see like a Protestant revival isn't that characterizes American political discourse and I've seen that many of the larger scale American political spectacles that peripherally or century involves. That's strange and interesting. But I wouldn't say it's a situation that I feel particularly comfortable in. Um, I don't have any objection to speaking in such events because I think that whether or not I should speak at such a dance is dependent to a large degree on what it is that I'm speaking about and I spoken twice to the turning point people and I've outlined, well a lot of the themes that I just don't run with you and you know, I've encouraged them to act responsibility, which I think is a message that conservatives have that salable to young people in a way that it, it hasn't been for maybe three generations.

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       Yes, I understand. So I'm also, I'm not saying that they're bad people you shooting per se, should not be associated with the thing is mostly that those events are so ideologically hypercharged. Yep. And that's, that's

Speaker 4:          00:18:55       my participation serves as a, as a balance to that, you know, as something that brings it back down to earth because I'm not talking to them as Conservative Party activists, let's say I'm talking to them as individuals, as people, as individuals. So, um, I, I, I also, at both turning point events that I've attended, I attempted to lay out the rationale for the left of center viewpoint and to explain why that also has to be taken into account. It's a strange thing in some sense that they invite me because I'm not a partisan person in any, in any fundamental sense. I've also been working quite extensively with the Democrats in one manner in the US as well, trying to help a group of people who are attempting to pull the central party narrative away from the radical leftists. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       So when it comes to party politics, your main thesis that I always hear from you is that, um, the openness of say the left and the proclivity for order for the ride, I have to keep each other in balance in the dialogue.

Speaker 4:          00:20:13       You want to ensure neither proclivity become so polarized or both so that the dialogue ceases then well then you have something approximating, well if not more than at least conflict or repression or. Right? So yes, you don't have to watch the experience and you have to keep the dialogue going.

Speaker 1:          00:20:37       That can be managed. I think this is a good point to transition to the identity politics chapter of our talk. So what I wanted to discuss is, and well it's narrative substitution and this is kind of. I came up with it myself and don't ever makes any sense but sounds impressive and that's good enough for me. So what I kinda mean by this, Eric Weinstein, last September with Dave Rubin, he inserted that the concept of safe spaces don't serve to protect individuals. They serve to protect narratives that can cannot survive scrutiny from the outside world. So I've tried to develop this, this thought a little further and I came up with the following thought that I wanted to present to you. I'm in identity politics. People's actual individual experience is replaced by the embodiment of a narrative of collective oppression, which doesn't necessarily reflect their actual position in society. So in short, there are not as oppressed as the narrative. They subscribe to big states. You

Speaker 4:          00:21:38       the data on that from the logical literature is quite clear. If you, if you survey minority group members, let's say they almost inevitably state the amount of oppression suffered by their group, far exceeds the oppression they experienced as individuals. Very common finding. Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:22:02       So, so how do we, how do you cope with this very grave disparity between data and narrative and never different body by individuals even though it doesn't reflect their actual position in society?

Speaker 4:          00:22:16       Well, let's, let's go back a couple of steps to your original propositions. Weinstein's conference for example, were that the purpose of safe spaces wasn't to protect individuals, but to protect a narrative that may or scrutiny. I certainly believe that because when. This is something I hope to do in the next year, I've been looking into some of the fundamental propositions of the identity politics and of the political spectrum, the idea of patriarchy, the idea of intersectionality, the idea that what would you call it, performance increments can be accrued as a consequence of diversification of view points along the standard identity politics lines. Those ideas are intellectually week almost beyond comprehension. Yeah. The only, and I looked up, I think it was Kate Millett, my, my memory might be fading. I looked, I looked up the research, let's call it on the idea of white privilege on the idea of the Patriarchy and the idea of intersectionality and I went and tracked down the people who formulated the ideas and started to look seriously at what they have written and discussed and frankly it's me intellectually week and I think the only reason it survived at all is because so it was all formulated in the universities.

Speaker 4:          00:23:51       The idea of white privilege, for example, was formulated that wet else. We had the idea of intersectionality at the law school at Ucla and I think the only reason that these ideas have gained currency is the serious scholars in universities and those were mostly but not all be those who are pursuing a research in the stem disciplines. Because of the fundamental corruption of the humanities and the social sciences have just ignored them. They haven't been subject to January criticism. Hypothetically. They're peer reviewed, but they're peer reviewed by people who've already taken the poison, let's say, or who are possessed by the same set of ideas. As soon as you analyze those ideas, they fall apart. So other disciplines, other academic disciplines have plainly ignored this. Yeah, well, I think it's because they never thought that the ideas were worthy of criticism, which has a real criticism.

Speaker 4:          00:24:49       Your ideas aren't even worthy of criticism. We're going to ignore them, and the problem is is that's actually not worked out very well because, well, the stem types, let's say we're busy peering through the microscopes, the activist pipes were busy corrupting the entire structure of the university and then spreading that, that pathology of appallingly bad ideas out into the broader culture, like the idea of intersectionality. We run a real focus on that. It's like we could just take that apart for a bit. So first of all, to be an intersection, intersection list, if that's a word, means that you have to buy the oppression narrative. You have to buy the narrative. That history isn't a battle ground between the oppressed and the oppressors. That's the first thing. So that's a Marxist presumption derived from, I would say it's an analog of the proletariat. [inaudible] struggled that was outlined as fundamental marks.

Speaker 4:          00:25:47       So it's a very bad, I don't think there's any doubt about that jeff or Bible out and I don't, I think it's an appalling poetry one side or the idea, even though there is oppression and that characterizes all social institutions, um, but that's by no means all the story then you have to buy the idea that the oppression occurs along the canonical lines drawn identity lines drawn by the identity politics type. So that would be essentially, let's say race, ethnicity, sexuality and gender as an article, uh, categories and I don't think the evidence for that is overwhelming as well. And then having accepted those propositions, unquestionably, they, you noticed that oppression is more than one dimensional St. Well, if you're black and female, then your oppression is either the summer or the product of those two minority statuses. Um, I don't find that particularly compelling or original idea.

Speaker 4:          00:26:57       I think it's obvious and it's also self contradictory and it's easy to think that through because as you multiply the number of identically which you could be oppressed, you reduced the number of people in each super ordinate category and my suspicions are that you could figure this out, arithmetically with a bit of work approximately. At least imagine that each person can be placed into 10 idea identity categories switch, which I don't think it's unreasonable. The actually the number of categories is the limit. It's limitless. You ended up with no groups. You end up right back to the individual and so so which is essentially what the West discovered. I would say it's some multiple thousands of years ago. It's really want to take everybody's differences into account which is what the intersection was claim you should be doing and what you end up doing is responding to each person as if you're a unique individual. So and that's just one example of how unbelievably show these ideas are and how, how easily they're subject to what I would say devastating criticism and that does support.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       Yeah. But I do think that what is often overlooked, because they're so dominant in our, the way our perception is shaped what is often overlooked. But actually very few people subscribe to identity politics. I think there was only one study, uh, yeah, at around 8,000 people. And the conclusion was that only eight percent actually subscribed to this narrative and media and education.

Speaker 4:          00:28:47       Well, you can imagine, you can hypothesize that the political, if you consider political affiliation unit dimensional, it's not clear that you could make a normal distribution. The extremes are rare and yeah. Then of course the question is how do you define what constitutes extreme, but it does appear that a reasonable estimate on both the right and the left is something approximating five to eight percent. And in that same study, even the people who were identified as relatively extreme in relationship to their left wing identity politics position of 40 percent of them had also agreed with the idea that political correctness has gone too far.

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       Yeah. So this identity narrative is basically it has consolidated its position in the universities

Speaker 4:          00:29:39       and then media

Speaker 2:          00:29:43       and human resources departments in large corporations as well. And I wouldn't underestimate the danger of that. That's, that's the new fifth. Call them inside the capitalist system itself, welcomed by the capitalists who want to have it both ways, but you have to give the identitarian seven, they're due credit because if their, if their doctor is indeed as intellectually week as it appears to us, they've accomplished quite a lot with it. Yes. Well continuous subsidies for 40 years. House and hurt, you know, what they've managed to do is blur the distinction between education and indoctrination and it's easy to blur that distinction because you would hope that to some degree what people you learn in university can be transposed into action now. And so drawing a distinction between education and indoctrination is very good to call thing. Um, but it still needs to be done. I've recommended to politicians,

Speaker 4:          00:30:45       Canada and the US mostly in Canada so far that they ask universities to generate in Ontario with my home problems. The newly elected conservative government has required the universities and colleges to formulate a statement, a free speech policy statement, and all of the colleges in Ontario have now complied and most of them have adopted some variant of the Chicago University of Chicago statement, which is a real move forward and I've been thinking that an equally useful thing to do would be to ask ologist in universities to formulate policy, dissociating education from indoctrination. And there is precedent for this. That's nonpartisan. So for the Canadian Revenue Agency, which is equivalent to the irs in the US

Speaker 2:          00:31:44       tax agency for bids charities from engaging in political activism. And so that means there's already a set of definitions regarding what constitutes activism. Say rather than charitable work, which

Speaker 4:          00:31:59       something that can be useful. You applied in the education field distinguishing activism from education. Because the problem is is that part of the problem is is that there is a small minority of very disruptive people, in my estimation, who have been subsidized or they're destructive work for about 50 years. And that's given them a power that's far of proportion to their intellectual rigor, to the credibility of their ideas and to their numerical prevalence.

Speaker 2:          00:32:27       Yeah, makes sense. And I think that the way to defeat this is to embody that the male archetype or ear or I know men or women

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       doesn't really matter. So I think we can go through that third point,

Speaker 4:          00:32:45       just make a swot. It's just big aside. Move quickly because I'm sure. Well, so one of the things that's happened in Hungary, for example, the president has cuts funding, if I remember correctly, to women's studies and I know that in Brazil there's no pressure being placed now, I don't know this very well on my part, but there's pressure being placed on lgbt activists trips and so you could say that one way of dealing with the unfortunate and I'm reasonable subsidization of this particular political viewpoint would be to stop funding that at the university or public level. But the problem with that is it opens up the specter of direct government interference with the autonomy be bad. So then we can go to the other topic, which is I think the way that you undermine a bad story, no undermine is right. I think the way that you engage in proper discourse in relationship to set video, logical presuppositions is by formulating and communicating better story or better story with.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       And that's a better transition.

Speaker 4:          00:34:05       Well, hopefully, well, hopefully it's the right way of going about it. He person who tells the best story wins and that that echoes back to Weinstein's caution that the purpose of the safe springs, which are clearly purpose of this space, is clearly not to produce more resilient individuals. Jonathan Heit and his coauthor, it just finished the American mind just published, look, Yanis Ganahl the piano off his name. Um, lay out the evidence that the safe space doctrine actually weakens individuals very clearly than I think any reasonable psychologist or a psychiatrist knows the literature on exposure to anxiety provoking stimuli would have to agree that protecting people from any exposure to things that they're afraid of or contentious like Lidl to weaken them rather than just cranking them. So I think it is to protect the narrative. Um, yeah, and, and, but I think the best way to combat and pathological narrative a better story.

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       Yeah, I agree. And talking about or stories I think I would now like to discuss one of the best stories I've seen in modern cinema and I'm talking about the movie gladiator that came out in 2000 starting Russia crow and Jacqueline Phoenix. You totally, you saw last night? Yeah, I had watched it before so I knew we were going to talk about it. So I was very surprised. I don't know how I avoided it now. And then there's a movie of substantial cultural significance that you just miss and that was what I missed. So yeah. Yeah. Well you made up for it. Um, so gladiator, I think this movie is ingrained in the psyche of my generation more so than any other, like epic, epic movie of it's open source. So there's not a character's, there's, there's Aragorn from Lord of the rings. There's hector from Troy is William Wallace from braveheart or spartacus.

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       There's Leah night is from 300. All these characters are the same archetipal figures, but somehow only maximum ms dot meridius really strict, really sticks through the years. And I have, uh, I've, I've put some thought into this and I have some ideas about why particularly this character in this movie sticks. I wanted to present to you three points that culminate in what I think is the implicit central thesis difference throughout the movie. So I'm going to list now the three points and then the central thesis or number one is that maximum, this is by far the best modern portrayal of the male archetypes. I'm, he's highly capable, but very gentle and these modest in word and body language and these admired and loved solely for his character and skill. So that's the, that's the portrayal of the architect's going to, is that the movie also contains the very best modern portrayal of the embittered villain whose character and skill are simply insufficient and he makes up for it through deceit and cruelness while still knowing every step of the way that eventually build it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       There's nothing you can do about it. And three, the characters themselves are exclusive in their own rights, but in this movie there juxtaposition within a hostile brother framework which makes it, which is a deeply architecture framework, which might be the reason that it's, it sticks so much more than all the other architects figures. And this brings me to the central thesis. And, um, I only figured this out two days ago and I'm very excited to get to share this with you. I think that central complicit thesis throughout the whole movie is as follows, that no matter how powerful someone is, the bane of a man who sold, who has been irreversibly corrupted far out exceeds the pain of a righteous man whose wife and son had been murdered and has been reduced to epic, which is really something to think about. Oh yeah. Right. Okay. So the themes that you've been developing. Okay. So the first thing we might also note that last over, maybe that's the right way of thinking about it. You said

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       Maximus is a paragon of soldierly virtue, right? He's physical combat and a warrior beautiful up. He serves his commander, but also serves the principals. More importantly, principles that govern his commander principals more than the commander himself and you can tell that because he chooses not to serve the new emperor because he doesn't believe that he abides by the proper principles. And Communists of course also killed his own father, which means that he killed the principles by which the state, um, he's like, he's like elder gods in the Mesopotamian creationists who kill app suit, who's their father, and then try to live on this course. It doesn't work out well for them. All that does is breed chaos. And that's exactly what happens in the movie gladiator.

Speaker 2:          00:39:38       Maximus as son is an interesting son, is also an interesting character because he becomes son as a consequence of his virtue rather than as a consequence of his birthright. Carbon has the, has the advantage of birth, but maximus has the advantage of virtue is the virtue of strength. And you know, that makes the movie in some sense also extremely barbaric. There's just endless and killing, which is very strange thing when you're talking about someone who's operating within a fundamentally moral framework. And I guess part of the moral of the story is that it's better to be a soldier than a coward and that's, you know, that's, it's not. I would say that on one hand that self evident and on the other hand that's a mystery because the coward might be able to avoid the mayhem and killing that characterizes the life of the soldier anyways. Maximus does organize himself under the virtues of courage and, and for parents and strength.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       Yeah. So my observation is actually of course, is a very powerful soldier, but my observation is that that is not the reason. Not so much the reason this archetype sticks. Hello? I read this character that he is the absolute embodiment of the characteristics that allow you to content with tragedy and malevolence in an optimal way, not just on the battlefield. It's not really about the battlefield.

Speaker 2:          00:41:15       Right. Well, you see, you see his soldierly capability as a representation of competence itself guided by principles. Yeah. I think that's reasonable. I also think that that's probably how the conduct of the soldier should be judged. It that soldiers are necessary despite the mayhem that warfare produces. We haven't figured out how to dispense with that. So do you think. Sorry. Do you think that Kayden, do you think that the Cain and Abel framework in which it is implicitly a structure it, do you think that adds to do how much a story sticks? Yes, definitely. Why is that? Well, because the story of Cain and Abel does lay out very, very elegantly and and it was incredible compression to fundamentally opposed modes of being both being characterized as able to favorite song. The most being that characterizes Cain and Abel is competent and virtuous and God theory, let's say, but more practically, which means he's allied with the highest of principles.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       That's the right way to think about it psychologically. Whatever the higher the highest of principals might be. There was an attempt. One of the things that you might consider psychologically is that the movement from polytheism to monotheism parallels parallels the integration of the individual psyche and the development of larger and larger scale social organizations. All those things happened at the same time, so you imagine that the larger scale, the organization, the human organization, so the more people included under the umbrella of the same state, the more organized and orderly the principles by which that state have to function must be because of the increasing complexity and also the the problem of having to determine how the state can remain intact over a long period of time without fragment, so the state has to organize itself so that the needs and wants of the bulk of the population are met with sufficient regularity so that the state itself doesn't fragment and that means that the state has to organize itself in what you might regard as a virtuous manner.

Speaker 2:          00:43:53       That can be iterated and at the same time the people who compose the state in its increasing complexity have to ally themselves with that longterm state goal. So it's a. it's a. it's a coalition between psychological integration and sociological complexity and and that's, that is foreshadowed we might say, or accompany by the movement from polytheism, which is the polling of people in all directions by fundamental, motivational and natural forces. Into monotheism, which is the direction of the under the rubric of a single set of principles. So single super ordinate set of principles. Now what those principles are not obvious, which is partly why we're having the discussion of gladiator. So I can give you an example of this. So for example, um, in the Old Testament, you see the articulation of the guiding principles emerge in its most fully formed manner with the commandments of Moses.

Speaker 2:          00:45:04       So you might say all of the diverse sources that might be polled people, hither and yon have being aggregated into a list of thou shalt nots. Here's how to regulate yourself. Here's how to get yourself across time so that you can have a stable, longterm, large scale society. But then there's a mystery that emerges in the New Testament, which is, it emerges, for example, with Christ is asked by the scribes and Pharisees, which is the greatest of the commandments. And Christ actually performs a very intelligent sleight of hand. And he says, well, you have to love God with all your heart and all your soul. And you have to love your brother as if he's yourself. Love your neighbor as yourself on, on those propositions, all the commandments and the law. There's an attempt to integrate even the commandments into something that's a higher order principle and that principle actually manifests itself in Judeo Christian society as the logos, whatever that is, and it's something like truthful communication devoted towards the highest good and the embodiment of that becomes the fundamental principle. And in gladiator you see movement towards that and embodiment, right? Because maximus is an organized and disciplined person who's governed by principles. The question is, and the question is posed throughout the movie, well, what his role right now asked for, asked by Marcus Aurelius because he failed log. What he's done is a failure. It's asked by communists and it's asked by the sister whose, whose name escapes me at the moment.

Speaker 2:          00:46:46       It's what? I think it's loosened. Okay? Okay. Okay. Um, and they all asked for what his role, but she comes the closest. She says it's a great idea, but it's not. It's an animating principle. And the question is, what is the animating principle? Now, whatever it is, maximus embodies that far more than common does. And maximus is a able figure l whereas comedy or comedic is clearly a failure of, of cane, makes it proper sacrifices and they're never well regarded. He says constantly, you know, that he, all he ever did was try to please his father. Well, his sacrifices went on, appreciate it. And that's what made him bitter and resentful and murderous and catastrophic death and evil and to tyrant and all that stuff. So yes, fundamentally archetypical structure. So who do you. This is like a compressed version of the thesis. Who Do you think in this story? Is it common as well? It's the same question that the social, it's posted in the Gulag archipelago to some degree. It's like, do, do you want to lose your. What's worse to put your life at risk, let's say, or to put everything you love at risk or they lose your conscience.

Speaker 2:          00:48:13       And Solzhenitsyn's conclusion was that there's no suffering greater than that which accompanies last exhale. There's something very, very profound about that because one of the things I've just been reading about this, interestingly enough, that was the prophet Elijah who, who first seems to have.

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       It's in the story of the profitable, profitable Asia as far as I can tell, where there's the first intimation that God might speak to human beings, not as the external force of natural power, storms, fire, wind, winter earthquakes, all the, all the overwhelming natural forces that human beings were subject to or maybe even not as internal forces that would more characterize some of the other polytheistic gods like lost or rage or or terror, but as the voice of conscience itself, which which is which is described in one kings which is this contains the story of Elijah asked the still small voice. That's the first time that that frees. It merges and so it's the idea that there's something that there's a psychological factor conscious itself that calls to you, that that has a dialogue with you. Even more importantly because it's conscious, doesn't tell you what to do.

Speaker 2:          00:49:47       It hints at what you shouldn't do and it isn't a deterministic force. It's not like when your conscious scripts you, you're forced to act in a manner that's in accordance with your conscience. You can choose to violate it, and so there's this idea that God transforms himself or becomes known as the voice of conscience and the facts, the late between human beings and divinity itself. I actually think this is a highly credible hypothesis. Let's say that what you need and powerful sustaining meaning to keep you from the bitterness of cane and that's to be found in the relationship with something of divine significance. Well, maybe that's mediated through your conscience and this relationship is absent within Kane. He severed his relationship with consciousness and consciousness, but with conscience, conscience of conscious. Yeah. Well, that's right, because conscience, his management conscience is the manifestation of the instate for good and evil.

Speaker 2:          00:50:58       Yeah. Nope. So we can take the argument that a little bit about what makes people bitter is that they feel that there is wrong in the world. It might be a large scale. Society is unfair. The natural world is a catastrophe. Human beings are intrinsically malevolent that the structure of being itself is wrong in some moral sense. Okay, but that's interesting because they wouldn't be bothered by that if they didn't have some sense of morality itself. Well, that what that means is that conscious, even the conscious that's driving them towards their cynicism is the dawning of the realization of a moral dimension to life. Now, conscience doesn't seem to manifest itself as an alien force that cannot be denied. It's more something that beckons and Harkins and also something that you need to enter into a negotiation with. Interestingly enough, in the Old Testament, even before the transformation of God, let's say into the voice of conscience, you have continual intimations that whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       Yeah, wait, is is something that can be negotiated with. So for example, Abraham negotiates with Yahuah when he tries to save the inhabitants of Sodom from being decimated by God's wrath, he bargains. He says, well, if I could find 50 good men, will you spare the city? And God says, yes. It's one of, if I can find 20, if I could find 10, if I can find a single good map. And God, strangely enough, despite his own audience, agrees this bargain, and so god, even in the Old Testament, the Old Testament, God's often pilloried as a very intransigent and tyrannical va, but it's clear even in the earlier stories that he could be negotiated with, oddly enough. Then you see the same thing with Jacob who eventually becomes Israel, right? And Israel means he who wrestles with God, which is very, very interesting idea, right?

Speaker 2:          00:53:04       Is that if God can be assimilated to conscience, then what that means is that the true followers of God are those who wrestled with their conscience and Jacob, before he's transformed into Israel. Jacob's a trickster figure, right? He's a. he's a maneuver. He's a salesman. He's a. he's someone who's not above using trickery to gain is an because he cheats his brother, for example, out of his birthright, and that is subject to the same treatment at the hands of his uncle, but in any case, he's not classically moral person, but he wrestles with the angel on the banks of the river when he returns to see the product that he's betrayed and he wrestled all night with an angel who also turns out to be God who puts his hip joint. It's a very contentious battle and he actually defeats the angel who is gone and requires him to bless it in the morning, and the blessing is that Jacob will now be called Israel, and that's he who wrestles successfully with believably interesting sequence of ideas because it all.

Speaker 2:          00:54:09       It also speaks, I think, to something approximating human destiny. It's like, well, what's the purpose of man with God in God's absence? What will say, forget God's absence for a moment, but assuming God, what's the purpose of man given the garden to the president and, and, and I'm omnipotent. What's the purpose of man? And it looks like the the fundamental idea that's emerging as monotheism emergency in the West is that go on and enter into a partnership to cocreate the world. It's something like that and that, that you do that under the guidance of your conscious.

Speaker 1:          00:54:53       So the destiny of men would be to transcend in dialog with God symbolically speaking,

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       yes, and to overcome suffering to the degree that that can be managed and to overcome malevolence to the degree that that can be managed at the dialogue with God. That's. That's the idea that emerges. That's the great monotheistic idea and the thing that it sort of a continuation, but stay up the argument I was making out with you before about responsibility in meaning. It's like, well, let's. Let's assume that you find meaning and responsibility and that you need a meeting that will sustain you through suffering and malevolence. It's like, well, where's that? Well, let's say it's to be found in hearkening to the clarion call of conscience. It cody's like, I can't see how that's wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       Maybe if you can also reverse engineer it, that if you take communists as a test case, that when you sever the relationship between the individual, the individual and conscious, then suffering is maximized.

Speaker 2:          00:55:55       Well, look, he's. He suffers terribly isolated from everyone, but the the thing he suffers most from is the fact that is alienated from his father. Right. And that, that, that torments him terribly. And that's actually why he hates maximus so much. Retail against the team enabled stories because Maximus, for all of the terrible things that's happened to him, he's never severed from the father. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       and that's the thing come you just cannot tolerate. And I do think that this suffering exceeds that of maximus. Yeah, perfect. Because it's so pointless to me. It's such a striking and interesting idea then that then to be corrupt, until it's more suffering than to be the victim of corruption. If you're righteous, you're righteous victim. It feels so profound and not, not not that intuitively true because maximum he loses everything. His wife and son are murdered. He didn't slip, so it's not as common as emperor. Yeah, so it's not at face value. Obvious then maximus suffers less than comedy is, right. I agree with it, but it seems, but it seems to be the thesis running throughout the theme was perhaps the only reason that Maxima suffers less to some degree is that the fact that he's maintained, his virtue makes this suffering bearable, and you see that as well.

Speaker 4:          00:57:31       When he has the argument with the man who comes to own him, the former of gladiator decides to do the honorable thing and to smuggle maximum sort of the of the prison. He also decides to to take the path of virtue. That in some sense gives a transcendent meaning to his life. Yet every deems him because he wasn't. He was also. He was also a miserable. Right, right, and so, but the redemption that interesting there too. The redemption comes at the cost of his own death and there's a very interesting architectural theme there as well because it is seeing what happens is monotheism develops in the West as a carbonates, at least along the Christian mind, is thinking in the figure of Christ, is that the principle that becomes the highest ideal is

Speaker 2:          00:58:30       the.

Speaker 4:          00:58:31       It's the mode of being that takes suffering voluntarily onto itself as it's full responsibility, right? That's the acceptance of the crucifixion, the betrayal that goes along with it. So yeah, you know, Christ spaces statement in the desert, so that's the confrontation with malevolence and accepts the necessity of its own bodily death, so that's natural. That's the. That's the terrible power of nature manifested in death and the terrible power of society manifested in the ability to punch, so any faces, all of those things voluntarily,

Speaker 2:          00:59:03       and the the, the, the

Speaker 4:          00:59:08       psychological process that enables that in some sense of the transcendence is the death and rebirth, rebirth, and to be redeemed means allow yourself to die when necessary. See what happens with the, with the, with the gladiator, the head gladiators. He allows himself to die necessary. Now he dies a physical death, but there's, but there's metaphysical deaths that can be undertaken continually. It's a spiritual death. It's like if you encounter, if you find yourself entangled in corruption and you need to set yourself right as a consequence, what that means is that you have to sacrifice some of yourself to the erroneous part of yourself and so the idea is that you can. You can die and be reborn in a spiritual sense. That's what baptism is, for example, and that that's what leads you is the identification with that part of you that will die and be reborn in the furtherance in pursuit of a higher order. Principles are then. That's what the Holy Ghost. I think that's the idea of the holy ghost fleets as like a gel or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:00:32       Let me just see what. What would be the best transition because we do more complex, which we're talking about. Art is the next thing and you wanted to refer us to the last two. So we still have individualization, individuation. Let's start with art, but look, look, I mean I was looking, for example, at a painting last night which was Rafales transfiguration of Christ, and it's this, so the transfiguration occurs when Christ goes up on the mountain with his disciples, I think it's Peter, James and John, and on the mountain he meets Moses, so bearer of the mosaic law, and he meets a lot of show and Elijah is a prophet who encounters the still small voice and he's transfigured, his face shines. His clothing is, is, is, is lightened to an unbearable, some like whiteness and it's. It's too much for the disciples to tolerate to see all this and so, so that's his transfiguration.

Speaker 4:          01:01:38       Then when he comes down from the mountaintop, this is all portrayed in this painting for she seemed the transfiguration at the top. You see the second part of the story at the bottom, he comes down and he cast that demon out of a young man and I thought, well, that's unbelievably apropos because you know, while you're smiling, you can see why it's apropos. At least to some degree. It's like I think that we all have the proclivity to be possessed to to a greater or lesser degree by the modern day equivalent of of demons and that's ideological possession or possession by cynicism, possession by that cynicism characterized in possession by nihilism or these totalitarian ideologies and the question is, well, how are those cast out? And the answer is, and this is portrayed in the painting, it's portrayed in the story, but strange story of Christ's transfiguration and its association with Moses and Elijah, unbelievably complex narrative structures, right? Pointing at something that was not fully articulated like that's intuited by the storytellers and the artist step, the willingness to die and be reborn in the service of the highest principle is the process by which possession is eradicated.

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       That's an idea that idea so overwhelmingly complicated and sophisticated than it has to be dreamed up and it has to be represented artistically before it can be comprehended. The painting by Rafaelle, the one I'm describing that was regarded as the greatest oil painting in the world for 300 years. It's a non trivial piece of art like I think it was painted. Let me just, let me just check this because I might as well get the date right. It was a renaissance painting. Rafaelle.

Speaker 4:          01:03:50       Okay, so from 15, 20 to 18, 20, that was regarded as the greatest oil painting in the world. That's three centuries. That's. You got it. You got to think about something like that happens, like what's being represented there? Well, I think it's what's being represented is something akin to what I've just been discussing and that's a good example of how the artists to storytellers and at the end the image makers are lay the pathway for articulated representations. You see the same thing happening in cardiac, right? Because it's a story but. But there's a moral to the story and there's a pointer towards an articulated set of principles potentially articulated set of principles. So the idea you just laid out, you think that it had to be. It had to manifest itself in a dream restory version before it could be articulated like in an operational way.

Speaker 4:          01:04:50       Yeah. Because of the ideas have to look. The way I look at it this, this waves, first of all, to some degree these ideas are encoded in behavior. So for example, in Exodus, Moses received the law, but remember before he received the law, he's wandering around in the desert for a long time, so it's in chaos with with a group of extraordinary these who are constantly fighting amongst themselves and who are constantly tempted to worship other idols. So in in a chaotic state. Then the temptation of principles, we really manifest itself. What principle should be guiding us and that's portrayed in the exit was story as the proclivity to chase after false. Now the Israelites actually come to Moses for a very long period of time in pairs or families to adjudicate disputes, and so he does that to the point of exhaustion. This is prior to receiving the 10 commandments, and so what's what happens with the 10 commandments.

Speaker 4:          01:05:57       As Moses comes to realize to revelation, he comes to realize it and articulated manner to principles that the Israelites are already, to some degree implicitly guided by that actually produce peace and harmony behavioral patterns that no one knows what they are because they're not conscious enough that they have mapped themselves enough. So the mosaic revelation is part of that process of mapping and the mapping itself is represented in the story of Moses and within the story of Moses is actually contained the articulated virtue, the commandments, let's say, but that's only part of the process of the unfolding of the virtue. It still doesn't answer the question, which is the question. It's eventually posted to Christ. It's like, well, that's all well and good, but what's the highest virtue? Well, that's, that's any insanely complicated question because it's no different than, well, how should you conduct your life?

Speaker 4:          01:06:57       Right? It's, it's the hardest questions, and so we've had to gather as a collective. We've had to gather information about, well, what is it? What does it look like when someone, when a particular person lives in undesirable life? We tell the story of someone who lives in undesirable life or maybe he tells his own story and then we aggregate a hundred stories of undesirable life and then we abstract out from those stories what constitutes undesirable and so that's like a picture of cane, right? It's a portrait of cane. We do the same thing on the other side. We we listen to people who who've lived triumphantly and we aggregate their stories and we set the size of you say, well then we we, we extract from that a portrait of able and that's a precursor like the successful and the unsuccessful are precursors to Abel and Cain and Abel and Cain are precursors to the divine, the divine finger, so the divine figures of Christ that Satan, right?

Speaker 4:          01:08:00       It's, it's an abstract process of continual abstraction and that's all done through at least to begin with through ritual and narrative and art is so complicated. It can't be done then the other way, so first it's acted out and an entrusted domain of ritual art and narratives. Then it becomes operational like an traditional loop, right? Because once, well, once you get the image of the ritual, then those modes of communication start to alter behavior, you know, so it's like, well, that's why we're having this discussion. We're talking about, we're talking about a movie that's an artistic representation and we're discussing it to articulate principles and we're also articulating those principles so that in principle our behavior can be altered. And I never thought about the loop. Oh yeah. See these things, these things feed back, right? So the, it's, it's the collective behavior. It's that negotiation at the collective level, fractious centuries long linear, long negotiation that produces something like that. Synthesis synthesis is represented in, in drama and mythology and ritual and art. Then next articulate. But those notes. And so the whole process starts to spiral up, spiral upward editing, increasingly rapid rate. So look, when I was always wondering that if this archetypal patterns that lead to the most favorable life are already known for such a long time, why does any, every generation seems to have to invent them. And you know, there's, there's no to known like one of the things but plato, socrates insisted on was that learning was remembering.

Speaker 4:          01:09:52       Okay, so let's say that when you're born you, you have a proclivity to manifest the number of patterns and you certainly do. You can manifest the patterns of rage and fear and hunger and thirst and like, but, but then also imagined, okay, so it's something like this, as this looping process occurred,

Speaker 4:          01:10:20       the people who are more likely to manifest the pattern that is being pointed to are more practically likely to live and to successfully propagate. So there's an evolutionary elephant that the society values something and the degree to which you manifest that value is proportionate to your success and your success is proportionate to your reproductive fitness. Then as that overtime the proclivity for that sort of ethical behavior will become coded in some sense in your genetic structure selected for, for that. So then you might say, well that exists. This is Mrs. What the archetype is. In some sense it exists as the possibility of being gripped by a particular kind division. Now there might be enough diversity in the ideal so that you can't emerge from the womb fully Christian if you don't know what I mean, but that doesn't mean that there won't be something that can suit you as a consequence of observing the manifestation of a kind of ideal and it doesn't to you because otherwise you wouldn't be gripped by the damn stories.

Speaker 4:          01:11:48       But here's the rub to it. Can't be hard coded. Exactly. So here's, here's something interesting about Christianity. It was actually posed as an interesting question in and the musical Jesus Christ superstar near the end, um, the, the, the, the actor who played Judas asked Christ after he's dead, that sort of a, there's a scene where everyone's singing and dancing. It's a strange sort of disco scene. And Judas asks why Christ had to come to Earth at such a strange time and in such an isolated place because he appears as a carpenter in a region, you know, 2000 years ago. Why then, why is there? And that answer is the divine principle has to manifest itself constantly within the confines of an individual life. With all of the peculiar idiosyncrasies and limitation for that individual life, and so part of the reason that the ideal beckons is because you can't just be born as Christ because Christ represents, let's say, this overarching idea.

Speaker 4:          01:13:08       It's actually been union of the divine with the particulars of your time and place and so because your particular eyes. Then you have to determine how to manifest the archetype in your conditions and your specific conditions that's partly associated with that dialogue with your conscious, so there's an architecture mode of being supposedly, ideally we'd have to integrate in with your surroundings and what needs to be met. That's right. It has to be manifest in the particulars of your time and place. That's the individuation process. That's exactly what it is because you regard the self. You'll regard to Christ as a symbol of the self. He actually reversed the spiritual and the psychological and sociological and psychological, and he thought he was thinking about the cosmic Christ as for Yoga, selfless, the totality of individual, but it was everything that you were right

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       now, everything that you were in the past, but also everything that you could possibly become a cross your set of potential futures.

Speaker 1:          01:14:23       Here's there's one paragraph from young then I'm going to send to you in the chat right now and I would like to ask you if you could, could read it out. It's not that long because I think that illustrates exactly what what you're talking about. I'm sending you a link. If you click on it, it's an image.

Speaker 2:          01:14:48       What is summit is for each when the bug unfolds and from the lesser to greater emergence. As Nietzsche says, one becomes two and a greater faker, which always was but which remained invisible appears to the lesser personality with the force of revelation. Yes, and that's the manifestation of the self. That's right. What that is is an intimation of who you could be and it's also an intimation of what you're associated with. That might guide you to what you could be, so you might say it's a revelation of your old core stability, but it's your rev revelation of your possibility in relationship to something that's infinite transcendent. Yeah. That's the one I would also say that that does. That is also very commonly manifested by a transformation in the relationship with conscious because when something like this happens, sometimes this happens to people, for example, in a hallucinatory or psychedelic experiences, right? They start to take their conscience seriously as the CEO believed, at least to some degree that what guided your interest and that would include your conscious was a manifestation of the totality of the self in the restricted domain of the present. Okay, so that's. Okay, so. So okay. Which one always was, but which remained invisible, right? That's the heavenly father. That would be. The markets are really as principal, that manifested itself in, in, in Maximus that resists and which markets really has also made himself subordinate to at least to some degree, right? That's the one which always was, but which remained invisible. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:16:47       He was truly an hopelessly little will always drank. The revelation of the greater down to the level of this littleness and will never understand that the day of judgment for his littleness has dawn, the man who is inwardly great. We'll know that the long expected friend of his soul, the immortal one has now really come to lead captivity captive. That is to seize hold of him by who was a mortal, had always been confined and held prisoner and to make his life flow into that greater life. A moment of deadliest peril.

Speaker 2:          01:17:27       Just prophetic vision of the tightrope Walker reveals the awful danger that lies in having a tight rope, walking attitude towards an event to which St Paul gave the most exalted name he could find. Yeah, that's quite a. that's quite the densely pack. That one it's from. It's from the archetypes and the collective unconscious page 1:21 if that's volume one, right? Because volume two is ion, which is even more frightening books, so yes, because in apparel talks about there is the parallel psychosis at least in part inflation because the manifestation of that, that second figure, but say the self, it's, it's, it's a devil's temptation as well because once you see that there's a relationship between you and the transcendent, let's say you start to take that seriously and you can, you can, you can become inflated by that prophetic duty, let's say, and and that's, and that's a very dangerous.

Speaker 2:          01:18:36       He actually writes this like 20 pages further, use this for the great psych danger, which always is always connected with individuation lies in the identification of ego consciousness with the self is produced inflammation, which Trenton, which threatens conscience consciousness is illusion. Yes. And he wrote a great essay, a great essay called relations between the ego and the unconscious, which is completely unconscious, incomprehensible unless you know the background that we're discussing where he wasn't very carefully that you have to stay in the proper relationship to the self, right? If the self overtakes the, the, the, the ego, then that's a descent into like manic religious insanity. That ones has to be struck where there's a relationship with the transcendent, but there's also still the grounding in the particular stuff here and now you see this echoed this idea equity. Interestingly enough, in the superhero mythology that dominated the adolescents imagination in 20th century, every superhero, so imagine the superhero. It's like a partial manifestation of the redemptive archetype. Every superhero has to have an alter ego.

Speaker 2:          01:19:51       And the alter ego well for Superman is Clark camp, mild mannered reporter and for Spiderman, it's, you know, high school, troubled high school, cause I nerd. But what's so interesting about those stories is that they understand without the alter ego, there's no superhero that both of those have to exist at the same time, the limitations and the end, the transcendence of the limitations have to both be there at that terrible paradoxical juxtaposition because the character isn't. The character can't exist without that tension. And I think that that's. Well, that motif wouldn't recur continually unless there was something to it that was narratively precise and accurate.

Speaker 1:          01:20:45       There's something in this paragraph that I want to tie it together when our previous stuff, because you talks about the end stage of individuation as a coming together with the immortal. It goes with the immortal. Now Joseph Campbell Campbell does exactly the same. He says, the Christ in you doesn't die. The Christ and you survived the death and resurrection and use that in our last talk. When you close your, um, you've never elaborated on the death of socrates and how he died in truth and honor. And then you said that part of the spirit doesn't die. So there is this theme of these people are somehow connected with something that is immortal and eternal, could not be understood simply as they have established a relationship with an archetypal mode of being that is eternal and that continues to exist beyond them and before them, but they've, they've established a relationship with that. Is that what that, what he means by,

Speaker 2:          01:21:48       by the immortal? Yes. That, that is what's meant. Is that right? It's that. It's the turtle pattern. It's theater. It's like you're the eternal music and the music goes on. Even if you depart the scene, the Christian is a Christian insistence so that that I also wouldn't overlook which is that also characterized as the finite, right? That's the promise of the resurrection. The resurrection of the body is that the Christians insists that about transcendent factor exists and that's the Christ. That's the word that's there at the beginning of time and at the end of time as as the judging revelation, write this transcendent locals that's eternal, but that's no more valuable in some sense. Then the particular creature that's that's, that's subject to apparent, apparent permanent death and it's very difficult for modern people to grant the idea of the bodily resurrection any credence and it's not something of which anyone can speak. I believe with any degree of what would you say it, knowing the Oregon consort or something like that, but at the same token, the world is a very strange place and it isn't obvious to me that I've learned to. I've learned to be very cautious in

Speaker 2:          01:23:28       Housley dismissing deep and ancient ideas regardless of their strangeness, and I do think that. See, the thing that's so interesting about that Christian insistence is that it valorizes the particular unbelievably important because you could say, well, if it's merely a matter of the eternal and the particular doesn't matter, but then if the particular doesn't matter, you ended up with that kind of nihilistic Buddhism, the suffering that characterizes or even in the proclivity for Christianity to degenerate into the forums that Nisha criticized, which is well, when you chase everything, we do an eternal beyond. It justifies everything terrible that's happening on earth as trivial and insignificant. That relieves you of your moral responsibility for, for addressing it. You can't, at the very minimum, the idea that the body is resurrected valorization of the value of the particular here and now, and an emphasis on the fact that that has defined value as well. It needs to be attended to and cared for properly. At minimum it stopped.

Speaker 1:          01:24:42       It's just one. One thing, uh, under paragraph I want to reflect on. It's the when you sense that individuation is a, could be a moment of deadliest apparel. And then he refers to the tightrope walker from now. What this means is that it can be so the danger can be so great when you embark on individuation in almost by definition means that the lesser you, unless they're part of your soul and your soul as to die, and then I think I've been there and in my own life, and that requires violence and recovery is by no means guaranteed,

Speaker 2:          01:25:22       right? That's exactly. Well, that's why. That's why that Motif, that's the Motif of going into the abyss, to to, to rescue your father like it's an abyss. There's no guarantee that you'll emerge from it. It's a real. It's genuine peril. Now the you know the, the, the what you need to be armed with in some sense to face. That is the willingness to die, that faith in rebirth, the, the, the, the, the willingness as well, or the decision to start abide by the truth because in a moment of great peril, this is another thing that. This is one of the things I think that terrified me into attempting to abide by the truth to the degree that I've been able to manage this. See, I started to understand not least by reading young that there were some points in my life where I needed to rely on my own judgment that I would be in a particular situation that no one could advise me about because no one would have access to the information about the particularities of my situation that I would have

Speaker 1:          01:26:37       and that I can call on

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       my relationship with the eternal, let's say to some degree. But if I had worked and corrupted my own judgment

Speaker 1:          01:26:48       when, when the necessity for a decision emerge, I would make the wrong decision and then I'd be lost. What stood out to me the few times you talked about this in a few lectures, like as a sidetrack, you talked about the death of the soul and what, what stood out to me is that you did this in a very, very efficient route when you really felt. It seemed to me like you felt the gravity of it. And um, and then when you kind of laid out your own story that you had to stop drinking, stop smoking, do to, to focus more on your work intuitively. There was to, it was a kind of a disparity between how visceral you could talk about the death of the soul and what you described as, what that meant for you, which I interpreted as mainly changing your lifestyle a little and, uh, and, and focus on your studies. So the question would be why? Why, why do you think I saw the disparity and if the disparities in the there, how is it that you can talk about the death of the soul, which such figures?

Speaker 2:          01:27:58       Well, I think I do think that there are things that are worse than death. I think that psychological disintegration might be worse than death because it can go on for so long and it can be so incredibly painful. To your point about communists, communists is correct. Is that the state that he exists in is worse than death.

Speaker 1:          01:28:23       It's hell

Speaker 2:          01:28:26       now. The disparity. I'm not sure exactly what you meant by that

Speaker 1:          01:28:32       meant you talk with such vigor and then start your fist. We're awake about the death of the soul. And then when you talked about letting parts of yourself die, you said it was mainly, it was stopped drinking and stopped smoking.

Speaker 2:          01:28:48       Zero responsibility I would say needs to some degree is the letting go of that because I had to make a choice between something approximating gratifying, immediate pleasure seeking and hyper social or hyper social way of Ba now that wasn't sustainable and in many ways for obvious reasons and doing, doing the difficult intellectual work already had decided to embark on and that was a death of a previous personality. It is trivial in some sense because it's. It's, it's burning off that which obviously needs to be burned off. But I would also say by the same token, that that doesn't make it a straight forward process. You alluded to this, you know, you said that you underwent a similar set of experiences where the old parts of you had to die. It's like, well that's

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       sub optimal and immature as they are. First of all, NGOs are still parts that are alive and still and still an element of your beginning. They might even be parts that you love and that other people love, and there are certainly things that you're familiar with, their modes of being that you're familiar with it. It's a major sacrifice to live elements of your personality. It's also a proper sacrifice. It was not an indictment on your report. I understand that. See, the problem with the identity politics types as far as I'm concerned, is the proclivity is always to sacrifice someone else feel oppressive and it's always externalized the oppressor, but in the individuation process, you're the oppressor. You are the oppressor, but it's much. See, and this is also the problem, this is something I really came to understand what I was writing the forward for. The new version of social gets in school like archipelago was. What's the problem here? Well, something has to be sacrificed and put the world right. Well who, what, who or what is going to be sacrificed, but you better make the proper sacrifices established the right relationship with the transcendent. Well, let's identify the evil as something external to us and sacrifice that well. What does that mean? Well, what it meant in the Russian revolution was that everyone died, but more specifically, everyone was killed. They were made into a burnt offering

Speaker 2:          01:31:28       to God and it was inappropriate. It's like, what if you're going to sacrifice because you have to sacrifice yourself, right? That's the. That's the. That's the. That's the crucifixion metaphor and sacrifices. You allow those parts of you that are unworthy to die. You encourage them to die even and, and, but we don't want to be foolish to say that that's merely a matter of pursuing your bliss, let's say, in, in the, in the Joseph Campbell manner or in maybe in the city. I mean, that's being a bit hard on Campbell, but it was an unfortunate phrase. Yeah, because if he knew better because he knew about the journey into the abyss, the sacrifice is, even if it's partial, it's still a depth.

Speaker 1:          01:32:23       I think also that this is why the death and rebirth, rebirth theme resonates so immediately in, in popular culture and in literature. For example, Gandalf who fell into the underworld, the bell rock and then emerged as the white.

Speaker 2:          01:32:41       Right, and everyone's, everyone's soul. Well, that's, that's a, that's a real representation of the transfiguration of Moses Christ Gandalf, the white, so it's not like tolkien didn't know these things and he knew these things perfectly well. That's right. In such a relief. I remember when I was a kid reading Lord of the rings for the first time, I was so appalled when gandalf disappeared and so relieved when he made, when he was like, oh no. GANDALF's garden. Like it's the death of God, right? What? What are we going to do? Open the great wizard. This has disappeared. Yeah. Yeah. And it is a terrible trial and you see that with Gandalf's experiences in underworld and he comes out white. Well, it's funny, it comes up white white's interesting because white is the sun, then white is purity, but why is also age, you know, and to undergo those experiences is also to risk all the physiological psychophysiological stress that widens your beard and that, that crazy your hair.

Speaker 1:          01:33:42       I'm going to tweet out now Jordan Peterson says white is purity.

Speaker 2:          01:33:46       Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:33:51       Know the thing is you also see this in more general popular culture. Have you ever heard of Dragon Ball z? No. It was a cartoon. It's an enemy and you have these creatures. They're called sayings, and whenever they're warriors and whenever they're in a fight with some eternal enemy and the moment they're about to die, they can their their spirit and their body can't take anymore. They become super science, which is the resurrect and they transcend and their hair stands up and it turns, turns, turns yellow, and they get electricity all around them. So whenever they are about to die, that's when they transcend. So they have been completely destroyed and that's when their transcendence occurs. In the beginning. They can control it, and that's a theme that keeps the entire saga together is this continual transcendence of the.

Speaker 2:          01:34:44       One of the themes that I developed in maps of meaning is that there's ways of construing yourself like you Construe Yourself as who you are. That's a stable state. Let's say who you are right now. That's me.

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       And then that all falls apart and then you consider yourself as the chaos that ensues when everything falls apart. And that's a state of hopelessness. And, and then maybe you recovered from that and you establish a new sense of order. You say, well, I passed through the underworld and now I'm in a better place and this is me, this better place, but then it's subject to fragmentation as well, and so what you learn is that you're not the order no matter how compelling and secure and promising that order is and you're not the chaos that ensues when that order is fragmented and you're not even the reestablishment of new order. You're the process by which that transformation continually occurs and that is the process of death and rebirth and that's where you identified with is that ever renewing process of death and rebirth and that identification with cracks that the Christians and the Christian narrative is aiming at instilling, aiming to, to the degree that something like that aims.

Speaker 4:          01:36:06       So is this also the Nietzsche refers to the man is a road between Beeston over men. I know that's not exactly the Christian the delineation, but instilled in more. I think that's probably more associated with the idea that we were talking about earlier. I mean these ideas are all late, but I think that's more associated with the idea of the partnership between man and God, mediated by conscious man is that is that intermediary finger because we're. We're moving towards the idea, but we're clearly not that that is a tight rope lights because moving towards the idealist, precarious, not the ideal and you can tumble at any moment. Seriousness to our being psychically, psychologically and spiritually as well as physically it's well not. That's part of aA. turtle crucifixion as well as a constant vulnerability of being a burden of being human. The necessary burden I suppose to me in my more, what would you call them? I don't know. You have these moments of thinking where

Speaker 4:          01:37:29       they're more metaphysical, more metaphysical moments I suppose. I do see that go on in there and engaged in a partnership to bring about the Kingdom of God on earth. Something like that. That there's something about that story. That's exactly right. That we should be struggling up yield with our burdens towards the highest possible ideal, and if there's something about that that's true or at least it's more true than anything else we can conceive of. And so that's the great adventure of lights. That's what you want to be cold too. I think you are called to that by your conscience, I think. Refer we we've talked for about 90 minutes now. I think this is a good time to. Yeah. This is a great note to close off on.
