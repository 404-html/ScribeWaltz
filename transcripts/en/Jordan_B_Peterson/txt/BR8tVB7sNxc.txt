Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi Guys, girls and interested others. I thought I'd give you an update on the week's events. I've still been involved in discussions with the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, David Cameron on the upcoming debate. And so I thought I'd fill you in on all of the events, but first of all, I want to make a slight detour. So one of the things that's happened to me since I put my lectures on youtube is that I frequently come across people claiming that high sound a fair bit like kermit the frog. Kermit the frog here.

Speaker 2:          00:42          Hi. Oh, kermit the frog here. Hi. All kermit the frog here.

Speaker 1:          00:53          And uh, I wasn't really sure what to make of that. It might not have been my first choice for animal Avatar, although I suppose it could be a lot worse. I need. Kermit is a pretty good guy and he's a decent spokes frog and a and a good organizer and, and all of that. So. But anyways, I was thinking about that this morning and I realized something and I think it's an example of what the psychologist Carl Jung called synchronicity. Synchronicity. The simultaneous occurrence of events that appear significantly or meaningfully related, but have no discernible causal connection. And since I've been engaging in this free speech campaign, I have experienced a number of synchronous event. So one of them was that when the Canadian Union of Public Employee Queer Caucus was sent, the University of letter denouncing me essentially at exactly the same moment that letter was released. I had another Canadian Union of Public Employees President in my office who was, who is a representative of one of the major groups on campus who was talking to me about his concerns about the new university sexual harassment policy, which has been formulated in response to the demands of Kathleen winds, Ontario government that threatens to make normal, let's call the misunderstanding social misunderstandings perhaps of a sexual nature, all equivalent to rape, um, and, and to sexual violence.

Speaker 1:          02:17          And this qp organization president was telling me about his concerns that that's going to put tremendous stress on the interactions between the people that he had. He has to represent. So that was an interesting juxtaposition. He couldn't find anybody in the University of Admin administration to properly address his concerns. But then the frog issue. Well, here's something cool, so you'll notice these sculptures behind me, they're made by an artist, a native artist named Charles Joseph, and Charles Joseph is a friend and now a brother of mine, um, as I've been inducted into their tribal group, which happened by say, by the way, the same week that I was being accused of being racist by many people on the University of Toronto campus. So that was another major active as far as I was concerned. But one thing that's kind of cool is that I had this mask made by Charles Awhile back. And this is a frog.

Speaker 1:          03:09          So there they are. Now. I've got my, my Kwakwaka'wakw, the Kwakwaka'wakw people are tribal people who live in, in, uh, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. And they have a remarkable artistic tradition, which I've been very interested in. And I've had a lot of work done by Charles who, as I said, as a residential school survivor and he made this beautiful frog hap for me. And so, and here's something cool too. So I asked Charles about the significance of the frog and Kwakwaka'wakw mythology, and he said the frog is a harbinger of dangerous, a dangerous times because if anything pollutes the waters, then the frogs disappear. And of course that did happen almost all around the world a few years ago because the frogs, frogs have very sensitive skin and so they pick up anything that, that, that has gone wrong and it interferes with their ability to reproduce and to live. And so I would say that as spokes frog, I'm announcing that there's something polluted, devote the water in which we're all swimming in, that we better clean it up and, or there's going to be trouble. So, um, there's a bit of synchronicity for you. So what I've been doing this week, because working out the details of the debate with, uh, with the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, David Cameron.

Speaker 1:          04:27          And uh, I met him Monday, November first in the meeting. He threw a curve ball at me, I would say. Um, he said that if the debate was going to go forward, the university couldn't allow it to go forward. If I was going to repeat my assertion that I would not use gender neutral pronouns to refer to people if they asked me to do so. And you may know that the university has already sent me two warning letters telling me that, um, my refusal to use these pronouns is in violation of university policy. We'll get to that in a while. And also contravenes the Ontario Human Rights Code. And, and also that as my employer, the university is as responsible for my speech acts as I am. And of course I did know that because that's exactly why I made the videos to begin with. And that's exactly what I said in the videos.

Speaker 1:          05:20          And so the university is distancing itself from me because they know that if I get called for my hate speech because of my refusal to use these pronouns, than the university is just as guilty as I am. So what they're doing is setting up a series of legal documents that are designed to show that they acted in good faith, trying to discipline a wayward employee who is contravening these policies. And David implied quite strongly. I would say that with each of those assertions, the probability that I will be able to teach at the University of Toronto come 2017 when I started my undergraduate teaching is diminishing. And so I knew that, but it was still a sharp to hear it. And then of course that put me in a conundrum because I wasn't sure if it was reasonable for me to proceed with the debate if a risk because it's a debate about free speech.

Speaker 1:          06:09          Say if a arbitrary restriction was placed on what I was able to say. And so initially I thought, well that I could proceed with the debate because I really want to talk about bill [inaudible] and issues that our larger scale than my mirror refusal to use these pronouns. But then I went home and I really thought about it and I talked with my family because we thought it was perverse in some sense that in this debate the debate would begin with a significant restriction on what I was allowed to say. So I wrote a letter, which I'm, which I'm going to read to you. I wrote this on on Tuesday, November second, and I sent it to American Gertler, who's the president of the University of Toronto show band, Nelson, Dean, Faculty of Arts and science, the vice provost who was a signatory of the second letter I received from the university, the one asking me not to repeat my assertions anymore, asking me to silence myself to Cheryl [inaudible], who's the vice president and provost to Kelly Hannah Moffat, vice president, human resources and equity.

Speaker 1:          07:10          A Hannah Moffitt is still working with the black liberation collective by the way, despite the fact that on their website they basically, they refuse to disavow violence in their pursuit of social change. And also, um, were started and continued to be strongly influenced by two people have, let's say, dubious reputation. You can read about them online if you want, and also Suzanne Ferber, who's the chair of the Department of Psychology, who gave me the first of the two warning letters. So what the university is doing is setting themselves up so that if I'm taken to court and they're taking the court along with me, then they can claim that they've done everything they possibly can to reign in this, you know, this abusive professor who refuses to let other people determine the words that he says. And uh, so this is the letter I wrote, Dear Dean Cameron yesterday. You indicated that if the debate where to proceed and if I repeated my insistence that I would not use gender neutral pronouns during that debate, the university would find itself in an untenable legal position.

Speaker 1:          08:14          This is because number one use of those pronouns is mandated by university policy and the Ontario Human Rights Act and its surrounding policies as laid out, for example, on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website and two, under those laws and policies, employers are responsible for the statements of their employees as if they were making the statements themselves. Thus, if the university hosts this debate, providing me with a platform for my views and I restated my intention to refuse use of the mandated pronouns and legal action and sued the university would not have properly upheld its legal obligation to ensure that its employees follow the requisite laws. You also indicated that if I continue to insist publicly that I will not use the mandated pronouns. The university may also be required to suspend my courses beginning in January. You suggested therefore that I agree during the debate not to repeat my refusal to use gender neutral pronouns, so as not to further compromise the university and to allow the debate to go forward. I sat at our meeting that I would consider this and I have. I cannot abide by this request. Part of the discussion that needs to be had during it outside of the debate is precisely what the university should do. Because of my refusal.

Speaker 1:          09:38          Here are the options. Number one, the university can consist, continue to insist upon my silence based on its understanding that my actions are currently legal. Sorry. Based on its understanding that my actions are currently illegal on its concern, a bit refusing to use gender neutral pronouns is illegal and more precisely be that my statement that I would refuse to use them if asked is also illegal. It can then take continue to take whatever actions that deems necessary to distance itself from me and my opinions. Option two,

Speaker 1:          10:19          the university can reaffirm its commitment to its statement on freedom of speech written in May 19, 92, which explicitly states that quote, the essential purpose of the university is to engage in the pursuit of truth, the advancement of learning, and the dissemination of knowledge. To achieve this purpose, all members of the university must have as a prerequisite freedom of speech and expression, which means the right to examine question, investigate, speculate, and comment on any issue without reference to prescribe doctrine as well as the right to criticize the university and society at large. The existence of an institution were unorthodox ideas. Alternative modes of thinking and living and radical prescriptions for social ills can be debated, contributes immensely to social and political change, and the advancement of human rights both inside and outside the university. Often this debate may generate controversy and disputes among members of the university and the wider community. In such cases, the universities primary obligation is to protect the free speech of all involved. The university must allow the fullest range of debate. It should not limit that debate by preordained and conclusions or punishing or inhibiting the reasonable exercise of free speech.

Speaker 1:          11:43          And I said the university must decide it can express option one, which in my opinion means sacrificing it's commitment to free speech as expressly laid out in the aforementioned statement or it can accept option to defending my right to quote, criticize the university and society at large and quote by all legal means necessary. This would mean throwing it support behind me and fighting the restrictive legislation on embodied in the Ontario Human Rights Act and associated policies and soon to be instantiated in federal bill. See 16 all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada if necessary.

Speaker 1:          12:27          I understand that the statement also says that quote, the purpose of the university also depends on an environment of tolerance and mutual respect. Every member should be able to work, live, teach, and learn in university, free from discrimination and harassment and quote, my actions have been deemed by some to constitute discrimination. So the two major principles outlined in the statement or now in conflict and the university and our society at large has to decide which one takes priority. As Professor Jonathan Haidt, professor of ethical leadership at Nyu Stern School of business recently indicated in the US universities must choose one t loss that's guiding principle, social justice or truth. I have similarly juxtapose social justice and freedom of expression and chose the latter.

Speaker 1:          13:28          Make your decision. I've made mine. May God himself help us live with the consequences. Now, Jonathan Haidt. I'm going to read you a little bit about what he wrote. He wrote this last week and all. All set. Yup. All set up the link and the video in the comments on this video so you can look at it. Jonathan Haidt, who's very good political psychologist by the way, says no university can have truth and social justice as dual t locis final goals. John Stuart Mill is the patron saint of what all call Truth University, which sees truth as a process in which flawed individuals challenge each other's biased and incomplete reasoning in the process all become smarter truth you dies when it becomes intellectual uniform or politically orthodox. Karl Marx is the patron saint of social justice, you which is oriented around changing the world in part by overthrowing power structures and privilege.

Speaker 1:          14:35          It sees political diversity as an obstacle to action. Each university must pick one. Alright, so now David Cameron, the Dean, wrote me back. That's the same day, which is what I requested and he said, I have reviewed your letter dated November second, 2016. I do not agree with the way that you have framed our conversation, which was a good faith attempt to find a way to identify a terms of reference that would allow for you as an academic to engage in a discussion about your views regarding the provisions of the Ontario Human Rights Code that it protected against discrimination based on gender identity and gender expression since 2012. That's the similar legislation in Ontario as well as similar amendments that are being considered federally. In Bill [inaudible]. David repeats his commitment to the to the forum or the university is quite prepared to host a forum where arguments are presented concerning the gender identity and gender expression protections of the Ontario Human Rights Code, or those being considered under bill [inaudible]. Arguments are presented concerning freedom of expression and how it should properly relate to nondiscrimination protections that exist in Canadian law. Arguments are presented as to any alternatives that might be preferable and slash or discussing, listen to and respond to arguments of colleagues who may have different views on these subjects.

Speaker 1:          16:02          The university cannot host a forum that will offer a platform for an expressed intention to engage in conduct with your students and colleagues that you appeared to have Nolan acknowledged would have been in, would be in violation of the Ontario Human Rights Code. If you wish to engage in a further discussion about this way of proceeding with the scholarly forum, we would be glad to receive your written comments. Yours sincerely. David Cameron, Dean, Faculty Arts and Science. So I slept on that and, and, and, and I'll tell you what I decided to do. So I talked about it, talked it over again with my family and some friends who have been following this and who are wise people. And, and then I also thought about this in mythological terms, so I'll give you the context of that. So

Speaker 1:          16:56          one of the oldest stories we have got to the story in genesis indicates that the environments that people find themselves in at an architectural level. So this is all human environments could be likened to a garden, a walled garden, a is a means walled garden. An Eden means well watered place by the way. And so genesis presents the proper environment for human beings as a a garden with walls. I'm a well watered garden with walls and so that's a combination of of of culture and nature that the walls are culture and the garden itself is nature and so human beings lived in a, in a, in an environment that's always partly nature and partly culture and those two things need to be kept in proper balance. But the thing about the garden is that there's always a snake in the garden and it's. It's like the idea that there's a snake in the garden.

Speaker 1:          17:47          There is the idea that nothing can exist without, without a flaw. Nothing can actually exist that doesn't have a serious flaw and the same ideas expressed in certain Asian ideas. For example, the Buddhist beautiful Buddhist Gardens in Japan very carefully manicured, always have a flaw as often do a certain forms of Japanese pottery and it expresses the same idea that that reality to exist must be allowed to have its flaws. And the Yin and Yang symbol is like that too. Because in the, in the chaos serpent, there's a white dot that indicates that in every chaotic circumstance order can emerge and in the and in the white serpent, there's a block dot which indicates that in every orderly place that a chaotic element can emerge, but you can't get away from the tension of opposites. And so I thought, well, it's necessary for this debate to proceed because it's important and, and I want the, the topics here to be aired properly and thoroughly and it would be better for the university to host it.

Speaker 1:          18:52          I, I very seriously considered renting a theater and just making my views known there. But I thought that's not as good as having the other side have it's opportunity to have their concerns noted. And I agreed that I would provide my arguments, at least an outline of my arguments to my opposition, let's say, or to the people on the other side of the discussion beforehand. So that they had a chance to marshal their arguments. And so I decided that despite this restriction, which is still the precise nature of which is still to be determined, that it would be better, all things considered to go ahead with the debate. And so it, it looks like it's likely to occur sometime in the next two weeks. And um, and that's that. But I would like to close by noting that the university appears to have made its choice.

Speaker 1:          19:47          And when I met David on Friday, we had a somewhat more heated exchange, still friendly, I would say, where I suggested that the university is making a big mistake here and that they have to make a decision as Jonathan Haidt said about which side they're on. And that if the university, the university has substantial legal resources and if they were as concerned about free speech as I think they should be. And as their own policy, which I'm supposed to abide by by the way. Because because I'm supposed to abide by university policies that the university policy on free speech, which I think is its highest order policy, suggests that I have the right. Or perhaps maybe even the obligation to criticize the university and society at large without, without reference to any preordained conclusions. And so I, I strongly suggested to David that, um, the university is on the wrong side of this, that they picked the side of the social warriors over this side of freedom of expression, or perhaps even as Jonathan Haidt has pointed out, perhaps even over truth and that that's a huge mistake, that they're violating the most fundamental principle upon which the university is predicated.

Speaker 1:          21:00          And I sincerely believe that to be the case, but I've decided to go forward with the debate because I believe that a flawed debate is better than none. And perhaps all you can hope for in the world of actuality is a flawed process that can grow and struggle. However, wretchedly and awkwardly towards something that might be regarded as the truth. So make no mistake about it. This is what's happened. The university has drawn the lines and they have decided that if they have to support political correctness slash social justice, um, neo Marxism or freedom of speech, then they're going to pick the former. And not the latter, and so that's the state of the art at Canada's perhaps Canada's greatest educational institution. And I would say that's also the, uh, a diagnostic indicator of the, shall we call it the state of the polluted water works that make up our current culture and as spokes frog for the nation. Let's say I'm, I'm stating quite bluntly, that we better clean up our act or there's going to be hell to pay.

Speaker 3:          22:22          It's not easy being green having to spend each day the color of the leaves when I think it might be nicer being red or yellow or gold or copper, much more colorful light. Then.
