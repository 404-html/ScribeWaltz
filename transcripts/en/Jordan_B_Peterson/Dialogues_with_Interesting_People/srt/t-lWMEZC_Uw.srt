1
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,170
Jordan,
thank you so much for giving us some 

2
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,170
time.
Again.

3
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,170
I'm in Sydney.
You're in Kentucky.

4
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,650
Yes,
I am.

5
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,660
I'm,
I'm there as part of my 12 rules for 

6
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,371
life tour,
which is I think expanding to hit about 

7
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:07,640
maybe 80 cities,
something like that.

8
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,150
Goodness.
Well that was very keen to have a follow

9
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:16,151
up chat after the conversation that you 
and I had together when you're in 

10
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:17,370
Sydney.
Uh,

11
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,550
and in particular to frame that for 
people who might be listening to this 

12
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,881
conversation at that time,
I had not seen you in front of a live 

13
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:29,220
audience the evening of that 
conversation.

14
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:34,221
After that conversation,
I had that opportunity at chatswood one 

15
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:37,731
of the seven talks that you gave in 
Australia put together by Sam Mcclellan 

16
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,450
from a,
from a Melbourne,

17
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,200
every one of them or sell out.
I'll have to say,

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,560
I don't know whether the biggest issue 
for me is what I learned by watching 

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,910
that.
All the questions that arise out of it.

20
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:55,290
But the first thing I'd say is I was 
concerned at the time that you and I had

21
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,380
had a very long conversation that might 
be too long for people when we put it on

22
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:59,430
the website and you said,
no,

23
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:03,540
John won't be young people especially 
are hungry for content.

24
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,330
Put it all up there.
They will listen to it.

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,300
You're absolutely right.
Young people looking for content.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,070
It is absolutely amazing.
Yeah.

27
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:18,071
So well,
I mean some of the big youtube stars 

28
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,691
like Joe Rogan,
they're constantly putting out three 

29
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:21,960
hour podcasts and people listened to all
of them.

30
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:26,961
Long haul truckers listen to them and 
guys driving forklifts and and young 

31
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:32,151
people and couples.
And there's a massive hunger for real 

32
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,080
for Ed,
for high quality educational material.

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,440
It shouldn't be underestimated.
And I mean one of the things that seems 

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,271
to be the case with these people on 
Youtube that are making a splash,

35
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:46,560
let's say in this alternate media 
format,

36
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:51,561
is that they fully have full respect for
the intelligence of their audience and 

37
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:54,060
they don't pull any punches in terms of 
content or lakes.

38
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,670
Yeah,
well that's where the come back to that.

39
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,700
But as I say,
you know,

40
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,710
it's just extraordinary.
I pull up a field station out in the 

41
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,750
country town near where I live,
uh,

42
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,760
and somebody gets out of the car next to
me,

43
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,280
a follow of about 35,
I suppose,

44
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,820
and he looks at me and he just says 
straight up before he even says hello,

45
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,270
he said,
I've just been listening to you and 

46
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,591
Jordan Peterson having a conversation.
And everywhere I go now that's what 

47
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:20,680
people say.
So thank you for the opportunity.

48
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,110
You made the comment there,
the for every,

49
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,880
uh,
youtube visit,

50
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,450
they'd be up to 11 podcasts.
I think that's what you said.

51
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:34,020
Well,
the podcast market is absolutely 

52
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,151
exploding and you're actually seeding,
seeding this start to effect book 

53
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:40,020
publishing because audio books have 
become extraordinarily popular and 

54
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,701
people are discovering that they can use
their phone time when they're commuting 

55
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:44,701
or,
or,

56
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:46,720
or exercising or walking or doing 
dishes,

57
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,260
whatever,
to engage themselves in high quality.

58
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,650
Well,
high quality educational material,

59
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,020
books and podcasts.
And so that's a real revolution it.

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,920
And it really is a revolution.
People young people to you,

61
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,030
not instead of listening to music,
which is really something because 

62
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,210
music's been a predominant cultural 
force for a very long time,

63
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,200
so it's an.
It's an amazing technological revolution

64
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,900
and I really appreciated our 
conversation by the way.

65
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:15,610
I think we had a great conversation.

66
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,710
I enjoyed it immensely and it seems to 
me that this is a sort of modern version

67
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:21,120
and the.
I think this is terrific,

68
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,520
if I'm understanding correctly,
are they all da da way.

69
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,880
People who perhaps had another great 
formal education had access to good 

70
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,510
quality literature and so forth put 
together by whether it was penguin or a.

71
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,740
What was it?
Every man's book,

72
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:33,870
so every,
every diet books,

73
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:37,110
whatever they were called.
Even reader's digest to Mike.

74
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,630
That education,
that learning the classics and so forth,

75
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:43,650
available widely and now this is a 
modern version of it perhaps.

76
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,560
Well,
and I think what's happening,

77
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,270
it's a main street.
They underestimate the,

78
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,890
the moral quality of their viewers.
They underestimate their intelligence.

79
00:04:55,891 --> 00:05:00,891
They underestimate their persistence and
they've also become quite manipulative 

80
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:04,050
in their use of editing and message 
massaging,

81
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,170
spin really.
And the other thing that's really good 

82
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,560
about these sorts of conversations is 
that what you see is what you get.

83
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,440
They're bare bones,
they're not high tech.

84
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,870
Well they are,
and their highest tech in some sense,

85
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:18,540
but not on the production end or the 
editing end.

86
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,840
So people can trust them and they're 
genuine conversations.

87
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:25,200
They're not designed to craft a message 
or anything like that.

88
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,050
They're not manipulative.
And,

89
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,070
and that's a big deal in youtube.
Youtube particularly doesn't respond 

90
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,390
well to manipulation as far as I can 
tell.

91
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,550
Well,
uh,

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,090
Andrea,
that conversations are enormously.

93
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:38,940
I've been stunned by the response.
Uh,

94
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:41,160
it's gone very,
very widely as you know,

95
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,280
uh,
both on your site and Oman.

96
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,650
Um,
but to come back to that die later that 

97
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,150
day,
you got one of the talks of the,

98
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,410
one of the seven that you gave in 
Australia chatswood.

99
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,710
And uh,
I was very kindly allowed to compare it 

100
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,851
for.
And one thing that 19 years in public 

101
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:04,931
life taught me is to have a bit of a 
look at your audience and summarize 

102
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:04,931
them.
A,

103
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,370
it was a pretty amazing experience.
The first thing had happened was that 

104
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:08,370
you worked on for,
you said a word,

105
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,700
you'd got a standing ovation.
That's something unheard of in this 

106
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,330
country,
but they did a 90 minutes top.

107
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,970
I gave you another standing ovation.
Uh,

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,370
you left,
came for a few minutes,

109
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,740
came back on,
took 30 minutes of questions,

110
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,260
and again,
they responded in the same way.

111
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,870
Let me just say a couple of things about
that audience.

112
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,790
I was,
firstly,

113
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:33,791
I've got to say pretty heavily impacted 
as I looked out there and recognized 

114
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:37,130
that there was an enormous hunger to 
hear what you had to say.

115
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,660
Even though you mentioned it was perhaps
best described as tough love.

116
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,630
You weren't ginger,
ring them up with a soft story.

117
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:47,600
You were really pushing you or really 
challenging them.

118
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,110
The second thing that struck me is that 
I've said many times since I reckon 50 

119
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,521
percent of the people in that room at 
night where young Australian men under 

120
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:59,480
the age of probably 35.
Uh,

121
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:02,120
the third thing that struck me was that,
that was a,

122
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,120
it was a cross section.
Uh,

123
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,130
I would say many of them were university
students,

124
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:09,260
but all university graduates,
but many,

125
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,750
many will not.
And the fourth thing that,

126
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,850
it just goes back to something you said 
a moment ago,

127
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,540
they knew what you were signing and 
you're a clinical psychologist in a 

128
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,231
highly educated person to suggest that 
they didn't understand would be very 

129
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:24,500
patronizing.
They ain't got what you're on about.

130
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,530
Oh,
definitely.

131
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,120
There's,
there's no doubt about that.

132
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,760
I mean,
there are,

133
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,810
those lectures aren't interesting unless
you understand them and there's just no 

134
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:32,950
doubt that that's happening.
You know,

135
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,300
I think one of the mistakes that 
psychologists have made,

136
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,360
especially the more popular ones over 
the last three or four decades,

137
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:42,120
is to try to convince people that 
they're okay the way they are.

138
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,430
It's like the self esteem movement,
you know,

139
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,680
you should love yourself the way you 
are.

140
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:48,810
You should feel good about yourself the 
way you are.

141
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:53,811
And that's actually not a very 
optimistic message for people because 

142
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:57,620
people are generally sensible enough to 
not be particularly satisfied with the 

143
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,640
way that they are.
They want to be who they could be.

144
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,900
They want to have something noble Tane 
map and,

145
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,160
and so I,
I make that case for very strong that 

146
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,930
you should more,
um,

147
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,360
what aligned and on board with who you 
can be then with who you are and who you

148
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:14,910
can be.

149
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,730
Isn't the person who has endless rights 
or,

150
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:22,731
or,
or as the member of a privileged or 

151
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:23,280
underprivileged group,
it should be who you should be,

152
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:27,720
should be an individual who's willing to
take on full responsibility for the,

153
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,960
for the catastrophe of existence.
And for the malevolence that's part of 

154
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,540
it.
And See,

155
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,550
I think people are responding to that,
first of all because everyone who has 

156
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,871
any sense knows that life is a tragic 
business and that everyone is 

157
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:44,640
susceptible to be trail and malevolence 
on their own part.

158
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:49,641
And,
and as a consequence of the actions of 

159
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:49,770
others.
That's our existential predicament.

160
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,430
And I think people also know in a very 
deep sense that the to that isn't 

161
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,310
security or safety.
Um,

162
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:03,210
and it's not envy or bitterness.
It's the willingness to try to work,

163
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,940
to make the world a better place,
to start with yourself,

164
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,560
take responsibility for yourself.

165
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,560
And then to take responsibility for your
family and then to take responsibility 

166
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,851
for your community.
And everyone knows that the people they 

167
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:17,370
admire are exactly the people that do 
that.

168
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:21,660
And we also all know that that's what 
gets you out of bed on a rough morning.

169
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,260
It's that you've got something important
and vital to do and it's not an easy 

170
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,200
thing.
It isn't necessarily even something that

171
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:33,201
makes you happy.
It's something that's meaningful and 

172
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:35,751
necessary to fight back against the 
tragedy and the malevolence of the 

173
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,740
world.
And people know that deeply.

174
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,070
It's deeply rooted inside their souls,
I would say.

175
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:44,970
And a call to that is very meaningful 
for people,

176
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:45,870
including me.
You know,

177
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:50,871
I include myself in my audience.
It's not like I'm lecturing to them 

178
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:54,801
precisely.
I'm having a conversation with them 

179
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:56,190
about how we can step the world right 
and we are setting it right.

180
00:09:56,191 --> 00:10:01,191
Things are getting better very rapidly 
around the world and we can really push 

181
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:01,710
that forward in the decades to come if 
we,

182
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,370
if we made a conscious effort.
And so I think this is a very exciting 

183
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:07,370
message for people.

184
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,910
One of the things that are outside about
Australians is I got the world's best 

185
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,600
bulldust detectors by recognize 
authenticity,

186
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,380
authenticity very quickly.
And if you're not authentic,

187
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,790
they won't listen.
So I think in part they were responding.

188
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,590
If I can pay you a compliment by the 
fact that you were talking about you,

189
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,310
you were talking about us,
you,

190
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:33,311
uh,
addressing where we are all together as 

191
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:37,841
human beings and in why it was designed 
you assigning to get to the good news.

192
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,590
You've actually got to go through what 
might be called the valley of death.

193
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:47,591
You've got to face yourself.
You've got to be realistic about 

194
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:48,750
yourself in the world that you live in.
And I,

195
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
all those young people.
It was almost as though they were saying

196
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:54,680
was sick to death of a therapy culture.
A culture that offers a sort of.

197
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,530
It's a relief to everyone.
There's a,

198
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,800
there's a dictum that Carl young derived
from the great outcome of sex Mr Colinas

199
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,100
inventory,
and it means what you most want will be 

200
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,681
found where you least want to look,
what you most need will be found where 

201
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:15,091
you least want to look.
And that people know that know everyone 

202
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,860
knows that they are tired of naive 
optimism,

203
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,270
let's say,
and not optimism.

204
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,870
Optimism doesn't have to be naive and 
they know perfectly well that the way to

205
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:27,871
set themselves right is to take careful 
stock of themselves and to pay very 

206
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,490
careful attention to the errors that 
they know they're making and to and to 

207
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,661
grow up and to mature and to and to 
adopt the responsibilities of a 

208
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:41,131
forthright citizen.
And I think people are sick to death of 

209
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:44,610
too much discussion of rights and and 
too much discussion of self esteem and 

210
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:44,610
all that.

211
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,950
All that.
All that discussion that goes along with

212
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,040
what everyone owes you.
It's like it's just not helpful to 

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,421
people because it isn't your rights that
give you meaning in life and you need a 

214
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,130
meaning to set against the tragedy and 
everyone knows that.

215
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:05,190
The way that you find that meaning is by
adopting responsibility.

216
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,790
Obviously for yourself.
You've got to take care of yourself,

217
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:14,210
your family.
I mean you want to be a good person to 

218
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,971
your parents.
You want to be a good person to your 

219
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,891
siblings and your children.
Clearly and you have to bear some 

220
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:22,620
responsibility for your community and if
you're really firing on all cylinders,

221
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:24,480
you do all those things at the same 
time.

222
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,640
You know,
and and I do believe,

223
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:28,560
and I tell people,
I do believe that the world,

224
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:30,510
if the tragic and malevolent place in 
many,

225
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:33,470
many ways,
but that the way forward through that is

226
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:38,810
is to do everything you can to put 
yourself on the side of what's good and 

227
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,391
to aim high and that that's where you 
get the dignity that enables you to to 

228
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,550
bear life without becoming corrupt and 
everyone knows this is true.

229
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,620
Who's gonna?
Argue with that?

230
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,140
Having found yourself on having of your 
like and being realistic about yourself 

231
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,250
on recognizing we were talking about 
this last time.

232
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:59,850
A dividing line between good and evil is
not between black and white or whatever.

233
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:05,090
A captor and Jayla.
I'm an old man and woman at somewhere 

234
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:11,181
across every human heart.
Having recognized that and you can then 

235
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:13,110
go on and help build a stronger,
fairer and more just more humane society

236
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,290
rather than what seems to be the way 
people approach it at the moment and 

237
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:19,080
say,
uh,

238
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,470
uh,
that somehow rather you society can fix 

239
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,470
your problems.

240
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,770
Yes.
Well that's it and I mean for young 

241
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,600
people in particular at skidsteer,
actually a very depressing message for 

242
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,661
young people to hear that it's time for 
them to get involved in political 

243
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:35,961
activism because any young person who 
has any sense knows perfectly well and 

244
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:37,960
if they're,
especially if they're 18 or so,

245
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,860
19 years old,
is they don't know a damn thing.

246
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,990
You know,
they haven't started a business.

247
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:47,991
They haven't started a family.
They don't have a permanent 

248
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:47,991
relationship.
They're not educated.

249
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:49,710
They don't have any experience.
And for someone to come and say,

250
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:51,780
well,
you're in a position to change the world

251
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,250
is nothing but a way of,
of disenchanting them with adult wisdom.

252
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,020
It's like you're not ready to change the
world.

253
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,170
You've got a lot to learn,
but you can learn it.

254
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,470
And in learning it,
you will become much more powerful and 

255
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,991
much more charismatic and much more 
articulate and much more wise and 

256
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:13,491
sensible,
and that's the way forward to to being 

257
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:13,491
much more than you are.

258
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,510
And young people.
Of course,

259
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:18,870
when you're 18 and you have 60 years of 
life ahead of you,

260
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,240
what you want to hear above all else is 
that there's way more of you yet to come

261
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,810
because what else are you going with 
those 60 years?

262
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,590
So it's,
it's a message.

263
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:32,420
It's a hard message because it says,
well,

264
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:37,421
you're not everything you could be,
but it's a deeply optimistic message 

265
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:41,321
because it's because the idea is that 
you could be way more than you are 

266
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:44,150
incomparably more than you are.
And I do believe that.

267
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,020
And what's so fun about this is that 
people keep telling me that,

268
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,270
keep people keep telling me that it's 
true.

269
00:14:50,271 --> 00:14:51,200
You know,
I have people,

270
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,170
endless people.
I've got one kid come up to me the other

271
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:55,340
day.
It was so fun.

272
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,100
He said,
a year and a half ago,

273
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,040
I had just got out of jail and I was 
homeless.

274
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,610
And he said,
I started listening to your lectures and

275
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,380
I just,
I got married this year,

276
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:08,600
I have a vagina and I just bought my 
apartment.

277
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,210
It's like,
wow man,

278
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,010
good work,
you know,

279
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,250
you did that in a year and a half and 
you know,

280
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,530
I was in la the other about a month ago 
and you know,

281
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,260
this was in a rough part of La,
downtown La near the Apollo theater.

282
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:29,261
And I'd given a talk there.
My wife and I were walking down the 

283
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,250
street and this car pulled up and this 
kid hopped out and he was about 19 or so

284
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,200
good luck and Hispanic kid ran over and 
asked me if I was Dr Peterson.

285
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,910
I said yes.
And he was all excited.

286
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:42,911
He said it'd been watching my videos for
about a year and a half and they really 

287
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:43,730
helped him straighten out his life.
He was just smiling the way.

288
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,660
He said,
wait a minute,

289
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:49,661
wait a minute.
Then he ran back to his car and he came 

290
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:51,650
back out with his dad and his dad was 
standing there,

291
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,860
you know,
and they have their arms around each 

292
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:56,860
other and they were just grinning like 
mad and the kid said,

293
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,310
look,
I've really put my relationship together

294
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,340
with my father and were really on board 
with this together and they were just 

295
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,470
like so happy you couldn't believe it.

296
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,470
And that just happens over and over.
Like it happens I would say four or five

297
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:14,021
times a day in restaurants or in 
airports through while you've been 

298
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:14,270
experiencing that to some degree in 
Australia you said,

299
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:16,100
and it's,
it's so good.

300
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,820
And the mainstream media that's been 
covering what I've been doing,

301
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
you know,
they just missed this completely because

302
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:27,161
everything.
It seems like everything that 

303
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:29,090
constitutes news in our society has to 
be political and group oriented.

304
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,390
This isn't political and it's not group 
oriented.

305
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,990
What I'm trying to do as a good clinical
psychologist and perhaps a good educator

306
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,080
and I mean good striving to be good in 
the moral sense is to help people 

307
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,320
develop as individuals and they are and 
it's really working.

308
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,380
And it's a thrill to be on this tour 
because that's all I hear and now no one

309
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:54,270
talks to me about the political issues 
or very,

310
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:59,271
very rarely,
and it's all because I also think that 

311
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:01,020
the battle against collective is to,
let's say,

312
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,890
the battle against identity politics 
isn't to be had in the political realm.

313
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,090
And maybe that's a secondary issue.
What the way that you,

314
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,420
that you fight for the sovereignty of 
the individual is by getting your act 

315
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,320
together and,
and right locally,

316
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:21,321
right where you are,
and starting to take advantage of 

317
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:21,321
everything that you have in front of 
you.

318
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,890
And,
and then you do no harm that way.

319
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,950
All you do is make yourself less bad.
Who,

320
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:30,450
what's the harm in that?
That's a good thing

321
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,040
to some extent.
I think the battle here is almost one of

322
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,520
statism or collectivism versus 
individual liberty,

323
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,720
who's going to shape who?
So you've got the whole,

324
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:43,390
the sort of push from the lift identity,
politics,

325
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,440
victimhood policies,
uh,

326
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,060
approaches and what have you.
We owe these people what have you.

327
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,460
So the state has control and shapes 
individuals and helps them forward.

328
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,240
On the other hand,
you have the different view that says,

329
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,270
now the state should be shaped by the 
people who make up the state.

330
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,750
You know,
Australia is a sum total of individuals 

331
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,320
who are Australian and they ought to be 
shaping the public square,

332
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,050
not having the public square of your 
local,

333
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,010
the public sector,
shaping them.

334
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,510
The whole argument is about what?
What?

335
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,230
What's the primary unit of analysis?
That's everything.

336
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,170
What's the primary unit of analysis and 
in the West,

337
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:26,171
the primary unit of the analysis has 
been the logos and that something like 

338
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,831
divine individual consciousness and it's
on that ground that we developed our 

339
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:33,220
idea of individual sovereignty and 
citizenship and you know,

340
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,280
we don't talk about a citizen is someone
who adopts the responsibilities of an 

341
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,850
ethical being.
That's a citizen.

342
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,810
We don't talk about that even in schools
and tell people that look,

343
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,450
the meaning in your life is going to be 
found.

344
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,260
It's going to be proportionate to the 
degree that you take responsibility for 

345
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,190
positively shaping your experience and 
the experience of the people around you.

346
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,940
And this isn't like be good in some in 
some week,

347
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,020
be inoffensive and harmless sense.
It's not that at all.

348
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:06,950
It's like get your spine straight,
get your aggression integrated,

349
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,110
pick a heavy goal,
like a heavy high goal,

350
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:14,480
something you can barely tolerate 
lifting and struggled along with it.

351
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,980
And that's where you'll find yourself 
respect and people know that it's,

352
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,640
it's fun to watch the working class guys
respond to this too,

353
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:24,430
you know,
because they know this.

354
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,840
Most of those guys worked like mad,
you know,

355
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:29,550
and they know that there's no ability in
that and,

356
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,540
and there is and so it's well and people
also say,

357
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:39,541
well that they're happy to come to my 
lectures or even read the book because 

358
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:43,560
I'm helping them find words to express 
things that they already knew to be 

359
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,861
true.
And those things that they know to be 

360
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:46,960
true are the bedrock axioms of our 
culture.

361
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:51,961
And one of the things we got right in 
the West was the idea of the sovereign 

362
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:55,860
responsible individual,
not the person with rights and certainly

363
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,770
not the person with rights granted to 
them by the state.

364
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,740
That's not part of the English common 
law tradition.

365
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,540
You're the locus of rights,
but,

366
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,620
but only in some sense because you're 
the locus of ultimate responsibility.

367
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,040
I guess part of what I've been trying to
tell people is that there's no 

368
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
difference between meaning and 
responsibility.

369
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,050
They're the same thing.

370
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,210
Yeah,
no,

371
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:19,910
I understand what you're saying.
Now.

372
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,020
As I looked at that audience,
I thought to myself,

373
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,410
we're doing a lot of talking about the 
first world war in this country.

374
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:30,411
60,000
Australians died out of a very small 

375
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:33,000
population in that horrendous event and 
we celebrate the bribery those young and

376
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,150
Zach's,
we call them who went off to college and

377
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,960
then to the western front and were 
involved in some of the critical battles

378
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:44,961
of the first world war every year.
Australians turnout and extraordinary 

379
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:49,150
numbers and more and more young 
Australians turnout to have you like pay

380
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:54,151
tribute to the courage.
And as I looked out across a wide 

381
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:54,151
audience,
I thought,

382
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:55,450
there's a lot of people here that I've 
willingly,

383
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,880
oh,
I would choose to be with in the 

384
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,181
trenches.
They are essentially people who want to 

385
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:07,581
be.
To use the word you did just a moment 

386
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:07,581
ago,
noble to the best of their ability,

387
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,180
but I live in a culture somehow that 
says,

388
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,290
no,
that's all nonsense.

389
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:16,291
That's not where you want to go.
And it seemed to me that they'd deeply 

390
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,730
resenting and deeply keen to reject

391
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,170
that approach.
Here's,

392
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:22,960
here's what it is.
So there's this idea that,

393
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,400
um,
it's pushed very hard in the 

394
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,661
universities by the postmodern,
Neo Marxists types and before anybody 

395
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:32,530
objects I know perfectly well that 
technically speaking,

396
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:36,280
postmodernism in Neo Marxists,
neo Marxism aren't commensurate,

397
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:39,770
but it doesn't stop people from,
from joining them together.

398
00:21:39,771 --> 00:21:41,710
It theologically.
But in any case,

399
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,180
the idea is that the West is 
fundamentally an oppressive patriarchy,

400
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,720
which it isn't.
It's partly an oppressive society 

401
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,630
because every society is partly 
oppressive and flawed,

402
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,270
but fundamentally the West is not an 
oppressive patriarchy.

403
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:57,970
And,
but if you buy that line,

404
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:02,971
then the next thing that comes along is 
that anything you do that contributes to

405
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:07,210
that patriarchy is also oppressive.
Tyrannical.

406
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:12,211
And so that's extraordinarily 
demoralizing for people who are trying 

407
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:15,391
to make their way in the world because 
they're trying to hoist the 

408
00:22:15,391 --> 00:22:18,100
responsibilities up on their shoulders 
and become competent,

409
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,400
contributing adults,
and they're criticized to death for 

410
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,400
being oppressive tyrants.

411
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,190
And so there's a conflation of 
competence with tyranny and you can't do

412
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:29,590
anything to anyone that's more 
demoralizing,

413
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:31,610
not you know,
then that Nisha said,

414
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,280
if you want to punish someone,
punish them for their virtues.

415
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,230
And so they're tired of that.
It's so demoralizing.

416
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,230
You don't like it appeals to the part of
each man,

417
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:46,231
let's say an each woman for that matter 
who will wants to avoid responsibility 

418
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,080
because you can rationalize it and say,
well,

419
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:52,081
I'm not going to take responsibility 
because that just makes me a tyrant and 

420
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:53,920
an an agent of the patriarchy.
But that's a.

421
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,850
That sort of thing leads people down a 
path.

422
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:59,210
And I've seen that my friends and in my 
clinical practice it.

423
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,240
So instead we say,
look like our culture has problems.

424
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:04,430
Every culture does and it needs 
everyone.

425
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,700
Everyone has to be awake so that we 
don't slip at every level of our social 

426
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,810
being into something like a blind 
authoritarianism,

427
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,910
but the way that that happens is by 
waking up and taking responsibility once

428
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:21,911
again for for yourself and your family 
and your community and that that and 

429
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:23,240
that's noble,
which is a word you never hear.

430
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,750
It's like a human being has to be a 
noble creature to withstand the tragedy 

431
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,790
of existence without becoming corrupt 
and so and and that,

432
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,250
that,
that coal is to the best in people

433
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,210
and Jordan,
just a.

434
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,380
We should wrap up on that part of it 
that evening night,

435
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:42,250
but there was one other thing when we 
kind of questions on.

436
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,890
There will full marks in the room.
They land up 20 deep at eight.

437
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:49,891
We got to seven.
I think the seventh question was from a 

438
00:23:49,891 --> 00:23:53,140
lady who asked a very intelligent 
question about what parents bring to 

439
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,731
their children and and in particular 
were they things that mothers bought to 

440
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:02,111
their children that women do best and 
other things that fathers bring to their

441
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:05,060
children that are best.
You gave a very rousing answer.

442
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,300
The issue of fathering,
and as I say,

443
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:13,301
there were a lot of men there,
I gather that your audience is the 

444
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:15,941
demographics of broadened out now,
but that was a very young man centric 

445
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:17,350
group.
Uh,

446
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,060
and you hammered the importance as I 
heard it.

447
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,380
I'll fathering.

448
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,110
Well,
the,

449
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:26,300
the empirical literature on this is 
absolutely clear.

450
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,140
I mean,
you know,

451
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:31,130
we have this idea that's being pushed 
forward that all families are equal.

452
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,270
So like there's a,
there's a grain of truth in that in that

453
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,070
people who are struggling,
uh,

454
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,170
mightily to raise their children 
properly are,

455
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,330
are worthy of respect whether they are 
single or in couples,

456
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:48,330
but the empirical literature is 
absolutely clear that that stable,

457
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,340
intact father families with fathers,
they're produced children who do way 

458
00:24:53,461 --> 00:24:57,060
better on almost every possible measure 
and even more than that,

459
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,180
that in communities where fathers tend 
to be at home or when you know,

460
00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:05,700
as part of the stable family,
the communities themselves do better.

461
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:08,310
Even those kids that don't have fathers 
at home.

462
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,350
So the role of father there is 
unbelievably important.

463
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:14,820
Then the question is what particular 
role does a father plan?

464
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:19,170
I just had a good conversation with 
Warren Farrell about that and part of,

465
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:24,670
part of my research should indicated 
that men are particularly useful in 

466
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,080
initiating rough and tumble play and 
play with their children in general and 

467
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,230
feral extended that by noting that men 
could use the opportunity to play as a 

468
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:37,260
reward for delaying gratification among 
their children.

469
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,610
That's a really big deal because one of 
the things you have to do to help people

470
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:44,340
matures,
to teach them to delay gratification and

471
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:49,341
to sustain attention and it looks like 
men that the pleasure that children get 

472
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:54,170
in playing with their fathers rough and 
tumble play,

473
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:59,171
but other forms of play as well.
The primary reward that can be used to 

474
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:03,881
help children learn to make the proper 
sacrifices and regulate their impulses 

475
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:04,820
over the longterm.
So,

476
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,420
so,
you know,

477
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,380
and I think fathers now of course 
mothers can do this too,

478
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:11,090
but I think fathers,
um,

479
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,740
are because mothers are generally 
charged with the fundamental care of 

480
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,210
infants.
There's a tension between that and 

481
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:20,940
encouraging children to step forward out
into the world as,

482
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,460
as courageous beings.
And you know,

483
00:26:23,461 --> 00:26:25,650
mothers are very,
very attached to their infants and their

484
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:30,651
infants are very fragile and so often 
hard for them to make the transition 

485
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:34,101
from primary security provider and 
caregiver too forthright,

486
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:39,351
encourager of adventure.
And that's certainly something that 

487
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:42,801
fathers can do,
is it's better to construe life as an 

488
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:46,221
adventure rather than as an enterprise 
that's there to make you feel secure or 

489
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:51,081
happy.
It's a great adventure and a dangerous 

490
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:52,320
one at that because everyone's life is 
at stake in this adventure,

491
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,900
you know,
were unbelievably tough creatures if we,

492
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,910
if we put ourselves out fully.

493
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Okay.
Now you said something very interesting 

494
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,870
and very important than my view.
You talked about empirical evidence in 

495
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,830
relation to the importance of fathering 
empirical evidence,

496
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,070
reason evidenced based decision making 
come thoughtful deliberation rather than

497
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:20,061
emotion and other words.
The difference between thinking and 

498
00:27:20,061 --> 00:27:20,610
feeling seems to me to be incredibly 
important.

499
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:22,830
We should follow the facts the way they 
take us,

500
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,930
but we're confronted.
Bought seems to be.

501
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,970
You mentioned and you said they're not 
related,

502
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:31,971
but we taught them together a sort of a 
cultural Marxism and postmodernism.

503
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:37,011
It seems to me the cultural Marxist will
deliberately distort the truth because 

504
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:38,970
of their agendas or hide the truth 
because of their agendas,

505
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,430
the postmodernists to fallen into this 
trap of if you like,

506
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,570
moral relativity,
so what's good for you is true for you 

507
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,381
and what's good familiar is true for me.
Even if they really painting black is 

508
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:53,250
white and white is black.
Isn't that a problem?

509
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,380
It's worse than that in some sense 
because it's not even.

510
00:27:56,381 --> 00:28:00,580
What's true for you is true for you and 
what's true for me is true for me.

511
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:05,380
It's why it's true for your group is 
only good for your group and what's true

512
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:10,150
for my group is only good for my group,
and so that sets this off often in group

513
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,690
conflict and in tribal sort of way.
You know the,

514
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:14,770
the,
the,

515
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,960
the real radical types who are swallowed
up by this ideology believe that science

516
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:23,720
itself is nothing but a euro centric 
patriarchal construct.

517
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,990
I mean,
they dispense completely with the fact 

518
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,121
that scientific discovery has given us 
this incredible technological power 

519
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:35,861
that's lifted the entire world out of 
abject poverty in a period of about a 

520
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:40,170
hundred and 50 years for that for them,
for some reason that doesn't constitute 

521
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,291
evidence.
And so when you bring up evidence that 

522
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,270
there's hand waving because the people 
who dispute this sort of thing rarely 

523
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,400
know the details of the literature,
they just write it off and say,

524
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:51,410
well,
that whole scientific enterprise,

525
00:28:51,411 --> 00:28:56,411
that's just part of the way that 
eurocentric males dominate and destroy 

526
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:58,550
the planet.
It's all power games for these people.

527
00:28:58,551 --> 00:29:03,551
There's no,
there's no reality at the bottom of it 

528
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:03,890
outside of the power gate.
And so that's uh,

529
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,320
well that,
that to me,

530
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:06,850
that,
that,

531
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,440
that's a,
that's a viewpoint that leads inevitably

532
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:11,980
to tribal conflict.
That's all.

533
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,800
That's what it does.

534
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,330
Now you might be able to help me.
I think it was George Orwell who made a 

535
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,471
reference to an ID being so utterly 
stupid that only a member of the 

536
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:25,521
intelligentsia could believe it.
No sensible person in the street would 

537
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,030
accept it for a moment.
There was a bit of there that night.

538
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,590
I would have thought you actually 
might've comment quite a a.

539
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:35,591
I thought a very astute remark that 
about something that an absolutely 

540
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:38,150
obvious and then you follow finished it 
by saying you would have thought someone

541
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,160
in a university somewhere might've 
noticed now always been an academic at 

542
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,251
any university in Australia.
I would have realized that I needed to 

543
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:49,570
wake up to myself because the audience 
lifted the roof off the place with their

544
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:54,571
applause.
They are highly skeptical about what is 

545
00:29:54,571 --> 00:29:56,140
happening now in our educational 
institutions.

546
00:29:56,141 --> 00:30:01,141
There is no other way to read that 
audience of a thousand decent 

547
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:05,821
Australians.
They are very skeptical about the value 

548
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:07,600
for money we're getting now out of our 
tertiary education sector.

549
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Yeah,
well it's the whole education sector to 

550
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,311
I would say increasingly from 
kindergarten all the way through 

551
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:15,311
university.
Yeah.

552
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:18,701
I think that I'm embarrassed,
increasingly embarrassed to be a member 

553
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:22,001
of the academy because of that.
Like I was reading this book today by a 

554
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,650
Norwegian called progress.
It's really good book.

555
00:30:24,651 --> 00:30:29,651
I would highly recommend it.
Very straightforward and all it is is a 

556
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:32,951
compendium of empirical facts about how 
much better the world has been getting 

557
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:35,780
for the last hundred and 50 years and 
just every possible way,

558
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,020
300,000
people a week or being hooked to the 

559
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,020
Electrical Power Grid,
right?

560
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,660
We,
we've reduced,

561
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,990
we've almost eliminated.
I'm starvation throughout the world 

562
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,351
except for political reasons and 
starvation was a big problem in places 

563
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,640
like Sweden and Italy less than 100 
years ago.

564
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,580
Orland

565
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,610
people are.
People have access to fresh water and 

566
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,520
the fastest growing economies in the 
world are in Subsaharan Africa and we're

567
00:31:01,521 --> 00:31:06,521
just making progress.
Progress on every possible front and 

568
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:09,970
everything that people learn in the 
education system seems to be associated 

569
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,400
with the idea that human beings are a 
cancerous growth on the planet,

570
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,700
that we're going to hell in a handbasket
and that we're going to burn ourselves 

571
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,170
out in the next 50 years and dye and 
it'll be our fault too.

572
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,150
And you know,
it's just not the case.

573
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,740
It's simply not the case.
I mean,

574
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:29,450
we have problems in front of us,
but there's a deep anti human ethos that

575
00:31:29,451 --> 00:31:31,010
permeates that.
And you know,

576
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:34,670
maybe it's still a hangover from our 
pessimism from the Cold War,

577
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,700
you know,
because everyone was truly terrified for

578
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:40,940
about five decades that we were going to
put everything to the torch,

579
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,440
you know,
and maybe we still haven't really 

580
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:46,440
recovered from that and it's not 
surprising because it was brutal.

581
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,970
But reading this book on progress just 
made me think again how badly we're 

582
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,291
educated because people just don't know 
how much things are getting better and 

583
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,010
why free markets are a huge part of it.
Private properties,

584
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,040
a huge part of it.
And that's all associated with the idea 

585
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,280
of the sovereign individual.
And so this really works.

586
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:07,130
I mean,
it's true that Europe got rich first,

587
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,120
but that's only been 100 most at most.
One hundred and 50 years.

588
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,430
Not even that long.
It's really since about 18,

589
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,010
95 and Europe first.
But Man,

590
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:18,110
China,
there's no one's starving in China.

591
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,260
There's no one's starving in India.
Southeast Asia has enough food and 

592
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:27,620
Subsaharan Africa is growing like mad.
And then we have these,

593
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,740
we have these,
we have our education system that 

594
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:32,740
trumpets,
that,

595
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,070
you know,
we live in a patriarchy that we should 

596
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,660
all identify with our tribal groups and 
that the right way of Inter,

597
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,360
of viewing history is victimizer group 
against victim group.

598
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,300
So like it's no wonder people are 
skeptical of that.

599
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:47,480
It's,
it's a profoundly anti western ethos.

600
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,900
And the thing is about the west is we 
got the sovereign individual,

601
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:52,570
right?
It's right.

602
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,670
And it's the responsibility part.
That's right.

603
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:59,671
Not the rights part.
I mean the rights rights are necessary 

604
00:32:59,671 --> 00:33:03,001
but,
but only the rights are there so that 

605
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:04,450
you can express your responsibility.
That's what,

606
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,590
that's the whole point.

607
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,710
Okay,
well let's come to this issue of our own

608
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,190
almost loading now.
Have our own beliefs and values.

609
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,590
I'm here in Australia now.
We're having a,

610
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:21,591
an extraordinary to going on a very 
wealthy and a lockable on us soil 

611
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:27,410
philanthropists.
Cold Pole Ramsay who was very active in 

612
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,800
the hill center,
left a very large amount of money to me,

613
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:33,801
might available to set up a,
an academy for the study of Western 

614
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:38,241
civilization.
And he wanted it to be done in one of 

615
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:38,241
our major universities.
Now,

616
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:41,580
one of our most acclaimed universities 
ended into deep negotiations.

617
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,420
Uh,
then,

618
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:47,421
uh,
the education union got involved and 

619
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:47,421
said,
no,

620
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:47,421
no,
this is going to be terrible.

621
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:49,860
It will be all about European audience 
of European supremacy.

622
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,170
So that same university has sent us for 
Islamic studies for indigenous studies.

623
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,790
They are not particularly autonomous in 
the sense that,

624
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,670
uh,
the university.

625
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,150
Oh,
sorry,

626
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:05,151
they're not particularly controlled.
It seems by the university they do 

627
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:07,941
pretty much their own thing,
but all now you can't have a center for 

628
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:10,791
the study of Western civilization.
It will fill us up with all sorts of 

629
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:13,020
racist ideas,
a supremacist ideas.

630
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,680
This is really worrying if we can 
understand our own past.

631
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:17,820
In fact,
there's a very wise,

632
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:20,820
I Asian said here the other day,
if you wanted them to understand,

633
00:34:20,821 --> 00:34:24,810
I Asian cultures understand you for your
own first.

634
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,650
Well,
it means to me it's just,

635
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,090
first of all,
you know,

636
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,240
in some sense I'm less worried about 
what's happening with the universities 

637
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,260
than I was because I think that they're 
going to destroy themselves completely.

638
00:34:37,261 --> 00:34:42,261
If they continue the way they are and 
that all that's going to happen is that 

639
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:45,501
people will take the genuine value in 
the wisdom of the past and presented an 

640
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:50,000
alternative forms.
We'll just steal it out from underneath 

641
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,340
the universities.
I would say to the philanthropist,

642
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:52,050
if the universities don't want the 
money,

643
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:54,090
then they should set up an institute on 
their own.

644
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,060
That my very well be a good course.
You can go directly to the people now,

645
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,720
you know,
like for now.

646
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:03,100
So for example,
for me,

647
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,210
if I want a lecture now,
I can lecture on anything I want,

648
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,160
whenever I want,
with no bureaucratic restrictions and I 

649
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,440
have an audience of people who are only 
listening because they want to listen.

650
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:23,070
That's where the university is.
The university is where there's an 

651
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,721
audience of people who are only 
listening because they want to be 

652
00:35:25,721 --> 00:35:26,090
educated.
That is the university.

653
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:27,380
The buildings are irrelevant.

654
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:33,390
Let's,
let's build on that from Abbott because 

655
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,141
what's in this debate unfold in 
Australia were listening to academic 

656
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:38,551
signing on.
I know we've got to preserve our 

657
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:38,551
academic integrity.
Uh,

658
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:42,800
and we've,
we're here to protect our policies of 

659
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,280
diversity and inclusiveness,
uh,

660
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:49,281
and all of those sorts of things.
And somebody topic pointed out actually 

661
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,570
we thought they were there to teach our 
young people how to think for themselves

662
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:52,050
primarily

663
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,140
that isn't what they're there for 
because that's predicated on the idea 

664
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,191
that there are sovereign individuals and
that they can actually think for 

665
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,931
themselves as individuals.
The whole idea here is that you're not 

666
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:04,690
an individual,
you're the member of a group.

667
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,420
That's it.
And they're serious about this.

668
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:10,930
This isn't a trivial objection,
it's a fundamental objection.

669
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,580
But I would also say,
look,

670
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:16,630
there's a new testament statement,
don't cast pearls before swine.

671
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,550
And you know,
that usually has to do with words,

672
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:25,100
right?
Don't waste words of wisdom and those 

673
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,621
who will not here,
but you can also just look at it 

674
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:30,111
literally.
If you have pearls and you're trying to 

675
00:36:30,111 --> 00:36:31,440
give them to someone and they won't take
them,

676
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,310
then go find someone else to give the 
pearls to.

677
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:39,610
If you're trying to give money to a 
university to do something great and 

678
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:43,411
they won't take it,
it's obvious that they don't want to do 

679
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:44,200
anything great,
so don't give them the money.

680
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,520
It's the wrong people.

681
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:47,670
Okay,
well,

682
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:50,430
let's tease this out a little bit more 
wisdom.

683
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,640
You've mentioned the difference between 
if you like knowledge and accumulated 

684
00:36:57,361 --> 00:37:01,470
cleverness and what have you,
and wisdom.

685
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,640
Surely there's a difference because to 
go back again to Chatswood,

686
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,020
I would say a good chunk of the people 
there were not university educated,

687
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:13,740
but they were smart and I would say like
odd side more.

688
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:14,730
They will wise.

689
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,050
They were striving for wisdom and that's
where wisdom is.

690
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:22,240
Wisdom is in the striving for wisdom and
wisdom is really act.

691
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:28,290
Wisdom isn't a collection of facts.
Wisdom is knowledge of how to conduct 

692
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,200
yourself in the world.
So it's a.

693
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,750
it's an action.
It's an existential issue.

694
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:32,630
It's,
it's,

695
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,810
it's truth.
As revealed in action.

696
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,890
That's wisdom.

697
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,760
Where's the most,
how understands consequences?

698
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,320
Well,
it's in.

699
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,950
It's sophisticated in its understanding 
of consequences because you think,

700
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:46,870
well,
what are the consequences?

701
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,400
And the answer is,
well,

702
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:53,610
there's the consequences for you now and
for you next week and next month and 

703
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:58,621
five years from now,
so the consequences are you and future 

704
00:37:58,621 --> 00:37:59,500
you,
so that's an iterated game,

705
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:04,890
but the consequences are also for your 
family now and in the future and for 

706
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,910
your community now and in the future.
And wisdom is the ability to consider 

707
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,350
all of those consequences as part of 
your,

708
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,120
as part of what guides your vision and 
your and your and your operations in the

709
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:18,370
world.
And that's character.

710
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,660
And then nobility of character is to 
take all of those things into account.

711
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:23,560
Simultaneously.

712
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,920
As I watched the debate,
I thought it to some extent,

713
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:27,820
one of the problems you've got here see 
us Louis.

714
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:30,360
Mater of a pointed out,
is pride,

715
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:35,870
pride,
getting in the way of people having 

716
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,121
sufficient humility to recognize that 
the nonsense say paddling is simply 

717
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:41,710
unconvincing in terms of what you might 
call the pub test.

718
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,980
What would pass the pub test out there 
where people have common sense and can 

719
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,030
see when people are being real and when 
they're not being real?

720
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,500
Well,
it's easy to dispense with that.

721
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:56,501
You just develop sufficient contempt for
the common person and then you don't 

722
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:00,731
have to worry about what they think and 
that's and that's when you confuse being

723
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:04,310
smart with being wise and they're not 
the same thing.

724
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,920
I don't think there's any relationship 
between them.

725
00:39:06,921 --> 00:39:09,650
In fact,
I mean intelligence is a great gift,

726
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:14,651
but it can go terribly wrong and it can 
certainly turned into a kind of 

727
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:15,170
intellectual arrogance,
that's for sure.

728
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:20,120
That blinds you to do your own ignorance
and humility is the antidote to that and

729
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:20,750
the,
the,

730
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,960
the,
the humility of the element of humility 

731
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,051
there that's necessary is to understand 
that what you don't know is more 

732
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:30,740
important than what you know.
And so if you're an India log,

733
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,860
you,
you dispense with all that because you 

734
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:35,860
already know everything.

735
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,740
I was gonna say,
I was reminded of that front I chatswood

736
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:39,120
has,
as you've probably gathered,

737
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,840
it had a big impact on man.
It was a powerful reminder to me that 

738
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,310
familiar.
It seems very important to recognize 

739
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:49,310
that there's a sense in which the more 
you learn,

740
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,661
the more you realize you don't know him 
very much and there's a lot more to 

741
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:53,661
learn.

742
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:53,850
Yeah.
Well,

743
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:54,720
in north,
you know,

744
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,210
being with an audience can help with 
that too because if you're,

745
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:03,211
if you're talking to an audience,
you can check to see if your message is 

746
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:03,211
being received.
You know,

747
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:07,881
when you might say,
well these people just can't understand 

748
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:07,881
what I have to say.
It's like,

749
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:08,580
well yeah,
they probably can if you,

750
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,880
if you formulated it carefully and you 
actually talked to them.

751
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:16,881
Individual individual,
which is what I try to do in my 

752
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:16,881
lectures.
Like I'm not talking to the mob,

753
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:21,440
I'm not talking to the group.
I never talked to the group when I'm 

754
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:21,540
lecturing.
I always pick people in the audience and

755
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:24,420
speak right to them and they reflect the
audit.

756
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:29,421
You know,
they reflect the entire group but they 

757
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:30,480
only reflect it because the group is 
made up of individuals like them.

758
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:36,590
So let's just go back to something you 
said earlier that it struck me as very 

759
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:36,870
interesting,
and that is that young people don't want

760
00:40:36,871 --> 00:40:40,320
to be involved in political activism.
I want to get himself sorted out first.

761
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,980
Many of those young people,
uh,

762
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,300
I think one of behave nobly and help 
build a better society,

763
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:50,301
a strongest civic square,
if I can put it that way and good on 

764
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:50,301
them.
That's terrific.

765
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:53,550
That's important.
They're very disillusioned with politics

766
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,880
and yet we have to govern our country.
We have to make certain that the rules 

767
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:58,880
are set,
if you like,

768
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,530
uh,
and that we maximize everybody's 

769
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,021
opportunities to live in freedom and 
insecurity when young people have,

770
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,390
if you like,
grounded themselves and feel ready to 

771
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:11,390
act,
nobody in the public square,

772
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,490
what should they do?
How can they make a difference?

773
00:41:14,491 --> 00:41:16,320
They want to make a difference.
How do I go about it?

774
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,980
Oh,
more more power to them I think.

775
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:19,970
But I think you know,
they,

776
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:24,660
they start by realizing they don't know 
anything and by starting to learn and if

777
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,050
they learn and work and disciplined 
themselves,

778
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:32,320
the opportunities to expand will come 
naturally because people will notice 

779
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:32,510
them.
Like,

780
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:34,220
look,
if you with competent people,

781
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:39,221
hyper competent people,
one of the things you learn is that 

782
00:41:39,221 --> 00:41:40,220
hyper competent people are always 
looking for young people to mentor.

783
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:40,980
Yeah,

784
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,700
starving and hoping that someone will 
come along who,

785
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,940
who has a lot of potential and then what
they'll do is offer them a and 

786
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,571
opportunity.
I keep my eye out at the university and 

787
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:56,430
in my private work as well all the time 
for young people who've got something to

788
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,150
contribute,
to say,

789
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:58,530
oh,
you look like you're sharp.

790
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,960
That's find out,
here's a task.

791
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:06,350
Why don't you go try this?
Then they come back and knock it out of 

792
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:06,350
the park and you think,
oh,

793
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,670
that's good because I got 20 more things
here that need doing that I can't do.

794
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,340
I've got more opportunities that I know 
what to do with.

795
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,460
Here's another one.
And so the thing is is that if you 

796
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,161
develop your confidence and you 
discipline yourself and you start to 

797
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,440
make that manifest in any hierarchy 
that's even vaguely competent,

798
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,690
you'll have more opportunities come your
way,

799
00:42:24,691 --> 00:42:28,980
then you'll know what to do with it.
It all happened organically.

800
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,510
So and it,
it,

801
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,100
it,
it is the way of the world,

802
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:37,101
and well,
if that isn't happening in the 

803
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:39,321
organization that you're working with 
and you're working diligently and you 

804
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:42,861
have your art together,
then it's time to find a different 

805
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:42,861
organization.
But generally speaking,

806
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:45,540
most organizations aren't that corrupt.
Some are

807
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,090
interesting,
I'd say that Australia is.

808
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,060
We worship youth culture and why,
but one of the things I've noticed about

809
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:58,061
youth is that overwhelmingly,
if I have the opportunity to tap into 

810
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:01,880
the wisdom of an older person to be 
mentored,

811
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,280
they go looking for it.
They're very keen for it.

812
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:10,630
Well,
it's part of the part of the human 

813
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,540
proclivity to admire and imitate.
You know what I mean?

814
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,680
One of the things that draws us forward,
we don't only learn by facts,

815
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,960
in fact,
we hardly learned by facts and all.

816
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,280
We learn by stories.
And we learn by invitation and we,

817
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,390
they imitate those we admire and we 
admire those who are competent.

818
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,870
And so if you find someone who knows 
what you don't and can operate 

819
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:32,840
effectively in the world in a manner 
that you would like to,

820
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:35,150
but town,
then you're going to admire them.

821
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:40,151
And if you admire them,
you're going to open the door to have 

822
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:40,151
them mentor you.
And I mean,

823
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:44,740
that's,
that's really fundamental to human 

824
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:44,740
cognition and human psychological 
development.

825
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,430
It's the catalyst for human development 
because we're deeply imitative.

826
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:55,030
It's,
it's the thing that distinguishes us 

827
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,891
from other creatures,
perhaps even more than even more 

828
00:43:56,891 --> 00:43:57,220
fundamentally than language use.
If I watch you,

829
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,750
if you know how to do something and I 
watch you do it,

830
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:05,050
I can learn to do it without having to 
go through all the pain that you had to 

831
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,500
go through to learn it.
It's such a gift.

832
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,840
That's why history is so important.
Our personal history,

833
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,900
uh,
if you locked out family history.

834
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:17,901
I was thinking the other day that my 
grandfather made a mistake with my 

835
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:20,310
father on the farm that I'm determined 
because I can learn from that,

836
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,010
not to repeat with my own son on the 
farm.

837
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:28,570
Um,
and then there's of course the broader 

838
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:28,570
cultural history,
which is why I believe,

839
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,690
and I think you're,
when you're not share this view,

840
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,720
we to learn from our history,
we ought to learn from the horrors of 

841
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,560
collectivism in Soviet Russia.
We ought to be honest about it.

842
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:39,930
We should teach our young people at the 
same time,

843
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,560
as we're honest about the watson,
our own cultural history,

844
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,710
but we're also honest about the 
nobility.

845
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,960
For example,
the mighty pushed to abolish slavery.

846
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,180
Surely the greatest human rights 
movement of all time.

847
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,920
We ought to know about it.
It's noble.

848
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:56,880
It was led by noble people who've 
struggled against extraordinary odds for

849
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:57,750
a long time.

850
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,030
Yes,
exactly.

851
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:01,350
And in slavery was a human universal.
So it's an,

852
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,800
it's an amazing,
miraculous attainment.

853
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,530
It's miraculous attainment.
Absolutely.

854
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,980
And you know,
what we're supposed to be doing in new 

855
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:11,980
universities is separating the wheat 
from the chaff,

856
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:17,080
not dispensing with everything.
As if it's because we don't want to put 

857
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,790
in the effort to discriminate and so 
it's easier.

858
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,140
Well,
it's just all corrupt.

859
00:45:21,141 --> 00:45:21,680
It's like,
no,

860
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:26,681
it's not.
People aren't starving to death anymore 

861
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:29,560
and societies are increasingly free and 
children are dying in the massive 

862
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,400
numbers that they want to start in and 
people are.

863
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,510
People's life expectancy has doubled.
Like things are going pretty well.

864
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:40,310
Don't mock it up and we need to figure 
out why and we need to take stock of the

865
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:43,250
things that we didn't pass that were 
wrong obviously,

866
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:47,020
but that doesn't mean that everything 
everyone did in the past was wronged.

867
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,060
That stuff.
That's not thinking,

868
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:55,270
that's just,
that's just reflexive resentment 

869
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,910
masquerading as intellectual 
superiority.

870
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,640
There's nothing about it.
That's good.

871
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Well,
you've been incredibly generous with 

872
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:04,720
your time.
Can we wrap up,

873
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,420
let's just think through what would we 
say in terms of people looking for 

874
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:07,950
solutions,
uh,

875
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:13,150
in academia and the media in politics.
How do we,

876
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:18,820
if you like,
stop the movement to reclaim what you 

877
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:23,351
called evidence based empirical decision
evidenced in decision making.

878
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:27,160
In other words,
learn to think again and stop being so,

879
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,320
so emotional.
There's a place for emotion,

880
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,880
but there's a place for thinking.

881
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,580
I think.
Well,

882
00:46:33,581 --> 00:46:37,030
I mean if you're a university student,
the first thing you want to note is that

883
00:46:37,031 --> 00:46:41,380
you're there to learn,
to think and to write and to read and to

884
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:46,381
speak.
That's what you're there to do and the 

885
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:48,481
reason you're there to do that is 
because that makes you incredibly 

886
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:51,421
competent because you're going to have 
to communicate with people for the rest 

887
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:54,400
of your life and if your communication 
that has the depth and clarity,

888
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,640
then you can see your way forward and 
you can bring other people aboard and 

889
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,430
you can do great things and so it's 
super.

890
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:05,820
It's super useful to get a real liberal 
arts education because it can make you 

891
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:11,820
into a great communicator and thinker.
If you're going to university,

892
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:16,860
read the great books and you'll continue
confined professors who will teach you 

893
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:17,200
that,
but that's what you're there to do.

894
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,200
You're there to spend four years 
immersing yourself in the imitation of 

895
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,380
the greatest people that our culture has
produced,

896
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:24,940
and if you think,
well,

897
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:29,941
there were no great people,
well then you might as well not through 

898
00:47:29,941 --> 00:47:32,881
the university because university is the
storehouse of the thoughts of great 

899
00:47:32,881 --> 00:47:37,561
people.
Then if you dispense with the whole 

900
00:47:37,561 --> 00:47:37,561
notion,
notion of great,

901
00:47:37,561 --> 00:47:39,010
then maybe you're there to become a 
political activist,

902
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:44,011
but that's not university.
That's something else that's like an 

903
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:45,340
ideological cult and maybe that's what 
you want.

904
00:47:45,341 --> 00:47:45,730
And,
and,

905
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:50,410
and I mean you'll,
you'll pay the price for that one way or

906
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:54,730
the other,
but even as a university student,

907
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:58,030
you have to take on the burden of 
educating yourself to a large degree,

908
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:03,031
but you have to decide that that's what 
you want and that that's what you need 

909
00:48:03,031 --> 00:48:06,960
in terms of your own personal life.
I have a program that I developed with 

910
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,160
my colleagues called the future 
authoring program.

911
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,900
It's a self authoring Dotcom and it 
helps people develop a vision for their 

912
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,430
life along about six fundamental 
dimensions,

913
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,300
family education,
mental and physical health,

914
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:27,010
career avoidance of temptation like drug
and alcohol use.

915
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,250
Um,
we tried to parse out a use of time,

916
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,130
you productive and meaningful use of 
time outside of work.

917
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:38,550
We tried to parameterize a decent life 
and then to guide people through the 

918
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,811
process of imagining what their life 
could be like if they put it together 

919
00:48:42,811 --> 00:48:46,321
properly and you need to develop a 
vision for your life and a sense of who 

920
00:48:46,321 --> 00:48:48,420
you could be if you were the character 
that you could be and,

921
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,580
and thinking through that and 
articulating it is actually part of,

922
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:55,630
it shouldn't be part of a classic 
liberal arts education because the whole

923
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:58,660
point of education apart from the 
technical end,

924
00:48:58,661 --> 00:49:01,990
which is important,
is to produce a noble citizen.

925
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,500
That's the point,
not to produce a bloody political 

926
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:07,500
activists.

927
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,380
Well,
let me just,

928
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:13,410
we should keep in mind though,
because even the chatswood that not a 

929
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,600
lot of those people,
most of them are not at university,

930
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,230
so they're not excluded either from in 
any way,

931
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:21,450
shape or form from broadening their 
horizon.

932
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,810
It's not like they're not doing 
important things like working men,

933
00:49:24,811 --> 00:49:26,880
for example,
working people in general.

934
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:32,270
I don't care what they're doing.
If they're working at a diner as a 

935
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,791
waiter or they're they're.
They're laying bricks or working a 

936
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:36,430
forklift or they're plumbers or these 
people are bloody important.

937
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:41,431
They build the infrastructure and 
there's a huge difference between a 

938
00:49:41,431 --> 00:49:45,540
craftsman who takes pride in caring what
he's doing and contributes to his family

939
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:50,500
and the community in that nobility of 
work and someone who does a slipshod and

940
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,130
haphazard job.
There's great nobility and genuine work.

941
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:59,020
So and I believe that you have just as 
much power,

942
00:49:59,021 --> 00:50:00,850
let's say,
much as much authority,

943
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:06,030
as much clout as a forthright and honest
working person as you do as an 

944
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:10,540
intellectual and I mean you can be very 
successful as a working person if you.

945
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,840
If you're diligent and honest and 
committed and competent and aiming up 

946
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:20,910
because it looked.
I do believe that each person is the 

947
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:22,300
center of the world and you have what 
you need right at that center,

948
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,750
and maybe you're not intellectual,
but you're good with your hands and your

949
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:28,550
practical and solid and people can rely 
on you.

950
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:29,480
It's like,
man,

951
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:34,810
that's a big deal because then when 
their roof blows off in the middle of a 

952
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:35,930
storm,
they can call you up and you're there in

953
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:38,000
an hour and you put the damn thing back 
together and,

954
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,740
and,
and Hooray for.

955
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:43,130
You said,
all of these things are important.

956
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,780
And so there's great nobility and in 
working class work as far as I'm 

957
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:48,780
concerned.

958
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:49,660
Well,
Jordan,

959
00:50:49,661 --> 00:50:50,760
that's a,
again,

960
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:53,690
a fascinating conversation from my 
perspective and uh,

961
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:59,010
uh,
it's tremendous to be able to interact 

962
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,251
with somebody who,
who cares passionately because that's 

963
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:01,251
what,
that's what they're picking up.

964
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:05,750
I know it's not about you.
You're actually trying to make a 

965
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:05,750
difference for people.
And you know,

966
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,820
we're seeing this unready disturbed by 
the way in which some of these movements

967
00:51:08,821 --> 00:51:11,130
were seeing at the moment of trying to 
divide men from women.

968
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:16,670
And a lot of people getting men are 
getting this idea that somehow their 

969
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:17,970
masculinity is toxic.
Uh,

970
00:51:17,971 --> 00:51:18,970
well,
you know,

971
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:23,990
we don't say that when the brave young 
French policeman takes a bullet for a 

972
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,340
young woman and her daughter in a French
supermarket,

973
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,290
we celebrate that.
And I actually think that not all,

974
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,830
but the great majority of men want to be
noble.

975
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,630
They know their floors as you said.
They've got to be honest about them.

976
00:51:39,631 --> 00:51:44,631
We all know to be honest,
but they also have a big part of them 

977
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:46,440
maybe like that divine spike.
So to speak,

978
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:51,650
divine spark that leads them to want to 
be responsible.

979
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,130
Noble people.

980
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,370
Yes.
And that's,

981
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:59,390
that's what women want from men too.
So unless they've been damaged in their 

982
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,290
relationship so that they don't trust 
men at all.

983
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:03,900
And then ours are prepared to dispense 
with all of them,

984
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,510
which is helpful.
But you know,

985
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:11,511
men and women need to call to the 
nobility in each other and that is what 

986
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:13,410
they both want.
Because you want a stalwart companion by

987
00:52:13,411 --> 00:52:15,590
your side.
You're a man.

988
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:20,591
You want someone you can trust and who 
you can rely on to help guide you and 

989
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:23,580
and and care for you and to care for 
your children and all of that,

990
00:52:23,581 --> 00:52:25,760
and to make a life with if you're a 
woman,

991
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:28,630
you want a man that you can rely on and 
that's going to help you,

992
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,940
help you deal with the children and with
the excess fragility that you have 

993
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,870
because of your pronounced roll and 
record production,

994
00:52:34,871 --> 00:52:39,560
and that is what we want and to 
denigrate and to split men and women.

995
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,560
A part is,
is too damaged humanity itself because 

996
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,680
it's not like we're all men or all 
women.

997
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:51,040
I have sisters and a mother and a white 
and women have husbands and sons and 

998
00:52:52,071 --> 00:52:56,150
fathers were not separate and I'm just 
split us apart on,

999
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,120
on the basis of sex is well,
it's,

1000
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,240
it's,
it's,

1001
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,280
it's this pathological as a suicidal 
impulse or a murderous impulse or a 

1002
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:07,610
genocidal impulses.
None of that's good.

1003
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:12,640
It's not acceptable,
but we're a hell of a lot better off 

1004
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,490
than we were and things are getting 
better and we can do better yet.

1005
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,290
That's a way better story.

1006
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,310
We'll look forward very much to having 
you back on these shores.

1007
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,820
Very nice speaking with you again and 
thank you very much for the opportunity.

1008
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:23,590
Thanks so much.
