1
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,110
I have the distinct pleasure today of 
being able to sit down and talk to Dr 

2
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,740
Steven Pinker,
Harvard University,

3
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:25,070
who's just written a new book,
many.

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,870
He's written many books,
but this is the newest one.

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,620
It's called enlightenment now and it's a
New York Times best seller for seven 

6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,451
weeks,
so that was a great accomplishment and 

7
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:40,350
darker pinker has indicated to me that 
it's doing,

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,300
it's,
it's,

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,440
it's,
it's doing better than his other books 

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:46,650
have and and that.
And they've also done very well.

11
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:51,651
So that's really something.
So Steven Pinker is the Harvard College 

12
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,920
professor of psychology at Harvard 
University.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,700
He's a two time Pulitzer prize finalist 
and the winner of many awards for his 

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,811
research teaching and books.
He's been named one of Time's 100 most 

15
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:05,880
influential people and one of foreign 
policies,

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,030
100 leading global fakers.
His books include the stuff of thought,

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,880
the better angels of our nature,
the blank slate and the sense of style.

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,540
And so I'm welcoming Dr Baker obviously,
and I'd like him to start telling us to 

19
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,410
start by telling us about the book 
itself and then we'll talk about broader

20
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,750
issues and about the other books he's 
written and that sort of thing.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,680
Well,
the book's subtitle is the case or 

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,400
reasons science humanism and progress at
all.

23
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:44,401
I'll begin with,
with the progress because that was the 

24
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,370
epiphany that more than anything 
inspired the book.

25
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,730
I'd been in a previous book,
the better angels of our nature when I 

26
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,560
was surprised to come across data sets 
showing that many measures of violence.

27
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:58,510
It declined over the course of history.
I was stunned to see a graph that showed

28
00:01:58,511 --> 00:02:03,511
the rates of homicide from England and 
other western European countries from 

29
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:08,160
the 13 hundreds to the 20th century,
showing a decline of anywhere from 35 to

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,910
50 in the chances of getting murdered.
Uh,

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,170
when I,
uh,

32
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,680
called attention to this factor and a 
blog post,

33
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:20,920
I didn't got correspondence from 
historians,

34
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,160
from international relations scholars,
from sociologists say,

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,110
you know,
you could have mentioned other declines,

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,240
another decline of violence.
And War scholar showed that the greater 

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,710
depth of war had plummeted.

38
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,850
Another showed me the rates of domestic 
violence have gone down,

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,140
still another that rates of child abuse 
had gone down.

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,310
And I realized that this was an 
important story here that was a,

41
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,350
that it had to be told that these 
different declines of violence ought to 

42
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,330
be presented to the world in between a 
single pair of covers,

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,750
uh,
just because it didn't seem to be 

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,461
something of a pattern.
And as a psychologist it opened up the 

45
00:02:59,461 --> 00:02:59,461
challenge of how to explain it.
First of all,

46
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:01,280
how to explain the,
uh,

47
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,350
the fact that there's been,
that there is so much violence in human 

48
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:06,940
affairs,
but also the fact that it can be brought

49
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:07,640
down.
Oh,

50
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,660
I had a similar set of epiphanies that 
led to the writing of enlightenment.

51
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:13,780
Now,
when after better angels was published,

52
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,150
um,
I started to come across data showing 

53
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,150
that other aspects of human wellbeing 
had improved.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,480
The rate of extreme poverty had 
plummeted by about 50 percent just in 

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,920
three decades.
And now stands at less than 10 percent.

56
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,370
Life expectancy has been increasing all 
over the world,

57
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,740
including the poorest parts of the 
world.

58
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Uh,
the number of kids going to school has 

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,320
increased,
including girls,

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,880
more than 90 percent of people under the
age of 25 on,

61
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,410
on the planet are literate now.
We have more leisure time.

62
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,670
We're safer,
uh,

63
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,430
in measure after measure life has been 
getting better.

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,520
And it's not the kind of development 
that you could learn about reading the 

65
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:58,591
papers.
Quite the contrary because journalism 

66
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:00,490
covers what goes wrong,
not what goes right.

67
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,610
You could easily come away with the 
impression that the world was getting 

68
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,780
worse and worse as a kind of statistical
illusion of a feeding,

69
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,730
a cognitive bias and not realize until 
you look at data sets,

70
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,460
how many ways in which life has 
improved,

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,390
including measures like war and crime,
uh,

72
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:23,391
which would,
what my guests are going in the wrong 

73
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:23,920
direction as opposed to the right 
direction.

74
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,250
And I combined that.
The other motivation for the book was a 

75
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,370
set of attacks on the application of 
science to the traditional domains of 

76
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,270
the humanities,
to,

77
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,670
to history,
to the arts,

78
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,150
to morality,
to language.

79
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,470
Uh,
a,

80
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:46,471
uh,
an effort that I think is quite a 

81
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:46,471
celebrity is the fact that,
that,

82
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:50,730
that scientific insights that are being 
brought to bear on a Cuban affairs and 

83
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,020
how could they not give him the,
uh,

84
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,390
art and society or are in a sense 
products of our,

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,080
our psychology products of human nature.
But in a lot of intellectual life,

86
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:07,081
there's bitter resentment to any 
application of scientific ideas or the 

87
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,510
scientific mindset to human affairs.
This was first noted by CP snow in this 

88
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,400
famous lectures and cultures in the 
early,

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,530
late 50,
[inaudible] early 19 sixties.

90
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,250
But the conflict was very much with us.
I wrote an essay called science is not 

91
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,141
your enemy,
which were published in the new 

92
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:28,141
Republican,
which went viral.

93
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:31,960
And that was the immediate,
a kickoff for the proposal that ended up

94
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,190
leaving and enlightenment.
Now,

95
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,470
uh,
I was involved in something of a 

96
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:38,470
literary spat with,
uh,

97
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,230
with Leon wieseltier and editor at the 
new republic.

98
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:42,960
But I quickly realized that,
uh,

99
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,340
two guys having an argument is not 
enough to,

100
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,560
to,
to pump out a book.

101
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,540
And so I had the centerpiece of the 
book,

102
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,810
just be the documentation of a fact that
most people are unaware of,

103
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,670
namely that in most measures,
life has gotten better over time.

104
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,580
Now,
as with the better angels of our nature,

105
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:05,010
I didn't want to just present a bunch of
grants,

106
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:10,011
although I did present many graphs,
but I wanted to explain them and it 

107
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,410
seemed to me that if we,
if there was any overarching explanation

108
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,030
as to wildlife,
get got better.

109
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:15,450
It's that people,
uh,

110
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,710
in the past thought that by 
understanding how the world works,

111
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,360
including ourselves,
uh,

112
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,540
we can try to solve problems,
remember what works a drop,

113
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,680
drop the failures.
And as we accumulate are our cultural 

114
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:30,680
knowledge,
uh,

115
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,200
we can improve our wellbeing.
And I attribute that mindset to the 

116
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,930
light and the idea that we can use 
knowledge to improve human wellbeing.

117
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,290
Now that might sound almost too banal 
and that tribe to be worth defending.

118
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,510
And so I thought that those ideals very 
much needed a defense.

119
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,210
Yeah.
Okay.

120
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,430
So you're waiting a number of things 
together.

121
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:58,431
So the first is your discovery that if 
you look at the data that things are 

122
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:04,701
getting better at a rate that's so 
remarkable that it is really nothing 

123
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:08,841
short of miraculous and you've produced 
dozens of graphs showing that in 

124
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,910
enlightenment.
Now I noticed the same thing about three

125
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:15,930
years ago when I was working for UN 
panel on economic sustainability,

126
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,230
the for the,
for the secretary general,

127
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,900
the original narrative was extremely 
pessimistic,

128
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,020
detailed how we were disappointing the 
planet and how everything was getting 

129
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,060
worse and how we are at,
uh,

130
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,120
at each other's throats.
And I started to read extremely widely 

131
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,291
and I found that on measure after 
measure with some notable exceptions 

132
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:40,671
like oceanic oceanic overfishing,
we have been doing so staggeringly much 

133
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:46,230
better in the last 150 years that you 
can't believe it on almost every,

134
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,690
on almost every measure you can imagine,
which is exactly what you detail out and

135
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,550
enlightenment now.

136
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,050
And,
and then now that that's a secret,

137
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,320
let's say people don't know about it and
the,

138
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,380
and that's strange.
And then you also associated with a 

139
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:02,560
critique of the,
of,

140
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,920
of the enlightenment and scientific 
rationality.

141
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:09,921
And it seems to me that you're implying,
or perhaps you're stating explicitly 

142
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:14,271
that you're stating explicitly that 
there's a connection between the 

143
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:19,851
pessimism and the lack of knowledge 
about this and the critique of the 

144
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:23,400
enlightenment and rationality.
Because there's a question here.

145
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:28,401
If things are getting so much better and
if the news is overwhelming on that 

146
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:32,271
front,
I mean some of the things you outlined 

147
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:32,271
are like the weather,
the decrease,

148
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:37,230
decreases and starvation,
I suppose the most remarkable and the 

149
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,880
provision of bountiful food on less and 
less farmland,

150
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,990
which is not something that people know.
It's like if all this is happening,

151
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,530
why don't we know about it?
And how is it linked to the.

152
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,370
How do you think if,
if it all is linked to the critique of,

153
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,910
of enlightenment rationality,

154
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,480
what are the reasons is an interaction 
between the nature of journalism and the

155
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:01,080
nature of cognition?
Namely the news is about what happens,

156
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,360
not what hasn't happened.
And a lot of the.

157
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,310
A very beneficial developments consists 
of things that don't happen.

158
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Countries that are at peace,
that used to be kids who are not 

159
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,530
starving.
I'm a kid,

160
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,750
a terrorist attacks that do not have it.
You never see a journalist saying,

161
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:21,690
I'm reporting live from a country that's
been at peace for 40 years.

162
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,720
But if a war breaks out,
you can be sure that we'll hear about it

163
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,070
all.
The more so now that,

164
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,280
that a majority of humanity consists of 
a,

165
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,710
on the spot video.
Journalists,

166
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,590
thanks to smartphones,
uh,

167
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,820
also a bad things can happen quickly.
Things can blow up,

168
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,800
worse can start a massacre,
can happen,

169
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,510
but good things aren't built in a day.

170
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,140
And they often consist of incremental 
improvements,

171
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,680
but few percentage points a year that 
the compound that,

172
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,890
that accumulate,
but that can never make the news because

173
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,820
they never happened all of a sudden on a
Thursday in October.

174
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,410
But together with all the,
the,

175
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,600
um,
cognitive impediments to understanding 

176
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,291
the state of the world,
the fact that news reports a memorable 

177
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:06,291
events.
And we know,

178
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:11,340
uh,
from these study of the cognition of 

179
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,730
risk and probability from Daniel 
Kahneman and Amos Tversky,

180
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,060
that we tend to assess probability and 
risk by a shortcut called the 

181
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,420
availability heuristic.
Namely,

182
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,620
the easier it is to I dredge up an 
example from memory,

183
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,750
the more likely we think something is.
And so people think that a tornado's 

184
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,710
killed a lot of people,
but they don't realize that falling off 

185
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,210
ladders kills far more people.
I just.

186
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,420
Because when someone falls off a ladder,
it doesn't make the news,

187
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,190
but when there is a tornado it guys.

188
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,370
Yeah.
Do you know the solar power kills more 

189
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:43,370
people?
The nuclear power every year.

190
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,340
I did not know that,
but it doesn't surprise me because 

191
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,860
nuclear power kills no one.
And I suppose as installers,

192
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,890
fall off routes is full approves for 
example.

193
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,820
Yeah,
exactly.

194
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,820
And well,
so,

195
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,830
so that's interesting.
So you can imagine that.

196
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,420
So good news or bad news is sudden it's 
dramatic.

197
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,780
We're,
we're tilted towards the processing of 

198
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:08,780
negative information in any case.

199
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,740
That's right.
And we don't naturally computer ratio 

200
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:13,740
between,
uh,

201
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,171
occurrences and not occurrences,
which is of course what goes into a 

202
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:21,730
probability and a rational assessment of
risk and probability.

203
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,670
So there's that,
that it's,

204
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:28,671
it's more than that in that because 
intellectual life in large parts of 

205
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:33,040
academia in a commentary caters and 
pundits,

206
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,430
there is an ideology of a,
of decline goes back to the 19th 

207
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:43,171
century,
a part of the counter of light that 

208
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,110
arose in a,
as a reaction to enlightenment,

209
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:47,600
hope score for progress of rationality 
that said that the,

210
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,710
that the holes that society is Western 
civilization is teetering on the brink 

211
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,380
or it's circling,
circling the drain and it's going to 

212
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:58,480
collapse any,
any time now.

213
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,340
And it's up to the intellectuals and 
commentators and,

214
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,150
uh,
to,

215
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,260
to,
uh,

216
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,740
point out how beckon into degenerate 
society is.

217
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,470
And to people like that musical progress
comes also sit in a front.

218
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,600
The reaction is,
hey,

219
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:21,601
we've been,
we've been warning all of you about how 

220
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:22,470
society is on the verge of collapse.
Don't come around and tell us that,

221
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,600
but everything's going fine.
What are,

222
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:25,570
what are we going to do now

223
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,630
with the romantic types like Russo?
And when I was reading,

224
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,880
I,
I wonder to the,

225
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,050
there's a,
there's a powerful Marxist narrative 

226
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,850
that's run its course for about 130 
years too,

227
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:44,851
that's predicated on the idea that there
is an oppressed class and the no 

228
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:49,801
pressure class and that narrative seems 
also to thrive on or to be affronted by 

229
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:56,311
the idea that the current,
the current system might be producing 

230
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:58,540
benefits across the board.
I think you do in fact,

231
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:03,541
in one part of the book ask about 
whether or not these benefits are only 

232
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:03,541
accruing,
for example,

233
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:08,191
to the rich.
And that doesn't seem to be the case as 

234
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:08,970
far as,
as far as the data indicates,

235
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,090
is that a fair,

236
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,810
quite the contrary.
The most dramatic improvements have been

237
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:15,330
at the,
at the bottom of the machinery,

238
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,560
uh,
extreme poor where,

239
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,260
uh,
the proportion of the world's population

240
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:25,261
living in extreme poverty,
Scala and over the last couple of 

241
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:26,860
centuries from probably about 90 percent
to less than 10 percent.

242
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,460
And the United Nations has set as one of
its millennia,

243
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,450
elegant goals to eliminate extreme 
poverty everywhere by the year 20,

244
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,240
30.
That's probably too optimistic.

245
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,030
But the fact that it can be set as a,
uh,

246
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,210
as a,
as a plausible aspiration is itself a 

247
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:45,210
Scottish.

248
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,720
Well,
I know the UN had said as one of its 

249
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,790
millennial goals,
the having of absolute poverty between 

250
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,140
2000 and 2015 and that was accomplished 
by 2012.

251
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,600
Exactly.
Ahead of schedule.

252
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,700
Yes,
exactly.

253
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,380
Has a complicated relationship to 
progress because Marxist doctrine 

254
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,180
actually does a layout,
a pathway to progress.

255
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:12,181
Unfortunately,
that pathway consists of violet class 

256
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:12,181
conflict.
Uh,

257
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,990
it isn't the light and the ideal of 
progress through,

258
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,290
uh,
through problem solving from the pro se 

259
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,700
a,
a belief that a nature throws problems 

260
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,081
at us and that if we apply brain power,
we can gradually chip away at them of 

261
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,170
progress.
Is,

262
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:32,171
is quite different.
And you're right that there is a strong 

263
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,180
critiques of progress both from the left
and from the right.

264
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,070
But from,
from the left,

265
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,230
uh,
is a,

266
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,100
uh,
kind of contempt for institutions like,

267
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,090
uh,
like markets like liberal democracy that

268
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,250
deserve a lot of the credit for the 
progress that we've made in that we,

269
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,640
to,
at least in the academic left a,

270
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,790
a,
a despising of the very idea of 

271
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,821
progress.
And I found that the only political 

272
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:02,550
faction is actually sympathetic to 
progress or libertarians.

273
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,140
There have been a number of rational 
optimist books in the last decade by 

274
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,990
people like Matt Ridley and Ron Bailey 
and Johan Norberg that,

275
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,050
uh,
that do have overlapping vision to the 

276
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:21,410
one that I took on lightening.
Now namely documenting progress.

277
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,730
Um,
but both from the academic left and from

278
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:27,860
the political right,
there has been a,

279
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,940
a,
a contempt for the notion of progress or

280
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,530
were there different reasons in 
academia?

281
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:36,680
It goes back to the Romantics to Russo,
as you mentioned,

282
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,680
but also to Schopenhauer Nietzsche.
Heidegger,

283
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:44,681
the existentialists,
the critical theorists of the Frankfurt 

284
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:46,580
school have large swaths of the academic
humanities.

285
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,540
Uh,
actually detest the enlightenment,

286
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,680
ironically enough.
Not by no means all of them,

287
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,540
but,
uh,

288
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,200
but there's a significant faction.

289
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,220
Yeah.
Well,

290
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,020
the questionnaire I guess in part is 
why,

291
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:04,350
I mean one of the things that really 
struck me as I've gone through this 

292
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,490
material over the last years is that 
this is really good news.

293
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,090
Particularly it doesn't really matter 
whether you're on the left to the right.

294
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:14,140
If you're on the left,
you think that the fact that the poorest

295
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,350
of the poor are being lifted out of 
abject,

296
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,020
absolute abject misery at a rate.
That's just.

297
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:25,310
I don't think you could hope for a 
faster improvement no matter how 

298
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,760
optimistic you were.
And then on the right of course,

299
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,990
the fact that the benefits of liberal 
democracy,

300
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,840
let's say and free markets are driving 
this in large part,

301
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:37,090
you take would also be a cause for 
celebration.

302
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:42,091
So there's the.
You talked about the availability 

303
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:43,090
heuristic and some of the role that the 
press might be playing,

304
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,150
the stock that negative events stand 
out.

305
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,090
We can also see negative events all over
the world now,

306
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,300
so we can't think of all over the world.
Whenever you hear about a negative 

307
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,921
event,
it's as if it's happening next door and 

308
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:02,650
is not as a threat.
So are the breadth of our news is 

309
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,440
exaggerated and the coverage is 
exaggerated,

310
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,670
but there still seems to me to be this,
this mystery at the bottom of all this,

311
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:12,940
which is in the face of such radically 
good news.

312
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,870
Why is there such an insistence that the
system is corrupt,

313
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,150
that we're going to hell in a handbasket
then that,

314
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,410
you know,
human beings are a cancer on the planet 

315
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:24,410
and everything is heading towards the 
apocalypse.

316
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,540
It's,
it's so,

317
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:30,870
it's so deep and it doesn't seem to be 
moved by the fact much.

318
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,570
I kind of think sometimes that it's a 
hangover from the cold war,

319
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,870
you know,
that was so deeply pessimistic for so 

320
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:39,870
long.

321
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,410
It goes back before the Cold War.
It certainly as a,

322
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,840
as a psychological syndrome,
it goes back,

323
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:50,841
at least to the Old Testament prophets 
who combined kind of social criticism 

324
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:52,350
with a,
uh,

325
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,160
fortunately at apocalyptic disaster,
absolute that syndrome,

326
00:17:57,161 --> 00:18:02,161
that combination of a moral schooling 
with predictions of doom.

327
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,790
It's something that our species quite 
naturally falls into.

328
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,270
Part of it is frankly a certain amount 
of,

329
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,290
uh,
uh,

330
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,460
interprofessional competition that 
society has various elites.

331
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,500
A,
there's the politicians,

332
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:19,180
the business people,
the military,

333
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,890
religious elites,
the academics,

334
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:25,891
the journalists,
they're always kind of competing for 

335
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:29,310
status since intellectuals don't deserve
a whole lot of credit for getting 

336
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,450
society to run,
for,

337
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,060
for putting food in the stores.
And that keeping the peace and,

338
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:35,680
and,
uh,

339
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,100
protecting the streets.
It's very easy to,

340
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,430
uh,
to look down on other societal elites 

341
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:44,430
on,
on government,

342
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,730
on business and to say,
well,

343
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:50,710
you guys are all failing and we're the 
ones who are morally a refined enough to

344
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:52,330
point it out.
I wouldn't,

345
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,720
I wouldn't put down just a sheer human 
competitiveness.

346
00:18:55,721 --> 00:19:00,721
I'm not the first to say this.
One of my favorite explanations of the 

347
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:01,560
veneration of,
uh,

348
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,840
of the past of golden ages comes from 
comms hogs.

349
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,140
You said competition of praise,
inclined to a reverence of antiquity or 

350
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,160
men contend with living not with a dead.

351
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,200
It also seems that the,
um,

352
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,870
there's a certain amount of resentment 
that is driving that as well.

353
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:23,890
And that would go along with the status 
competition because there's anger.

354
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:28,891
I suppose if you're a member of anemia 
group to see that your paradigm,

355
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,960
let's say isn't leading the charge 
forward,

356
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:32,860
um,

357
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,210
that's what I did.
And you talked about the astonishing 

358
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,531
decline in global poverty and a part of 
that story is it did not come about 

359
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:44,520
through massive redistribution,
which for,

360
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,430
for many people on the left was the only
route to lifting up the poor,

361
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,190
namely to,
to redistribute resources.

362
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Now that have been,
of course adjust adjustments either 

363
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,820
shocks the fact that China and India and
Bangladesh and Indonesia have risen out 

364
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:02,400
of poverty,
uh,

365
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,250
came in part of the expense of 
manufacturing jobs in the United States.

366
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,760
That's not exactly what people meant by 
redistribution.

367
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,430
And it literally is a redistribution of 
resources,

368
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,790
although it is a shaking up of the 
economies of many,

369
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,850
many nations.
But this massive increase in the wealth 

370
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,990
of that Asian countries did not come 
because it was,

371
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
the horses were,
were shipped from the wealthy west to 

372
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,000
the impoverished east.

373
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,590
Right?
So that's also a threat to the doctrine 

374
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:34,590
itself,
a direct threat.

375
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,920
The fact that wealth is being produced 
and it's being distributed to people at 

376
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,550
the low end means that implies that that
redistributive philosophy is likely an 

377
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:50,441
error,
and you can understand that might be 

378
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,901
regarded as a catastrophic threat,
particularly the people on the radical 

379
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:52,901
left,

380
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:57,110
well certainly,
certainly for radical notions of 

381
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,250
redistribution,
but at the same time,

382
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,760
the more limited kinds of redistribution
that have,

383
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,850
uh,
that are ubiquitous in wealthy 

384
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:05,860
countries.
I have a graph showing that the amount,

385
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,040
the proportion of GDP allocated to 
social spending a skyrocketed in the 

386
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,481
20th century from about one percent to 
about 22 percent in every developed 

387
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,990
country.
No exceptions.

388
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,100
Uh,
and,

389
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,060
uh,
thanks to,

390
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,630
to spending on the cooler on children on
the sick,

391
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:27,890
uh,
on the rates of absolute poverty have 

392
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,070
fallen in wealthy countries.
So not only,

393
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,850
uh,
have,

394
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,190
uh,
developed developing world become 

395
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,230
wealthier and not directly expensive the
developed world,

396
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:43,231
but in the developed world,
thanks to some amount of social 

397
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:45,661
spending,
I guess you could call it 

398
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:45,661
redistribution.
Uh,

399
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:45,870
the,
even as inequality has risen,

400
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,230
poverty has not.

401
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,310
Right?
Right.

402
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:53,311
I wonder,
I was just reading a book by Walter 

403
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:56,260
Shadelle called the great leveler is an 
excellent book and one of the things he 

404
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,640
did was an empirical analysis of left 
versus right wing governments,

405
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,910
I think across the 20th century,
but it might've gone farther back then 

406
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,800
now to see if there was any difference 
in the Gini Coefficient across the 

407
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,991
classes of government.
And what he found was that there was no 

408
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:16,980
difference whatsoever.
He makes a fairly strong case that the 

409
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,401
only redistributive techniques that work
our pestilence and war essentially,

410
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:22,810
and that's because they knock everyone 
down to zero,

411
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,380
but you're making a different case like 
an incremental case in some sense,

412
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:31,381
which is that governments perhaps 
regardless of their ideological 

413
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:35,800
proclivities in the 20th centuries as 
they've become more wealthy,

414
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,180
they have incrementally devoted the 
larger part of their,

415
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,330
uh,
of their resources to incremental 

416
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,571
improvements in.
You might think about it as an 

417
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:50,861
investment in the future rather than 
redistribution or investment in social 

418
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:54,310
capital education and health care.
Those sorts of things that,

419
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,810
well,
it's probably,

420
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,260
it's probably some combination.
It's a combination of investment in 

421
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,360
public goods because of course the whole
society is better off if,

422
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,280
if everyone's educated,
uh,

423
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:06,910
also in assurance,
people support a,

424
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,620
a,
a,

425
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,640
a safety net that's most popular 
euphemism for social spending because 

426
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,661
you never know whether it's going to be 
you or your or your mother or your 

427
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,811
brother who's going to be,
who's going to be a need in the lottery 

428
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:21,800
of misfortune.
And then part of it's part of it is,

429
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,250
is,
uh,

430
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:24,770
his charity,
he was the modern conscience,

431
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,020
won't allow the little match girl to 
freeze to death.

432
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,310
The jokes to,
to,

433
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,030
to Barry,
grandpa by the side of route 66.

434
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,840
And so I think social spending has been 
pushed along by,

435
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,300
by,
uh,

436
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,520
all three.
Uh,

437
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,620
it hasn't necessarily in some countries 
it probably has reduced the Gini 

438
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,131
Coefficient in western European 
countries which have a more aggressive 

439
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:47,450
system of taxation.
The United States or Canada,

440
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,900
but more important than the ginny 
distribution is that it's reduced the 

441
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,411
number of people living in poverty which
are morally relevant measure at any 

442
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:56,411
case.

443
00:23:56,411 --> 00:24:01,210
Yeah.
So those two things are complicated 

444
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,110
because obviously you want to raise 
people out of abject poverty.

445
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:02,590
I mean,
that's,

446
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,620
that's a,
that's a zero argument proposition and 

447
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,650
that seems to be happening very rapidly.
The question after that I suppose is to 

448
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:16,171
what degree does the remaining degree of
inequality that's generated by 

449
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,550
productive capital assistance also 
constituted social threat?

450
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,910
Because there is evidence it was 
reviewed best buy in the spirit level 

451
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,560
that as inequality increases rates of 
male homicide,

452
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:31,561
for example,
increase in all sorts of other negative 

453
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:34,411
measures.
So there's some weird interaction 

454
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:37,381
between raising absolute levels of 
wealth and ensuring that inequality 

455
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:38,520
doesn't,
I don't know,

456
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,330
exceed some hypothetical optimal that,
that,

457
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,650
that needs to be considered in social 
policy.

458
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,330
Are there,
I,

459
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:51,370
I signed some skeptical Ri analysis of 
the data in the spirit level.

460
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,880
And probably absolute prosperity matters
more than inequality in determining a 

461
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,860
social health include such as happiness,
crime,

462
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:09,270
um,
other kinds of social pathologies like 

463
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,270
drug addictions.
Uh,

464
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,780
it's not easy to try to tease them 
apart.

465
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,800
No,
definitely.

466
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,360
You know,
countries like Sweden are a very 

467
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,920
egalitarian,
but they're also very rich that are more

468
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:24,921
lopsided,
but they're also very poor and so it 

469
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:27,681
takes a little bit of statistical wizard
rated to tie them apart and my reading 

470
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:30,921
of the literature is that it's actually 
prosperity that is more important than 

471
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:31,560
that at any quality.
But also,

472
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:36,561
and this is a point that in the 
psychological literature rate was 

473
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,500
emphasized by Christina's Storman's and 
Paul Bloom that what people sometimes 

474
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,211
think of as a sort of aversion to 
inequality to people having different 

475
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:53,091
amounts.
It's actually an aversion to unfairness 

476
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:53,091
to injustice.
Yeah.

477
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:57,560
That,
but people would really infuriates 

478
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,781
people who said they think that the 
people at the top half ill gotten gains 

479
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:02,670
equal if they sense that the system is 
basically fair,

480
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:05,940
that either greater effort,
talent,

481
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,590
or even luck,
uh,

482
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:11,370
result in an unequal distribution of an 
impartial lottery,

483
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:12,960
for example,
that they're okay with that.

484
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:14,140
It's cheating.
That really.

485
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,460
Yeah.
And people are really good at 

486
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:19,460
remembering cheating and recognizing it 
as well.

487
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,710
Yeah.
So,

488
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,760
okay,
so there is something we could talk 

489
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:25,760
about for a minute because you know,
there's a,

490
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,510
the,
the is political.

491
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:33,310
What do you call rumblings about the 
fact that I think a lot of this is 

492
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:36,711
generated by the radical left types,
particularly on the campuses that the 

493
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:38,910
system is rigged and that it's an 
oppressive patriarchy.

494
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:43,911
And that the reason that people were at 
the top is because they played power 

495
00:26:43,911 --> 00:26:43,911
games.
You know,

496
00:26:43,911 --> 00:26:48,701
it's this,
my sense is that the control is that 

497
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:52,360
we're,
we're ethnic or racial or gender groups 

498
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,581
and we're competing in the Marxist 
manner and those who win have one 

499
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:58,731
because of oppression.
But I know the literature on the 

500
00:26:58,731 --> 00:27:01,800
relationship between the individual 
individual differences and longterm life

501
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:05,460
success in the Western world and the 
literature is actually very clear.

502
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,850
So intelligence seems to account for 
about 20 percent of the variance in 

503
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,441
longterm life success.
And then trait conscientiousness 

504
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:17,340
accounts for perhaps another,
maybe 10 to 15 percent.

505
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,120
And then there's smaller contributions 
of emotional stability.

506
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,060
Um,
and also have trait openness,

507
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:26,440
which seems to be a good predictor of 
entrepreneurial ability.

508
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:31,441
So it looks like in the West that you 
can attribute about 40 to 50 percent of 

509
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,270
the variance,
maybe that's a little high,

510
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:38,271
but it's not.
It's not radical over estimate to the 

511
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:41,691
sorts of individual differences that are
associated with productivity because 

512
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:44,850
increases an Iq Higher Iq at higher 
conscientiousness definitely make people

513
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:49,851
more productive.
It seems to me that you can use that as 

514
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:50,320
an index of the,
um,

515
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:56,060
of the,
of the genuinely meritocratic nature of 

516
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,791
a culture and also as an index of its 
willingness to engage in fair play 

517
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:02,790
because you'd expect if a,
if your culture is aimed at productivity

518
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,210
and it turns out that those are the most
pr and it turns out that the most 

519
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,840
productive people are in fact 
differentially rewarded.

520
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,070
That seems to me to be a reasonable 
index of the success of the society.

521
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:19,260
Now that data is still leaves 50 to 60 
percent of the variance and explained.

522
00:28:19,261 --> 00:28:23,640
And so you can in there,
you can include racism and prejudice and

523
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:28,790
the tyranny of the system and blind luck
and physical health and all the 

524
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,171
arbitrary random events that make up 
that determined whether someone is 

525
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:37,161
successful or failures in life.
But it does seem to me to provide a 

526
00:28:37,161 --> 00:28:40,821
metric saying that not only is our 
society crazily productive and 

527
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:43,890
reasonably and reasonably good at 
district distributing the spoils,

528
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,480
even though there's still some 
inequality,

529
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:50,481
but a fair bit of inequality is actually
generated as a consequence of 

530
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:53,220
differences in genuine productivity that
seem reasonable to you.

531
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,420
Uh,
yeah,

532
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,200
it,
it,

533
00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:00,310
it ought to be obvious and the now 
except for the fact that in a lot of 

534
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:04,451
intellectual life,
the assumption is that the correlation 

535
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,840
between psychological traits and success
at zero.

536
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,510
So the fact that it's what,
you know,

537
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,920
let's say it's 40 percent,
let's say it's 33 percent,

538
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:15,250
that's a lot higher than,
than most people are willing to 

539
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,250
acknowledge.
What you said is exactly right.

540
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:21,251
That leaves more than half of the 
variance not to be correlated with 

541
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:25,910
individual differences.
And of course various inequities could 

542
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:29,890
go into that.
And they're not mutually exclusive.

543
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,850
It seems hard.

544
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,880
We know that there's a lot of gaming of 
the system,

545
00:29:36,881 --> 00:29:37,510
particularly.
Yeah,

546
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,640
by the wealthy.

547
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,820
Uh,
and that should obviously be eliminated.

548
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:44,650
It's not meritocratic,
not fair.

549
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:49,651
It's not productive.
We could also ask another question is 

550
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:53,880
whether the rewards that go to 
untalented aren't necessarily in sectors

551
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:57,700
that lead to what we might call a 
productivity in the sense of,

552
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,350
of,
um,

553
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,840
increasing societal wealth and an 
argument can be made that there is some 

554
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,620
misallocation of intellectual resources 
that we have.

555
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,390
Uh,
the,

556
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,480
the economy is too driven by,
by finance that the,

557
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,660
uh,
there are too many lawsuits.

558
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,250
Legal system is who each other.
Uh,

559
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,200
and so,
uh,

560
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,530
arrested by intellectuals,
this does still leave a,

561
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:22,930
a,
a place for criticizing a number of the,

562
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:23,740
uh,
uh,

563
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:28,030
the ways in which our economy is set up.
There's always scope for improvement.

564
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:33,430
Yes.
We were talking about why despite the 

565
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,551
fact that a fair bit of the variance or 
a third to half of the variance in life 

566
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:39,940
success is taken up by,
let's say,

567
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,960
individual attributes.
There's still room for a systemic 

568
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:44,960
critique that's valid.

569
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:50,890
Yeah.
One of the pathologies of intellectual 

570
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,351
life that I,
I wrote about it in the blank slate of 

571
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,350
the denial of human nature was that,
uh,

572
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,620
the in,
in polite company in intellectual 

573
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,070
circles,
the amount of life success determined by

574
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,080
a inherent and largely heritable 
psychological traits has to be zero.

575
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,000
I mean,
that's just the,

576
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,520
the,
the,

577
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,480
uh,
uh,

578
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,400
only acceptable position.
And you and I know it's not zero.

579
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,190
Well also just send me interject for one
second.

580
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:18,860
I'm also,
there's a fairness element there.

581
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,480
But the other thing is,
it seems to me that that's extraordinary

582
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,400
extraordinarily selfserving of people 
too,

583
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:27,270
because if you get together with a group
of Harvard professors,

584
00:31:27,271 --> 00:31:32,271
for example,
it's pretty obvious that their innate 

585
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:35,931
intelligence is one of the factors that 
determine their success and to deny the 

586
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:40,191
fact that heritable differences make a 
difference means perhaps to act as an 

587
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:46,131
Avatar of a social justice orientation,
but equally to deny the role of,

588
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,900
of the benefits of chance in your own 
success and to therefore lack a certain 

589
00:31:53,071 --> 00:31:56,400
degree of humility that you might 
otherwise be required to have.

590
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,850
So it's not at all.
And I'm not claiming that you were 

591
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,661
implying this at all,
but it's not all in the service of 

592
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:09,150
higher social ideals that people denied 
the contribution of,

593
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,820
of heritable components.
For example,

594
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,890
the birth laundry.
So,

595
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,190
whoops,
we just stepped.

596
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,380
Okay.

597
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,740
Uh,
unfortunately the video just froze.

598
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,280
And after you said,
I'm not saying you claim this,

599
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,770
you suddenly froze on the screen,
so I'm not saying you're claiming this.

600
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,190
Sure.
Well,

601
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:36,190
it's just,
it seems self serving for people who are

602
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,990
particularly bright,
for example,

603
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:43,350
to not be grateful for the fact that 
they won the genetic lottery in that,

604
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,730
in that manner,
and sufficiently humble to not know what

605
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:55,580
the role of that arbitrary chance in 
determining their success.

606
00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:00,610
I mean,
it's not like they don't deserve their 

607
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,141
success because of that.
But claiming a certain degree of 

608
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:06,041
biological determinism doesn't 
necessarily make you a bad person even 

609
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:10,871
though it can be read that way because 
it makes you very sensitive to your own 

610
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:12,830
good fortune if you,
if you think it through carefully.

611
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,210
Oh absolutely.
In fact,

612
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:18,030
successful people are the winners of at 
least three lotteries.

613
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,740
One of them that you mentioned,
of course it's the Connecticut lottery,

614
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,870
the fact that some people were born with
greater intelligence and 

615
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,470
conscientiousness and openness to 
experience.

616
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:33,830
Another is that there's a,
a second lottery in a human development 

617
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,930
that is not strictly genetic,
but it is in a sense of constitutional 

618
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,910
or developmental.
The fact that I might consider this,

619
00:33:41,911 --> 00:33:46,911
one of the most profound discoveries in 
the history of psychology that 

620
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:51,071
correlations between identical twins 
reared together are generally on the 

621
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:56,310
order of five point five and they share 
not only their genome,

622
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,250
but uh,
the vast amount of their environments,

623
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,020
their parents,
their neighborhoods,

624
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:04,260
their older siblings or younger sibs.
The number of books in the house,

625
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:06,630
number of guns in the house,
number of tvs in the house,

626
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,370
they're not indistinguishable.

627
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,270
Identical twins are a correlate quite 
highly,

628
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,570
but no one near perfectly.
Which means that there is a second 

629
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,301
lottery that has to do either with just 
the way the brain congeals during 

630
00:34:21,451 --> 00:34:26,451
development,
which can be specified down to the last 

631
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:29,040
snips by the genes and perhaps by chance
life events,

632
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:34,070
which might leave unpredictable traces 
that we can't add a document store or 

633
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:37,410
systematically understand.
Then of course there's the third lottery

634
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,440
of what happens to you in your 
profession.

635
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,540
Did you bet on the right sector?
Did you happen to have a good 

636
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:51,480
relationship with the boss?
Numerous.

637
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,020
It's a matter of being in the right 
place at the right time,

638
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,920
the right time.
So all that having been said,

639
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,450
um,
and,

640
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,690
and you're,
you're absolutely right.

641
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:04,691
We have to acknowledge the role of a,
of hereditary temperament.

642
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,060
Untalent be known zero role of chance,
and that still leaves a big chunk of the

643
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:16,061
variants that could be due to a systemic
features of the system that perhaps 

644
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:21,731
ought to be changed.
There's just no doubt that the wealthy 

645
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:21,731
game,
the system,

646
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:25,631
particularly in the United States in a 
number of ways that don't work to the 

647
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:29,590
benefit of society at large.
There are also aspects of the system 

648
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,701
that are perhaps fair but irrational.
The fact that so much of our 

649
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:35,930
intellectual talent now gets sucked into
finance.

650
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,260
Now,
of course we do need a financial sector 

651
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,260
and it's weird that they're smart people
in it,

652
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,190
but having a lot of our brain power 
devoted to figuring out how to act on 

653
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:51,261
financial information,
Microsoft microsecond faster than ones 

654
00:35:51,261 --> 00:35:54,080
competitors is probably not the best use
of our societies.

655
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,860
Intellectual capital.
Likewise,

656
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:01,470
there's no doubt that we have far too 
much brain power invested in a legal 

657
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:06,531
system in a corporation suing each other
patent trolling a and another not so 

658
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:07,920
productive uses.

659
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,940
The funny thing is too though,
that there's an erotica erotica of 

660
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,440
pathology in in a system.
In some sense.

661
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:22,470
I mean,
one of the things that struck me quite 

662
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,350
hard for example,
is that if you look at the creativity 

663
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:30,330
curves across the lifespan,
they matched the criminality curves 

664
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,220
almost perfectly,
and one of the things that make me think

665
00:36:33,221 --> 00:36:37,390
when I was doing that research was so as
young men become more antisocial,

666
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:42,391
they also become more creative.
Even though those things might not be 

667
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:42,490
correlated,
but they do map on top of one another.

668
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,550
I was taking in a society like the 
United States,

669
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,510
which has a fair degree of criminality,
but also a fair degree of creativity.

670
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:54,690
We have no idea how loose the system has
to be so that malfeasance can thrive so 

671
00:36:56,831 --> 00:37:01,831
that it can also be similar caneously 
loose enough so that creativity can 

672
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:01,831
thrive,
right?

673
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:06,660
Because you might think if you were 
optimistic that you can tighten up the 

674
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,481
system and get rid of the criminal 
behavior without adding a totalitarian 

675
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:11,860
layer to this system that would also 
simultaneously demolish,

676
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,860
you know,
individual variability and creativity.

677
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:20,220
We just,
our models just aren't sophisticated 

678
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,220
enough to see such things apart,
you know?

679
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,000
Well,
there,

680
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,060
there I,
I'm not so sure there.

681
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,560
I mean,
I,

682
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,950
I do agree with you,
there's a certain amount of,

683
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,220
uh,
risk taking or young men on the bake 

684
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,930
that might underlie both criminality and
a productive creativity.

685
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,820
But,
uh,

686
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,830
over the course of history,
I think one of the accomplishments of 

687
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,840
civilization and indeed have a,
uh,

688
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,640
an enlightenment driven progress is that
we have managed to tease them apart.

689
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,710
Just two examples are the fact that the 
rate of homicide punished by a factor of

690
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:52,620
about 35 from the Middle Ages to the 
20th century,

691
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,770
and that in fact that includes the 
scientific revolution,

692
00:37:55,771 --> 00:38:00,771
the industrial revolution lightened 
meant into all of the advances of the 

693
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:02,220
20th century.
So justice people were not stabbing each

694
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:03,680
other.
So for instance,

695
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,800
if they were also coming up with the 
theory of evolution and the atomic 

696
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,570
theory of matter,
and then again,

697
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,200
19 nineties when the rate of violent 
crime in the United States fell by half 

698
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,360
and they were also declines in Canada,
Britain,

699
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:22,670
other western countries.
This certainly it was not a time of 

700
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:22,670
economic stagnation or.

701
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,400
No,
no,

702
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,610
no.
Fair enough.

703
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:29,730
I guess then the question starts to 
become is how in the world did those 

704
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,151
things get teased apart so that we are 
able to regulate anti social behavior 

705
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:36,781
without simultaneously making things 
excessively rigid,

706
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:39,460
unregulated,
totalitarian.

707
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,160
We managed it.
Maybe it's part of that same incremental

708
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,650
process that you detailed out at the 
beginning of our talk.

709
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,980
You know,
another thing that struck me about your 

710
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,860
book that was quite interesting,
I thought it was that you list the names

711
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:55,861
of a very large number of totally unsung
heroes and those are people in.

712
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,830
We have a very interesting table near 
the beginning where you list,

713
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:04,860
I think about 10 names,
maybe 12 of people who've saved between 

714
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:08,560
hundreds of billions and billions of 
lives with their scientific,

715
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,990
but they're incremental scientific 
productivity.

716
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,470
And yet those are people that are by no 
means household names.

717
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,140
That's another place where things don't 
make the news.

718
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,510
Yes,
absolutely.

719
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:23,420
And it's a,
it's funny how our moral,

720
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,790
a crediting our moral,
our awarding of moral Brownie points 

721
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:33,690
doesn't quite correlate with how much 
good it often doesn't at all correlate.

722
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Uh,
and the case of the inventors of 

723
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,540
synthetic fertilizer,
vaccines of chlorination,

724
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:47,541
of public water,
supplies of the green revolution in 

725
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:48,090
agriculture are,
are pretty much unknown.

726
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,110
And they literally say billions of lives
a.

727
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,240
whereas various reformers and profits 
and agitators are a pretty well known.

728
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,370
A number of,
uh,

729
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:04,670
uh,
certainly people who are sanctioned by 

730
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,820
the Roman Catholic Church who have to 
perform a miracle that might resolve it,

731
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,150
results in saving one life,
of course,

732
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,890
in fact did not because miracles don't 
happen,

733
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,340
but the fact that that definition of 
saint has nothing to do with saving 

734
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:21,501
lives on skills of millions or billions 
to shows like human moral sense is not 

735
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:26,610
really well calibrated to morality as we
would a defended by,

736
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:32,460
I think it was stolen who said something
like a single death is a tragedy,

737
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:37,350
but a million deaths is a statistic.
He actually didn't say it,

738
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:37,740
but,
uh,

739
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:38,330
but it's,
it's,

740
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,140
it's a conventionally attributed to him.
So let's say for good reason.

741
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:48,141
I mean,
I suppose I could have said it to or I 

742
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:49,760
guess maybe the same thing plays in 
reverse a,

743
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,160
is that

744
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:55,510
the saving of a single life has a 
narrative punch and the incremental 

745
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,430
savings of 100 million lives,
especially through prevention.

746
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,840
That's another problem,
right?

747
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:04,841
Because prevention isn't dramatic 
because the terrible thing merely 

748
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:05,310
doesn't happen.
And that's not,

749
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:07,230
um,
I,

750
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:12,130
I rather cheekily wrote an article on 
the human moral sense that began with a,

751
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,200
who do you,
who do you think is most morally 

752
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,051
praiseworthy,
Mother Teresa or Bill Gates or Norman 

753
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:23,620
Borlaug.
And this was before a gates is pivot 

754
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,440
from a computer technology to 
philanthropy was,

755
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,170
was well known.
It was about 10 years ago.

756
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,470
And I set it up as a bit of a trick 
question because of course everyone 

757
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,351
would say mother Teresa,
even in our field and in of moral 

758
00:41:35,351 --> 00:41:38,831
psychology,
whenever a speaker has to pull out at 

759
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:40,070
the end example of a particularly moral 
person,

760
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,250
Mother Teresa is the stereotype.
Even though if you ask people,

761
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,290
well,
what exactly did she accomplish?

762
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,140
Uh,
how many lives did she save?

763
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,120
How many sick people did she actually 
cure?

764
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,380
A,
it's very hard to come up with our 

765
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,851
actual accomplishment.
What does Bill Gates has already been 

766
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:01,030
credited with saving perhaps 100 million
lives through his efforts to eliminate 

767
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,110
effective infectious disease loving 
world.

768
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,800
And Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace 
Prize in 1974.

769
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:11,801
His role in fomenting the green 
revolution probably saved a billion 

770
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:16,421
lives,
selective breeding of hybrid crops that 

771
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:19,100
required less fertilizer that could be 
grown twice a year,

772
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,500
less water,
higher yields,

773
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:23,870
less susceptibility to disease,
uh,

774
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:27,020
which are countries like Mexico and 
India from,

775
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,330
from basket cases to exporters of food 
in,

776
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,970
in,
in less than a decade.

777
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:37,140
Right.
Do you think that would be a story that 

778
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,061
everyone in in elementary and junior 
high school would learn because it's 

779
00:42:39,061 --> 00:42:41,980
such a remarkable,
absolutely remarkable story and no one,

780
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,280
I mean,
I don't know what percentage of people 

781
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280
would know his name,
his name,

782
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,250
but I don't imagine it's,
it's,

783
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:51,130
I suspect it's in the low percentages if
that.

784
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,450
I,
I,

785
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:53,610
I'm,
I'm sure that's right.

786
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,460
I think it may have been a change.
I seem to recall a,

787
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,370
although I hate to begin any sentence 
with when I was young,

788
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,050
uh,
but we,

789
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:08,320
we did read a heroic biographies of 
medical pioneers,

790
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,260
like the discover of intuitive and that 
Thomas Edison,

791
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,500
and I don't know if that kind of a 
heroic biography of the innovator of the

792
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:23,921
inventor,
a scientist is as common in children's 

793
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:23,921
education.

794
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:25,650
Yeah,
I suspect I strongly suspect not.

795
00:43:25,651 --> 00:43:30,651
It certainly wouldn't be in Canada given
the tilt that our education system has 

796
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:30,651
taken.
So.

797
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:36,140
Alright,
so a couple of a couple of broader 

798
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:36,140
questions.
Again,

799
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,580
if you don't mind,
you have a whole corpus of work and 

800
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,960
there are recurrent themes in some 
sense.

801
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:47,430
One of them being things are getting 
better in ways that we really don't know

802
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:52,710
and what are you,
what if you could have what you wanted 

803
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,880
with regards to the impact of your 
books,

804
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:59,610
what,
what would you want that impact to be 

805
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,980
and also what do you think like one of 
the things I've done on twitter recently

806
00:44:01,981 --> 00:44:06,360
because I'm trying to figure out how to 
use twitter is to tilt my tweets towards

807
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:11,361
people like human progress.org.
Someone you site in your introduction 

808
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:14,010
and people who are purveying information
while including yourself by the way,

809
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:19,310
who are purveying information about how 
much better things are getting and so 

810
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:23,270
what impact would you like to have your 
books have and how do you see that 

811
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,640
playing out psychologically,
politically,

812
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:28,641
and what do you think people who are 
listening now say could do practically 

813
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,960
to get the good news out,
so to speak?

814
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,760
Certainly intellectual life should be 
more data driven.

815
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:40,970
How bad you shouldn't be allowed to say 
or talk about any reported trend based 

816
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:47,151
on an event that happened yesterday or 
this year because trend means change 

817
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:52,461
over time.
And in so many areas we really do have 

818
00:44:52,461 --> 00:44:54,690
data and it's just irresponsible not to 
cite those data,

819
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,930
particularly since they have become 
increasingly available through websites 

820
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,250
like our world and data and keeping 
progress.

821
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,640
So I'd like to see a replacement of 
ideological debate,

822
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,750
which so much of our current debate is,
it's whether the right or the left is 

823
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,150
more St Louis Moral,
uh,

824
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,860
praiseworthy correct.
And more,

825
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:20,310
uh,
well,

826
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,450
well,
let's look at the data.

827
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:25,340
It chances are that neither an off the 
shelf position of the left door,

828
00:45:25,341 --> 00:45:28,260
an off the shelf position of the right 
is likely to have it all figured out.

829
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,080
No one is on this event or infallible.

830
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,230
These ideologies go back to the,
to the French revolution,

831
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:38,580
and they're unlikely to be the font of 
solutions to complex problems.

832
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:44,170
What?
Let's try to see what works and what 

833
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,861
doesn't and come up with the mixture of 
what is most likely to solve our 

834
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:49,431
problems.
Spoken like a true proponent of the 

835
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:49,431
enlightenment.
Yeah,

836
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:49,880
I guess,
uh,

837
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,960
and stepping back even farther,
I would like to see a greater 

838
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,430
integration of the,
um,

839
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:00,930
uh,
the insights and mindset of the science 

840
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:04,520
into social and cultural affairs.
As we talked about earlier in the 

841
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:09,450
conversation.
This very idea is often met with horror.

842
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:14,810
I don't just.
The humanities types I suppose in some 

843
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,741
sense,
aren't very happy with the idea that 

844
00:46:18,741 --> 00:46:18,741
they'd have to learn statistics.
And I can,

845
00:46:18,741 --> 00:46:20,040
I have a certain amount of sympathy for 
that perspective.

846
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,510
But.
Well,

847
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:22,230
there isn't.
Yes,

848
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:24,210
there is a,
a horror therapy,

849
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,810
uh,
expanding realm of five member in data.

850
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,500
And a horror,
Epi,

851
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,120
a thought that,
uh,

852
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,630
ideas about human nature from,
uh,

853
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,430
from science,
from evolutionary psychology,

854
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,460
from behavioral genetics,
from social and personality and 

855
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,801
cognitive psychology might be brought to
bear on our understanding of society,

856
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,520
of justice,
of,

857
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,510
of art,
literature,

858
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,560
fiction.
Quite contrary to be the mindset of the 

859
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,630
enlightenment where all of the 
enlightened few us off.

860
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:02,940
We're a pretty serious psychologists.
It'd be the field didn't exist at the 

861
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,510
time,
so they weren't called that,

862
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:08,870
but they a mind the observations from,
from travelers and missionaries and,

863
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,180
uh,
and explorers,

864
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,300
Opi ways of other cultures.
They relied on their own observations 

865
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,850
and common sense.
They tapped into what brain science 

866
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:21,850
existed at the time.
So it's not a,

867
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:25,430
it's hardly a radical idea that our 
understanding of,

868
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,170
uh,
of art and culture and society should be

869
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,430
informed by our,
of human nature.

870
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:35,670
But now the disciplines have become so 
professionalized and they're housed in 

871
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:39,301
different buildings on campus and 
they're rivals for the money from the 

872
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:39,410
dean.
Uh,

873
00:47:39,411 --> 00:47:44,411
there's a great hostility to the old 
enlightenment idea of consilience is 

874
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,350
often a,
a,

875
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:47,650
a,
a paranoid fear that this means that the

876
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:51,220
sciences we'll take over the humanities,
which of course is preposterous.

877
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:52,510
They wouldn't,
they would want to,

878
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:53,700
they couldn't there be good.

879
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:58,910
No,
and I think the sciences can really 

880
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:58,910
inform the humanities.
I mean,

881
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:58,910
versa.
Yeah.

882
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:03,720
I'd been trained as a scientist.
My appreciation for the humanities is 

883
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:03,900
actually substantially deepened.

884
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,690
So in here,
and indeed in many fields,

885
00:48:07,691 --> 00:48:11,260
this is a complete my,
what am I own fields of linguistics.

886
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,440
It's just taken for granted that.
And no one really cares where the 

887
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,010
humanities influences.
I ended the scientific ones.

888
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,570
Studies of philology of classical 
grammar,

889
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,600
of a,
of texts now blend into a statistical 

890
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,951
studies of Corpora of laboratory studies
have speech and language processing.

891
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,880
And uh,
the where the science ends up in the 

892
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,010
ends off the humanities begins.
No one even talks to him.

893
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,560
The science can also really change.
Can really change your mind.

894
00:48:42,561 --> 00:48:46,280
Like I've looked at individual 
differences in relationship to political

895
00:48:46,281 --> 00:48:51,281
belief.
And so I've learned three things from 

896
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:54,761
doing that that I think are 
revolutionary have been revolutionary 

897
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:58,040
for me.
So the first is that I'm liberal.

898
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:00,500
Lefty types are characterized by higher 
trade,

899
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:03,590
openness and lower conscientiousness,
and then conservatives,

900
00:49:03,591 --> 00:49:05,750
the reverse and I,
I think,

901
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:10,780
well that's quite interesting because it
puts the liberal left types into 

902
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,570
creative entrepreneurial domain because 
that's characterized by high openness 

903
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:17,141
and it puts the conservative types in 
the managerial and administrative 

904
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:20,080
domain.
And so that implies that the liberal 

905
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,961
left types create new ideas and new 
enterprises including entrepreneurial 

906
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:24,770
enterprises because the data there is 
fairly solid.

907
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,040
Whereas the conservative types manage 
and administer those enterprises and so 

908
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,240
each needs the other.
And so there's that nice polarity 

909
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,260
dynamic.
And then there's also the idea that the 

910
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,181
reason that openness and 
conscientiousness unite to predict 

911
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:43,700
political behaviors because of borders.

912
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:49,190
So open people liked the borders between
concepts to be fluid so that there's 

913
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,350
information exchange and they're not 
orderly.

914
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,690
The liberal types because they're not 
conscientious.

915
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:57,290
And so they don't see any utility in 
keeping things categorically distinct.

916
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:02,650
Whereas the conservatives are afraid of 
the contamination of things because of 

917
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:06,881
the movement of information and they 
like to see the borders between things 

918
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:11,290
to to ensure that that's the case.
So the reason that openness 

919
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:15,220
conscientiousness stack together as 
predictors of political behavior seems 

920
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,151
to be because of the two fundamentally 
different attitudes toward towards 

921
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:22,670
borders all the way from the conceptual 
to the political,

922
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,160
so the right wingers think while borders
are good because that stops and 

923
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,670
contamination is a real problem and a 
definitely problem often and the liberal

924
00:50:31,671 --> 00:50:32,770
lefty type state,
no,

925
00:50:32,771 --> 00:50:37,771
no.
We want as much information to flow as 

926
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:39,611
possible and both of those perspectives 
are valid and need to be discussed.

927
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:45,610
Then the other thing I learned from the 
American empirical data was that 

928
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,850
orderliness,
which is part of the part of 

929
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:49,940
conscientiousness predicts conservatism,
is associated with disgust,

930
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:54,941
sensitivity and so that that feeds that 
desire to maintain borders so that 

931
00:50:56,061 --> 00:51:01,061
there's no cross contamination that's 
associated with what's been called the 

932
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:04,871
behavioral immune system,
and so those are actually quite 

933
00:51:04,871 --> 00:51:07,541
revolutionary ideas from the perspective
of political theory or political belief 

934
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:11,930
is temperamentally determined that the 
reason that the two temperamental traits

935
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:15,080
determined political belief is because 
of a difference in attitude,

936
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,200
fundamental difference in attitude 
towards the borders between things that 

937
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,750
you can make a case for open and closed 
borders on evolutionary grounds and that

938
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,780
there's a.
there's an association between 

939
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,330
conservatism and discussed,
which for me shed tremendous light,

940
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:31,700
for example,
and the motivations of Hitler who was an

941
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:36,701
extraordinarily orderly person and who 
used disgust oriented language all the 

942
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:38,810
time when he was formulating his 
policies of extermination.

943
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,680
So those are revolutionary contributions
of individual,

944
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:47,681
different science to political theory.
It's all driven by hard data 

945
00:51:47,681 --> 00:51:48,320
statistically derived.

946
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:50,270
Well,
I,

947
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:55,290
I agree and I can sense the kind of 
paranoid reaction that these claims 

948
00:51:56,191 --> 00:52:01,191
might elicit among some traditional 
political theorists and thinkers that,

949
00:52:01,831 --> 00:52:06,831
oh,
are you saying that the conservative 

950
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:08,040
beliefs are nothing but an expression of
disgust sensitivity,

951
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:12,390
and of course it doesn't apply,
that he's a fascinating findings.

952
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:16,330
Don't say that the earned income tax 
credit is a good or a bad idea,

953
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:21,340
or the Paris climate accords themselves.
The issue still have to be decided on 

954
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:25,410
their merits the other hand,
if you do,

955
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,060
if you are aware of your own potential 
biases than that,

956
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,160
that is a source of insight.
It's a source of understanding.

957
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,520
It could cause you to step back from 
your own convictions and be more 

958
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,660
receptive to arguments on both sides.
Of course,

959
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:41,160
that was definitely done.
That for me,

960
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:45,870
that it can't not be a helpful.
CanNot be an important source of insight

961
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,850
as to how political debates unfold.

962
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:48,540
Yeah.
Well,

963
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:53,541
if you know that the liberal left types 
are necessary for the fostering of new 

964
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:55,680
enterprises and the Conservatives are 
necessary to run them,

965
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:00,630
then that certainly indicates why both 
groups not only are necessary,

966
00:53:00,631 --> 00:53:05,631
but are all of mutual benefit.
Somebody has to maintain systems and 

967
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:10,161
someone has to expand them and those 
things are gonna work in opposition to 

968
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:11,820
one another because expanding a system 
often fragmented,

969
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:17,330
so there's gonna be tension,
but no system can remain static forever 

970
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:17,480
and,
and,

971
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:22,730
and completely untrammeled 
transformation throws everything into 

972
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:27,351
chaos.
So there obviously has to be a dialogue 

973
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:29,540
between those viewpoints like a,
it's like an opponent process issue 

974
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,150
essentially.
And

975
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,620
yes.
And,

976
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:32,120
and,
uh,

977
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:37,140
all of us ought to be more aware,
have more insight into how our own 

978
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,740
psych,
psychological proclivities might,

979
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:46,970
uh,
affect the positions that seem to each 

980
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:46,970
of us to be obvious.

981
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,670
Well,
and that is what they do,

982
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:53,671
right?
Because the temperamental variable or 

983
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:53,671
variables actually tell you what is self
evident.

984
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:54,850
That's how they operate.

985
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,000
My understanding from,
from the literature that you're citing,

986
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,610
is that the,
the,

987
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,560
uh,
variance and opinions that is correlated

988
00:54:02,561 --> 00:54:04,880
with personality differences,
uh,

989
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,290
is also the hardest to get people to 
give up to,

990
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,490
to persuade them.

991
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:10,100
Yeah.
Well,

992
00:54:10,101 --> 00:54:12,820
I,
no doubt because I think the,

993
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,210
those temperamental differences are like
axiomatic values,

994
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,630
you know,
and they're grounded and I think they're

995
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:23,050
grounded in the hyper development of 
separate circuitry.

996
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:26,040
So it's going to be very,
very mean.

997
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,910
And I also think that like,
if you're an x,

998
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,920
if you're an introvert,
you want to learn to be an extrovert,

999
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:34,210
you have to learn it.
Micro skill by micro skill,

1000
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,400
right?
There's no revolution,

1001
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:41,580
there's no revolutionary cognitive 
transformation that's going to turn you 

1002
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:41,680
into an extrovert.
You can pick up the skills,

1003
00:54:41,681 --> 00:54:44,260
but it's bit by bit and it's 
incremental.

1004
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:49,261
And so I think it's the same with 
political attitudes is you can develop 

1005
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:52,891
an appreciation for the viewpoint of 
people who are on the other side of the 

1006
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:54,190
temperamental divide,
but it's a,

1007
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,430
it's an increment by increment advance 
and it's very,

1008
00:54:57,431 --> 00:54:59,560
very effortful but necessary.

1009
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,020
It's necessary.
You know,

1010
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:06,090
it's been really useful to me to see 
where the cognitive,

1011
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:11,371
sociological,
political utility of both political 

1012
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:12,840
temperaments lights and,
and,

1013
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,070
and why it's so crucially important.
I mean,

1014
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,350
with regards to disgust sensitivity,
I mean,

1015
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:22,351
you might think,
well that's pure reduct purely 

1016
00:55:22,351 --> 00:55:22,351
reductionistic with regards to the 
conservative viewpoint.

1017
00:55:22,351 --> 00:55:26,760
But no,
a lot of people in history have died as 

1018
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,870
a consequence of cross cultural 
contamination,

1019
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,060
right?
I mean there are estimates that up to 90

1020
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:36,061
percent,
maybe even 95 percent of the native 

1021
00:55:36,061 --> 00:55:36,250
Americans parish because of their 
exposure to the Spaniards.

1022
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:41,520
Right?
And so the idea that contamination is a 

1023
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,560
problem when,
when two things that were distinct unite

1024
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,990
is,
is,

1025
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,200
is a truism and it's a powerful 
evolutionary force and equally powerful 

1026
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,820
as the observation that.
Well,

1027
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:52,810
yeah,
despite that,

1028
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:56,050
despite that though,
the benefit of information flow,

1029
00:55:56,051 --> 00:56:01,051
free information flow and trade is so 
overwhelming that you can't throw the 

1030
00:56:01,051 --> 00:56:01,051
baby out with the bathwater.

1031
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,220
Yes.
It's the case where the,

1032
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:04,130
the,
uh,

1033
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:08,860
evolutionary adaptive value of a,
uh,

1034
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:12,740
of a motive or a,
an emotion is explicable.

1035
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:18,080
And we can also recognize that thanks to
advances in science and technology,

1036
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,640
the emotions themselves are no longer 
particularly effective defenses against,

1037
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:25,690
uh,
this case infection by my pathogens.

1038
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,390
We have much better ways of protecting 
ourselves,

1039
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,170
but we are stuck with these ancient 
adaptations which are,

1040
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:35,320
are no longer quite so adaptive.
It can be harmful,

1041
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:40,690
especially to treat other people on the 
metaphor of contaminants are pathogens.

1042
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,030
And you're certainly right that in,
in,

1043
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:51,280
in Hitler's rhetoric,
despite the fact that he is often a 

1044
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,380
claimed to have used eugenic ideas to 
motivate a genocide against the Jews,

1045
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,070
much more of his language came from,
uh,

1046
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,980
from pathology and histology.

1047
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,830
Oh yeah.
It's contempt.

1048
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,190
And there was a parasite

1049
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,050
parasites.
Exactly.

1050
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,440
Microbiology,
not genetics that Hitler is

1051
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,900
ideas.
So I thought we might close by.

1052
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:23,110
I have a question for you about your,
your derivation of these moral virtues 

1053
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:28,970
specifically from the enlightenment.
And I'm curious about that because.

1054
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:30,440
Well,
first of all,

1055
00:57:30,441 --> 00:57:35,441
you could make a case that it wasn't so 
much the enlightenment as it was the 

1056
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:36,350
specifically the rise of empirical 
science.

1057
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:41,680
And then you could of course have a 
discussion about how those two things 

1058
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:41,680
are related,
but I'm also curious.

1059
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:46,400
I've been reading Ian mcgilchrist book,
the master and his emissary and mcgill.

1060
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:51,580
Chris makes a pretty strong case.
I would say that get the rationalistic 

1061
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:56,051
enlightenment values are in some sense a
consequence of the articulation of an 

1062
00:57:56,751 --> 00:58:01,130
underlying set of principles that are 
more metaphoric in nature,

1063
00:58:01,131 --> 00:58:06,131
more narrative in nature.
The case I also made in my book maps of 

1064
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:09,401
meaning and to some degree in 12 rules 
for life that the enlightenment project 

1065
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:13,391
and it's rationalities nested inside a 
deeper web of metaphor and ritual and 

1066
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:17,780
image that would be associated with 
longer scale cognitive processes,

1067
00:58:17,781 --> 00:58:19,790
some of which are expressed in religious
thinking,

1068
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:24,791
but some of which are grounded in not so
much rationality as in motivation and 

1069
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:28,460
emotion and the way your book is 
structured.

1070
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:33,460
And I think the way enlightenment 
thinkers think is that there was a 

1071
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:37,901
miracle of sorts that occurred sometime 
in the last three to 500 years and 

1072
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:42,461
people woke up and became rational.
And then the question is to what degree 

1073
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:46,841
was the ground for that awakening?
Prepared by events that weren't the 

1074
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:51,641
awakening itself,
but there were associated with other 

1075
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:53,300
processes and I'm just curious as to 
what your thoughts are on that.

1076
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:59,650
Uh,
there's nothing new under the sun and a 

1077
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,110
good intellectual historian can find the
antecedents of any intellectual movement

1078
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,560
in various precursors.
Um,

1079
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,840
you know,
it's hard to.

1080
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:12,050
I don't think there's a lot in the 
enlightenment that can specifically be 

1081
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:12,050
attributed to,
to,

1082
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,970
um,
to a religion,

1083
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:18,971
particularly Christianity just based on 
the fact that it was already around for 

1084
00:59:18,971 --> 00:59:19,220
a thousand years and nothing much 
happened.

1085
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,790
So it couldn't be religion or 
Christianity itself.

1086
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,440
Although there are,
as you say,

1087
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:27,950
there are strands that were carried over
for in particular,

1088
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,760
and this is an insight that I got from 
my other half,

1089
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:33,440
Rebecca Goldstein,
my wife,

1090
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:33,920
uh,
who,

1091
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,700
who are,
you've appeared on stage with winter.

1092
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,470
The one thing that the Greeks didn't 
have that,

1093
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,520
uh,
the Christianity did was the idea of 

1094
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,540
compassion for the week and,
and universal human flourishing.

1095
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:51,430
You don't really have that for all of 
the brilliance of a,

1096
00:59:51,431 --> 00:59:52,490
of ancient Greece.

1097
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:54,760
That wasn't a,
a big feat.

1098
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,470
But the enlightenment,
of course,

1099
00:59:57,471 --> 00:59:59,330
did not spring out of,
out of nowhere,

1100
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:03,830
if I were to identify the emphases,
what your why,

1101
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:08,850
what,
what happened prior to the 18th century 

1102
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:09,760
that allowed her to fold them as opposed
to a couple of hundred years earlier,

1103
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:14,770
a couple of hundred years later,
one of them was the scientific 

1104
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:15,200
revolution of conventionally located in 
the,

1105
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:20,210
in the 17th century,
which not only provided a kind of a 

1106
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:23,890
paradigm for understanding,
namely a testing propositions against 

1107
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:28,430
the empirical world,
seeking deeper naturalistic explanations

1108
01:00:28,431 --> 01:00:30,170
for phenomena.
And which,

1109
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:35,171
of course overturned a millennia,
old dogmas reminding people that they're

1110
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,460
their own common sense,
their own societies,

1111
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:42,920
convictions were fallible.
So that was,

1112
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,050
uh,
an essential precursor.

1113
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,140
Another one was the discovery of the,
uh,

1114
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:51,380
of the new world,
that there were entire civilizations,

1115
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:56,381
entire world,
literally worlds in the sense that it 

1116
01:00:56,381 --> 01:01:00,431
had been a unknown,
that the knowledge base that they had 

1117
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:05,531
been part of a Western civilization for,
for Millennia was radical,

1118
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:06,730
incomplete.

1119
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,240
And technologically,
I suspect that the greater,

1120
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,830
uh,
exchange of ideas and people,

1121
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,500
uh,
was a contributor of the prior to the,

1122
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,130
just prior to the lightning in the 
second half of the 18th century,

1123
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:24,330
there's a massive growth in the 
efficiency of a printing printing 

1124
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:29,790
presses itself,
but it was the democratization of books 

1125
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,780
and pamphlets,
the rise literacy,

1126
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,920
uh,
and the movement of people.

1127
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:35,960
It became easier for,
uh,

1128
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:41,040
for,
for heretics and radicals to jump ship 

1129
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,730
and move to where things were cooler,
if things got too uncomfortable where 

1130
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:50,171
they were.
And it's amazing how many of the 

1131
01:01:50,171 --> 01:01:50,171
enlightenment thinkers were persecuted 
for their beliefs,

1132
01:01:50,171 --> 01:01:52,670
who they were threatened with,
imprisonment or death.

1133
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,240
Many of them ended up in Holland or 
Paris or London,

1134
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:59,030
or jumped around to wherever they had 
made the greatest freedom,

1135
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:03,140
but also just the sheer,
a kind of precursor of the,

1136
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:04,340
uh,
the web today.

1137
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:09,341
The fact that pamphlet can be introduced
and within a few months and it will be 

1138
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:13,480
translated into a dozen European 
languages and,

1139
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,510
and smuggled in.
So the exchange of ideas,

1140
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:22,570
uh,
I think it helped to accelerate the 

1141
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:27,140
route,
although since it only happened once in 

1142
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,410
human history,
we can never really know for sure why it

1143
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,370
happened,
when it did.

1144
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,750
But those are three good hypo.

1145
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,300
Yes.
Well,

1146
01:02:32,301 --> 01:02:37,301
and we're in an interesting time now 
where we can sit and make a video like 

1147
01:02:37,301 --> 01:02:40,781
this and publish it almost 
instantaneously and share it with half a

1148
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,830
million people.
I mean that,

1149
01:02:42,831 --> 01:02:47,831
that ability to share ideas rapidly as 
developing a pace and God only knows 

1150
01:02:48,201 --> 01:02:49,840
what the consequence of that is.
We're,

1151
01:02:49,841 --> 01:02:53,720
we're in a situation now which has only 
occurred to me about last year where the

1152
01:02:53,721 --> 01:02:58,721
spoken word for the first time in human 
history has the same breach and 

1153
01:02:58,721 --> 01:03:00,800
longevity as the written word.
And it's easier for people to listen.

1154
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,050
No audio books are becoming very 
popular.

1155
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,690
Lots and lots of people listen to 
podcasts.

1156
01:03:05,691 --> 01:03:10,691
You know,
I have working class people come to my 

1157
01:03:10,691 --> 01:03:10,691
talks all the time and say,
look,

1158
01:03:10,691 --> 01:03:14,591
I'm sitting in my forklift for three 
hours a day and I'm doing nothing but 

1159
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:14,840
listening to podcasts,
you know.

1160
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:17,870
So that's,
that's a really remarkable thing.

1161
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,780
So I think,
I think I'm going to let you go.

1162
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,580
You've been very generous with your 
time.

1163
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:28,630
I appreciate the conversation very much.
I'm going to close by showing your book 

1164
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:31,070
again,
Steven Pinker's,

1165
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:36,071
new book and lightened now,
which is tearing up the bestseller 

1166
01:03:36,071 --> 01:03:39,100
charts and which is a guide to proper 
end intelligent optimism in the 21st 

1167
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:42,230
century.
And maybe I'd ask you just in closing,

1168
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,560
what do you think there are things that 
individuals,

1169
01:03:45,561 --> 01:03:50,561
what do you think individuals should be 
particularly optimistic about right now 

1170
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:53,861
and what do you think individuals could 
do to spread the message that things are

1171
01:03:55,071 --> 01:03:57,350
getting better and that we can solve our
problems?

1172
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:05,130
The fact that there are new efforts to 
try transcend political divisions and 

1173
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:11,240
find out what works.
I tend to politicize and rationalize a 

1174
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,180
problems like poverty,
like climate change,

1175
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:20,600
a light like war and peace like crime.
Those are very much worth supporting 

1176
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:27,650
organizations like at a political.
There are ngos that try to monitor the 

1177
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,060
state of the world.
There's effective altruism.

1178
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:38,250
There's just the general application of 
rationality to solve our problems that 

1179
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,220
is responsible for the progress that 
we've enjoyed in the past and if there's

1180
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:46,221
going to be progress ahead of us will be
responsible for what will enjoy in the 

1181
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:46,221
future.

1182
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:47,860
All right,
well I'm,

1183
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:52,090
I'm,
I'm would like to close to by mentioning

1184
01:04:52,091 --> 01:04:54,730
to everyone who's listening that you 
know,

1185
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:59,820
things are getting better.
They're getting better because people 

1186
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,370
are facing problems and actually trying 
to solve them.

1187
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:02,830
They're doing micro analysis of the 
problems,

1188
01:05:02,831 --> 01:05:04,990
breaking them down into their 
constituent elements,

1189
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:10,620
being humbled enough to use incremental 
solutions to solve them and to address 

1190
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,400
them at,
at,

1191
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,640
at a high level of resolution instead of
a low level of or a low resolution level

1192
01:05:15,641 --> 01:05:18,190
of ideological debate.
And it's really working.

1193
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,930
And I would,
um,

1194
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:25,680
what would we say encourage people to 
pick up Dr Baker's book because the 

1195
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:30,691
world is getting better and we should 
know it and we should be happy about it 

1196
01:05:30,691 --> 01:05:32,410
and we should continue to foster that 
development in every way that we can.

1197
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:36,740
And I think this is an excellent book as
an excellent contribution to that effort

1198
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:40,410
as well as your other books like are,
are better,

1199
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:41,800
better,
better,

1200
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:47,310
better angels of our nature.
So thank you very much for spending the 

1201
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,290
time with me today and for talking with 
me and it was a pleasure to meet you.

1202
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,810
Thanks so much.
Thanks for having to Jordan.

1203
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:53,920
The pleasure was mine.
