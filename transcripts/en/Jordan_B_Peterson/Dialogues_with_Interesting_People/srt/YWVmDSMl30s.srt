1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,680
I'm here with a couple of professors 
from Wilfrid laurier to talk about the 

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,410
Lindsay Shepherd scandal and what 
happened with Professor Rambo Canada and

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,210
Pimlott and administrator Adrianne,
Joel,

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,350
Adrian,
right Atria,

5
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:29,590
Joel,
who I think is the Unsung,

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,370
what would you call it,
the unsung villain in this entire 

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,460
process because she seems to have 
escaped relatively unscathed,

8
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:39,790
even though I think her role is more 
reprehensible than anyone else's.

9
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,970
Anyways,
why don't you guys introduce yourself 

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,921
and talk about what you've been doing at
Wilfrid laurier and also just let 

11
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,160
everybody know why we're meeting.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,050
Yeah.
Well,

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,600
uh,
I'm Dave Haskell and uh,

14
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:55,110
I'm a prophet Laura Day.
I'm in the Faculty of Liberal Arts.

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,850
Uh,
this is my colleague.

16
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:57,450
Will,
will,

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,850
how do we come into this whole thing 
like this is,

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,950
this didn't just happen with the Lindsay
affair,

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,540
like to background.
We support maximum freedom of expression

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,960
and we've really found each other along 
with a few other professors who feel the

21
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:17,121
same way that we do that free expression
and free inquiry is the core value of a 

22
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:20,940
university.
And but sort of how did we run out

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,870
each other business school?
Uh,

24
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:27,871
so my exposure to the faculty of Arts is
minimal and I've been really sheltered 

25
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,900
from this professionally,
but watching what's happening in the U.

26
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,360
s watching what was happening to you at 
uft,

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,470
I'm a Grad,
I did my phd here and um,

28
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,860
it was in January that our university 
leadership sent out an email,

29
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,190
um,
explaining to the faculty how to think 

30
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,470
about the trump travel ban and declaring
a,

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,540
its,
its commitment to diversity,

32
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:57,520
equity and inclusivity.
And I was really offended by that,

33
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:01,540
that they would see fit to pronounce on 
a political issue in another country.

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,460
Uh,
offended.

35
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:05,640
Why I,
I'm,

36
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,980
I've got a phd.
I'm able to reach my own conclusions 

37
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,530
about whether these things are good or 
bad.

38
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,020
I don't need my administration preaching
to me about the,

39
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,310
the right way to think about an issue,
a political issue,

40
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:19,370
particularly consumer.

41
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,400
So why do you think they did that and 
what do you think they were thinking 

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,960
when they did that?
Because that sort of seems self evident,

43
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:26,630
right?
To the Snot,

44
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,370
the administration's role to dictate a 
political stance to the faculty.

45
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,840
That's just clearly not their role.
So what do you think they were thinking?

46
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,740
It would seem like a manifestation of 
trump derangement syndrome.

47
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:43,741
It seems like just the same reaction 
that the Democrats in the US for having 

48
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:48,230
that they lost to this horrible person 
and they couldn't understand why and it 

49
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,900
was so reprehensible and here was yet 
another terrible thing that he was doing

50
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,140
and we must all agree how bad it was.
Well,

51
00:02:56,141 --> 00:03:00,100
I mean even if the funny thing is even 
if you can make that and say

52
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,100
personally and even socially,
the idea that you could make that case 

53
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,110
and then be university administration 
and then tell your faculty to think that

54
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:13,111
way.
I mean that's taking it in a whole 

55
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:14,821
different.
That's taking it to a whole whole 

56
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:15,310
different level of presump 
presumptuousness.

57
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,570
Did that come from our administration?
From the diversity and equity from the 

58
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,190
administration,
from the leadership,

59
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,230
the university leadership.

60
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,330
I remember the.
It's confusing because I remember we 

61
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,660
also got an email from the diversity and
equity office when when trump won and 

62
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
they said that they've created a safe 
space and they were going to be open for

63
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:39,260
extra hours in case anybody needed to go
and find

64
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,920
comfort.
Right.

65
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,570
That happened a lot in the United 
States.

66
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:43,470
Hey,
what do you think?

67
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:45,630
At least the Americans have some 
justification for it,

68
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:47,490
given that it's their country.
I mean,

69
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:52,491
we need safe spaces because a 
conservative was elected in the United 

70
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:52,890
States and they're not even in our 
country.

71
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:55,010
It does seem to be a little bit on the 
absurd side.

72
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,030
Well,
it just to me,

73
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,090
you know,
they didn't send out an email when 

74
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,071
Justin Trudeau won and I have to imagine
that there were some students who were 

75
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:07,750
offended,
like there's got to be conservative 

76
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,750
students at l'oreal,
but it's.

77
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,550
It's very much a one sided conversation.
When we talk about administration,

78
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,530
when we talk about the diversity and 
equity office,

79
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,830
they talk about diversity,
but they really don't mean it because 

80
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,700
they do not want those students who are 
ideologically diverse.

81
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,030
They talk about inclusion,
but they purposely will exclude those 

82
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,420
students.
And an email like that is proof positive

83
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,770
of that kind of exclusion.
But what?

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Well that was,
that was the thing that just got me 

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,240
hopping mad and I was emailing back and 
forth with a colleague at Queens,

86
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,700
uh,
and we were talking about the importance

87
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:40,240
of free speech and this had outraged me.
And,

88
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:45,241
uh,
and he sent me a link to a star article 

89
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:48,581
that David had written.
This is now maybe a month later in 

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,270
February or March about a,
this guest speaker.

91
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,870
Oh,
Daniel.

92
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,590
Roberta.
Yeah,

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,440
yeah.
Yeah.

94
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,650
And that she couldn't speak and where 
she was,

95
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:55,280
she,
uh,

96
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,740
um,
commercial lawyer.

97
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,440
Yeah,
yeah,

98
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:58,310
yeah.
Yeah.

99
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:01,190
So merely because she served as a 
defense lawyer for someone,

100
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,670
she was pilloried.

101
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,780
Well this was another,
like when people look at the Lindsay 

102
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,390
Shepherd affair,
this is not an isolated case at Wilfrid 

103
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,230
laurier.
This is something that is,

104
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,480
it is a regular occurrence and now it 
isn't always as high profile,

105
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,710
but whether it's students in my office 
saying I can't speak,

106
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,100
whether it's my colleagues sometimes 
saying to their students who believes 

107
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,491
that they're stifled and every hand goes
up and there have been cases of that 

108
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:34,941
colleagues have come and told me,
but we've got these other examples like 

109
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:38,421
when Daniel came to speak at the 
Brantford campus of Wilford Laurey and 

110
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,720
some students agitated until she was 
forced not to do so and,

111
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,060
and my,
My President Greg,

112
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,430
we should provide some background.
So that was the case.

113
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,230
Right.
And so give me a.

114
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,950
She was a CBC journalist who was accused
of sexual assault and sexual misbehavior

115
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:56,700
by a number of people who was 
immediately let go at CBC,

116
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,980
who was dragged

117
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,140
viciously through the press,
I would say,

118
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:05,141
and then was found innocent in the 
courts now,

119
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,370
but,
and he had a defense lawyer.

120
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,750
The defense lawyer had been invited to,

121
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,910
to speak.
Yes.

122
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,940
She was part of the defense team.
She was going to speak and she wasn't 

123
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:14,940
going to speak about the Ghomeshi trial.
In fact,

124
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:20,130
she was going to talk about what it's 
like to be a high power powerful lawyer,

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,010
um,
in,

126
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,140
in the big city in Toronto.
And I mean that would have been really 

127
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,701
valuable for the criminology students,
but the students who were agitating 

128
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:33,970
against her really with the support of 
several professors,

129
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,170
uh,
they were saying,

130
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:35,500
well,
no,

131
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,510
if she comes on,
it will trigger students.

132
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,760
It will,
um,

133
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,830
it will mentally harm students.
And so that was used as justification 

134
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,010
for the act.
Interesting to,

135
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,870
to me to see that these claims of harm 
and so forth or

136
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,890
generally put forth by people who have 
no clinical expertise whatsoever.

137
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,970
And their idea is that the way that you,
first of all that,

138
00:06:55,971 --> 00:07:00,971
the way to aid people's mental health is
to protect them and there's no evidence 

139
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:04,571
for that whatsoever.
And the second is that in your attempts 

140
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:09,011
to protect them,
the best thing to do is to shelter them 

141
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,040
from exposure to ideas that would be 
challenging or frightening,

142
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,550
which is precisely the opposite of what 
a clinician does when he's trying to.

143
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:15,230
Or she is trying to,
um,

144
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,930
deal with someone who has access 
anxiety.

145
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,860
What you do in a case where someone who 
has access anxiety,

146
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:23,840
even as a consequence of a trauma,
let's say,

147
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,290
is you get them to voluntarily expose 
themselves to increasingly larger doses 

148
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,640
of exactly what frightens them.
That's the curative route.

149
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,710
So not only is it a advice that's being 
disseminated,

150
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:41,711
say by people who aren't clinicians,
it's actually advice that's being 

151
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,621
disseminated,
who are promoting the opposite of what 

152
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:45,740
an informed clinician would do.
And that doesn't.

153
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,360
That isn't my opinion,
that's,

154
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,840
that's as close to a consensus as 
anything you could reach among clinical 

155
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:52,850
practitioners,
right?

156
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,420
One rules for clinical improvement is 
get your story straight,

157
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,250
something like that.
Talk about your past,

158
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,090
sorted out and expose yourself to the 
things that you're afraid of that you're

159
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:04,400
inclined to avoid.
That's the pathway to,

160
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,640
to resilience and more robust mental 
health.

161
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,320
Okay.
So tell us the story a bit.

162
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,530
You guys have an inside view of what's 
happened on the Wilfred laurier campus 

163
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,120
since the,
the Lindsay Shepherd fair broke.

164
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,540
I should just say that,
you know,

165
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:23,541
after this rubber tie event,
I read David's piece and immediately 

166
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,090
emailed him and just say,
and that's how we injured and uh,

167
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,210
we met and we had lunch and uh,
in just talked about free speech and the

168
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:35,730
Chicago statement and how can we get it 
implemented the university,

169
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:38,130
but we just couldn't see any way forward
and really.

170
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,200
So that's another thing we want to 
discuss.

171
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:42,570
You guys have rewritten the Chicago 
statement,

172
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,870
right?
So that it's more appropriate in the 

173
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:47,870
Canadian context,
right?

174
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,140
We call it the Laurie Laurie a statement
for freedom of expression.

175
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:49,800
Okay.
Okay.

176
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:53,580
And you've been trying to convince or,
or you're trying to be in,

177
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,880
you've been trying to communicate the 
university authorities to have that 

178
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,810
ratified essentially adopted as a state 
of principles and have you had any 

179
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,600
success with that or what's the 
consequence?

180
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,630
They deferred to a task force that's 
going to be held and we can certainly.

181
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Okay,
as in is that in the aftermath of the 

182
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:13,980
shepherd affairs that going to be part 
of it really do anything over the summer

183
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,980
just because it just seemed too big a 
mountain a and there seemed to be no way

184
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:23,900
to introduce the idea right now you've 
got your

185
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,470
catalyst and Lindsay shepherd becomes 
the catalyst and and,

186
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,730
and you know what,
what a object lesson in what goes on at 

187
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,720
l'oreal,
but also what an object lesson in how 

188
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,091
you handle these free speech opponents.
She's really given a model that other 

189
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:45,850
students I hope will follow,
but it was,

190
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,770
it was through this robot tie thing that
we got to know each other and,

191
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:51,030
and a few others.
Yeah,

192
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,600
there's a couple more of you.
And so about five I think he told me.

193
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,590
That's right.
So,

194
00:09:56,591 --> 00:10:00,340
so the rope Italians incident really 
brought us out of the woodwork.

195
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,750
We started a chat and say,
you know,

196
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,570
we see this problem on our university.
We don't know what to do.

197
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,020
And then when the Lindsay Shepherd 
scandal broke,

198
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,040
we all immediately we were emailing as 
it's happened again,

199
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,050
is essentially what we were saying.
And we said,

200
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:15,850
we've got to do something about this.

201
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,380
Uh,
I'd already,

202
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,880
I was out on a,
on a trip and I came home and I said to 

203
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:23,880
my wife,
where are the newspapers?

204
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,220
This was a November twelfth when the 
story broke Christie Blatchford story.

205
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:28,240
And I said,
hey honey,

206
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:29,170
where are the newspaper?
She said,

207
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,820
I can't let you see him.
I said,

208
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,410
why not?
She said,

209
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:37,411
you cannot read the papers.
And of course it was [inaudible] 

210
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:37,930
Christie Blatchford articles in there.
So as soon as I read it,

211
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,380
I was beside myself.
I thought it's happened again and this 

212
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,380
time,
this is really terrible.

213
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,500
They've attacked a Ta,
is what they've done.

214
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,950
So I contact with the full force of the 
administration and claims that she had 

215
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,590
done mental harm,
broken two laws to laws,

216
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,360
federal and provincial is sincerely 
worried that they were going to railroad

217
00:10:58,361 --> 00:10:59,170
this young lady

218
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,090
so they could have easily taken her to 
the Ontario Human Rights Code.

219
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,050
The mission would have had field.
What was gonna Happen?

220
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,910
Uh,
I contacted Christie Blatchford.

221
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,200
I said,
can you put me in touch with her?

222
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:10,860
She was kind enough to do so I got in 
touch with Lindsay and I said,

223
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,790
I know that this is a terrible time,
but you've got a professor who supports 

224
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,880
you.
I knew that these gentlemen also would,

225
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,150
uh,
and then quickly I as quickly as I 

226
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,731
could,
I wrote an op Ed for the Toronto Star 

227
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:26,460
that we just again to saying this is 
happening.

228
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,960
The world needs to be aware of it,
but it was really after that,

229
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:32,040
uh,
that Monday after the story broke on the

230
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,840
Saturday,
we started to talk and,

231
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,390
and how can we,
how can we assist Lindsey and,

232
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,090
and how can,

233
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,190
oh,
the orbit helped you.

234
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,110
And the fact that the star ran it was 
quite remarkable as well.

235
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,850
So hurry to the star.
The Star really does want to do its best

236
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:49,650
to champion free expression.
Yeah.

237
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:52,200
Well you'd think journalists would 
actually be concerned about that to some

238
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,620
degree.
Think they are.

239
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:58,621
Like,
one of the things that's happened to me 

240
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:00,061
in the last year is that although the 
press coverage of what I did just to 

241
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:03,991
remind people.
So last year I made a video about bill 

242
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,441
[inaudible],
which was the bill who's provisions 

243
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:07,300
Lindsay Shepherd theoretically 
transgressed against.

244
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:11,110
Just to be clear about that,
and when I first made the video,

245
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,960
I was accused by all sorts of people,
including journalists,

246
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:14,890
have,
um,

247
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,490
well first of all,
making unnecessary noise and being 

248
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:20,590
unnecessarily alarmist,
which were the minor accusations.

249
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,510
And then the more major accusations were
that,

250
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,820
you know,
I was all the things that you'd expect a

251
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:25,450
far right.

252
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,850
I'm an agitator to be a bigot and a 
transphobic and racist and all of these 

253
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,210
things.
And so,

254
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,200
but what was interesting was that the 
journalists,

255
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,630
by and large,
especially the main journalists,

256
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,460
turned around on that issue really 
quickly.

257
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,580
It was probably within three weeks 
because what happened was a couple of 

258
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,761
them actually went and read the policy 
documents that I had referred to on the 

259
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:52,440
Ontario Human Rights Commission website,
which are still there and which are 

260
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,990
still appalling and have led exactly to 
this situation with Lindsey.

261
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,940
And as soon as they read what I had,
uh,

262
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,090
being uh,
uh,

263
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,800
what,
what outing,

264
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:04,801
let's say in my video,
then they started to understand that 

265
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:06,580
this was,
that I wasn't just ringing a bell for no

266
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,440
reason at all.
It was actually reasonable,

267
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:13,441
I think,
of people to go after me to begin with 

268
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:15,601
because Canada is such a safe and 
peaceful place and our political 

269
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:19,171
situation and economic situation has 
been so stable that when someone comes 

270
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:19,540
out and says,
look,

271
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:24,130
we're in danger of making a major error,
the logical first response should be,

272
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,500
no,
there's something wrong with you.

273
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,600
It's like we're flying.
There's something wrong with you.

274
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,940
Right.
Exactly.

275
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:32,800
Well in Indiana.
So it's reasonable.

276
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:37,801
I think it was reasonable for me to be 
hit hard in the aftermath of doing that 

277
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:38,650
because,
well,

278
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,740
generally speaking,
whistleblowers in Canada are alarmist in

279
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,750
Canada.
Have very little to be alarmist about 

280
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:46,750
this.
This.

281
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:46,750
Okay.
So now,

282
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,100
so fine.
So this thing happened with Lindsay.

283
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,830
What have you seen happening on the 
Wilfred laurier campus?

284
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,130
Things that I'm not particularly proud 
of,

285
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,570
I would say.
I mean,

286
00:13:55,571 --> 00:14:00,340
I knew that a will and some other 
colleagues were going to come to the aid

287
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:05,341
of Lindsey,
but I was thinking that once her 

288
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:07,951
recording became public that we would 
just have a flood of professors coming 

289
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:11,910
to support our cause,
which is we had a lorry,

290
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,130
a statement for freedom of expression 
modeled on the Chicago statement.

291
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:17,260
We thought that immediately people would
just say,

292
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:22,261
of course we need to reinforce that this
needs to be the primary mission free 

293
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:27,541
expression,
free inquiry needs to be the primary 

294
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:27,541
mission.

295
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:27,790
And we got that a pretty fast.
We really did.

296
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,380
And uh,
and,

297
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,380
and uh,
and got it on change.org.

298
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:37,381
And then where I was emailing everybody 
that I knew and trying to get people 

299
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:39,940
interested and I would say out of 50 
emails I sent,

300
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:44,260
I got 15 signatures from personal 
relationships.

301
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,770
So even with personal relationships,
you could only get a 30 percent hit 

302
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,951
rate.
So what do you think's stopping 

303
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:54,140
professors from signing that say are 
clambering on board,

304
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:57,350
especially in the aftermath of the 
shepherd recording,

305
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:02,351
which we should point out.
This is one of the things that's very 

306
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:05,021
interesting is that outside Wilford 
Laurey and perhaps outside universities 

307
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:12,311
that are in the same boat,
the reaction to that recording was 

308
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,160
universal,
right?

309
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,350
And and national and international and 
uniform.

310
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,630
And the reaction was,
what the hell.

311
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,690
This is scandalous.
There's nothing about this that is 

312
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:25,690
acceptable.

313
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,290
Right?
And so what's what struck me is so 

314
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,811
remarkable is that even though there's 
been international outrage over this 

315
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:36,041
and,
and very and not an outrage of a sort 

316
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:39,440
that's only been disputed by a very 
small number of people,

317
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,690
at least to begin with,
Wilfred laureate responded on mosques,

318
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:45,950
let's say as if this was somehow 
debatable.

319
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,230
You know,
as if there were two sides of the story 

320
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,230
here,
let's say.

321
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,230
And I thought,
well,

322
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,930
I thought Rambo Canada and Pim Lot who 
were the professors,

323
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,270
did what they did.
I thought it was appalling for in 

324
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,160
upgrading her and in the manner in which
they did it and in the language that 

325
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,271
they used.
But I thought what was truly terrifying 

326
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:10,121
was the presence of Adrian Joel at that 
inquisition because she was a 

327
00:16:10,121 --> 00:16:14,260
administrator who was hired specifically
to do exactly what she was doing by 

328
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,170
legislated necessity on the part of the 
Ontario Liberal government.

329
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Right.
Because it wasn't just the university 

330
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,851
that was involved in this.
Her position was set up because of 

331
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,341
legislative necessity,
which is something also to keep in mind 

332
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:27,341
when we're going after the university's.
Okay.

333
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:30,110
So you had a hard time getting faculty 
on board.

334
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:34,310
How many faculty members didn't sign it 
out of,

335
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,180
out of how many faculty?
Five hundred and 50 full time and now.

336
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,490
And so you say,
well what's going on with them?

337
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:41,570
Well,
I think that some.

338
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,420
Maybe,
I know this is hard to believe,

339
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:49,421
but maybe unaware.
Even now there's a big proportion that 

340
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:50,460
are unaware.
I unbelievable.

341
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,030
I think.
Okay,

342
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,460
well that's it's own mystery because I 
don't know where you'd have to have been

343
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,490
in the last month to not have noticed 
that this has happened,

344
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,430
that people perhaps in the sciences,
the computer sciences,

345
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:02,330
the math,
they,

346
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,230
they've got their head down and they're 
doing the research and and so and so.

347
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't think there's anything 
diabolical there.

348
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:13,001
I think that as well.
I've got very few signatures from the 

349
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:16,960
business faculty meet some,
but a lot of people just aren't engaged.

350
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,380
It's a bit of a commuter school a little
bit so I think people are just getting 

351
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:22,970
on with their research and their 
teaching.

352
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,120
Maybe not aware of.
Well that's a.

353
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,140
that's an interesting thing in and of 
itself because I think part of what's 

354
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,641
led to the occupation of the university,
let's say by the radical postmodern 

355
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:38,900
types is the proclivity of the 
scientists in particular,

356
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,080
but also I would say the more serious 
scholars to be focusing narrowly on 

357
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,110
their field of inquiry,
which is essentially what they should be

358
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:50,010
doing and not paying attention to any of
the broader contextual issues.

359
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,200
Which is actually a perfectly fine 
strategy.

360
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,250
When things are going well,

361
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,080
but a terrible strategy when they're 
not,

362
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,590
and what you also see,
so we've got these people who might not 

363
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,790
be aware and we've got the,
the few who are aware and are supporting

364
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,880
maximum free expression,
but then you've got these other people 

365
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,370
who are convinced that maximum free 
expression,

366
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,980
free inquiry is not a good thing for a 
university.

367
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,640
And,
and those people are definitely 

368
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,471
congregated within the arts and the 
humanities and they justify it because 

369
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:22,611
they are applying a social justice lens 
or what they would call a critical 

370
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:25,220
theory lens to this entire,
this entire issue.

371
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,550
And,
and how,

372
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:29,850
how about a quick summary of critical 
theory or critical theory?

373
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:34,851
I mean in a nutshell,
it's an idea that came from the 

374
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:38,001
Frankfurt school in Germany.
It transfers over to Columbia 

375
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:38,001
University.
Uh,

376
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,590
it is some German scholars who are 
Marxists.

377
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,680
And what they are saying is that a 
Marxism as an economic unit or as an 

378
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:48,570
economic philosophy really doesn't work.

379
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,570
It doesn't transfer very well,
but let's change it over to a social 

380
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:53,570
theory.
And it's a,

381
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,890
it's a theory of oppressor and 
oppressed.

382
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:57,750
And it's very bifurcated,
you've,

383
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,590
you are either one or the other and if 
you are the oppressed,

384
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,870
you're good.
And if you're the oppressor,

385
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:05,460
you're bad.
And it's as simple as that.

386
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:07,380
There's no nuance or okay,
I'm,

387
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,440
I'm being as bad as they are to to.
So I'm giving you the really broad 

388
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,701
strokes on this,
but essentially it does set up the 

389
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:18,230
villain and the victim.
And,

390
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:23,280
and it is the idea that we must do 
everything to silence the villain,

391
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,050
the oppressor,
and to center the oppressed.

392
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,970
Yes.
And then we will elevate the oppressed.

393
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,150
And same thing happened essentially with
the French,

394
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,030
a deconstructionist to 1970.
It is.

395
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,980
So this is,
this is the motivation behind it.

396
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,100
But when,
when you hear them talk about critical 

397
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,670
theory,
it is not critical thinking.

398
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:49,671
There's a big difference.
And so parents will hear while they're 

399
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:49,671
teaching critical theory.
Isn't that a good thing?

400
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:54,170
No,
because critical thinking means I'm 

401
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:54,170
going to show you both sides of this 
argument.

402
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:59,060
Critical theory means I'm going to 
deliberately give you one side of the 

403
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,841
argument.
I'm going to tell you who's right and 

404
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:05,151
I'm going to tell you who's wrong.
There's an oppressor and oppressed the 

405
00:20:05,151 --> 00:20:05,151
oppressors,
the bad guy.

406
00:20:05,151 --> 00:20:09,240
The oppressed is the good guy and it's a
very manipulative way of.

407
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,840
Okay.
So,

408
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:10,530
uh,
so,

409
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,860
so there's,
let's say two reasons why people 

410
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,260
wouldn't sign the,
the,

411
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:16,890
the,
uh,

412
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,980
the petition one is they're doing 
something else and they're just not 

413
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:21,980
interested in it.
And,

414
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,320
and,
and fair enough,

415
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,480
even though I think that that's 
dangerous at the moment.

416
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,520
The second is that they're actually 
philosophically or ideologically opposed

417
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,590
to the proposition.
Right.

418
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,840
And so to what degree do you think the 
ladder is the determining factor behind 

419
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,540
the relatively small degree of support 
that you,

420
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,460
that you guys have been able to draw 
out?

421
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:42,960
The big thing that the,
uh,

422
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,010
a group of faculty signed an open letter
to the University of about the

423
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,220
violence.
Uh,

424
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:49,830
and,
and that,

425
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:54,831
the,
that the administration needed to make 

426
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:54,831
the campus safe.
Yeah.

427
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:56,050
They did the same thing with me after I 
made my video.

428
00:20:56,051 --> 00:21:01,051
I was,
I made the campus unsafe and 200 people 

429
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:01,051
signed up.
He signed a petition.

430
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:01,051
Yeah.

431
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,570
What does unsafe mean?
I mean this is the problem.

432
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,320
The the,
the left,

433
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,770
the far left are taking words that have 
a traditional meaning,

434
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:16,771
a traditional definition,
and they're blowing that definition 

435
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:17,470
completely,
completely away,

436
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,640
and and at one time,
harm meant that there was an infliction 

437
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,110
of damage that would have lasting effect
and it would compromise the appearance 

438
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,380
or the function,
right?

439
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:31,570
We can think about damage to a car,
right,

440
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,350
lasting and it's affecting the,
the appearance or the function.

441
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,050
That's what harm is,
but they've stretched that definition so

442
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:44,051
that it becomes meaningless.
That my an objectionable idea becomes 

443
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:46,870
harm,
that that when you show a video,

444
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,620
you've made a place unsafe and that

445
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,260
that's the language of trigger warnings 
and safe spaces,

446
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:58,060
but it's disingenuous that there was a 
trans rally and one of the speakers said

447
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,130
that,
letting I can quote this,

448
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:05,131
apparently letting Peterson's views be 
heard in the classroom is violence is 

449
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,400
violence.
Yeah.

450
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:06,940
Right,
right.

451
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,040
Yeah.
Yes.

452
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,870
You can react with violence.
Yes.

453
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:15,871
Well,
that's often what I think that I've 

454
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:17,431
thought a lot about.
One of the tenants of postmodernism 

455
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:18,910
left,
so I would say of critical theory,

456
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:22,120
but particularly of postmodernism in 
it's more Marxist variance,

457
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:27,121
is that the only motivation for the 
construction of hierarchies is power and

458
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:29,470
you think,
well that's.

459
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,400
No,
there's lots of reasons for producing 

460
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,400
hierarchies,
right?

461
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,340
There's hierarchies of competence,
there's hierarchies of interest,

462
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:38,650
there's hierarchy,
hierarchies of aesthetic quality,

463
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,800
like there's all sorts of.
Wherever you can make a qualitative 

464
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:43,800
judgment,
you make a hierarchy.

465
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,820
So there's the idea that power is the 
only driving force between behind the 

466
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,240
construction of hierarchies is 
absolutely preposterous.

467
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,710
So you think,
well why in the world would anyone make 

468
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,930
that claim that it's only power that 
exists while as far as I can tell,

469
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,990
at least one of the reasons is that it 
justifies the use of power and if you 

470
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,950
have your position because of power,
which is basically tyranny,

471
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,430
then I'm fully warranted in my use of 
power against you.

472
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:14,431
That's all there is.
So I think it's a great justification 

473
00:23:14,431 --> 00:23:14,431
for it.
Okay.

474
00:23:14,431 --> 00:23:18,811
So how many people signed the petition 
stating that the campus had become 

475
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:20,380
unsafe?
That was like 79,

476
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,580
79.
Just like that.

477
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,690
Okay,
so you got more people signing a 

478
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:27,940
petition claiming that what shepherd did
made the campus on Save,

479
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,530
then you did getting some.
Okay,

480
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:34,531
so that's interesting because one of the
things we're going to address later is 

481
00:23:34,531 --> 00:23:37,120
the president's letter as a consequence 
of the inquiry into the Lindsay Shepherd

482
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,010
affair,
and one of the things she says,

483
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,360
I'm a people who've tried to downplay 
what happened at Lindsay at Wilford 

484
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,250
Laurey have said basically

485
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,050
two or three things.
One is that,

486
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:55,410
well,
the shepherd is not to be trusted and 

487
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:55,410
she's really like a.
a,

488
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,440
a subtle arm of the right wing.
That's one.

489
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:01,610
One.
And that she's a reprehensible 

490
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:01,610
character.
Yes.

491
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:01,610
Yes.
There are Pedrosa.

492
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:01,950
I know they.
They directly went after it.

493
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,280
I'm quite sneaky that way.
The second is that pim lot,

494
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,610
ramboo Canada and Joel misinterpreted 
Bill [inaudible],

495
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,490
which I think is absolutely 
preposterous.

496
00:24:12,491 --> 00:24:15,730
I think they interpreted exactly the way
that it was written,

497
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:20,731
especially if you consider the 
surrounding policies and that's what I 

498
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:23,221
was warning about last September and the
third is that this was an isolated 

499
00:24:23,381 --> 00:24:28,381
incident and doesn't truly reflect the 
reality either of Wilfrid laurier or 

500
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:30,760
other campuses and not stated explicitly
in the president's letter,

501
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,270
and so that's one of the things I wanted
to discuss because I don't buy that.

502
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,300
I think this wasn't an anomaly.
This wasn't people stepping out of line 

503
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,950
and I think the proof of that is not 
what Rambo candidate or pim law,

504
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,570
because we could say,
yeah,

505
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:48,571
yeah,
they're ideologically committed 

506
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:50,520
professors and they and they're.
They're not very professional in their 

507
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,301
administrative abilities and they went 
after a Ta unprofessionally and 

508
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:54,301
stupidly.

509
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:54,820
That's bad.

510
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,870
That's not really bad.
What's really bad was that there was a 

511
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,860
paid administrator at the meeting who 
was hired to do exactly that,

512
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,070
and so the fact that she was there is 
the proof to me that this is not only 

513
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:13,111
not an isolated incident.
It's actually a logical and it logical 

514
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:18,981
and inevitable consequence of 
legislative moves that made these 

515
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:23,060
bureaucratic positions necessary and the
practical reality that these 

516
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,380
administrative positions do exist on the
campuses.

517
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,860
So there's no isolated incident issue 
there.

518
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:34,010
Now,
how do you think Lindsay's been treated 

519
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,010
at Wilfrid laurier?
Like what's your,

520
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,630
what's your impression of her,
of her personal situation there?

521
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,740
I think that,
so on the positive side,

522
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,460
there have been students who have 
rallied to her support and that's been 

523
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:50,951
really encouraging to see a,
it was some students on campus who are 

524
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,260
dedicated to freedom of expression.
They mostly are coming from the 

525
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,930
conservative clubs,
uh,

526
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,640
whether it's the conservative political 
club or other conservative groups.

527
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Uh,
although definitely invitations have 

528
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,600
been extended to other groups of other 
political stripes or other.

529
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,750
They really haven't rallied to Lindsey,
sadly.

530
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:17,010
Uh,
so those students have to a certain 

531
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,141
extent,
befriended her or brought her under 

532
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:21,830
their wing or just began associating 
with her and saying,

533
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,920
how can we support you?
I think in her classes,

534
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,100
and I'm just going from what I've seen,
I follow her on twitter,

535
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,000
so I see what's been going on there 
apparently,

536
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:36,550
and I don't think this is inaccurate,
the other Grad students are being quite 

537
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:37,130
scathing.

538
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,480
Yeah,
that's what I've heard from her and from

539
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:42,450
her tweets is that at least they're cold
at minimum,

540
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:47,451
they're cold and the professors as well,
including the one who told her that she 

541
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:50,160
couldn't use her laptop in class because
she didn't want to be recorded.

542
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,370
I mean,
you couldn't script this level of 

543
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:55,370
idiocy,
but my.

544
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,110
My thought is students always ask me a 
Dr Hascall,

545
00:26:57,111 --> 00:26:59,120
can I record what you're talking about?
I say,

546
00:26:59,121 --> 00:26:59,600
yes,
yes.

547
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,510
The answer is yes.
The answer's yes.

548
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Because you know what?
I don't say anything in my class that I 

549
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,200
wouldn't publicly say because I and I 
want to be accountable.

550
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,630
I want people to know what I'm saying in
my class.

551
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,000
I want them to know I'm fair.
I'm balanced.

552
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,730
I present both sides of the argument.
I'm not afraid of that.

553
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,420
I mean,
why are people afraid of accountability 

554
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:22,420
that that's beyond my understanding.
Yeah.

555
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:22,420
Yeah.

556
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,140
Well that's,
that's a very good,

557
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,180
that's a very good question.
So,

558
00:27:25,181 --> 00:27:25,900
okay,
so,

559
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,240
um,
I think,

560
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,100
I think what we'll do now is go through 
this letter because what happened 

561
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,190
yesterday I guess is the president had 
appointed a third party fact finder to 

562
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:41,220
look into what happened with the Lindsay
Shepherd Fair.

563
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,250
Right.
And there were concerns about that 

564
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,761
because many people,
including Christie Blatchford were 

565
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:50,731
concerned,
and the lawyer that's representing 

566
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:51,430
Lindsay Howard,
Howard Levin,

567
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,640
was concerned that the person who was 
appointed to do the third party 

568
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,061
investigation wouldn't be neutral 
because he had tweeted his agreement 

569
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:04,681
with a variety of,
let's call them politically correct 

570
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:07,171
issues quite publicly,
but it doesn't look like he's done a 

571
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:09,781
credible job.
That that's what it appears to me 

572
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:12,030
anyways.
The president who is very closed mouth 

573
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,230
or new assiduously neutral about this 
whole affair has released a report and I

574
00:28:16,421 --> 00:28:21,421
thought we could go through it and talk 
about whether or not we think that it 

575
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:23,020
addressed the issues reasonably so 
because I think it did in some part,

576
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:24,280
but I think it didn't in others.

577
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,370
So this is from mcclatchy.
Deborah mcclachi,

578
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,380
Phd,
who's the president and new vice 

579
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:34,380
chancellor at Wilford Laurey and 
relatively new at it,

580
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,020
so she's really been raked through the 
coals thoughts for sure.

581
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,080
She was still vice president academic,
which is the second most senior 

582
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,260
physician for the last five or so.
She's accustomed to this.

583
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,760
Okay.
Okay.

584
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,850
It is.
I believe it is time for some clarity 

585
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,820
around the events of the past few weeks 
here at Wilfrid laurier university,

586
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:53,830
stemming from the very regrettable 
meeting,

587
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,170
so that's an interesting turn of phrase 
to begin with.

588
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,010
That followed the showing of a TV.
Oh,

589
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,020
clipped by a teaching assistant during a
tutorial as the newly appointed 

590
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,710
president and vice chancellor of this 
incredible 106 year old institution.

591
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,980
I'm here to set the record straight and 
announced some important changes.

592
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,370
The issue has highlighted some 
deficiencies but input,

593
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,100
but as importantly at is created 
opportunities.

594
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,410
Yeah.
Well to me that's a.

595
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:22,620
that's a kind of marketing doublespeak.
It's like we could just go with the 

596
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,371
deficiencies issue for now.
Opportunities for Laurie to improve our 

597
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:28,000
own performance,
to lead a broader discussion on academic

598
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:33,001
freedom and freedom of expression and 
opportunities to work together as a 

599
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:36,370
community to demonstrate the strengths 
we have as an institution.

600
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,030
When the issue first broke,
I erred on the side of caution as a 

601
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,030
person,
as a president,

602
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,160
as the president of Laurie am sensitive 
to the viewpoints and concerns of our 

603
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,620
students,
staff and faculty.

604
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,830
As an employer,
I am cognizant that the four people who 

605
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,650
were in that meeting room,
our employees and one is also a student.

606
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,850
All four are entitled to due process.
I did not want to rush judgment.

607
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:03,030
Rather,
I wanted to ensure we were able to 

608
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,861
objectively assess the facts and make 
sound decisions flowing from that 

609
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:04,861
assessment.

610
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:09,480
That seems reasonable enough.
And I would say the events that have 

611
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,510
transpired probably justified her 
approach.

612
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,790
Um,
although I had taken issues with some of

613
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:16,180
the things that she had said and not 
said when she was on the agenda,

614
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,240
but whatever.
We hired an external fact finder with 

615
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,331
expertise in human resources issues.
I have received the report and we are 

616
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:26,380
taking decisive action to ensure these 
events will not be repeated.

617
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,790
The report along with what we already 
knew has led me to the final conclusions

618
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,820
following conclusions and actions.
There were numerous errors in judgment 

619
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,801
made in the handling of the meeting with
Ms Dot Lindsay Shepherd the Ta of the 

620
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:42,190
tutorial and question.
In fact,

621
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,980
the meeting never should have happened 
at all.

622
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Okay.
That's probably the most damning 

623
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,160
statement and the entire report I would 
say because she.

624
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,900
And then she says no formal complaint 
nor informal concern relative to a 

625
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:54,900
lorry.

626
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,030
A policy was registered about the 
screening of the video.

627
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,250
This was confirmed in the fact finding 
report.

628
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,200
Okay,
so we can take that apart a little bit.

629
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,230
No formal complaint.
Okay.

630
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:10,231
So Rambo Kana claimed that one or more 
students had complained.

631
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,920
He wouldn't say how many and he wouldn't
say what the nature of the complaint 

632
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:16,920
was.
Now,

633
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,180
what this document seems to indicate 
that is that,

634
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,640
well,
if there was a complaint,

635
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,670
which it leaves vague,
there was nothing that would constitute 

636
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,640
a genuine complaint in an administrative
sense and that's why the meeting should 

637
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,450
have never happened.
So I guess one question would be,

638
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,860
um,
what if any appropriate disciplinary 

639
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,800
action should be taken against Rambo 
Mckenna and pim lot.

640
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,680
And I don't know the answer to that 
because you know,

641
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,700
they're not administrative experts and I
don't think faculty can be,

642
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:51,030
but by the same token,
I don't feel like I understand exactly 

643
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:54,760
what happened to bring about the meeting
to begin with.

644
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,960
Do you guys know?

645
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,860
I mean,
whatever we do know we've had to piece 

646
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,710
together from different media reports 
because as has been said,

647
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,010
uh,
our president is not releasing the 

648
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,590
findings of this like this is,
this is going to be,

649
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:12,020
this is a secret.
The Independent investigation.

650
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,690
We will never know what it actually 
says.

651
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:16,850
We don't know what all the 
recommendations are.

652
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,950
We,
I think we can take her at her word that

653
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,510
she's telling us what's

654
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,270
and why is she making it secret or 
keeping it secret?

655
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:24,450
Is that,
is that the,

656
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:26,750
this concern with,
what do you call it?

657
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:28,820
Confidentiality.
That seems to be the,

658
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,260
the what,
the,

659
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,580
the camouflage behind which these things
are always hidden.

660
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,170
That seems to be implied and,
or even said explicitly,

661
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:41,620
but I've seen other cases where been 
disciplinary measures and,

662
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,050
and we,
we get more details than this.

663
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,010
Right?
So,

664
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,040
so I don't know.
I don't know the level of 

665
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,040
confidentiality that is required under 
law,

666
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,690
but what I can say,
and I'll let,

667
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,460
will talk about what the disciplinary 
actions can be.

668
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,880
Let's keep in mind that when Ramboo 
Canada said that there had been a 

669
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,200
complaint and it says here that there 
wasn't,

670
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,640
he then echos that in his apology to 
Lindsay.

671
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,500
He then says,
of course,

672
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,330
I'm,
I'm paraphrasing here,

673
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:14,750
so I'm not being completely accurate in 
terms of what he exactly said,

674
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,960
but he said something like,
of course there are things I can't 

675
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,300
discuss because of the complaint that 
was made by a student.

676
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,780
So he's echoing what seems to be an 
untruth and while this is about

677
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,120
closest statement,
as you might imagine in a statement like

678
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:31,040
this,
stating that it was an untruth,

679
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,100
I mean he said,
she said no formal complaint nor 

680
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,410
informal concern relative to a lorry.
A policy was registered.

681
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:40,100
I mean,
that's,

682
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,090
that's

683
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,330
Huh.

684
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,900
That's as close as you could get.
Two coming right out and saying that the

685
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:49,600
statement that there was a complaint was
a falsehood.

686
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,600
And I just want to follow that thread 
for a second.

687
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:57,140
So here we have a controversy that was 
started on an untruth and it seems to be

688
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,320
that this is part of the whole modus 
operandi here when we're here and 

689
00:34:06,901 --> 00:34:10,260
there's been harm and it's unsafe 
violence,

690
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,510
daily violence.
Although again,

691
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,130
when the media,
global,

692
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:19,131
National News,
Globe and Mail checked in to see if 

693
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:21,510
there were any police reports related to
any harassment or any threats.

694
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,700
No police reports had university of 
Toronto.

695
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,260
So.
So at some point,

696
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:28,360
don't we have to say there was a boy who
cried wolf.

697
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,150
Well this is even,
this is more egregious.

698
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:33,500
Even though then claiming harm,
I mean because you know,

699
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,330
maybe people were getting nasty tweets 
and so forth and I suspect they were,

700
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,910
um,
but the thing is,

701
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:44,911
is that Rambo Canada and pim lot 
directly claimed that there had been a 

702
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:44,911
complaint.
Right?

703
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:47,670
And so that's a big problem that isn't 
thoroughly addressed

704
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,300
well,
and in either somebody,

705
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,520
uh,
heard about the tutorial and the fact 

706
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,080
that a Peterson video was shown a and 
uh,

707
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:01,580
kind of found out somehow,
but he decided that was unacceptable

708
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:07,290
and that the right way to approach it 
was to claim that a student had 

709
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:07,990
complained because it's not a problem 
that he found it.

710
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,080
It's not such a big problem that he 
found unacceptable.

711
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:14,680
Let's say it is his class,
like he has a right to talk to,

712
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:19,681
is ta about what's going to be shown and
what's not going to be showing even 

713
00:35:19,681 --> 00:35:20,890
though he handled it.
I think reprehensive in that meeting,

714
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,990
but he could come out and say look like 
that is what the sort of thing I want to

715
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,120
be discussed in my class.
I don't agree with Peterson.

716
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:30,220
I think he's a jerk.
And like,

717
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,560
here's the other things you should be 
concentrating on,

718
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,560
but to come out and say a student 
complained and then to buttress that the

719
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,370
accusation

720
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,830
that she had violated federal and 
provincial law as well as the university

721
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:46,690
bring in and I don't understand why Joel
was there without some sort of follow up

722
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:50,550
paper work or evidence of a,
of a complaint.

723
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:50,950
Well,
I,

724
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:52,080
I think that the,
the,

725
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,320
the,
the reason for that is that the 

726
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,841
positions that people like Joel occupy 
are so ill defined and so fundamentally 

727
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:02,900
reprehensible in their organization and 
their,

728
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,570
in their aims is that this is exactly 
the sort of thing that you would expect.

729
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,430
And so I thought she didn't say much in 
that little inquisitorial recording,

730
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:16,431
but I thought the thing she did say were
spectacularly concerning.

731
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,070
Let's put it that way.
The way the discipline.

732
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,600
What,
what,

733
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:22,590
what is the discipline?
Do you have any sense of this?

734
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,060
Like I,
I,

735
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,530
I can't speculate.
I don't know.

736
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,780
Communications are uh,
well what,

737
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,380
what happens when somebody lies or when 
somebody brings forth that complaint 

738
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:34,500
that wasn't a complaint.

739
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,760
I will.
That is that.

740
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,790
Well,
that's one of the things this document 

741
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:40,790
does not address,
like it's a big problem.

742
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:44,370
It's a big problem.
If there was no complaint and the reason

743
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:49,371
she was disciplined was because there 
were because there was a claim that 

744
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:50,100
there was a complaint like that's well 
we can,

745
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:53,370
we don't have to beat that to death 
claim that there's harm.

746
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,820
What about if there's a claim that the 
campus has daily violence?

747
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,200
What if there's a claim that such and 
such area has become unsafe?

748
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,380
Does that need to be proven or should we
be seeking disciplinary action against 

749
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,430
people who are making those claims?
That's a very good,

750
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,840
that's a very good question.
Okay,

751
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:10,540
so,
so that's,

752
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,840
that's a,
that's a problem that isn't addressed in

753
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:13,980
this report.
It's a big one.

754
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,390
Okay.
And,

755
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:20,391
and I mean the president is obviously 
not happy with this because she also 

756
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:24,480
says the errors in judgment.

757
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,940
Okay.
No formal complaint,

758
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:30,600
no informal concern was registered about
the screening of the video.

759
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,760
This was confirmed in the fact finding 
report.

760
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:34,590
So they're not beating around the Bush 
about this.

761
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:39,591
There are stating very clearly the 
errors in judgment were compounded by 

762
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,560
misapplication of existing university 
policies and procedures,

763
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,920
basic guidelines,
basic guidelines and best practices on 

764
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,641
how to appropriately execute the roles 
and responsibilities of staff and 

765
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:55,740
faculty were ignored,
not just not understood,

766
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,290
ignored or not understood.
Okay.

767
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,570
That's a pretty damn damning statement 
there too.

768
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:05,870
So I don't even know how the particular 
here I heard Howard levins say that she 

769
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:11,571
was entitled to some sort of represent.
Lindsay was entitled to some 

770
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:14,421
representation under the bylaws of our 
university and she was supposed to have 

771
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:14,490
had that,
that nobody offered that.

772
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:20,390
Right.
So that's an administrative followup at 

773
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,311
the level of employee employer 
relationships to say nothing of the 

774
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:25,610
academic issues at stake here.
We don't have policies and procedures 

775
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,790
about how to carry out and acquisition 
and that's not what she's saying.

776
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,500
I think there's a med eval document that
you can use,

777
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,240
but one thing Jordan,
I'd want to point out here is that the 

778
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,240
errors and were compounded

779
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,520
by misapplication of existing university
policies,

780
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,190
misapplication of existing university 
policies.

781
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,400
At the end of this document,
she's going to say that our gender and 

782
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:47,530
sexual violence policy needs to be 
reviewed.

783
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,170
So which is,
it was,

784
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,630
right.
Was it an error,

785
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,890
an application or an error in policy 
and,

786
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,750
and that's.
This is confusing.

787
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,410
Yeah,
it is.

788
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,790
Because my suggestion would be the 
policy is terribly flawed.

789
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,850
We have a colleague who's one of the 
free speech proponents at our 

790
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,610
university,
Dr Andrew Robinson.

791
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,730
He is an expert in human rights law and 
he went through our gendered and sexual 

792
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,901
violence policy with a fine tooth comb 
and he says this document is unworkable.

793
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,530
It makes thought a crime.
And he wrote an op Ed to that effect.

794
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,300
So my point would be,
and what,

795
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:28,340
and who did he,
what organization is he part of 

796
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,340
interest?
Yeah,

797
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,340
but which,
which,

798
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,540
which,
which,

799
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,310
uh,
human rights and human diversity.

800
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,510
I mean,
that's exactly.

801
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:32,810
It says field.
Yes,

802
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,450
exactly.
And so when he looked at this,

803
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:39,451
he says,
this goes beyond what the Ontario 

804
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:42,001
government was even asking for.
And it gets to the point where it 

805
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:45,961
actually makes.
You can be guilty of thought crime.

806
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,600
You can be guilty of transphobia without
any intent if someone,

807
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,180
if someone says,
I've been harmed mentally,

808
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,810
that is enough for conviction under this
particular policy.

809
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,810
It's the same with the Ontario Human 
Rights Commission's policies.

810
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,980
Intent doesn't matter.
So this isn't in this application.

811
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,280
I'm,
I'm saying,

812
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,710
did Adriana Joelle actually get it 
right?

813
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,360
And so is that a misapplication or do so
it'll be interesting if the university 

814
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,920
does discipline her,
if she gets legal representation,

815
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,980
who claimed that she was actually 
applying the policies correctly because 

816
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:22,980
that is the question.
Right?

817
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,370
So,
but it could be two things.

818
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:29,371
It can be the policies are flawed and 
this is the consequence and they were 

819
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:29,371
misapplied.

820
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:31,600
We don't know,
but if there's definitely ambiguity here

821
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:33,130
and that,
and that's a crucial issue.

822
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:38,220
I think Lindsay was guilty under the 
gender and sexual violence policy and 

823
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,120
she was.
Adrian was accusing her.

824
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,280
She was [inaudible].
Uh,

825
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,030
it would have been an Ontario human 
rights code violation,

826
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:51,270
but GSP,
she was right if there had been a 

827
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,270
complaint.
Right,

828
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,320
right.
Okay.

829
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,700
Okay.
And how many angels can dance on the 

830
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:57,700
head?
Okay.

831
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
Procedures in how to apply university 
policies.

832
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,930
Same issue here and under what 
circumstances were not followed the 

833
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,591
training of key individuals to meet the 
expectations of the university and 

834
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:10,720
addressing such an issue as an issue as 
such as this was not sufficient and must

835
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,340
be improved.
Okay.

836
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,790
The question is who are these key 
individuals?

837
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,830
Do they mean Rambo cannot pim lot and 
Joel is they,

838
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,350
are they putting all three of those in 
there?

839
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:25,470
And then the next question would be how 
are they going to improve the training 

840
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:30,151
of key individuals?
Because that actually worries me as a 

841
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:30,151
faculty member,
right?

842
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:33,571
Because whenever the administration 
decides that it's going to engage in 

843
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:34,370
some additional training of faculty

844
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,710
members,
then that raises the hair on the back of

845
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:37,140
my neck.
Like,

846
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,400
is this unconscious bias training?
Is that what they're talking about?

847
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,280
Which has been.
Well I think,

848
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,270
uh,
I can't remember.

849
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:49,271
I've just read recently,
no himself who developed the iat just 

850
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:52,901
published a review paper stating clearly
stating clearly that attempts to reduce 

851
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:56,330
unconscious bias by explicit explicit 
training.

852
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:59,500
There's no evidence whatsoever that they
have any positive effect.

853
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:03,150
And that was nozick himself who helped 
develop the IAT [inaudible],

854
00:42:03,151 --> 00:42:05,240
the little coterie that develop that 
test.

855
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,650
I'm a chair of the Harvard Psychology 
Department.

856
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,680
I'll remember her name in a minute.
Green walled Anthony Greenwald and 

857
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,440
Nozek.
What's her name?

858
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:20,530
Mazda three of them developed it.
They're starting to fragment a bit 

859
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,440
because the thing is being pushed way 
too hard.

860
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,620
Right?
It's not a test that's valid for the 

861
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,931
purposes that it's being put to and they
know it perfectly well even though 

862
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:31,100
they're consulting about it and have 
made quite an enterprise out of it.

863
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,300
But no,
Zack is,

864
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:37,550
you know,
it seems to be a pretty credible 

865
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:37,550
scientist and he's actually looking at 
the data and it's clear that the,

866
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,270
these unconscious bias training programs
have zero positive impact.

867
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,090
There's some evidence that they have 
negative impact because of course people

868
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:46,910
don't like being accused of being 
unconscious racists.

869
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:51,911
Right.
So I'm wonder is that the kind of 

870
00:42:51,911 --> 00:42:53,771
training,
and there's nothing in here that says 

871
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,081
this,
but this is the problem that it says 

872
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:58,271
there will be training unconscious bias.
Is that the same as systemic 

873
00:42:58,271 --> 00:42:59,060
discrimination?
Well,

874
00:42:59,061 --> 00:43:04,061
it's the,
it's the neurological equivalent of 

875
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:04,061
systemic discrimination,
so imagined discredit,

876
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:07,220
systemic discrimination is built into 
the structure of the system,

877
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:12,370
right?
Unconscious bias is built into your 

878
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:15,341
perceptual structures.
So even before you act or think you're 

879
00:43:15,341 --> 00:43:18,770
biased towards against the members of an
outgroup that's the claim,

880
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:22,040
and not only biased in against the 
members have outgroup,

881
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,510
which is a different claim that biased 
in favor of your ingroup,

882
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,200
which of course almost every human being
is,

883
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:29,030
especially if you think about your 
family,

884
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,980
but that,
that,

885
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,040
that implicit bias also manifests itself
in behaviors that would essentially be 

886
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,730
categorizable as racist,
at least at a low level.

887
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,240
And there's very little evidence that 
the implicit bias that this test,

888
00:43:44,241 --> 00:43:48,350
hypothetically measures,
manifests itself in measurable behavior.

889
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,250
So

890
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,040
we went through a thing in the summer 
where they ran a regression on salaries 

891
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,600
at lorry and found that women were paid 
a little bit less than men by about four

892
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:01,900
percent.
And so they gave all the time

893
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,460
include jade,
did they include age as a covariate?

894
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,900
The answer to that would be no.
The model was a,

895
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:09,940
it had,
um,

896
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,890
rank,
uh,

897
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,100
and I don't know that it had,
it only had four categories of professor

898
00:44:16,101 --> 00:44:20,090
though when this has been done at 
University of Michigan for instance,

899
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:24,290
because I looked at comparables,
they had 21 categories of professor,

900
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:29,030
uh,
or 21 departments at ours.

901
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:30,770
We had four.
So you were comparing,

902
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:36,620
for instance,
within the business school who might be 

903
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,160
in marketing versus someone who.
Well,

904
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:43,161
I know,
I know from setting up regression 

905
00:44:43,161 --> 00:44:45,110
equations ad nauseum that the,
the covariates that you included in the 

906
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,590
equation determine the outcome of the,
of the,

907
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:48,830
of the year equation,
the conclusion they reached,

908
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,280
the explanation for the statistical 
significance of the Jenica efficient was

909
00:44:52,281 --> 00:44:54,290
systemic discrimination,
right?

910
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:54,920
Right.
Of course.

911
00:44:54,921 --> 00:44:55,290
Well,
that,

912
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,610
that wasn't the conclusion they reached.
That was the conclusion.

913
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:03,610
They stepped into the inquiry width and 
they gerrymandered the statistics until 

914
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,110
they found a regression equation that 
supported their,

915
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,240
their initial claim.
So that was,

916
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,990
that's not an inquiry,
but.

917
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,150
So there's,
what I hear you saying is there's really

918
00:45:11,151 --> 00:45:16,151
no scientific basis for this idea that 
there could be this unconscious bias 

919
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:20,380
that could drive.
There is evidence that were full of 

920
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,950
unconscious biases,
I mean we couldn't even see if we didn't

921
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:26,951
have unconscious biases because we have 
to use shortcuts and heuristics to just 

922
00:45:26,951 --> 00:45:31,121
process the world.
The issue is what measurable impact does

923
00:45:31,281 --> 00:45:36,281
that have on behavioral?
That's the first thing and it's minimal 

924
00:45:36,281 --> 00:45:36,281
at best.
First of all,

925
00:45:36,281 --> 00:45:39,740
it's not easy to distinguish between 
racial bias and novelty avoidance,

926
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:45,190
right?
Because what you'd have to do is you'd 

927
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,190
have to find a person,
interracial group,

928
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,050
say a white person who is just as 
familiar with black people as with white

929
00:45:48,051 --> 00:45:53,051
people and then show that there was a 
bias because otherwise you can't 

930
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:53,420
distinguish it from a novelty,
novelty aversion,

931
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,850
and people are characterized by novelty 
aversion.

932
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,530
You already have developed a preference 
for that cop over this cup.

933
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,360
I mean it happens that quickly and it's 
that.

934
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:05,360
It's that subtle and great and grand,
let's say.

935
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:10,600
So the first issue is we can't really 
distinguish unconscious bias from 

936
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,690
perceptual habit,
let's say,

937
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:15,410
or from or stereotyping from 
categorization for that matter,

938
00:46:15,411 --> 00:46:20,411
and that literature is being under 
assault in a major way in the social 

939
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:23,471
psychology literature.
But even assuming that an implicit bias 

940
00:46:23,471 --> 00:46:24,380
does exist,
which you might,

941
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:29,950
there might be grounds for by noting 
that people do have an in group 

942
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,730
preference safe for their family members
and perhaps even for the racial members,

943
00:46:31,731 --> 00:46:36,731
although it's hard to distinguish that 
from novelty or from familiarity 

944
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:37,550
preference,
putting all that aside,

945
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:43,030
which you can't.
There's no evidence that these courses 

946
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,321
that are put in place to reduce that 
bias have any effect whatsoever on the 

947
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:48,170
bias it's complete.

948
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,440
Even the people who are pushing the IAT 
and the idea of implicit bias are 

949
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:53,540
willing to say,
well,

950
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:57,080
all these things that we're doing to try
to reduce it have absolutely no effect.

951
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:58,970
Or if anything,
a negative effect.

952
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:04,060
And again,
just we don't know that what the 

953
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,741
training is going to be.
I guess where we went down this rabbit 

954
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:05,741
hole was we don't know what the training
is going to be.

955
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:06,200
Right?
We don't know.

956
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:11,970
We have no evidence to assume.
We have no reason to assume that the 

957
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,700
training is going to address the proper 
problem and every reason to be skeptical

958
00:47:13,701 --> 00:47:14,780
that it won't.
Okay.

959
00:47:14,781 --> 00:47:16,730
So next,
um,

960
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,450
there is also institutional failure that
allowed this to happen.

961
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:25,810
Well,
we don't know what that means because 

962
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:25,810
I'd like to know what the institutional 
failure was,

963
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,440
but that's a pretty broad and she says 
when,

964
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:28,880
when there is institutional failure

965
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,580
ultimately starts and ends with me,
well that's a nice statement and okay,

966
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:38,581
she's taking responsibility for it,
but unless it's specified what the 

967
00:47:38,581 --> 00:47:39,100
institutional failures are,
it's just hand waving.

968
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,520
Going forward,
we will implement improve training and 

969
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,060
new procedures and engage in a very 
specific administrative review.

970
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,360
Details would be nice to strengthen and 
enhance confidence in what students and 

971
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,140
employees can expect it.
Lori specifically,

972
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,350
there was no wrongdoing on the part of 
Ms.

973
00:47:56,351 --> 00:48:01,351
Dot Shepherd in showing the clip from 
Tvo in her tutorial showing a video clip

974
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:06,691
for the purposes of an academic 
discussion is a reasonable classroom 

975
00:48:06,691 --> 00:48:06,880
teaching tool.
While thank God for that,

976
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:11,910
given that Ti vo is a publicly funded,
a middle of the road left leaning,

977
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:15,970
liberal news media establishment,
a credible one for sure.

978
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:21,180
I wish that early on immediately 
following this story breaking that 

979
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:28,770
administration had said exactly that 
because remember for more than a month 

980
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:31,420
now the public,
the Canadian public has wondered,

981
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:36,810
can you show tv Ontario videos in 
classrooms that Lori,

982
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,270
right,
and I'm not.

983
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,350
I'm not joking.
Yeah.

984
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,540
Like this was this and there has not 
been an answer from administration on 

985
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:47,500
that.
Very basic question.

986
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:52,501
Yeah,
and so people who are thinking about 

987
00:48:52,501 --> 00:48:52,660
sending their kids to l'oreal are 
thinking,

988
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:57,661
is that the place where they didn't know
whether or not you could show public 

989
00:48:57,661 --> 00:49:02,521
television in a classroom?
Is that the place where it took a 

990
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:07,110
independent investigation to come to the
conclusion that it's okay to play a clip

991
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,770
from the agenda that we still don't?
Yes,

992
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:14,320
exactly.
It is the place where all of that was in

993
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:19,321
doubt.
That is Wilfred laureate is the place 

994
00:49:19,321 --> 00:49:19,810
where those things were in doubt and so 
they're not quite as in doubt,

995
00:49:19,811 --> 00:49:21,760
but we also still don't know what else 
is.

996
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,550
What else is still in doubt.
Right.

997
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:26,170
Because if that can be you wonder,
well,

998
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,120
you know,
that's pretty damn innocuous.

999
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,240
Okay.
Any instructional material needs to be 

1000
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,971
grounded in the appropriate academic 
underpinnings to put it in context for 

1001
00:49:35,971 --> 00:49:36,820
the relevance of the learning outcomes 
of the course.

1002
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:39,760
Yeah.
Well,

1003
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:44,761
the questionnaire is any instructional 
material needs to be grounded in the 

1004
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:46,960
appropriate academic underpinnings.
To put it in context,

1005
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:51,961
the question there is who decides what 
the appropriate academic underpinnings 

1006
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:54,810
to put it in context are because that's 
supposed to be the.

1007
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,090
That's supposed to be the bailiwick of 
the professor period.

1008
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,300
Right,
and with with some leeway for the for 

1009
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,561
the teaching assistance and so on.
But I worry when I hear about context 

1010
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:10,590
because I've seen opinion pieces from 
some of my colleagues who tell me that 

1011
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:15,151
the appropriate context is within the 
frame of social justice or within the 

1012
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:16,930
frame of critical theory.
Well,

1013
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:21,931
that's what I'm kind of said to shepherd
was that while part of the reason you 

1014
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:23,440
were wrong was because you portrayed it 
neutrally.

1015
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:28,130
If you had contextualized it essentially
have you had connects July's Peterson

1016
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,130
as Hitler,
which was Rambo kind of statement than 

1017
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,651
it would have been perhaps appropriate 
to to to edit the video and that is 

1018
00:50:35,651 --> 00:50:37,430
equivalent to leading the witness.
Right.

1019
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:42,610
And leading the witnesses when we have a
lawyer up an authority figure telling 

1020
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,841
the person on the stand what to say,
taking my ideas and putting them into 

1021
00:50:46,841 --> 00:50:47,530
that person's mouth.
Right.

1022
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,580
Well that's how you produce unconscious 
bias.

1023
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,430
But.
But my point would be,

1024
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:56,250
so I'm not saying that this is in here,
but we really need clerical error.

1025
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:57,140
Well that's,
that's a.

1026
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,200
that's a sentence that doesn't.
That I'm not happy about appropriate 

1027
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,221
academic underpinnings.
To put it in context for the relevance 

1028
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:06,740
of the learning outcomes of the course.
Jesus.

1029
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,950
It's just administrative.
Double speak the whole way through.

1030
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,000
You present in class in order.
The criteria for evaluating that.

1031
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:16,280
I,
I showed videos all the time.

1032
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,280
Every class says they have the adequate 
underpinnings.

1033
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,110
Yeah.
Well that's.

1034
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:24,270
That's the question is who decides that 
did the.

1035
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,420
The answer to that.
There's a simple answer to that.

1036
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,550
The professor.
That's the answer.

1037
00:51:28,551 --> 00:51:30,740
There isn't another answer.
There's no board,

1038
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:33,770
there's no higher authority,
there's nothing else you know,

1039
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:38,771
and I show I do show clips from Hitler 
in my class and my personality class 

1040
00:51:38,771 --> 00:51:40,070
when we talk about orderliness and 
totalitarianism,

1041
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:45,071
I show clips from the triumph of the 
will and I show this other documentary 

1042
00:51:45,071 --> 00:51:47,000
called Crumb,
which is about,

1043
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:52,380
uh,
an underground cartoonist from the 19 

1044
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,421
sixties named Robert Crumb.
And it is an absolutely shocking 

1045
00:51:55,421 --> 00:51:58,661
documentary,
like if you ever wanted to know more 

1046
00:51:58,661 --> 00:51:59,210
than you want to know about rapists and 
serial killers,

1047
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:01,460
that documentary will tell you.
It's really,

1048
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,360
it's a tough.
It's a tough watch.

1049
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:07,580
No one,
I can't,

1050
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:13,420
I can't imagine a like a committee 
reviewing my teaching materials and 

1051
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,340
allowing those things to go forward 
without challenge.

1052
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,580
It'd be a disaster.
Okay.

1053
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:25,280
The ensuing discussion also needs to be 
handled properly.

1054
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,530
Yeah.
Well,

1055
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
we have no reason to believe this 
discussion was not handled well in the 

1056
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,000
tutorial in question.
Okay.

1057
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,920
So whatever handled property means 
Lindsay Shepherd managed it,

1058
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,220
which I think is a good sign here 
because if we take that as the model,

1059
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,390
Lindsay did present the information 
neutrally.

1060
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,030
Yeah.
And,

1061
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,670
and she was not taking sides and if 
that's our model,

1062
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:47,600
that's,
that's a good sign.

1063
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:48,350
Okay,
that's good.

1064
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:49,370
So that's acceptable

1065
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:56,410
by this,
because we're going to three or four 

1066
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,631
paragraphs.
Find out that we need enhanced training 

1067
00:52:58,631 --> 00:52:58,631
for tea.
Great.

1068
00:52:58,631 --> 00:53:01,330
So did she handle it properly?
Why do we need to treat it?

1069
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,730
The training?

1070
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:02,930
Yes.
That's row on.

1071
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:07,950
And again,
who's going to do the training because 

1072
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,871
it's not going to be the faculty because
the faculty don't have time or the 

1073
00:53:09,871 --> 00:53:13,561
inclination for that matter to run that 
kind of trains are going to be the 

1074
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:13,561
diversity and equity.
Yeah,

1075
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:13,561
right.
Well,

1076
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:15,460
that's the question.
Who's going to do the training?

1077
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,980
I have apologized to ms dot shepherd 
publicly,

1078
00:53:17,981 --> 00:53:22,981
as has Dr Lew Rambo Khanna,
who's supervising professor the 

1079
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:27,271
university has conveyed to her today 
that the results of the fact report to 

1080
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:31,221
make the results of the fact finding 
report to make sure she understands it 

1081
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:33,240
is clear that she was involved in no 
wrongdoing.

1082
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,170
Yes.
Well,

1083
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,650
for someone who is involved in no wrong 
doing,

1084
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:39,630
she should bloody well got raked over 
the coals for the last month.

1085
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:45,140
So the university is taking concrete 
steps to make changes to ensure this 

1086
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,110
doesn't happen again.
Yeah,

1087
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:46,950
well good.

1088
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:52,460
It has been made clear to those who were
involved in the meeting with Ms Dot 

1089
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,701
shepherd that their conduct does not 
meet the high standards I set for staff 

1090
00:53:55,701 --> 00:53:55,701
and faculty.
Well,

1091
00:53:55,701 --> 00:53:56,730
that is a big question there.
Right?

1092
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:02,010
How has it been made clear to those who 
were involved in the meeting with Ms Dot

1093
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:07,010
Shepherd?
That their conduct does not meet those 

1094
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,010
high standards?
Because we don't know.

1095
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,850
Does that mean that the president talked
to them as there'd being disciplinary 

1096
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:11,100
action like we,
we.

1097
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:16,190
Because if it was,
I don't even know what would be 

1098
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,471
appropriate,
but I would say that not knowing what 

1099
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:21,750
was done is not appropriate.
So,

1100
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:27,950
and I think it deserves specifics.
I mean that's what got me into this was 

1101
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:32,110
the Christie Blatchford,
his article was very accurate because 

1102
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,810
she already had the audio,
but then when we heard the audio,

1103
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,990
it was so appalling what was done to her
in that room.

1104
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:40,150
It was such horrible bullying.
Uh,

1105
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,740
and,
and just such a violation of whether the

1106
00:54:41,741 --> 00:54:46,741
university should stand for.
That's what all of the anger,

1107
00:54:46,831 --> 00:54:49,370
I mean in Canada,
the devil's in the details.

1108
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,720
So it's the same with the,
how it has been made clear to those who 

1109
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,071
are involved.
So because I don't mean maybe this is 

1110
00:55:00,071 --> 00:55:04,751
something we could talk about too.
I don't know what would constitute 

1111
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:06,170
appropriate disciplinary measures as a 
concept.

1112
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:11,270
I mean,
you have here three people acting on a 

1113
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:15,131
nonexistent complaint who produced an 
international scandal that damaged 

1114
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,980
lindsay in a real sense,
although it might have also made her 

1115
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980
stronger,
but it certainly,

1116
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,290
it certainly didn't have to because a 
lesser person would have crumbled.

1117
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:29,320
I don't know if she would feel that she,
I think she might take exception to 

1118
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:29,320
that.
Uh,

1119
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,280
she certainly has not claimed any kind 
of victim status through this whole 

1120
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,941
thing and I think that no,
but that's more a testament to her 

1121
00:55:36,941 --> 00:55:40,061
character than,
than anything else because I mean she 

1122
00:55:40,061 --> 00:55:41,540
was subject to the kind of attacks I 
would say that would have snowed under a

1123
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:46,010
lesser person,
but she has risen to this challenge.

1124
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,090
Yes,
definitely,

1125
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,020
definitely.
Well,

1126
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:48,290
and,
and,

1127
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:53,291
and thank God for that.
But then there has been real harm done 

1128
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:56,000
to the university as far as.
I don't know how you would quantify that

1129
00:55:56,001 --> 00:55:58,640
and financial terms,
but I suspect it's substantial.

1130
00:55:58,641 --> 00:56:03,641
But reputational terms,
I mean now I would say internationally 

1131
00:56:03,641 --> 00:56:04,520
this is what Wilford Laurey is known 
for,

1132
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:07,220
so maybe that's an overstatement,
but I don't think so.

1133
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,070
As these are individual employment 
issues,

1134
00:56:10,071 --> 00:56:12,770
I cannot go into greater detail on any 
individual case.

1135
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:17,950
Well that could be but know that the 
university has and is taking action to 

1136
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:22,121
rectify the situation and send a clear 
signal that this cannot and will not 

1137
00:56:22,121 --> 00:56:23,890
happen again.
That sounds pretty forthright.

1138
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:24,580
Yeah,
it is.

1139
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:30,750
One key improvement highlight is the 
need to enhance our faculty and Ta 

1140
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,570
Training.
Yeah.

1141
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,150
Well,
like I said,

1142
00:56:34,151 --> 00:56:37,180
as a faculty member,
whenever I see that I don't see the role

1143
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:40,780
of the administrators at a university to
to train the faculty.

1144
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:45,930
That's not their role.
Their role is to move paper around for 

1145
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:49,861
the faculty.
Fundamentally it is the responsibility 

1146
00:56:49,861 --> 00:56:53,161
of course,
instructors to develop guidelines for 

1147
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:53,230
the roles and expectations of their tax.
Fair enough.

1148
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,470
The university also has high 
expectations of professors.

1149
00:56:56,471 --> 00:57:00,130
As Ta supervisors,
we recognize the need to do more in this

1150
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:05,131
area.
We wreck the university's intent is to 

1151
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:09,451
enhance the training and support for 
both the supervisors and teaching 

1152
00:57:09,451 --> 00:57:10,780
assistants,
making these mandatory and standardized.

1153
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,660
That's my favorite part.
Jesus.

1154
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,280
Dismal.
So that.

1155
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:20,310
So my suspicions as a skeptic are that 
the making of training for faculty,

1156
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:29,310
Mandatory and standardized will do more 
harm than this scandal has done over the

1157
00:57:31,691 --> 00:57:32,170
long run.

1158
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,440
So we don't know what the training is.
We don't know who's going to do it.

1159
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:36,910
We don't know what it's going to be 
about,

1160
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,230
but the one thing we do now,
is it

1161
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,870
mandatory?
Mandatory and standardized,

1162
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,160
right?
Yeah.

1163
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:48,190
Mandatory and standardized.
Be Interesting to see how they'll do 

1164
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:51,251
that too because it isn't so easy to 
make training mandatory for faculty 

1165
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:51,251
members.
Right?

1166
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:55,390
You can't just do that by fit because 
they can generally tell you to go to 

1167
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,220
hell and should gendered and sexual 
violence policy.

1168
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:04,540
It has become clear to us that managing 
the new gendered and sexual violence 

1169
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,651
policy,
now that's the one that's mandated by 

1170
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:08,651
the provincial government.

1171
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:13,180
So it was bill a one 63,
the provincial bill that said you need 

1172
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,620
to have a policy on gendered and sexual 
violence.

1173
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,640
According to our colleague Dr Andrew 
Robinson.

1174
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:24,670
He says,
we go way beyond what the province even 

1175
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,730
asked for to the point where it becomes 
unmanageable and,

1176
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:29,480
and you have instances of thought crime.
So.

1177
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:34,510
So that's what we have like this like 
this where you can claim that somebody 

1178
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,330
is transphobic for simply showing a 
video.

1179
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,660
Can I.
Can I read you?

1180
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:44,690
The definition is this from the gender 
is from our policies,

1181
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:49,870
from our policy.
It is an action that reinforces gender 

1182
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:52,410
inequalities resulting in physical,
sexual,

1183
00:58:52,411 --> 00:58:53,880
emotional,
economic,

1184
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:54,660
or mental harm.

1185
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:57,350
Okay,
so what's the first part of that again?

1186
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:57,880
Yes.

1187
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,240
Yeah.
You get lost,

1188
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:04,241
don't you?
It is an action that reinforces gender 

1189
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:04,241
inequality.
Okay,

1190
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:09,030
so let's start with that.
An action that reinforces gender 

1191
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:10,330
inequalities.
Okay.

1192
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:15,331
So the first thing we might point out is
that no one knows what the hell that 

1193
00:59:15,331 --> 00:59:15,331
means,
right?

1194
00:59:15,331 --> 00:59:20,040
It's a box that you can put anything in.
So actions that's a problem because 

1195
00:59:20,351 --> 00:59:25,351
what?
It isn't obvious to what constitutes an 

1196
00:59:25,351 --> 00:59:25,351
action or an inaction for that matter.
So I mean,

1197
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:29,780
and then that reinforces gender 
inequalities,

1198
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:31,280
right?
So that,

1199
00:59:31,281 --> 00:59:36,281
that's,
that's the sort of sentence that only 

1200
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,681
someone who's ideologically possessed to
the maximum would create because you 

1201
00:59:38,681 --> 00:59:40,130
can't parse it.
Gender inequalities.

1202
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,740
Like what does that mean exactly?
I don't.

1203
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,650
Well anyways,
discrimination,

1204
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,590
sex or gender,
it doesn't talk about discrimination.

1205
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:50,690
It talks about inequality,
right?

1206
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,650
Which is,
which is,

1207
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,170
it would be different if,
if the,

1208
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,790
the phrasing had included the words 
discrimination.

1209
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,360
Okay.
And the next part is a resulting in 

1210
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:01,360
physical,
sexual,

1211
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,240
emotional,
economic or mental harm.

1212
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,290
Right?
Right.

1213
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:05,510
So it says broadly construed,
both,

1214
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:09,170
both clauses are as broadly construed as
they can be,

1215
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:13,700
and the reason for that is to allow 
maximum scope per interpretation,

1216
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,740
which is exactly what happened with 
Adrian Joel.

1217
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:16,910
Well,
mental harm,

1218
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:17,960
again,
mental harm.

1219
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,790
And,
and as you pointed out,

1220
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,720
mental harm is not backed up by the 
empirical evidence apart from 

1221
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
posttraumatic stress syndrome,
like cognitive behavioral therapy would 

1222
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,111
suggest that you actually can do mental 
good by exposing someone to 

1223
01:00:35,111 --> 01:00:39,221
objectionable ideas when they've eaten 
in moderation in order to help them 

1224
01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:40,600
become less mentally fragile.
Uh,

1225
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,130
Scott Lilienfeld out of emory 
university,

1226
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:45,790
very credible scholar.
Well,

1227
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,630
he is one of the mass.
He's written several textbooks on psycho

1228
01:00:49,631 --> 01:00:50,450
pathology,
right?

1229
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:55,451
He knows his stuff and just this year he
put out a paper where you explored the,

1230
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:59,090
the empirical evidence around 
microaggressions,

1231
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:03,200
and he did all of the literature and 
microaggressions that are of course,

1232
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,500
these innocuous actions that are deemed 
to be bigoted or,

1233
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:12,840
or somehow sexist.
It's rudeness essentially.

1234
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:17,210
They are actually.
It's showing a video of from Tvo is what

1235
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:20,390
a microaggression is.
And what he said was,

1236
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:25,540
there is absolutely no evidence.
There's no evidence that 

1237
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:28,790
microaggressions,
these objectionable ideas lead to mental

1238
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:29,180
harm.

1239
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:34,500
He also said that the,
the concept itself is extraordinarily 

1240
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:34,680
ill defined,
which is also a big problem.

1241
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,210
That was the beginning of our 
conversation.

1242
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,660
Everything is if you make the box big 
enough,

1243
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:41,890
you can put anything into it

1244
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:47,230
and and what you see in this gender and 
violence policy that will,

1245
01:01:47,231 --> 01:01:52,231
is reading from there,
they're actually go on to say that this 

1246
01:01:52,231 --> 01:01:52,231
can include

1247
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,590
Heterosexism,
like you can be your,

1248
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,310
your mental crime can be heterosexism.
Yeah.

1249
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:03,360
So what if I said something in class,
like the empirical evidence strongly 

1250
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,150
suggests that raising children in a two 
parent family leads to better outcomes,

1251
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:10,480
which it does by the way,
like it like and seriously it does that.

1252
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,700
Then also that's the question of,
well arguably right?

1253
01:02:14,701 --> 01:02:16,350
Arguably our transcripts,
that policy.

1254
01:02:16,351 --> 01:02:20,070
Now here's an interesting thing too,
so it has become

1255
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,160
clear to us that managing the new 
gendered and sexual violence,

1256
01:02:23,161 --> 01:02:28,161
Paul's,
he has led to a confusion in its 

1257
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:28,161
application.
Right.

1258
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,161
Okay.
So this is back to the issue we 

1259
01:02:31,161 --> 01:02:32,541
described earlier.
Is it a confused confusion in the 

1260
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:33,180
application or in the policy?
Now you just read the damn policy.

1261
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:38,660
Now it seems to me that there's no way 
you could apply that policy without 

1262
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:42,231
confusion,
so it's not a confusion in its 

1263
01:02:42,231 --> 01:02:42,231
application,
its.

1264
01:02:42,231 --> 01:02:45,860
It might also be that,
but it's a confusion in the policy 

1265
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:45,860
written right into it.
Okay,

1266
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,340
so that's.
That's of crucial importance,

1267
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:49,270
right?
It,

1268
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:54,410
in fact,
the interviews conducted by the fact 

1269
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:55,860
finder confirmed that the rationale for 
invoking the GSV P did not exist.

1270
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,740
It was misapplied and was a significant 
overreach.

1271
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:04,100
Yeah.
I'm not so sure about that because I 

1272
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,131
know that these kinds of policies emerge
from the same sort of policy framework 

1273
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:09,090
that characterizes the Ontario Human 
Rights Commission.

1274
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:13,350
It's the same people doing it and the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission policies

1275
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:18,351
are written so that they can be broadly 
misapplied with no significant 

1276
01:03:19,051 --> 01:03:20,550
overreach.
So.

1277
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:21,990
So.
Okay,

1278
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:27,080
so that's a problem.
To provide clarity of the policies 

1279
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,741
intent and to strengthen accountability.
We will engage in an administrative 

1280
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:35,451
review with the goal of finding the 
appropriate structure to oversee and 

1281
01:03:35,451 --> 01:03:37,320
execute the GSPP and its accompanying 
procedures.

1282
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:41,250
We will also undertake a full review of 
the policy and its procedures.

1283
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,150
Okay,
so good.

1284
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:47,330
So they're.
They're saying while it might've been 

1285
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:49,401
misapplied,
but maybe the policy itself also has 

1286
01:03:49,401 --> 01:03:49,401
some problem.
I think

1287
01:03:49,401 --> 01:03:52,350
this is really good news and we had a 
meeting with our colleague Andrew Andrew

1288
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:53,640
Robinson today and we said,
well,

1289
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:54,760
you know,
what do you think about this?

1290
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,560
And he was pleased.
He said,

1291
01:03:56,590 --> 01:04:01,590
you know,
if some good has come out of this 

1292
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:04,180
controversy,
this is one of those good things because

1293
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,300
definitely the gendered and sexual 
violence policy,

1294
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,550
we haven't.
Lori isn't workable.

1295
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:14,850
It is prejudiced against certain people 
and certain ideas and so it needs to be 

1296
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,890
reworked because at this is not an 
inclusive document.

1297
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:18,880
It excludes

1298
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,180
and so it needs to be fixed.
So this is a good thing.

1299
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:27,190
Well,
and it's also a canary in the coal mine 

1300
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:27,300
for similar policies at universities all
across Canada.

1301
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:32,560
We'd say,
and maybe broader because one of one 

1302
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,290
thing you'd hope is that the Lindsay 
Shepherd affair has produced enough,

1303
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:39,291
may be negative repercussions to set 
people back on their heels a little bit 

1304
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:43,191
and make them dig into these policies 
because I can't imagine that there's 

1305
01:04:43,191 --> 01:04:46,730
another university in Canada who would 
enjoy partaking in a scandal of 

1306
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:46,860
equivalent magnitude.

1307
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:50,050
What I would hope,
and on that point,

1308
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:54,490
Jordan,
if someone is a student or if someone is

1309
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:57,250
a faculty member,
ask for the evidence.

1310
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,240
That's what I've learned from this.
There are a lot of claims out there.

1311
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:04,060
Mental harm.
Our campuses become unsafe.

1312
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:07,020
Uh,
the ideas that are contained in the,

1313
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:09,910
the gendered and sexual violence policy.
I'm saying,

1314
01:05:09,911 --> 01:05:14,380
okay,
what is the evidence that proves this?

1315
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,620
Because this is,
this is what a university is to be based

1316
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:17,830
on

1317
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,430
from the enlightenment to today.
We are supposed to be able to say,

1318
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:26,460
here's the evidence for why we do this.
And the further we get away from 

1319
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:29,500
evidence and the more we embrace 
ideology,

1320
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:32,920
we completely remove what the mission of
a university is supposed to be.

1321
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,710
And the idea of evidence,
we removed the idea of evidence,

1322
01:05:35,711 --> 01:05:39,850
which means we remove the idea of 
knowledge because there's no distinction

1323
01:05:39,851 --> 01:05:41,450
between knowledge and evidence.
Right?

1324
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:42,550
Right.
So,

1325
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,460
so if you are a student and you want to 
say,

1326
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:48,490
what can I do say,
what's the evidence of mental harm?

1327
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,800
What's the evidence that,
that this,

1328
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,980
that I'm transphobic.
What's the wealth?

1329
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:58,050
Well,
so partly what you're also saying there 

1330
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:58,300
is a restatement of the old presumption 
of innocence idea.

1331
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,590
It's like,
okay,

1332
01:05:59,591 --> 01:06:01,810
you're accusing me of something.
Prove it.

1333
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,250
I'm innocent.
Adi,

1334
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:05,260
prove it.
Where's your evidence?

1335
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:06,390
Now I know when we do it.

1336
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,450
I know.
Well,

1337
01:06:07,451 --> 01:06:10,810
part of that is tied up with this,
with the sexual harassment issue,

1338
01:06:10,811 --> 01:06:12,690
because increasingly,
and this is,

1339
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:17,700
this is this has started,
I think most particularly the United 

1340
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,450
States,
we're moving towards a preponderance of 

1341
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:21,790
evidence standard instead of a 
assumption of innocence standard.

1342
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:26,850
That's especially true with these sexual
harassment policies that are being 

1343
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:30,060
derived by derive from institutions and 
administrators concerned with such 

1344
01:06:32,351 --> 01:06:35,140
things as the gendered and sexual 
violence policy.

1345
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:40,350
And that.
That's related to the comment you made 

1346
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:40,930
earlier about the lawyer who wasn't 
allowed to speak right,

1347
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:44,830
because she had the temerity to offer 
someone who is accused of a crime,

1348
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:46,840
a legal defense,
right when,

1349
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:51,870
when apparently what we were supposed to
do with just assume that the people who 

1350
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:55,891
were making the accusations were right 
because they claimed that they were 

1351
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:55,891
wronged.
So and,

1352
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:56,860
and to,
to be,

1353
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:58,600
I mean,
we always have to do our caveats,

1354
01:06:58,601 --> 01:06:58,930
don't we?

1355
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:04,170
We say,
I know that we want to protect people 

1356
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:07,060
who are victims like I each of us would 
agree,

1357
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,360
but it can't be done at this sac by 
sacrificing truth.

1358
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:15,420
Well,
you don't protect people from being 

1359
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:15,420
victimized by undermining the rule of 
law.

1360
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,890
No,
quite the contrary because ultimately it

1361
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:19,720
comes back to bite you in the behind.
Yeah.

1362
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:20,860
So that's for sure.
And very,

1363
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:22,420
very rapidly.
So.

1364
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,620
Okay.
In the interim,

1365
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:28,621
we will ensure access to the existing 
support and complaints procedures by 

1366
01:07:28,621 --> 01:07:30,730
providing management and oversight 
through the Austin Office of dispute,

1367
01:07:30,731 --> 01:07:33,100
Resolution and support.
Okay.

1368
01:07:33,101 --> 01:07:34,170
I'm not sure what that means.

1369
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,910
Well,
it's actually very good news.

1370
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:36,630
Okay.
Okay.

1371
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,100
Means that,
uh,

1372
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:43,310
the oversight of this is being removed 
from the diversity and equity office and

1373
01:07:43,621 --> 01:07:45,870
put under the president's direct 
control.

1374
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,320
So she doesn't think that they're 
responsible.

1375
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:52,860
I'm,
and I'm very worried about diversity and

1376
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,040
equity office over

1377
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,610
this suggests that the president should 
be,

1378
01:07:56,630 --> 01:08:01,630
it suggests the president is also 
worried about the diversity and equity 

1379
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,100
office that she has said we're not a 
bit,

1380
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:08,520
but the fact that she has done this is 
really a strong sign that,

1381
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:13,570
that she is aware that that office needs
to be needs to be right or at least that

1382
01:08:14,101 --> 01:08:15,980
she's concerned enough the reputation

1383
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,980
of the university so that she's not 
going to let the same mistake happen 

1384
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:20,980
again,
which is a good thing.

1385
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,250
Like I don't care why she's doing it 
particularly,

1386
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:24,410
but it's a good thing that it is being 
done.

1387
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:25,250
Okay.
So fine.

1388
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:25,990
So that's,
that's a,

1389
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:31,090
that's good news that this has the added
benefit of improved accountability as 

1390
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:33,170
that office reports through to me as 
president.

1391
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:34,130
Yeah.
Okay.

1392
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:39,340
Well you can see in those lines that 
she's not particularly happy about 

1393
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:42,791
what's happened.
I wonder what sort of financial hit 

1394
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:45,011
Wilfrid laurier took because you could 
imagine that while the donors are going 

1395
01:08:45,011 --> 01:08:49,811
to be a lot more conservative than the,
than the professors and the 

1396
01:08:49,811 --> 01:08:49,811
administrators and the students.

1397
01:08:49,811 --> 01:08:50,970
Well,
we have a,

1398
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:54,570
we've been contacted by a group of 
alumni who have now organized.

1399
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,320
They haven't yet released what would be 
their,

1400
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:02,360
their press release,
but slowly they've been reaching out to 

1401
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,350
other alumni and it's the lorry,
a alumni for free expression.

1402
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:09,620
And what they have said is their mandate
is one to withhold all donations until 

1403
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,040
laurie a excepts the Loria statement for
freedom of expression.

1404
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:15,870
And uh,
I,

1405
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:19,560
I haven't checked in.
It was just someone acting on her own.

1406
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,330
Uh,
she's a Lauria alumni.

1407
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:27,170
She has I guess,
contacts within the alumni association 

1408
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:29,940
and she just,
she sent us some contact information and

1409
01:09:29,941 --> 01:09:31,110
said,
here's what I'm doing,

1410
01:09:31,111 --> 01:09:33,930
wanted you to know I support your 
efforts and I'm,

1411
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:36,690
I'm working on this.
I'll let you know when I'm ready to go.

1412
01:09:36,691 --> 01:09:37,860
And so that was really encouraging.
Yeah.

1413
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:42,890
I have a colleague who does a survey of 
chief financial officers quarterly to 

1414
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:47,351
gauge their optimism about the economy 
and started down at Duke and he's 

1415
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:51,091
starting it now for Canada and he got 
responses from to a he because he sent 

1416
01:09:51,201 --> 01:09:52,670
out an email to shortly after this 
broke,

1417
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:55,460
he got responses from two alumni who 
just said,

1418
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,150
you're,
you know,

1419
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:58,100
why should I participate in this?
Why should I help you?

1420
01:09:58,101 --> 01:09:59,810
This is not so I don't have any respect 
for you.

1421
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:01,750
These are alumni of,
of,

1422
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:05,330
of Wilfrid laurier university as well,
and I can imagine too that enrollment is

1423
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:07,040
going to take a pretty vicious hit.
You know,

1424
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:10,430
our business school is quite excellent.
We have a great car program.

1425
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,980
We in the finance area,
tech,

1426
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:16,460
a lot of very strong students and we 
compete for top tier students in Ontario

1427
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,870
of the entry average is like 89 or 
something and,

1428
01:10:19,871 --> 01:10:20,960
and,
and we really could be for the,

1429
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:25,970
what we call the high flyers and they 
can choose any school right in the 

1430
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:26,350
province,
right?

1431
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,070
Yeah.
Well,

1432
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:32,071
it doesn't take much of a hit to a 
reputation to give people who have 

1433
01:10:32,071 --> 01:10:32,071
options,
the reason to go elsewhere,

1434
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:37,110
right.
And then you lose the best people and 

1435
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,110
that's when things really started

1436
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,660
the fall apart and what you might begin 
to see.

1437
01:10:37,661 --> 01:10:40,160
And I would say that this is something 
that uh,

1438
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:45,240
the general public might look at,
watch what happens to the entrance 

1439
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,750
averages in the arts and humanities that
so,

1440
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:48,670
so,
so we might not take a hit,

1441
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:54,540
but let's see if the average is take a 
hit because suddenly and currently the 

1442
01:10:55,031 --> 01:10:59,440
entrance average to get into our general
arts program in communications.

1443
01:10:59,441 --> 01:11:04,441
Let's just talk.
Communications is mid seventies with an 

1444
01:11:04,441 --> 01:11:06,520
average of 60 in English.
So.

1445
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,510
So I,
I don't,

1446
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,620
I mean,
right,

1447
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:09,580
basically

1448
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:12,840
a failing grade because I'm just few 
handy in the NASA.

1449
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:13,950
In high school

1450
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,210
you'll get 60 you really well,
right?

1451
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:21,230
So it's,
it's basically the grading basically 

1452
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:21,230
runs from 60,
it goes zero.

1453
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:23,910
You didn't hand it in 60 to 100.
You handed it in.

1454
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:29,210
And let's keep in mind that the tutorial
that Lindsay was running was a grammar 

1455
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:34,161
tutorial.
The content of which looked a lot like 

1456
01:11:34,161 --> 01:11:34,161
grade six curriculum.
Yeah.

1457
01:11:34,161 --> 01:11:39,140
Yeah.
Well that gets us into a discussion of 

1458
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:39,140
the schools in general,
but we're all ready.

1459
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:43,440
I'm,
I'm thinking that maybe it's not a good 

1460
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:43,680
idea to lower standards any anymore.
Right,

1461
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:44,720
right,
right.

1462
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:45,870
Okay.
Okay.

1463
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:50,960
So academic freedom and freedom of 
expression for those who have chosen to 

1464
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,140
use this incident as an indictment of 
Wilfrid laurier university or the plight

1465
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:59,490
of Canadian universities in general,
I say your assertion is unreasonable and

1466
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:00,330
unfounded.
Well,

1467
01:12:00,331 --> 01:12:01,740
we better stop this interview.
Yeah.

1468
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,430
Yeah.
Well,

1469
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:04,200
you,
you can say that all you want.

1470
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:04,700
I.
Well,

1471
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,800
I would say instead that what happened 
at Wilfrid laurier is a precise 

1472
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,851
manifestation of exactly the sort of rot
that both produced bill [inaudible] and 

1473
01:12:13,851 --> 01:12:18,591
that I was warning about last September.
And so I don't think the assertion is 

1474
01:12:18,591 --> 01:12:21,180
unreasonable in an unfounded at all.
And here's one piece of data.

1475
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:25,350
Eighty percent of humanities papers are 
not sighted once,

1476
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,420
so,
so.

1477
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:31,500
So let's just translate that for the 
viewing public.

1478
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,560
Yes.
That means that they're producing 

1479
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,300
scholarship that nobody looks at that,
that even their friends don't look at.

1480
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,420
And because,
okay,

1481
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:44,421
so what a citation is,
is I read someone's paper and I find a 

1482
01:12:44,421 --> 01:12:45,090
good idea in it,
and then I use that idea to buttress and

1483
01:12:45,091 --> 01:12:46,530
idea of my own or to,
or to,

1484
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:48,780
or to riff off or to,
or to,

1485
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:52,560
or to criticize even for that matter.
And then I cite them,

1486
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:54,300
I say who they were and when they 
published it.

1487
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,690
And then the paper,
the size that there's a huge bureaucracy

1488
01:12:57,691 --> 01:13:02,691
that keeps track of citations and it's a
major indication of academic ability to 

1489
01:13:02,691 --> 01:13:02,910
be cited,
right?

1490
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:03,390
It's,
it's,

1491
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:08,510
it's the,
it's like it's academic payment to be 

1492
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:08,510
cited.
Okay.

1493
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:11,640
So 80 percent of humanities papers don't
get cited once.

1494
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:15,300
It's absolute failures,
absolute failure as a game.

1495
01:13:15,301 --> 01:13:17,990
If someone wanted to play a game,
uh,

1496
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:23,020
I would suggest that they go and they 
look at the publications of the 

1497
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:27,330
professors in a particular area and see 
if the titles all sound the same.

1498
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,770
And if they all say something about 
intersectionality,

1499
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:36,840
a colonialism and,
and these other various,

1500
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:39,750
uh,
social justice words,

1501
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,050
you might wonder,
am I going to get taught the same course

1502
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:43,920
again?
And again,

1503
01:13:43,921 --> 01:13:47,610
by every professor in this program,
because it seems to me that all of their

1504
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:49,290
research is,
is very similar.

1505
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,700
Uh,
and,

1506
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,760
and how can that be when there's such a 
broad base of knowledge and the world 

1507
01:13:55,830 --> 01:14:00,150
that we can have such similarity between
every publication,

1508
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,920
which then goes on.
Why?

1509
01:14:01,921 --> 01:14:05,730
Why do I need to read my colleague stuff
when it's exactly like my own,

1510
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,800
which,
which we see.

1511
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,370
So just just as a baseline Jordan,
how many,

1512
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,100
like what,
what would you say

1513
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:17,100
is,
is someone who is doing some good 

1514
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:17,100
research?
What's,

1515
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:17,650
how many citations would,
would they be receiving?

1516
01:14:17,651 --> 01:14:19,940
Maybe collectively,
like what,

1517
01:14:19,941 --> 01:14:21,160
what are we looking?
Thousands.

1518
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:21,940
Thousands?
Yeah.

1519
01:14:21,941 --> 01:14:23,410
Well a good.
Like if you,

1520
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:29,040
if you write a good paper then like a 
great paypal,

1521
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:31,480
paypal will get you 100 citations,
right?

1522
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:34,520
An outstanding overwhelmingly 
outstanding pay.

1523
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:37,220
I'll get you a thousand citations.
Um,

1524
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,760
10 isn't none.
You know,

1525
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:44,470
if you register with 10,
but zero is that failure.

1526
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:50,010
It means your work had zero impact it,
it means your work wasn't worth the 

1527
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:50,780
paper.
It was published on this.

1528
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,800
This brings us to a kind of interesting 
little issue with regards to the rot in 

1529
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,440
the universities,
which,

1530
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,630
which Deborah mccloud she says does not 
exist.

1531
01:14:58,631 --> 01:15:01,540
It's like,
here's how the game works is that we set

1532
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:04,270
up a little ideological garden,
right?

1533
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:09,271
The 10 of us play in,
and then we all publish in the same 

1534
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:11,380
journal and we peer review each other's 
articles and we just published them.

1535
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,200
There's no critique or very little.
So the,

1536
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:18,790
the barrier for publication is very,
very low when it should be very high,

1537
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:21,400
like a good journal,
a good journal will reject.

1538
01:15:21,401 --> 01:15:23,530
Ninety percent of the papers that are,
uh,

1539
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:24,060
that are,
are,

1540
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:25,120
are,
are,

1541
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,950
are submitted to it,
right?

1542
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:32,190
So rejection rates really matter.
So the question is why do the papers get

1543
01:15:35,441 --> 01:15:38,770
published since no one reads them and 
they have nothing to offer.

1544
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:40,480
And the answer to that is very 
straightforward.

1545
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:46,410
The journals are extremely expensive,
are way more expensive than they should 

1546
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:47,830
be.
So just to buy a single paper online for

1547
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:51,160
the ordinary person is like $40,
which is more than a hardcover book.

1548
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:53,050
That's just a download,
the PDF.

1549
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,900
And so the journal itself,
the libraries are full of them,

1550
01:15:55,901 --> 01:16:00,901
are very expensive and the subscriptions
are very expensive and so what happens 

1551
01:16:00,901 --> 01:16:04,681
is the professors pressure the 
university libraries to by the journals 

1552
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:08,860
and the library funds the publisher and 
so the publishers will publish anything.

1553
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:13,860
Routledge is a good example of that,
much to my chagrin because they 

1554
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,190
published my first book but and they 
used to be a great publishing house,

1555
01:16:15,191 --> 01:16:20,191
but they'll publish damn near anything 
and the reason for that is that the 

1556
01:16:20,191 --> 01:16:22,921
libraries are forced to pay radically 
inflated prices for the publications 

1557
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:28,501
that no one ever reads.
And so people right to publish in 

1558
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:32,641
journals that libraries have to purchase
at inflated prices to produce knowledge 

1559
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:38,340
that no one will ever read.
And that's the little scandal that 

1560
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,030
plagues the humanities.
I think it characterizes the humanities 

1561
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:44,941
more than plagues them.
So the idea that there's no systemic 

1562
01:16:44,941 --> 01:16:45,070
rot,
let's say in the universities,

1563
01:16:45,071 --> 01:16:46,770
especially in the humanities,
is just not right.

1564
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,610
This is just far too general.
There.

1565
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:54,150
There is rot and it's not everywhere and
this just reveals that.

1566
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:57,000
I don't think she's that familiar with 
the situation.

1567
01:16:57,001 --> 01:17:02,001
She's in and,
and I've been listening to some of your 

1568
01:17:02,001 --> 01:17:03,450
work and Jonathan Haidt trying to 
understand what's been going on over the

1569
01:17:03,451 --> 01:17:08,451
last two years in universities protected
as I am in a business school and 

1570
01:17:08,451 --> 01:17:10,220
starting to realize that it's not 
everywhere.

1571
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:14,300
It's social justice perspective.
Fields are fine so far.

1572
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:16,040
Yeah,
and the business schools,

1573
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:18,830
although there are moves into the 
business schools,

1574
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:22,040
but they're still doing all right.
Philosophy is not doing too badly.

1575
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:27,070
Like there are disciplines that have 
still remained untouched and mostly 

1576
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:31,361
what's happened so far is that if the 
discipline has a strong economic or 

1577
01:17:31,361 --> 01:17:35,621
scientific footing,
it's proved much harder to corrupt and 

1578
01:17:35,621 --> 01:17:38,830
empirical for my part.
So I play in the playground of sociology

1579
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:40,610
of religion,
but all my stuff,

1580
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:43,250
well most of my stuff is quantitative so
I actually,

1581
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:45,790
I wasn't familiar with what was going 
on.

1582
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:50,980
I don't.
I go to conferences where everybody has 

1583
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:53,741
to have strong empirical evidence.
I publish in journals that are 

1584
01:17:53,741 --> 01:17:56,801
international journals that are the 
scientific study of religion is what we 

1585
01:17:57,021 --> 01:17:58,160
do.
So,

1586
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:03,360
you know,
I'm familiar with food co and that 

1587
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:03,360
stuff,
but that's not where I play,

1588
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,300
so I wasn't really exposed to what's 
going on and you don't and you don't 

1589
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:07,300
really think.

1590
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,430
Well they kept no reason to be that 
concerned about it.

1591
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:15,390
Well this is it,
but then I'm trying to get into the 

1592
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,280
headspace of some of my colleagues.
So I got out of text book,

1593
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:19,750
it was called race class and gender and 
it's,

1594
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:24,770
it's an anthology that's used in 
cultural studies courses in women's 

1595
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:26,810
studies courses and it sorta the Goto 
text.

1596
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:31,840
So I'm told and I'm reading it and I 
turned it and I turn to page 14 and I 

1597
01:18:32,091 --> 01:18:37,091
can tell you it's page 14 because I was 
so astounded by what I found and it 

1598
01:18:37,091 --> 01:18:37,440
said,
uh,

1599
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:38,600
we the,
Oh,

1600
01:18:38,601 --> 01:18:43,601
it says objectivity as found through 
rational thought is a western and 

1601
01:18:44,331 --> 01:18:48,230
masculine concept that we will challenge
throughout this text.

1602
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:48,710
Yeah,
right.

1603
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

1604
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:53,420
And I said it's too bad.
It's too bad that you're shocked by that

1605
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:58,630
because the want to go for irrational pc
types have been saying exactly that 

1606
01:18:58,731 --> 01:18:59,960
since the 19 seventies.

1607
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,720
Like that is exactly.
Make no mistake about it.

1608
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:05,090
This is why mcclachi is wrong.
This isn't,

1609
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:07,310
this isn't something they're secreting 
in.

1610
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,860
This is the dead statement.
Oh yeah.

1611
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:11,180
They said,
um,

1612
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:16,590
the,
the whole notion of logic and coherence 

1613
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:19,010
and empirical data for that matter.
The evidence.

1614
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:24,430
Let's question,
let's question the definition of 

1615
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:26,891
evidence because the underlying idea.
Remember the underlying idea here is 

1616
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:28,610
that all hierarchies are predicated on 
power.

1617
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:32,900
So if the reason that I put forward 
something as evidence isn't because it's

1618
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:37,901
evidence,
it's because it's evidenced that I get 

1619
01:19:37,901 --> 01:19:39,110
to have that position of power.
And so if you're a postmodernist and you

1620
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:39,440
say,
well,

1621
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:44,441
I'm going to question your evidence,
what you think you're saying is you're 

1622
01:19:44,441 --> 01:19:45,860
going to question my claim to that 
arbitrary power.

1623
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,670
The whole idea that there's evidence 
outside of claims of arbitrary power.

1624
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,520
The postmodernist dispensed without the 
19 seventies.

1625
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:57,670
That's Derrida.
That's exactly what he said in all this 

1626
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:01,811
time.
I've been trying to get samples of 

1627
01:20:01,811 --> 01:20:01,811
thousands so that I could say,
you know,

1628
01:20:01,811 --> 01:20:02,960
this is a little bit.
We can say something,

1629
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,480
God just in generalized.
No,

1630
01:20:04,481 --> 01:20:09,481
no.
That just demonstrates how thoroughly 

1631
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:09,481
entrenched you are in the reining 
patriarchal ideology,

1632
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:14,151
I guess,
and I was just hoping to get beyond 

1633
01:20:14,151 --> 01:20:14,151
anecdotal.
There's no beyond that.

1634
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,770
There's no beyond anecdotal.
That's become a methodology.

1635
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:21,771
That's odd.
It's called auto ethnography is a 

1636
01:20:21,771 --> 01:20:25,671
technical term for it and auto 
ethnography is the publication of a 

1637
01:20:25,671 --> 01:20:29,901
journey of a,
of a private diary essentially in a 

1638
01:20:29,901 --> 01:20:34,460
hypothetically reputable,
reputable academic journal.

1639
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,480
It's only because of in the last three 
or four years that these things have 

1640
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:41,480
been happening and I said,
well,

1641
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,030
where?
Where do they get this?

1642
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,690
How do they,
how do they find these thoughts?

1643
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:46,410
Yes.
Well,

1644
01:20:46,411 --> 01:20:47,040
we don't.

1645
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,560
We don't want to fall into the mistake 
of making,

1646
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,710
of making the assumption that this 
hasn't been thought through.

1647
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:56,670
People are just misunderstanding what 
evidence is.

1648
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,000
That isn't what's happening at all.
When they say they want to question the 

1649
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,241
definition of evidence,
that's exactly what they mean when they 

1650
01:21:05,241 --> 01:21:05,241
say,
we want a question,

1651
01:21:05,241 --> 01:21:10,160
the definition of evidence because the 
definition of evidence currently 

1652
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,030
supports the scientific power structure 
in chemistry say,

1653
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,430
and that's fundamentally dominated by,
let's say,

1654
01:21:14,431 --> 01:21:19,431
white men.
We can go after the definition of 

1655
01:21:19,431 --> 01:21:19,530
evidence itself and that's how we're 
going to bring it down,

1656
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:24,830
and so the next on the hit list are 
going to be the biologists that are 

1657
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:27,000
already under attack from the paper.
It said that mathematics is whiteness.

1658
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,560
Yeah,
yeah,

1659
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:28,790
yeah.
Definitely.

1660
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,280
I didn't know that mathematics could 
have a race.

1661
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:38,020
Yep.
Thinking the thing is there's nothing 

1662
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:38,020
logical about these claims.

1663
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:40,260
Once you accept this central axioms,
the axioms are straightforward.

1664
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,740
The world is a battleground of power 
hierarchies.

1665
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:49,100
That's what it is.
There isn't anything else outside of 

1666
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,891
that,
and each power hierarchy generates its 

1667
01:21:51,891 --> 01:21:55,281
own internal narrative including rules 
for what constitutes evidence that 

1668
01:21:56,731 --> 01:22:01,731
support and buttress the structure of 
that hierarchy and because the 

1669
01:22:01,741 --> 01:22:06,741
hierarchy's exclude,
then it's in the best interests of the 

1670
01:22:06,741 --> 01:22:08,340
people who are excluded to invert the 
hierarchy and of course they also regard

1671
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:12,510
that as just even though that's part of 
the incoherence of the entire argument,

1672
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:14,520
that's where they have to turn to to 
Marxism,

1673
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,340
but make no mistake about it.
This isn't.

1674
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:18,780
This isn't accidental.
It isn't.

1675
01:22:18,781 --> 01:22:21,360
People misunderstanding what constitutes
evidence.

1676
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:22,650
Not at all.

1677
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:27,770
No.
I've been listening to some of your 

1678
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:28,890
lectures on this for the last year and 
thinking you sound a little deranged.

1679
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:31,350
Well,
I,

1680
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:34,290
I might be a little deranged deranged 
about this.

1681
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:39,970
And then this whole episode with Lindsay
Shepherd just proves that in every 

1682
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:42,170
dimension of this is about power.
Uh,

1683
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,650
the double speak,
the,

1684
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:46,910
the changing of terminology from the 
expulsion.

1685
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:49,880
People's ideas could be violent.
The circling,

1686
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:51,920
the sacred,
circling around the victim group.

1687
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:52,530
Well,
look

1688
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:58,040
what happened at Wilfrid laurier.
One of the things that were so bloody 

1689
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,811
interesting that I thought was just 
fascinating was the unbelievably 

1690
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:05,980
strategic attempt to transform shepherd 
into perpetrator and

1691
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,980
Rambo Kana and pim law into the victims,
especially Rocana as a professor of 

1692
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:10,980
color.
Right?

1693
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,640
So,
so what happens,

1694
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,340
the reverse narrative was,
well,

1695
01:23:15,341 --> 01:23:18,850
Lindsay shepherd was using something 
like her white privilege and their white

1696
01:23:18,851 --> 01:23:23,710
tiers to,
to harass a poor professor of color.

1697
01:23:23,711 --> 01:23:26,280
Untenured professor of color.
Yeah.

1698
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:30,160
Yeah.
And that there was every attempt made on

1699
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:35,161
the part of the people who are going 
after shepherd to make that the 

1700
01:23:35,161 --> 01:23:35,161
narrative.

1701
01:23:35,161 --> 01:23:35,161
So

1702
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:40,280
in the they started accusing everyone of
being trans phobic just right out of the

1703
01:23:40,481 --> 01:23:41,920
blocks.
Within days of this,

1704
01:23:41,921 --> 01:23:43,840
we were all tired without epithet.

1705
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:49,640
Immediately labels have been just flying
and without any regard to the intent of 

1706
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,390
the person or even the content.

1707
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:53,310
Here's something interesting about the 
transphobia issue too,

1708
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:58,460
so I've had at least now a number of 
discussions with trans people by the 

1709
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:03,111
way,
but also a number of letters from trans 

1710
01:24:03,111 --> 01:24:03,111
people over the last year,
about 40 of them as a matter of fact,

1711
01:24:03,111 --> 01:24:07,851
which is a lot of letters because there 
aren't that many trans people and every 

1712
01:24:07,851 --> 01:24:11,691
single one of them I think I got one 
letter from a trans person who wasn't 

1713
01:24:11,691 --> 01:24:15,201
happy with what I was doing,
but every single one of the other 

1714
01:24:15,201 --> 01:24:18,171
letters said the same thing.
We are sick and tired of being the 

1715
01:24:18,171 --> 01:24:21,621
poster child for these activists who 
claim to speak in our name because 

1716
01:24:21,621 --> 01:24:25,791
that's another thing that we should be 
very aware of is just because an 

1717
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:28,371
activist comes out and says,
I'm a member of this minority group and 

1718
01:24:28,371 --> 01:24:32,181
therefore I speak for them.
It's like the first time it might be 

1719
01:24:32,181 --> 01:24:35,331
true,
but the second claim is not only just 

1720
01:24:35,331 --> 01:24:35,331
unjustifiable,
it's actually,

1721
01:24:35,331 --> 01:24:38,680
I would say it's,
it's not racist exactly,

1722
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:43,681
but it's groups just because it's 
predicated on the assumption that just 

1723
01:24:43,681 --> 01:24:45,100
because you happen to be the member of a
class,

1724
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,250
that you're a representative member of 
that class,

1725
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:53,280
that class is so homogenous that 
everyone in it is the same enough so 

1726
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:57,631
that all the members within it can speak
for all the other members used to call 

1727
01:24:57,631 --> 01:24:58,660
that racism when it was,
it applied to racial category.

1728
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:03,910
Absolutely.
But Lindsay has been very good to point 

1729
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:06,661
out and so if some of the media that 
there have been a transgendered students

1730
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:12,001
at Laurie who have spoken out in support
of Lindsay and we have to keep this in 

1731
01:25:12,161 --> 01:25:14,350
mind that this is not a transgendered 
issue.

1732
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:19,530
No,
and neither was my comments on bill 

1733
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:22,800
because I mean,
all I know that Lindsey,

1734
01:25:23,381 --> 01:25:26,260
as she even said,
she is not transphobic.

1735
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:29,020
She supports the rights of transgendered
people.

1736
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:31,660
This is,
she's unequivocal in that.

1737
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,590
Uh,
and,

1738
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:35,230
and I think that that's just cover story
her for her.

1739
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:36,640
True,
right beliefs,

1740
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:42,670
and there are transgendered students who
have come to her support and at great 

1741
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:45,340
personal cost to themselves.
Like those are some brave people.

1742
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:50,341
They're right there to break with that 
group that the hostility in that group 

1743
01:25:50,341 --> 01:25:52,900
is real in the activist end of the 
group.

1744
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,440
You Bet.
You Bet.

1745
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:54,650
Yeah.
We're

1746
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:59,650
so quick to take over this issue as 
their own and claim that the,

1747
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:04,010
the debate itself was and

1748
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:09,010
that it was just cover for this 
transphobic climate that existed and it 

1749
01:26:09,301 --> 01:26:11,570
has nothing to do with transgender 
people.

1750
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,910
It's funny too.
You saw the same thing with um,

1751
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:20,200
Rinaldo Walcott when he was on the 
director of the women's in diversity 

1752
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:20,810
women's and gender studies at,
at the,

1753
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:21,900
at,
at,

1754
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:26,910
at the University of Toronto.
He claimed that he claimed like four 

1755
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:30,251
times in that interview that the 
University of Toronto was a white 

1756
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:33,191
supremacist organization.
And I thought I just don't know what to 

1757
01:26:33,191 --> 01:26:36,761
make of that.
Like I traveled down to my office about 

1758
01:26:36,761 --> 01:26:36,780
a week after that,
that,

1759
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:42,250
that interview and I happened by some 
students who were standing outside 

1760
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,960
waiting to write an exam.
So there's about 100 of them may,

1761
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:48,920
and like this is particularly true at 
the University of Toronto.

1762
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:50,060
I would say that

1763
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:56,960
you couldn't look at that group of 
students for more than two seconds and 

1764
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,030
think that that was a white supremacist 
organization.

1765
01:26:58,290 --> 01:27:03,290
I mean it's so ethnically diverse.
If you think that the University of 

1766
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:07,030
Toronto is a white supremacist 
organization,

1767
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,600
then what that essentially means is that
the most tolerant institution in the 

1768
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:17,620
most tolerant city in the most tolerant 
province in the most tolerant country in

1769
01:27:17,621 --> 01:27:21,550
the world is white supremacist.
So it's like,

1770
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:25,940
well then I don't.
I don't,

1771
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:28,820
I don't even know what you could.
Especially when you say that,

1772
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:33,821
as someone who's a full professor,
I don't know if he's a full professor 

1773
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:36,680
who's a professor at that institute.
It's like,

1774
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:41,710
where's your evidence for this?
That same professor was using racial 

1775
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:44,800
slurs against Lindsay.
Oh yes.

1776
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,380
The white tiers thing.
They're also misogynistic,

1777
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,420
right?
Because it's white girl tears.

1778
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,090
I could never ever

1779
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:58,470
do something like that to any student of
any race.

1780
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:03,680
I just don't understand how the people 
on the far left can rationalize that 

1781
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,240
kind of behavior.
It,

1782
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:09,370
it just,
it's so they can rationalize it with 

1783
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:10,590
power,
but in terms of civility,

1784
01:28:10,591 --> 01:28:14,370
just incivility in recognizing the 
humanity in every person.

1785
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:18,420
How can you resort to those kinds of 
racial slights?

1786
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:19,620
I just,
I don't.

1787
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:24,830
I don't understand how you can say don't
be racist and then you make racial 

1788
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,790
comments terribly racist comments.
I just,

1789
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:28,350
I don't under do people.
Well,

1790
01:28:28,351 --> 01:28:33,351
no,
there's the idea there is 

1791
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:34,491
straightforward.
You cannot on her racist comments 

1792
01:28:34,491 --> 01:28:36,360
against the dominant group.
That's the rule.

1793
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:39,670
If there's a dominant group,
so once you identify them as oppressor,

1794
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:44,720
you can say anything you want about them
because by definition this is axiomatic 

1795
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:48,680
in the ideology.
You can't say anything racist about the 

1796
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:48,990
oppressors,
that that's like a rule.

1797
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:53,460
It's a rule of discourse.
So here's where I go with this.

1798
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:57,450
For self interest,
do you not realize when you say,

1799
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,750
I don't care about your efin white 
fragility?

1800
01:29:00,751 --> 01:29:02,100
No,
that not well cut.

1801
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:06,300
Is that as I get his name right?
Walcott,

1802
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,190
Walcott,
he didn't say,

1803
01:29:08,230 --> 01:29:13,230
but others other pundits have said that 
in it's appeared on Lindsay Lindsay's 

1804
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:16,970
twitter page where they've assaulted her
there or that's too dramatic where 

1805
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:19,470
they've made insulted her.
They're insulted her there.

1806
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:21,470
Uh,
but my,

1807
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,520
my point would be,
even in your self interest,

1808
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:28,550
do you not realize that you are giving 
ammunition to the real white 

1809
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:30,960
supremacists?
Do you not realize that there are really

1810
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:36,170
dangerous people on the right who are 
looking for that exact kind of comment 

1811
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,730
to rationalize their behavior?

1812
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:39,400
Well,
if you're trying to burn something down,

1813
01:29:39,401 --> 01:29:42,910
what makes you think you're going to be 
so careful about how it burns down?

1814
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:44,550
And I really mean that.
Look,

1815
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:45,480
I mean I've,
I've,

1816
01:29:45,481 --> 01:29:50,481
I've had,
have interactions with the right wing 

1817
01:29:50,481 --> 01:29:53,820
racial supremacists online.
They're not very happy with me and it's 

1818
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:57,211
because I called them out for the same 
sort of behavior that the leftists 

1819
01:29:57,211 --> 01:29:57,211
manifest,
which is like,

1820
01:29:57,390 --> 01:30:02,390
I don't,
I'm not impressed by your manifestation 

1821
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,530
of group identity,
Uber All let's say.

1822
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:08,070
But I understand that the radical right 
wingers are playing the same game as the

1823
01:30:08,171 --> 01:30:09,640
radical left winger.
So you might say,

1824
01:30:09,641 --> 01:30:11,980
well why would the radical left wingers 
play into their hands?

1825
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,970
I would say,
well,

1826
01:30:12,971 --> 01:30:17,971
if you're trying to,
if you're trying to burn the whole damn 

1827
01:30:17,971 --> 01:30:20,101
house down,
then why not inflame the people who are 

1828
01:30:20,101 --> 01:30:20,101
most likely to do it?
And you might think,

1829
01:30:20,101 --> 01:30:20,510
well no,
that,

1830
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:25,650
that's not in anybody's best interest.
It's like it's the stated aim of this 

1831
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:25,650
ideology,
right?

1832
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:30,361
They want to invert the pie.
They want to invert the Patriarchy 

1833
01:30:30,361 --> 01:30:30,361
essentially.
Well,

1834
01:30:30,361 --> 01:30:34,240
what's the patriarchy while it's the 
White Supremacist University of Toronto.

1835
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:39,100
So who cares if you're handing your 
opponents weapons,

1836
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:44,220
you're hoping that it will escalate that
the people on the left as well as the 

1837
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,130
people on the right.
Yeah.

1838
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:51,790
So its power because uh,
this is the same thing has happened at 

1839
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:55,130
evergreen state and the whole 
justification there was racism.

1840
01:30:55,970 --> 01:30:57,770
I know when they went in after Bret 
Weinstein,

1841
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,320
who is about is,
I mean Brent is,

1842
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:02,840
he's a Bernie.
He's a Bernie supporter,

1843
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:03,920
right,
exactly.

1844
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,950
They eat their own.
Last week from Mike Paris,

1845
01:31:06,951 --> 01:31:11,951
who is the only colleague of his that 
publicly defended him and he emails me 

1846
01:31:12,291 --> 01:31:17,291
and he says,
I've been following the story closely 

1847
01:31:17,291 --> 01:31:17,291
and I just want to reach out and just,
you know,

1848
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:22,660
commiserate with you and wonder is there
anything we can do or talk about it 

1849
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:22,660
together?
And I thought,

1850
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:24,440
no,
you're from evergreen state,

1851
01:31:24,441 --> 01:31:29,441
you know,
that's a nightmare and we're not that 

1852
01:31:29,441 --> 01:31:32,030
bad,
but it's the same pattern repeated.

1853
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:36,940
It's not about transgender people and 
their rights and,

1854
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
and just the victim.
They didn't know the term transgender 

1855
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,380
people.
As far as I'm concerned,

1856
01:31:42,381 --> 01:31:47,381
we're,
we're like sacrificial animals on the 

1857
01:31:47,381 --> 01:31:47,381
altar of bill.
See 16,

1858
01:31:47,381 --> 01:31:49,490
the activists have a new group that's 
oppressed to wave the flag for,

1859
01:31:49,491 --> 01:31:51,420
to push forward their radiology.
And,

1860
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:56,480
and as NSA said,
the consistent message I've got from 

1861
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,610
transsexual people is I wish they just 
shut the hell up and quit putting us out

1862
01:31:58,611 --> 01:31:59,450
in,
in,

1863
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,250
in the public

1864
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:05,250
eye in that guys,
because all they're doing is making our 

1865
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:05,250
life more difficult.
It's like,

1866
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:05,250
well,
it doesn't matter.

1867
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:06,370
We're trying to tear down the 
patriarchy.

1868
01:32:06,371 --> 01:32:08,440
Who cares if your life is being made 
more difficult?

1869
01:32:08,930 --> 01:32:13,930
It's like you.
You don't make an omelet without 

1870
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:13,930
breaking a few eggs.
We want to keep that in mind.

1871
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:18,960
Okay.
Laurie prepares our students and 

1872
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:19,930
instructors for difficult discussions.
Yeah,

1873
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:25,680
probably not.
We support our teachers in navigating 

1874
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:26,170
complex and divisive issues with care 
and confidence.

1875
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:29,200
That's a more credible statement.
I mean,

1876
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:34,380
especially given the outcome of this is 
just want to take you back to the 

1877
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:37,381
lessons of the previous paragraph.
Lauria has commitment to academic 

1878
01:32:37,381 --> 01:32:38,990
freedom or freedom of expression.
Well,

1879
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:41,930
that's unequivocal perfect.
Yes.

1880
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:45,150
Except that they won't adopt the,
the Chicago principles.

1881
01:32:45,151 --> 01:32:48,360
So for example,
something else to keep in mind that the.

1882
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:53,810
I think this is the first time anybody's
talked about this when we were 

1883
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:55,000
established in 1973.

1884
01:32:55,510 --> 01:33:00,510
The Wilfred Laurier Act says 
specifically that this university will 

1885
01:33:03,101 --> 01:33:08,101
be dedicated to research and teaching in
the spirit of free inquiry and free 

1886
01:33:08,861 --> 01:33:13,861
expression.
That is the establishing act of our 

1887
01:33:13,861 --> 01:33:14,740
universe charter statement and,
and,

1888
01:33:14,741 --> 01:33:18,400
and that is what it says is our mission.
So in fact,

1889
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:23,460
we are breaking the law by not standing 
behind maximum free expression.

1890
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:31,240
And Max free inquire because it is right
in our very founding principle,

1891
01:33:31,241 --> 01:33:36,241
our very founding charter in the fact 
that we are so hesitant to to just 

1892
01:33:37,121 --> 01:33:41,770
embrace that and say,
we know that it's within this contest of

1893
01:33:41,771 --> 01:33:45,250
ideas that the best facts come forward 
and knowledges advanced.

1894
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:48,910
Why are we afraid of that?
Why are we afraid?

1895
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:53,920
What's made made every university a 
great university because we're doubtful 

1896
01:33:54,371 --> 01:33:56,740
about the integrity of the institution 
like this.

1897
01:33:56,820 --> 01:34:01,820
This critique that whose claim is that 
our institutions are patriarchal.

1898
01:34:02,381 --> 01:34:06,160
Institutions are fundamentally corrupt 
and oppressive is sufficiently.

1899
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:10,600
What would you say makes people 
sufficiently guilty so they're perfectly

1900
01:34:10,601 --> 01:34:15,100
willing to circumvent their adherence to
policies,

1901
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:19,270
to charter policies like that.
I just think that at some point you have

1902
01:34:19,271 --> 01:34:21,460
to say,
this is why you were created.

1903
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:24,250
Maybe we should get back to this and 
maybe.

1904
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:28,390
I mean maybe there's a someone who is in
the provincial parliament who's going to

1905
01:34:28,391 --> 01:34:33,391
say,
I'm kind of upset that you've actually 

1906
01:34:33,391 --> 01:34:34,720
rejected the very founding charter.
I would hear,

1907
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:39,721
well,
there's no one in the current in the 

1908
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:40,270
current legislature that would do that.
Certainly not in the current government.

1909
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,440
Not by any,
not it,

1910
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:42,730
no,
no chance at all.

1911
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,390
Okay.
Um,

1912
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:49,440
we support our teachers in navigating 
complex and divisive issues with care 

1913
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,670
and confidence.
We are leaders in ensuring our students,

1914
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:56,700
faculty,
and staff have the necessary supports 

1915
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:59,401
and tools to help those who've 
experienced marginalization and 

1916
01:34:59,401 --> 01:34:59,401
discrimination to engage fully.

1917
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,190
Okay.
So now you see the reversal,

1918
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:02,120
right?
Right away.

1919
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:07,330
Here is,
and this happens every time now that a 

1920
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:09,761
modern university,
virtually every time that a modern 

1921
01:35:09,761 --> 01:35:09,980
university comes out with a statement in
favor of free speech,

1922
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:14,630
the next thing they do is,
is bringing this competing set of claims

1923
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:15,410
like the,
uh,

1924
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:21,070
to help those who have experienced 
marginalization and discrimination to 

1925
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:25,331
engage fully.
As soon as the word marginalization is 

1926
01:35:25,331 --> 01:35:25,740
in there,
then you know that that postmodern ethos

1927
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:26,480
has,
has,

1928
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:27,470
has,
has,

1929
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:31,520
has,
has manifested itself within the,

1930
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:34,040
within the confines of the document 
property.

1931
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:39,041
Grounded academic debate at laureate 
occurs everyday and encourages critical 

1932
01:35:39,041 --> 01:35:39,950
thinking and civil discourse.
Yeah,

1933
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:44,180
ideas that one finds objectionable 
should be challenged and debated.

1934
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:49,420
The common good of society depends on 
the search for knowledge and it's free 

1935
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:49,420
expression.
Hey,

1936
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:54,070
fair enough.
Free expression and academic university 

1937
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:58,480
academic freedom at the university 
require accompanying responsibilities 

1938
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,200
and accountabilities to be met by 
members of the university community.

1939
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:02,610
The other shoe drops.
Well,

1940
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:04,370
even that statement,
it's not so bad.

1941
01:36:04,371 --> 01:36:05,140
I mean,
okay.

1942
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:08,720
Faculty members have responsibilities 
and they should be accountable.

1943
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:13,870
I think.
I think that university should be a 

1944
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:13,870
civil place.
I think that it should be civil,

1945
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:17,450
right?
I think that there should be tolerance,

1946
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:22,690
but tolerance is very different from an 
embrace and a complete embrace of what 

1947
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:25,500
diversity is now defined as.
Or equity is defined.

1948
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:29,210
Tolerance means I disagree,
but I'm going to let you speak anyway.

1949
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:31,580
And that really is the goal of the 
university.

1950
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:32,930
Uh,
so anyway.

1951
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:33,610
Yeah.
Okay.

1952
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,180
We,
we,

1953
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:37,220
we will continue to ensure that we are 
protected against protecting,

1954
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:39,380
against and dealing with hate and 
intolerance.

1955
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:41,780
These have those have no place in civil 
society.

1956
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:47,230
See that I'm not so sure about that.
Hate and intolerance have no place in 

1957
01:36:48,231 --> 01:36:50,180
civil society.
The problem with that is hate,

1958
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,370
hate and intolerance is not defined 
here.

1959
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:57,540
That is the problem and the I keep 
hearing hate speech is not free speech.

1960
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:59,450
And then when I asked,
well,

1961
01:36:59,451 --> 01:37:01,010
what do you mean by hate speech?
Yes,

1962
01:37:01,011 --> 01:37:02,690
that is the problem.
Well,

1963
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:05,390
the other thing too is I'm actually 
allowed to hate you.

1964
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:11,530
It's okay.
You might've done something that makes 

1965
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:12,530
me hate you but that.
But there are limits on what I can do as

1966
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:14,600
a consequence of that hate.
And that is not.

1967
01:37:14,601 --> 01:37:19,601
So there's two problems.
The first problem is this is a big one 

1968
01:37:19,601 --> 01:37:20,630
who defines hate.
That's a major problem.

1969
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:22,820
And the second is,
well,

1970
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:27,850
you don't limit hate.
You can't limit hate anymore than you 

1971
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:30,581
can limit anger or aggression,
but you can limit the manner in which 

1972
01:37:30,581 --> 01:37:32,130
people conduct themselves when they're 
motivated by those emotions.

1973
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:37,150
And let's be clear,
there is really a clear definition of 

1974
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:38,840
hate when you look at the criminal code 
under sections three,

1975
01:37:38,841 --> 01:37:39,920
18,
and 3:19,

1976
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:45,130
it says you cannot advocate physical 
violence against an identifiable group.

1977
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:48,470
I am totally on board with that.
Like let's,

1978
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:53,270
let's be clear.
You can't say go and hurt these people.

1979
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,130
I got that.
But that's really clear.

1980
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,170
Where's that?
Definitely.

1981
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:03,610
I just want to see all the issue.
There is something we discussed earlier 

1982
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:05,400
is while then we can gerrymander the 
definition of hurt,

1983
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:06,930
right?
Well,

1984
01:38:06,931 --> 01:38:09,750
I'm talking physical advocating,
physical violence,

1985
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:11,210
right?
Physical after that,

1986
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:13,200
physical in there because the criminal 
code also does.

1987
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:17,370
I think it does it in such a way to say 
we can harm what is harm.

1988
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:22,400
Again,
harm is longterm infliction of damage 

1989
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:26,310
that compromises your ability to 
function or your appearance.

1990
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,790
It's a pragmatic definition is grounded 
in common law.

1991
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:34,791
So we actually have a history of 
defining it so that safe and let's not 

1992
01:38:34,791 --> 01:38:38,391
move away from these definitions because
they're the thing that allow us to have 

1993
01:38:38,391 --> 01:38:40,290
conversations that are uncomfortable but
needed.

1994
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,620
Okay,
good.

1995
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:45,160
They,
uh,

1996
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:48,930
these have no place in civil society,
let alone on a university campus.

1997
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:51,780
They will not be tolerated at Lori.
Yes.

1998
01:38:51,781 --> 01:38:52,450
Well,
we see you.

1999
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:57,620
We saw an example of that not being 
tolerated with the Lindsay Shepherd 

2000
01:38:57,620 --> 01:39:00,060
case.
I remain concerned by the way faculty,

2001
01:39:00,061 --> 01:39:02,230
staff,
and students involved in aspects of this

2002
01:39:02,231 --> 01:39:04,410
situation were targeted with such 
vitriol.

2003
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,320
Now now things are starting to get out 
of hand.

2004
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:10,080
I remain concerned by the way faculty,
staff,

2005
01:39:10,081 --> 01:39:13,840
and students involved in aspects of this
situation were targeted with what,

2006
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:15,600
with such vitriol,
vitriol.

2007
01:39:15,601 --> 01:39:17,550
That's acid day.
So,

2008
01:39:17,551 --> 01:39:18,210
um,
is she,

2009
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,000
you think she's talking about the tweets
that Lindsay has received them,

2010
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:23,940
is that faculty,
staff and students.

2011
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:27,210
So not just Lindsey,
but I just wonder is this,

2012
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:32,040
does this apply to those who have been 
advocating free speech?

2013
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:32,970
And I,
I'm,

2014
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:34,320
I'm just,
I'm pointing it out there.

2015
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:39,440
I mean all of us who have come out in 
favor of maximum free speech have been 

2016
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:44,240
subjected to a lot of vitriol,
both emails and it's always anonymous 

2017
01:39:44,581 --> 01:39:47,520
emails.
It's always from people who will not say

2018
01:39:47,521 --> 01:39:49,140
who they are.
So,

2019
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:54,220
but my point would be I,
unless there was something that simply 

2020
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:55,860
said,
I am threatening your life.

2021
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,620
I just,
I deleted.

2022
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:00,390
That's what I do because this is what 
happens.

2023
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:05,600
I mean,
I wish people were civil but they're 

2024
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,701
not.
There's no discussing heart issues 

2025
01:40:07,701 --> 01:40:07,701
without conflict.
Like that's just not happening.

2026
01:40:07,701 --> 01:40:12,530
The question is how you live with the 
conflict and you can't limit it to none 

2027
01:40:12,530 --> 01:40:13,290
because then people can't have a 
conflict.

2028
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:15,370
They can solve a problem,
so what you do is you.

2029
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:19,470
You Limited well as we've limited quite 
successfully in our country to date,

2030
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:24,500
right?
We use the definitions of violence that 

2031
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,781
have prevailed throughout the 
establishment of English common law and 

2032
01:40:26,781 --> 01:40:29,660
that works just fine.
My concern about that paragraph is that 

2033
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:32,070
she's cowtowing,
let's say,

2034
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:36,150
to concerns about the way that the 
people who actually,

2035
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:41,300
let's say perpetrated this event were 
dealt with by members of the general 

2036
01:40:41,881 --> 01:40:46,881
public,
so member members of the university 

2037
01:40:46,881 --> 01:40:51,321
community must be supported to work and 
study in an environment free of 

2038
01:40:51,321 --> 01:40:54,090
discrimination and harassment.
That's a tougher and they have

2039
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:59,090
my commitment.
We will continue to make this a 

2040
01:40:59,090 --> 01:40:59,090
university priority.

2041
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:03,140
Yeah,
that's a sentence that worries me in an 

2042
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,530
environment free of discrimination and 
harassment and they have my.

2043
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:09,060
The problem is it's so difficult to 
distinguish that between real dispute.

2044
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:11,310
You know?
I mean if you're.

2045
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:13,470
If you're committed to a line of 
argumentation,

2046
01:41:13,471 --> 01:41:15,570
you stake your whole,
your whole life on it,

2047
01:41:15,571 --> 01:41:20,571
say your,
your whole academic career and you're 

2048
01:41:20,571 --> 01:41:21,480
engaged in a dispute with someone else 
who holds a contrary view point.

2049
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:25,200
There's going to be heat and sparks 
generated by that exchange.

2050
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:30,230
There has to be because otherwise you're
not talking about anything of any 

2051
01:41:30,230 --> 01:41:30,230
importance.

2052
01:41:30,230 --> 01:41:30,230
Yeah.
If we all agree,

2053
01:41:30,230 --> 01:41:31,850
we don't need free speech.
I mean,

2054
01:41:31,851 --> 01:41:33,680
that's standard.
That's the thing,

2055
01:41:33,710 --> 01:41:35,930
right?
But when I read this line,

2056
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:39,260
uh,
members of the university community must

2057
01:41:39,261 --> 01:41:44,261
be supported to work and study in an 
environment free of discrimination and 

2058
01:41:44,261 --> 01:41:48,311
harassment and,
and I just wonder how equally that idea 

2059
01:41:50,181 --> 01:41:55,181
has been applied at my university so far
because certainly we know that our 

2060
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:00,740
president has sent out letters of 
support to the Lgbtq community,

2061
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:04,190
which she was right to do.
If they are feeling harassed,

2062
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:07,640
I have no problem with that.
But at the same time,

2063
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:10,130
there are official bodies at our 
university,

2064
01:42:10,131 --> 01:42:15,131
the women's center and other bodies that
are under the auspices of the diversity 

2065
01:42:15,131 --> 01:42:16,180
and Equity Office,
uh,

2066
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:19,580
if I'm correct that are petitioning to 
have a,

2067
01:42:19,581 --> 01:42:24,581
there's a pro life group on campus and 
they are petitioning to have them 

2068
01:42:24,581 --> 01:42:25,580
defunded and shut down.

2069
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:26,420
Right.
So,

2070
01:42:26,421 --> 01:42:31,421
so did Debra mccloud,
she sent out a letter to all the people 

2071
01:42:31,421 --> 01:42:31,421
who are supporting the shepherd to say,
well,

2072
01:42:31,421 --> 01:42:32,660
we're really sorry about older

2073
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,150
your responses.
My point,

2074
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:41,230
our president is aware that there's a 
group on campus that are marginalized.

2075
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:45,590
These are the prolife students,
and I don't care what your position is,

2076
01:42:45,591 --> 01:42:49,280
pro life or pro choice,
whatever your position is,

2077
01:42:49,281 --> 01:42:51,890
you bloody will have to admit that 
there's at least a debate.

2078
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:53,260
There is a debate,
but,

2079
01:42:53,261 --> 01:42:58,261
and the point I would make is here truly
is a marginalized group of students who 

2080
01:42:58,671 --> 01:43:01,280
have received no support from our 
university.

2081
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:04,190
None.
And I know my president is aware because

2082
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:09,220
early on in this controversy I said,
and another matter is that these 

2083
01:43:09,261 --> 01:43:11,660
students are being attacked or I'm 
sorry,

2084
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:16,720
I don't want to use hyperbolic language.
These students are being harassed and 

2085
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:20,951
they are being harassed because they 
were being threatened with having their 

2086
01:43:20,951 --> 01:43:22,910
funding removed by official bodies of 
the university.

2087
01:43:23,290 --> 01:43:28,290
Yeah,
well there's the prolife students are 

2088
01:43:28,290 --> 01:43:28,290
real canaries in the coal mine as far as
I'm concerned,

2089
01:43:28,290 --> 01:43:28,830
regardless of what you think about,

2090
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:33,880
do anything represent diversity,
ideological diversity.

2091
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:37,930
But we're not seeing any reception of 
these diverse students.

2092
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:43,230
Do they?
Are they being included in this 

2093
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:43,340
diversity and inclusion?
No,

2094
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,890
they're being excluded purposely by 
actual offices of my university.

2095
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:49,340
So I'm saying,
yeah,

2096
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:52,070
that's standard practice.
I would say on campuses

2097
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,050
across the country,
it's just uneven,

2098
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:59,480
it's uneven,
and I think that what what we need to 

2099
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:03,191
see a is just a policy that applies to 
all students and not just those who 

2100
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:08,321
smell right or are orthodox to the 
social justice or who were in the.

2101
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:11,420
What would you call it?
Acceptable class of victims.

2102
01:44:12,310 --> 01:44:17,310
Okay.
It bears repeating in the current 

2103
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:17,310
context that Laurie is support for our 
lesbian,

2104
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:17,420
gay,
Bi,

2105
01:44:17,421 --> 01:44:18,170
trans,
queer,

2106
01:44:18,171 --> 01:44:23,171
and two spirited campus community and 
transgender people in particular is 

2107
01:44:23,171 --> 01:44:26,921
unwavering.
It isn't the obvious that it bears 

2108
01:44:26,921 --> 01:44:29,141
repeating in the current context because
the issue here fundamentally is that 

2109
01:44:29,141 --> 01:44:33,310
Lindsay Shepherd was was subject to an 
administrative inquisition despite the 

2110
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:38,810
fact that she was 100 percent innocent 
by the university's own standards,

2111
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:43,960
and so it doesn't bear repeating in the 
current context that is support for our 

2112
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:48,731
lbgt to Lgbtq campus community and pr 
and transgender people.

2113
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:53,360
In particular is unwavering.
It actually isn't about them.

2114
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:58,660
It's not about them at all.
It's about the fact that she got 

2115
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:00,320
pilloried for doing something that she 
was actually right to do.

2116
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:05,150
So I'm not happy with the fact that this
paragraph was inserted into here.

2117
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:10,270
I think it's an indication of exactly 
the kind of administrative weakness that

2118
01:45:10,341 --> 01:45:12,470
allowed this sort of event to occur to 
begin with.

2119
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:12,780
Now,

2120
01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:14,910
this is the theme though,
right,

2121
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:18,520
of the Justice Warriors,
is that this is the victim group they've

2122
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:20,440
repeated over and over that there's been
violence,

2123
01:45:20,441 --> 01:45:22,060
harassment,
vitriol.

2124
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:27,360
Everybody's picking up on that.
The union president said that it was 

2125
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,170
daily occurrence.
The president's repeated.

2126
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:31,720
She's issued a campus wide email and 
response to the open letter saying,

2127
01:45:32,050 --> 01:45:34,120
uh,
we're going to make this a safe campus.

2128
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:36,810
She's repeating it here.
So the validation,

2129
01:45:36,811 --> 01:45:36,890
yes,

2130
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:41,950
their narrative of victimization 
emerging from the Lindsay Shepherd 

2131
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:41,950
event.
Without evidence,

2132
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:42,330
we,
we,

2133
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,660
we actually send an email to our 
faculty,

2134
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:48,360
uh,
the Union president and we said,

2135
01:45:49,230 --> 01:45:54,030
we're concerned about this daily 
violence on campus.

2136
01:45:54,270 --> 01:45:58,290
Could you please supply us with evidence
of this?

2137
01:45:58,291 --> 01:45:59,850
And she wrote back and she said,
uh,

2138
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:02,310
what did she say something

2139
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:04,980
as I'm telling everyone in the press,
no.

2140
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:06,850
Yeah,
because it would inflate,

2141
01:46:06,851 --> 01:46:11,851
didn't she say because it would inflame 
the situation even further with 

2142
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,600
something like that.
So how,

2143
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:18,750
how in the world providing evidence that
something like that with members of the 

2144
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:22,471
union,
we are paying our fees just like 

2145
01:46:22,471 --> 01:46:22,540
everyone else.
And we just,

2146
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:27,600
we wanted substantiate some 
substantiation to these claims that 

2147
01:46:28,721 --> 01:46:30,170
there was violence as a daily.

2148
01:46:30,190 --> 01:46:32,380
Well,
the whole premise is that there's injury

2149
01:46:32,381 --> 01:46:34,930
happening and that's why we can't speak 
about these things.

2150
01:46:35,110 --> 01:46:40,110
So if they can establish the violence,
then maybe we're sympathetic to the 

2151
01:46:40,110 --> 01:46:40,900
argument that the space shouldn't occur.
But.

2152
01:46:40,901 --> 01:46:45,400
But that's susceptible to bogus claims.
If there's no substantiation,

2153
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:47,920
you can't build policy that way.

2154
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:49,980
Yeah.
Not without

2155
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,980
getting into the kind of trouble that's 
already emerged in light of recent 

2156
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:56,490
events.
We have added measures to improve campus

2157
01:46:56,491 --> 01:46:58,500
safety while it is by.
No.

2158
01:46:58,530 --> 01:46:59,370
See that,
that,

2159
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:04,520
that actually seems to me to be the one 
sentence in this article so far.

2160
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:09,921
That's actually a mistake because by 
going forward with what practices are 

2161
01:47:12,641 --> 01:47:17,641
that are going to improve campus safety,
then the president is validating the 

2162
01:47:18,001 --> 01:47:23,001
claims of the people who claim that this
occurrence produced an unsafe 

2163
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:25,110
environment on the campus.
It's like,

2164
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:26,650
so I,
I,

2165
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:31,980
I think that that was weak.
We will ensure that all students,

2166
01:47:32,131 --> 01:47:37,131
staff and faculty know exactly what our 
commitment to academic freedom and 

2167
01:47:37,131 --> 01:47:37,440
freedom of expression means in the 
classroom.

2168
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:40,020
That would be good.
To that end,

2169
01:47:40,021 --> 01:47:43,920
we have established the task force on 
freedom of expression to take input from

2170
01:47:43,921 --> 01:47:46,230
our community,
which we should point out,

2171
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:49,260
which won't include Lindsay Shepherd.
Right?

2172
01:47:49,261 --> 01:47:51,570
Because she asked to be part of that 
taskforce.

2173
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,610
In fact,
I believe that they offered it to her.

2174
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:54,710
I'm not exactly sure.

2175
01:47:55,270 --> 01:48:00,270
Some,
some Grad students nominated her and it 

2176
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:03,181
was prior to the revelation being made 
that it would be the position would be 

2177
01:48:03,181 --> 01:48:06,400
filled by the president of the graduate 
students association who,

2178
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:09,370
and I think this was poor form,
uh,

2179
01:48:10,030 --> 01:48:15,030
just before that announcement was made,
the president of the Graduate Students 

2180
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:20,760
Association put out a statement where I,
I'm not sure if it's a he or she or a,

2181
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:22,730
I'm not sure of the,
the uh,

2182
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,380
gender pronoun use,
but um,

2183
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:29,890
that they were standing 100 percent 
behind the Trans and Lgbtq.

2184
01:48:29,950 --> 01:48:30,660
Yeah.
And the.

2185
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:35,970
And that,
the fact that they were going to sit on 

2186
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:35,970
the,
on the taskforce would indicate that all

2187
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:37,330
students would be represented properly,

2188
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:42,010
but it's just the.
They showed this incredible bias.

2189
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:43,510
And,
and then they said,

2190
01:48:43,511 --> 01:48:45,550
and we're going to be sitting on this.
I just don't,

2191
01:48:45,551 --> 01:48:50,551
I don't know that that does a service to
all the Grad students who they 

2192
01:48:50,551 --> 01:48:50,551
represent.

2193
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:54,590
Alright,
look at best practices beyond Lori pay.

2194
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:59,620
They could look at Chicago,
that'd be good and develop a clear 

2195
01:48:59,620 --> 01:48:59,800
tangible and you never know.
Maybe they will.

2196
01:48:59,850 --> 01:49:01,810
You never know.
And develop a clear,

2197
01:49:01,811 --> 01:49:04,900
tangible set of practical,
implementable guidelines that will bring

2198
01:49:04,901 --> 01:49:09,901
clarity to this issue for our own 
classrooms and we'll have the potential 

2199
01:49:09,901 --> 01:49:13,141
to serve as best practices for others.
Well that's exactly what you guys are 

2200
01:49:13,141 --> 01:49:13,960
recommending.
That is my commitment to you.

2201
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:19,200
Well,
and it's not like the University of 

2202
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:19,200
Chicago is a lightweight

2203
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,180
and it's not just the University of 
Chicago over 30 universities.

2204
01:49:21,181 --> 01:49:25,050
Many of them Ivy League have adopted the
Chicago statements to great effect.

2205
01:49:25,051 --> 01:49:25,560
Right?
Right.

2206
01:49:25,650 --> 01:49:26,790
And so,
so this is.

2207
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,660
This is something that has worked that 
is working.

2208
01:49:31,170 --> 01:49:33,150
It's clearly something that should 
happen in Canada.

2209
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:35,580
It would be a wonderful thing.
It would be a wonderful thing to do.

2210
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:36,750
Would be.
It would be so wonderful.

2211
01:49:36,751 --> 01:49:41,250
So it's not like we're trying to 
institute this policy that hasn't worked

2212
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:46,460
and that hasn't been been accepted by 
really prominent universities in the US 

2213
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:48,130
and it doesn't,
it doesn't

2214
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:53,130
involve us a law or legal ease.
It is simply a statement of philosophy 

2215
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:58,830
about what we want and which is maximum 
free expression and free inquiry within 

2216
01:49:58,830 --> 01:49:58,830
the bounds of the law.

2217
01:49:59,290 --> 01:50:03,180
And I just think this task force is 
going to be a disaster because,

2218
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:04,680
uh,
the justice,

2219
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:09,940
uh,
advocates aren't interested in free 

2220
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:09,940
speech,
uh,

2221
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:13,170
they,
they want to forbid certain forms of 

2222
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:14,110
speech and it's just a question of which
topics and who's going to come

2223
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:16,300
troll the lender might be enough public 
screwed.

2224
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:18,700
Like I don't think interest in Wilfrid 
laurier.

2225
01:50:18,810 --> 01:50:22,030
I'm sure that the president would be 
real happy if this went away,

2226
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:27,450
but I think the probability that it's 
going to go away is very low because I 

2227
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:31,081
think Wilford Laurey is now being 
watched and being watched by very many 

2228
01:50:31,081 --> 01:50:32,620
people to see what the genuine outcome 
of this will be.

2229
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:35,920
And I think that even if it was ignored 
by the mainstream media,

2230
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:40,921
which it might be,
it's not going to be ignored by people 

2231
01:50:40,921 --> 01:50:43,470
on Youtube and the people who've been 
who've been generating content 

2232
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:44,280
associated with Lindsay shepherd and 
the,

2233
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:47,740
the magnitude of that content online is 
absolutely overwhelming.

2234
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:49,960
I don't know if the Wilfred laureate 
administrators.

2235
01:50:49,961 --> 01:50:52,240
No,
because you know people older than 40,

2236
01:50:52,241 --> 01:50:54,580
you usually don't know much about online
media,

2237
01:50:54,790 --> 01:50:58,330
but the amount of commentary this has 
been generating,

2238
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:03,420
this is generated on youtube is 
absolutely beyond belief like it was a 

2239
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:03,420
major scandal.

2240
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:06,370
Back to the task force though,
and we'll you've said this in the past,

2241
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:11,910
the freedom of expression proponents,
we already are the compromise position 

2242
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:16,120
because we are saying we want you to be 
able to articulate whatever position you

2243
01:51:16,121 --> 01:51:21,121
have.
We want you to be able to like we are 

2244
01:51:21,121 --> 01:51:24,301
the compromise position.
We're not saying we want to shut down 

2245
01:51:24,301 --> 01:51:24,790
anybody.
Whatever your position is,

2246
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:27,160
let's hear it.
That's that.

2247
01:51:27,190 --> 01:51:32,190
That is where we are.
So we're already in that compromise 

2248
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:35,821
position in the boundaries of the law,
within the boundaries of the law in 

2249
01:51:35,821 --> 01:51:37,360
respect to the university in its 
operations.

2250
01:51:37,361 --> 01:51:38,350
Of course.
So,

2251
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:42,520
so we're already saying we want all 
these sides to be able to be hurt.

2252
01:51:42,521 --> 01:51:47,521
I don't understand.
It's already approved diversity of 

2253
01:51:47,521 --> 01:51:47,521
opinion.
It is.

2254
01:51:47,521 --> 01:51:50,290
It is.
And so what I have to look at is many of

2255
01:51:50,291 --> 01:51:55,291
the colleagues that I have who are on 
the left and are hoping for restriction 

2256
01:51:55,291 --> 01:51:58,330
of free expression are really,
to a certain extent,

2257
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:00,400
linguistic imperialists.

2258
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:03,780
That's exactly why I objected to bill 
[inaudible].

2259
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:09,180
I said that I wasn't going to let the 
linguistic imperialists take control 

2260
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:13,171
over my voice.
The fact that it happened to be about 

2261
01:52:13,171 --> 01:52:15,751
transgender pronouns with.
Well that was just how that problem 

2262
01:52:15,751 --> 01:52:16,690
manifested itself at that period of 
time.

2263
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:18,700
But that,
that what have you called them?

2264
01:52:18,701 --> 01:52:21,160
Linguistic imperialist.
That's exactly right.

2265
01:52:21,161 --> 01:52:22,180
And,
and these,

2266
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:27,210
the,
these idiot ideologues on the radical 

2267
01:52:27,210 --> 01:52:29,761
left who were so good at neologisms are 
unbelievably good at grasping the 

2268
01:52:29,761 --> 01:52:31,390
linguistic territory.
I mean the,

2269
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:35,170
the propagation of words like cis 
gendered is a perfect example of that.

2270
01:52:35,630 --> 01:52:36,600
So it.
Yeah,

2271
01:52:36,601 --> 01:52:41,601
it's just,
I don't understand how they can be so 

2272
01:52:41,601 --> 01:52:44,020
against colonialism and imperialism and 
then want to do that in,

2273
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:46,140
in the sphere of language,
in

2274
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:49,910
an authoritarian structure which can 
only be abused.

2275
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:50,640
Well,
that's,

2276
01:52:50,730 --> 01:52:55,730
that's part of the weird.
See there's this weird marriage between 

2277
01:52:55,730 --> 01:52:57,030
postmodernism in Marxism.
Right?

2278
01:52:57,031 --> 01:53:02,031
Which makes no sense because you 
actually can't be a postmodernist and I 

2279
01:53:02,031 --> 01:53:03,510
guess you can be a critical thinker and 
a Marxist,

2280
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:08,540
but you cannot be a postmodernist data 
Marxist at the same time because the 

2281
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:12,150
postmodernists hypothetically are 
critical of grand narratives,

2282
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:13,410
right?
They don't believe that they,

2283
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,780
that they have in a universal validity.
Of course,

2284
01:53:15,781 --> 01:53:18,840
the problem with that is that without a 
grand narrative you can't act,

2285
01:53:19,170 --> 01:53:23,130
but they sneak the Marxism in through 
the back door and then the justification

2286
01:53:23,131 --> 01:53:26,670
I think is for these authentic 
authoritarian impositions is that,

2287
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:31,920
well,
it doesn't matter as long as the right 

2288
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:32,280
people are being hurt by them and the 
right people would be the people who are

2289
01:53:32,281 --> 01:53:37,281
in positions of power now who,
who have no justification for being in 

2290
01:53:37,281 --> 01:53:38,510
those positions of power.
Right?

2291
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:43,550
Because they don't stable solution.
If you're making the assumption that 

2292
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:45,090
what's being sought after is a stable 
solution,

2293
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:50,660
and I think that's.
I think that's a dangerous assumption 

2294
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:53,270
because I think that the university 
activists mean exactly what they say 

2295
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:56,820
when they say that we should be flipping
over the patriarch.

2296
01:53:56,870 --> 01:54:00,500
They've put no counterproposal forward 
throughout this.

2297
01:54:00,501 --> 01:54:02,870
Right?
It's like they don't have a solution,

2298
01:54:03,230 --> 01:54:06,440
a,
they're not even talking about a list of

2299
01:54:06,441 --> 01:54:11,441
forbidden topics and who's going to be 
adjudicated and what the appeals 

2300
01:54:11,441 --> 01:54:11,630
process,
so that's always.

2301
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:12,800
That's always done post hoc.

2302
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:18,120
Yeah.
That way you can keep the level of fear 

2303
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:18,120
that you can keep adding to the list as 
well.

2304
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:19,440
Definitely that will because it's way 
better.

2305
01:54:19,441 --> 01:54:24,441
It's way better if you.
It's way better if you want to exercise 

2306
01:54:24,441 --> 01:54:27,501
power over people to never let them be 
sure which policies they're violating 

2307
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:30,390
and I think that what happened to 
Lindsay Shepherd is an excellent example

2308
01:54:30,391 --> 01:54:31,740
of that,
so it's a.

2309
01:54:31,741 --> 01:54:36,741
it's a canonical example of that.
If it's the Orwellian idea of freedom is

2310
01:54:36,841 --> 01:54:41,841
the ability to say two plus two equals 
four and they want to keep avoiding the 

2311
01:54:41,841 --> 01:54:45,651
ability to say two plus two is four by 
creating new answers and moving on and 

2312
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:50,740
he just went through this whole process 
with a statement unfree expression and 

2313
01:54:51,121 --> 01:54:53,460
it goes on for paragraphs and paragraphs
and then the last,

2314
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:58,700
nearly the last sentence is freedom of 
expression does not trump all other 

2315
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:02,580
rights in the university community.
Freedom of expression.

2316
01:55:02,790 --> 01:55:05,700
Can only thrive constructively when 
accompanied by other rights,

2317
01:55:05,790 --> 01:55:09,480
including the equality rights of equity,
diversity,

2318
01:55:09,481 --> 01:55:10,950
and inclusion.
There you go.

2319
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:15,980
That's right.
And so now you no longer have free 

2320
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:15,980
expression and that's the snake in the 
garden right there.

2321
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:15,980
Eating that.
Yeah.

2322
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:17,130
So there's,
there's this,

2323
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,300
but how.
I mean those,

2324
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:21,150
those are so complicated.
There's individual rights and group.

2325
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:26,510
There's positive rights and negative 
rights and they're all in this salad 

2326
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:29,250
with no guidance as to how you're going 
to trade them off against each other.

2327
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:34,280
It's,
it's like you say it just ad hoc as we 

2328
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:34,280
go forward.
We'll.

2329
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:38,420
Yeah.
Was so funny to produce an entire 

2330
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:40,311
document talking about freedom of 
expression and then put a sentence like 

2331
01:55:40,311 --> 01:55:41,490
that in is a Coda psyllid if.
And by the way also this,

2332
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:42,660
it's like,
wait a second,

2333
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:44,400
it's also this,

2334
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:49,610
it's that little admixture of poison.
It destroys the integrity of the entire 

2335
01:55:49,801 --> 01:55:50,820
argument and,
and,

2336
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:55,850
and to,
and to put all those words in their 

2337
01:55:55,850 --> 01:55:55,850
diversity.
Okay.

2338
01:55:55,850 --> 01:55:55,950
What the hell do you mean by that?
Exactly.

2339
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:01,340
Inclusivity or.
That's a word that really that's when I 

2340
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:04,521
really have trouble with because it's 
very difficult to understand even what 

2341
01:56:04,521 --> 01:56:07,431
that means and equity equity is equality
of outcome and so that's an impossible 

2342
01:56:07,981 --> 01:56:12,981
goal to begin with because it multiplies
in difficulty as you add number of 

2343
01:56:13,171 --> 01:56:14,910
measurement dimensions.
Right?

2344
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:20,330
So.
And that's the intersectionality 

2345
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:20,330
problem,
so to speak.

2346
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:20,330
So.
All right,

2347
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:21,390
well,
well with the task force,

2348
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:26,391
the interesting thing is we'll didn't 
want to sit on it because having looked 

2349
01:56:26,581 --> 01:56:27,710
at what had happened,
I,

2350
01:56:27,711 --> 01:56:30,480
I suppose it was the experience at UBC 
that,

2351
01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:34,050
well I just saw big arguments happening 
with no,

2352
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:37,380
no possibility of a constructive outcome
and so.

2353
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:41,790
But I was more hopeful and I understand 
wills position completely,

2354
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:43,230
right?
Yes.

2355
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:48,231
Well it's easy as a faculty member to 
get pulled into interminable 

2356
01:56:48,231 --> 01:56:49,710
administrative duties that have no 
positive outcome whatsoever.

2357
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:51,510
In fact,
it's pretty much par for the course.

2358
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:52,370
Well,
he makes the,

2359
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:55,530
I mean your most compelling argument.
Well to one,

2360
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:59,550
look what happened at UBC and two were 
already in a compromised position.

2361
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:01,380
You mean what,
what more can you want?

2362
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:03,580
And I get that,
but I,

2363
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:07,560
I have let my name stand for nomination.
Uh,

2364
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:08,880
we'll see this week.
I guess,

2365
01:57:08,881 --> 01:57:12,630
whether or not I'll,
I don't know if I'll get voted.

2366
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:14,940
Well,
one of the things we should find out and

2367
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:19,970
publicize is whether any people who have
a strong free speech orientation will 

2368
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:22,060
end up on that task force.
I mean that,

2369
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:24,410
that's absolutely critical.
Important.

2370
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:29,420
Well,
they'll certainly get their work done 

2371
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:31,131
quickly if no one running the free 
speech side is on it because they'll 

2372
01:57:31,131 --> 01:57:31,131
just say,
right.

2373
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:36,200
But maybe they'll have to create a list 
of their own about what can't be talked 

2374
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:36,200
about.
Right?

2375
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:37,020
Who knows where that will go.
Well,

2376
01:57:37,021 --> 01:57:41,310
and one thing that strikes me though is 
just the disregard for history,

2377
01:57:41,540 --> 01:57:46,540
uh,
people who are marginalized or would be 

2378
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:50,601
considered in the marginalized group.
If we look at how did they get the 

2379
01:57:50,601 --> 01:57:52,200
rights that they have today,
right?

2380
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:56,250
How did that happen was because of free 
expression,

2381
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,180
right?
Actually,

2382
01:57:58,110 --> 01:58:01,040
the easy case to make for free speech is
left wing.

2383
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:06,300
It's like powerful.
People don't need their free speech 

2384
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:06,300
protected.
They're powerful,

2385
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:10,820
they're rich.
They can say whatever the hell they 

2386
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:12,381
want.
It's people who are precisely 

2387
01:58:12,381 --> 01:58:13,020
marginalized and oppressed,
who need all the protection of the law.

2388
01:58:13,021 --> 01:58:14,420
Of course they want to weight it against
saying,

2389
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:19,421
yes,
we want to have people without power to 

2390
01:58:19,421 --> 01:58:20,970
have the freedom of expression,
but let's make this a quicker process by

2391
01:58:20,971 --> 01:58:24,930
making sure those that have power can't 
speak whoever those who have power,

2392
01:58:25,010 --> 01:58:27,180
it's not just,
Oh,

2393
01:58:27,181 --> 01:58:27,960
you know,
you could say,

2394
01:58:27,961 --> 01:58:32,961
well,
wouldn't it be wonderful if those who 

2395
01:58:32,961 --> 01:58:32,961
had unfair power weren't allowed to 
speak?

2396
01:58:32,961 --> 01:58:32,961
It's like,
well,

2397
01:58:32,961 --> 01:58:37,640
maybe it wouldn't be wonderful,
but who the hell is going to decide who 

2398
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:40,650
has power and who has unfair power?
Like the devil's in the details there.

2399
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:45,940
So the only fair application of this 
principle is to let everybody have equal

2400
01:58:45,941 --> 01:58:48,970
opportunity,
not equal outcome by the way.

2401
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:50,680
Well,
that's the free market solution,

2402
01:58:50,681 --> 01:58:55,681
right?
Because you can't determine these by 

2403
01:58:55,681 --> 01:58:56,020
central Fiat because it's technically 
impossible,

2404
01:58:56,110 --> 01:58:59,020
which is actually something 
postmodernist should know because that's

2405
01:58:59,021 --> 01:59:01,660
actually one of the logical consequences
of their philosophy.

2406
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:06,940
Right?
Things are too complicated to decide by 

2407
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:06,940
Fiat in some sense,
but.

2408
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:11,240
All right.
Is there anything else that you guys 

2409
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:11,240
want to say that,
that,

2410
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:14,350
that you've observed as a consequence of
this Lindsay shepherd of fair or that or

2411
01:59:14,351 --> 01:59:17,290
that you're hopeful about or pessimistic
about what,

2412
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:18,550
what?
What's the,

2413
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:21,610
how do we solve this?
Just the way we're solving it.

2414
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:25,570
This is the way to solve it is to,
is to have W.

2415
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:28,720
I think this is a textbook case of the 
utility of free speech.

2416
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:31,600
Shepherd was able to make her case 
publicly.

2417
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:34,840
There's been a huge debate about it.
There's been some moves made on the part

2418
01:59:34,841 --> 01:59:38,200
of the university that looked positive.
We've got ample opportunity.

2419
01:59:38,201 --> 01:59:40,750
Everyone has ample opportunity to have 
their voice heard.

2420
01:59:40,751 --> 01:59:42,220
You know,
this video we're making tonight,

2421
01:59:42,221 --> 01:59:44,890
I'll probably be watched by 150,000
people,

2422
01:59:45,070 --> 01:59:50,070
so like,
and we had a perfectly reasonable 

2423
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:50,070
discussion,
you know,

2424
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:52,020
I think we gave credit where credit was 
due with regards to this document and,

2425
01:59:52,230 --> 01:59:57,230
and are jointly hopeful that something 
positive will come of it and made some 

2426
01:59:57,230 --> 02:00:02,131
pointed critiques about,
about what it does contain and what it 

2427
02:00:02,131 --> 02:00:05,911
doesn't,
but we don't want to underestimate the 

2428
02:00:05,911 --> 02:00:08,401
utility of doing these things.
It's useful and I think the fact that 

2429
02:00:08,401 --> 02:00:11,371
you guys have this little cabal of 
people at Wilfrid laurier who are 

2430
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:14,791
willing to speak,
I was shocked when when you wrote that 

2431
02:00:14,791 --> 02:00:15,900
op ad and when the Toronto Star 
published it,

2432
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:20,910
I mean nothing like that from an 
academic happened in relationship to me 

2433
02:00:20,921 --> 02:00:25,921
last year and Bill [inaudible],
we've seen such uniformity of outcry 

2434
02:00:25,921 --> 02:00:30,270
about this from all the newspapers,
glove star son,

2435
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:35,300
which,
which really just shows you the 

2436
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:35,860
disconnect between what is happening in 
the academy and what is happening.

2437
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:38,320
It's a disconnect of staggering 
magnitude.

2438
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:40,480
People outside the academy say,
well,

2439
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:45,500
how can you believe that they have what 
they've been saying is really this 

2440
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:47,290
happened,
this actually happened.

2441
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:51,760
That's the universal response and and 
you know the response on the campuses as

2442
02:00:52,210 --> 02:00:52,630
well.
Yeah.

2443
02:00:52,631 --> 02:00:56,020
It happened and we were right.
I have a solution.

2444
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:58,150
I have a solution.
I mean it's not a solution,

2445
02:00:58,151 --> 02:01:02,590
but it's A.
I call it an inoculant actually.

2446
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:07,800
So yes.
Let's get the statement for freedom of 

2447
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,370
expression at our university and similar
statements at all universities.

2448
02:01:09,550 --> 02:01:12,550
Why the federal government is not tying 
funding to this.

2449
02:01:12,551 --> 02:01:17,551
I know that the Conservatives Med 
suggestion that I made to the 

2450
02:01:17,551 --> 02:01:17,551
conservatives,
well this is,

2451
02:01:17,551 --> 02:01:18,880
this is what needs to happen,
but in addition to that,

2452
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:24,120
I think that young people and parents of
young people need to look at what's 

2453
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:28,471
happening and they need to start 
educating their kids at home and they 

2454
02:01:28,471 --> 02:01:28,471
need to start.

2455
02:01:28,471 --> 02:01:32,800
And I've written several op-eds where 
I've said people ask me,

2456
02:01:32,801 --> 02:01:37,801
what is the solution that I say?
Start watching the videos of Jordan 

2457
02:01:37,801 --> 02:01:38,950
Peterson.
Start watching the videos.

2458
02:01:39,070 --> 02:01:40,460
Uh,
there's Jonathan Heit,

2459
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:41,180
Jonathan.
Hi.

2460
02:01:41,181 --> 02:01:43,270
You Bet.
Look into the Heterodox Academy.

2461
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:44,750
They know what they're doing,
who,

2462
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:48,770
who definitely are scholars of repute,
the,

2463
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,870
they,
they are moderate in the,

2464
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:52,790
like incredibly civil.
Uh,

2465
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:55,340
there are also some people outside of 
academia.

2466
02:01:55,341 --> 02:01:56,090
There's a,
um,

2467
02:01:56,210 --> 02:01:58,510
a fantastic utuber.
Uh,

2468
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:03,700
my name is Josephine.
She's a Canadian political science 

2469
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:05,870
student who is at u of t moderate,
really well spoken,

2470
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:09,320
articulate in classical liberal ideas.
My name is Josephine.

2471
02:02:09,370 --> 02:02:13,550
Okay.
So she's actually been the reason that I

2472
02:02:13,551 --> 02:02:15,470
know she knows you.
She was at one of your rallies.

2473
02:02:15,471 --> 02:02:18,760
I spotted a video there.
She is in the background there.

2474
02:02:18,830 --> 02:02:23,830
Another young lady as a woman who is her
name is roaming millennial.

2475
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:24,500
Yeah.

2476
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:26,270
I don't roaming millennial.
I'd been on her show.

2477
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:28,220
Oh yeah,
you bet.

2478
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:29,060
You Bet.
Yeah,

2479
02:02:29,470 --> 02:02:31,010
and she's a tough cookie.
That girl,

2480
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:34,190
you bet.
And I would say start watching these.

2481
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:39,620
Yeah,
well the young people are watching them 

2482
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:39,620
in droves.
You know,

2483
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:39,620
she has a big following,
roaming millennial,

2484
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:44,111
and I'm grateful for that because in 
fact when these students go into the 

2485
02:02:44,111 --> 02:02:47,321
university classroom,
if they choose to go into the arts or 

2486
02:02:47,321 --> 02:02:49,901
the humanities,
they're going to go in with knowledge 

2487
02:02:49,901 --> 02:02:52,810
where they can say,
I realize it's tough to challenge a 

2488
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:53,150
professor,
but start a facebook group and say,

2489
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:58,210
Hey,
did you know that there are other ideas 

2490
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:00,521
to do?
You know that there's an opposite side 

2491
02:03:00,521 --> 02:03:00,521
of this debate.
Well,

2492
02:03:00,521 --> 02:03:03,950
we should.
Or we could also encourage parents who 

2493
02:03:03,950 --> 02:03:06,101
might be listening or or students 
thinking about going to university who 

2494
02:03:06,101 --> 02:03:09,671
might be listening to this,
is that check to see where the 

2495
02:03:09,671 --> 02:03:12,731
university stands on free speech and if 
they dampen down their support for free 

2496
02:03:12,731 --> 02:03:14,840
speech and for your inquiry with 
statements about diversity,

2497
02:03:14,841 --> 02:03:17,600
inclusivity and equity,
then go somewhere else.

2498
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:20,120
It's a worry.
Another thing,

2499
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:25,300
and this is just beginning in Canada,
we have a society for academic freedom 

2500
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:27,890
and scholarship that professors can join
if a,

2501
02:03:27,930 --> 02:03:32,930
if a.
sorry if a professor has joined the 

2502
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:33,110
Society for academic freedom of 
scholarship,

2503
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:36,980
you can be pretty sure they are going to
be wanting to give you both sides of the

2504
02:03:36,981 --> 02:03:40,640
story.
So that's not a bad check either for.

2505
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:45,670
Do they have to do their research though
the students to do diligence while 

2506
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:45,710
that's good,
it'll educate them.

2507
02:03:46,130 --> 02:03:51,130
Right.
I mean Lindsay Shepherd definitely got 

2508
02:03:51,130 --> 02:03:51,130
educated over the last two months.

2509
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:53,750
No kidding.
No kidding.

2510
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,390
She's got her phd thesis in 
communication.

2511
02:03:56,391 --> 02:03:59,960
Pretty well demonstrated there is an 
auto ethnography for you.

2512
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:05,650
Yeah.
I caused an international scandal by 

2513
02:04:05,650 --> 02:04:05,650
just revealing what had actually 
happened.

2514
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:06,700
Yeah.
Alright.

2515
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:07,850
Alright,
good.

2516
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:10,940
My pleasure.
Thank you guys for coming and also for,

2517
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:16,310
it's not common for faculty members.
Well to talk to me first of all,

2518
02:04:16,311 --> 02:04:21,311
like this.
Certainly not on record and certainly 

2519
02:04:21,311 --> 02:04:21,980
not common for them to be writing and 
speaking openly about such issues.

2520
02:04:21,981 --> 02:04:24,500
So I don't know what the hell got into 
you guys.

2521
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:29,680
It's really good.
That's happening at Wilfrid laurier to 

2522
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:30,590
where were we realize we're finished now
by being associated with you.

2523
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:31,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

2524
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:32,540
I,
I said,

2525
02:04:32,541 --> 02:04:34,880
uh,
earlier good of you to offer yourself on

2526
02:04:34,881 --> 02:04:36,580
the sacrificial altar.
I,

2527
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:39,300
you've got to look your kids in the eye 
eventually.

2528
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,590
Yeah.
And uh,

2529
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:45,980
how are you going to say that you need 
to stand up for truth if you actually 

2530
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:48,270
don't stand up for truth.
That is a problem.

2531
02:04:48,370 --> 02:04:49,140
Yeah.
Yep.

2532
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:51,480
Alright guys.
Good.

2533
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:53,440
Thanks a lot.
