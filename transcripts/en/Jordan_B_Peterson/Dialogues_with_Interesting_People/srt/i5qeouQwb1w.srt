1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,250
So I'm talking today with Samuel Andrea,
who's a composer or Canadian composer 

2
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,990
who's currently residing in Strausberg 
where he's working as a composer and 

3
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,570
we're going to talk today about music,
so,

4
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,690
but I think we'll start off by having 
Sam talk a little bit about his career 

5
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,950
and position itself so that we can move 
into the,

6
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,370
into the conversation and provide a bit 
of context for everybody who's watching 

7
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,120
and listening.
So take it away.

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,920
Well,
I'm a composer.

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,100
I'm from Canada originally and I lived 
there until I was 22 and I decided 

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,740
actually fairly early on that I wanted 
to live in France.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,160
And so I moved to Paris where I studied 
for quite a number of years at the Paris

12
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:00,680
conservatory.
Um,

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,750
I remained there for 12 years and moved 
to Strasburg two and a half years ago 

14
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,920
and I've been here ever since.
So I mainly a composer,

15
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,850
but I do a lot of other things as well.
I'm also a poet.

16
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,980
I'm also a teacher.
I'm also a performer.

17
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,790
So tell me a little bit about your 
experiences in,

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,890
in North America first as a composer.

19
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:24,190
Well,
I should start by saying that because I 

20
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,901
left so young,
I didn't really have the opportunity to 

21
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:26,990
put together anything resembling a 
professional career when I was living in

22
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:28,350
Canada.
Uh,

23
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,230
but what I can say is that I started out
in music by,

24
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,260
by producing songs when I was a teenager
and that became something of an 

25
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,971
obsession.
I was very interested in a sort of 

26
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:46,811
unusual branch of the sort of singer 
songwriter tradition that involved 

27
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:51,670
paying attention to avalon guard 
manifestations of music and trying to 

28
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,830
incorporate those into the pop song 
format.

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,410
And there is a very fascinating and a 
lengthy history of that.

30
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,700
And so that was sort of my initial foray
into music.

31
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:08,780
So I made a total of about eight or nine
albums of,

32
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:09,740
uh,
of songs.

33
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:15,670
And as I was going along with that,
I became more and more interested in 

34
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,810
forms of musical expression that were 
not easily compatible with the song 

35
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:22,810
format.

36
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,680
And that resulted in a kind of 
interesting tension.

37
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,530
And so towards the end of my sort of 
very short lived career as a,

38
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,220
as a singer songwriter,
it became obvious to me that I couldn't,

39
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,670
I couldn't resolve the contradictions 
between sort of popular forms of 

40
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,141
expression and the sorts of things that 
we're really starting to fascinate me 

41
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:44,070
and just keep me up at night in the 
format of the pop song.

42
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:48,950
So that resulted in a kind of schism at 
a certain point where I was making songs

43
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,900
that really didn't sound like songs at 
all.

44
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,700
And it was from that point,
it was a,

45
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:57,740
it was a fairly straightforward matter 
just to abandon ship,

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,940
so to speak,
and,

47
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,280
and,
and basically,

48
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:04,030
uh,
take up a full time composition.

49
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,270
You said that you were trying to 
incorporate avant garde elements into 

50
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,071
your songs.
So I think maybe the first thing you 

51
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:16,681
could do is defined for the listeners 
the difference between the song and and 

52
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:20,820
other forms of composition because it's 
not self evident to people standing 

53
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,700
outside the professional musical 
universe.

54
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,060
And also what you mean by avant garde 
forms and why you were trying to 

55
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,060
incorporate them.

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,090
Well essentially the song is a 
vernacular format,

57
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:30,800
it's a,
it's,

58
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:35,801
it's a form of expression that deals 
with materials that are familiar to 

59
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:36,660
everybody in that are accessible to 
everybody.

60
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,050
So in other words,
the standard pop song has three chords 

61
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,050
for the most part.
And so these are,

62
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,930
these are very easy materials to 
masters,

63
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,920
so anyone you know who's interested 
enough in it can,

64
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,950
can take the trouble to learn those 
three chords and put together something 

65
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,590
resembling a pop song.
They might not be very good at it,

66
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:57,591
but you can still,
you can access the basic fundamental 

67
00:03:57,591 --> 00:03:58,710
building blocks of the pop song fairly 
easily.

68
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,590
Um,
whereas other branches of a composition 

69
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,810
are primarily written,
they're not primarily things that come 

70
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,090
out of a performance tradition 
necessarily.

71
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,960
In other words,
they might be initially encoded as a,

72
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,010
as a score,
and then only after the score is 

73
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,661
written,
do you have hopefully a performance 

74
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:20,940
tradition coming out of the piece.
Whereas an in pop music,

75
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:22,950
it's the opposite.
You start with the instrument,

76
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:24,660
you start with performing,
you start with,

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,220
with the sort of immediate to a sort of 
tactile relationship.

78
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:34,221
You have to,
your instrument and the music sort of 

79
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:37,490
flows out of that,
but you don't begin with the score with 

80
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:37,490
the written document

81
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,680
and these avant garde elements that you 
were talking about.

82
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,700
Two things.
What,

83
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,430
what got you interested in them?
Why did you think it was useful?

84
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:49,431
And uh,
and explain a bit more about what 

85
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:49,650
happened when you started pursuing them.

86
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,180
I didn't think of it in terms of 
utility.

87
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,190
It was something that had literally just
grabbed me by the throat because when 

88
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,970
one thing that started to happen was,
uh,

89
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,190
in the,
in the sixties particularly,

90
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:05,191
you had this very brief cultural moment 
when there was a kind of crossover 

91
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:08,821
between,
between what the postwar avant garde 

92
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:12,091
we're doing and,
and the sort of most broadly popular 

93
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:13,210
rock acts.
So for example,

94
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:18,211
the Beatles on there on the white album 
famously included the track called 

95
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:18,550
revolution nine,
which is a sound collage.

96
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,210
It's a piece of a sonic art.
It is an absolutely no regard a rock 

97
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,170
song.
And they did that because the,

98
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,060
you know,
John Lennon and Paul Mccartney,

99
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,640
we're interested in Stockhausen and 
things like this.

100
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,390
And that's an extraordinary cultural 
moment and the Beatles were far from the

101
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,030
only ones to do that.
So if you,

102
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,120
if you get interested in,
in that kind of music from that year,

103
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:43,960
from the sixties and onwards,
and you look at it closely,

104
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:47,440
you can't help noticing that there's a 
kind of shadow world that's,

105
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,030
that's peeking through via these sorts 
of manifestations and a lot of,

106
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,340
a lot of groups did,
did things like that as well.

107
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,470
The doors did that.
They did very,

108
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:59,690
uh,
strange sort of collage,

109
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,180
avant garde poetry and all sorts of 
things that,

110
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:02,780
uh,
that,

111
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,960
that you can't easily square with the 
demands of the pop song format.

112
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,830
So as I was listening to these things 
when I was 12 or 13 years old,

113
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,550
my attention was instinctively drawn to 
the more unusual elements of those 

114
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,760
records,
which is interesting because when they 

115
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,861
came out,
those were usually the tracks that 

116
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:23,861
everybody skipped,
right?

117
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:23,861
But not,
you know,

118
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:25,280
I was instinctively fascinated by them.

119
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,560
I always thought that Jim Morrison's 
foray outside of the song format was 

120
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:30,560
generally unfortunate.
But,

121
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,700
and I was confused.
Of course,

122
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:34,440
when I listened to revolution number 
nine,

123
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,710
although I thought that in the context 
of that album,

124
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:39,330
it was very interesting because that 
wall,

125
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,420
it's a double album,
which was a very remarkable album and it

126
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:46,260
seemed oddly enough to fit in some 
strange way.

127
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,010
I mean that whole double album fits 
together in a remarkable way even though

128
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:55,011
there's quite a diverse range of,
of a song formats that are incorporated 

129
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,090
into it.
So why do you think the.

130
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,440
So let's do a couple of things.
Why don't we define what constitutes 

131
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,130
avant garde period.
It's not necessarily a term that people,

132
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,250
they've heard it undoubtedly,
but people hear all sorts of,

133
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,090
what would you call them?
Let's call them terms.

134
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,210
They hear all sorts of terms that 
they're not necessarily that haven't 

135
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,211
been well defined.
So you could tell us about the avant 

136
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:21,000
garde.
Tell us why it attracted you,

137
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,830
do you think as well?

138
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,680
Well,
first of all,

139
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:24,820
to define the avant garde.
I mean,

140
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,950
it's,
it's a military term and it simply means

141
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:30,810
the unfortunate souls that are the first
to go into battle out there on the front

142
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:31,750
line,
so to speak.

143
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,810
Um,
and so I suppose that in the,

144
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:38,811
in the artistic domain,
it simply means people who are engaging 

145
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:39,610
in,
in forms of artistic expression that are

146
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:42,310
as yet untested.
Now there's a,

147
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:47,311
you can certainly debate whether that 
term is at all historically valid 

148
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:47,550
anymore.
Um,

149
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,490
and there's a strong case to be made for
saying that the avant garde in a certain

150
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:54,700
sense basically no longer exists because
it's been so thoroughly,

151
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,120
uh,
institutionalized and written about and 

152
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,120
discussed.
And it's very,

153
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,770
very difficult these days to make a work
of art that actually shocks anybody,

154
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,480
you know,
that's a kind of an interesting thing.

155
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:06,220
And that's a very recent phenomenon 
also.

156
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,220
I mean,
you can do absolutely outrageous things 

157
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,220
and,
and,

158
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,980
and have them be installed in public 
places and it'll generate a certain 

159
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,141
amount of civic controversy,
but nothing even remotely close to what 

160
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:20,860
would have happened 60 years ago even.
So that's the first thing,

161
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,010
an interesting phenomenon in and of 
itself,

162
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,340
right?
So there's a kind of extraordinary 

163
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,790
tolerance for all sorts of artistic 
expression.

164
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:34,300
But you could also argue that it's a 
form of societal indifference as well.

165
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:34,930
You could say that,
well,

166
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:39,931
the reason nobody's rioting and no one's
shocked and and seeking to have these 

167
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:44,380
sorts of cultural forms bend is because 
it simply doesn't matter.

168
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:46,930
Those sorts of arts have been declawed 
in a certain sense.

169
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,720
I mean there's an argument you could 
make in that sense.

170
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,940
People are so flooded with sounds and 
images now too,

171
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:55,530
that the sheer volume of those sorts of 
things that we're to,

172
00:08:55,531 --> 00:09:00,180
I also think inoculates us against or 
also inoculate,

173
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,560
inoculate us against shock but also 
makes it more and more difficult to be 

174
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,040
sufficiently original to actually have 
that effect on people.

175
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,300
I mean,
it's not like people have dropped all 

176
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,300
their taboos because you see that the 
Da,

177
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,140
the taboos about what can be said for 
example,

178
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:21,141
just shift around.
But it certainly does seem to be the 

179
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:21,300
case that it's harder for artists to,
to,

180
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,390
to play,
uh,

181
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,780
to play a role that it also,
I suppose speaks to some degree to the 

182
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,070
degeneration of cultural norms around,
around all sorts of different areas.

183
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,830
Because if there are strongly 
established norms,

184
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:37,650
it's a lot easier to violate them.
And that's pretty interesting because it

185
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:41,000
also means you can't be a revolutionary 
unless there's a half decent tire around

186
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:41,820
to him.
Me End,

187
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,080
so.
Right.

188
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,570
Yeah.
So why do you think the avant garde 

189
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:48,880
attracted you instead of it's.
I mean,

190
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,300
it,
it,

191
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,410
it would have been more typical,
let's say for someone who started out 

192
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,710
composing pop songs to continue in that 
vein,

193
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:58,990
not to go down the rabbit hole of the 
avant garde,

194
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:01,120
which is a very strange thing for anyone
to do.

195
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,580
Yeah,
a couple of reasons.

196
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:05,840
The first thing is that the,
the,

197
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,110
the pop song format is interesting in 
that it,

198
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,380
it only works if you stay relatively 
close to its parameters and if you start

199
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:19,741
to stray too far outside of them than 
what you're doing basically no longer 

200
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:21,010
functions as a pop song because it's no 
longer vernacular.

201
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,460
And so I have a fascination with all 
sorts of forms of music and the pop song

202
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:31,340
is an incredibly difficult medium to 
work within.

203
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,590
Again,
because you,

204
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,690
first of all,
it's.

205
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,320
It gets completely unforgiving.
You're working in basically a,

206
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,370
an extremely compressed format.
It's very rare for pop songs to be too 

207
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,551
much longer than three minutes,
so you don't really have much room to 

208
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:46,750
maneuver and you certainly don't have 
any room to maneuver structurally.

209
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:49,120
I mean you pretty much have to stick to 
the verse,

210
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:49,720
Chorus,
verse,

211
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:53,080
chorus thing from the immense majority 
of pop songs.

212
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,440
There's been very little variation in 
that since since rock really since the 

213
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,440
fifties.

214
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,970
I mean I know that three minute length 
was.

215
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,850
That was actually a commercial 
imposition if I remember correctly,

216
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,920
but that structure verse,
chorus,

217
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:07,700
verse,
Chorus,

218
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,530
what out of what did that originate?

219
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,890
Well,
that's a.

220
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,290
that's an extremely old forum and you 
certainly have a.

221
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,920
there's a there.
There are broke forms such as the Rondo 

222
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,291
or the returned mail though that have an
extremely similar forum where you 

223
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,831
alternate one fixed element that keeps 
returning the same way essentially and 

224
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:27,990
then a secondary element that that sort 
of gives you a certain degree of relief,

225
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:32,340
a certain degree of a contrast with the 
proceeding element,

226
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,690
so that's a chaos order interplay I 
guess of sorts.

227
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:38,340
At least that's the way I would 
interpret it.

228
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:40,680
And why the three guards structure,
why,

229
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,290
why do you think instead of two chords 
or four chords,

230
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,360
why,
why do you think that's dominated?

231
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,430
Well,
if three chord structure is the bare 

232
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,400
minimum that you need in order to have 
any kind of harmonic tension basically,

233
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,440
uh,
in,

234
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:54,280
in,
in music,

235
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,580
generally speaking,
you,

236
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,780
you in tonal music anyway,
you have a very simple and effective 

237
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,360
polarity between the what's called the 
tonic and the dominant degrees.

238
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,430
And that's,
that's something that was,

239
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,280
that basically structured the entire 
classical period of the baroque period 

240
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,280
as well to it.

241
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,420
Unpack that for.
That's for us.

242
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,220
And tell us what that is.
Why that,

243
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,370
why that,
why that works musically?

244
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,480
White works aesthetically?
Well,

245
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:22,810
it's,

246
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,090
it's one of many possible strategies for
music.

247
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:28,790
And in fact if you,
if you go beyond the broke into,

248
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,930
into renaissance music or,
or,

249
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,980
or even earlier,
you don't have this sort of strong 

250
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,520
polarity between two opposing harmonic 
regions.

251
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,460
That was something that really came 
about during the 17th century,

252
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:40,850
basically.

253
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,690
Conversational.
Do you think that,

254
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,720
like one of the things that I've noticed
about many pieces of music is that they 

255
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,381
sound like dialogues.
There's an announcement on the one hand 

256
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:55,681
and then there's the response on the 
other and then there's an announcement 

257
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:55,681
and then there's a response.
It,

258
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:59,370
it seems to me to be based in dialogue 
based analogically metaphorically,

259
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,720
maybe in dialogue you hear that in many 
classical pieces as well.

260
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,640
So I would say that it's,
it's,

261
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,670
it's a way of setting up an extremely 
rudimentary story and extremely 

262
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,850
rudimentary form of narrative in the 
sense that you start with that

263
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,140
a region that is established that you,
that you basically have as your home 

264
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,890
base essentially,
and then you,

265
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:24,891
you modulate to a different,
different harmonic region and through 

266
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:27,010
this process of modulating,
you move from

267
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,000
your home base to somewhere else and 
that creates a tension.

268
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:34,900
It creates a nostalgia and it creates a 
need for resolution.

269
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,250
Um,
there are plenty of other ways you can 

270
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,250
do right.
Well,

271
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,250
okay.
So That's interesting.

272
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,551
I mean for a variety of reasons.
One thing that made me that made me 

273
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:50,041
think about right away is the proclivity
of small children to do that with their 

274
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,910
mother in particular,
so the space around the mother is 

275
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,650
defined as home territory,
partly because mother is familiar,

276
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:02,070
but also partly because if something 
goes wrong and mother is their mother 

277
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,800
can fix it,
so so there's.

278
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,990
There's a zone around the child when the
mother is there,

279
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,830
where there is access to immediate 
resources that will fill in where the 

280
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,911
child's skills are lacking,
and then what the child will do after 

281
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:22,681
obtaining sufficient comfort from being 
in the presence of mom is to go out far 

282
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:24,730
enough into the world,
driven by their curiosity,

283
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,080
which which has an underlying biological
manifestation.

284
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,530
There's an exploratory system that 
drives the child out there too.

285
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:38,390
It discovered new information and to 
extend their skills by pushing against 

286
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,650
the unknown and then when that when they
either get tired or when they go out far

287
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:45,940
enough so that negative emotion as a 
consequence of threat predominates,

288
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:50,740
they run back to their mother.
And so it reminded me of that.

289
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:53,300
And it's also a microcosm of the hero's 
journey,

290
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:56,440
right?
Which is the journey from a safe and and

291
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,810
defined plays out into the unknown and 
then a return.

292
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,670
And that is,
well,

293
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,100
I wouldn't even say that's the simplest 
story.

294
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,740
That's the simplest story that also 
involves transformation.

295
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,710
So it might be the simplest good story,
something like that.

296
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,040
But I haven't mapped that on to that.
A chorus,

297
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,740
a,
what'd you call it?

298
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,270
Verse Chorus?
Yes,

299
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:17,950
yes,
yes.

300
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,190
So that and that return to stability.
So,

301
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,210
so you think,
so does that make sense?

302
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:25,010
That mapping as far as you're concerned?

303
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,350
Absolutely,
because one of the,

304
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,610
one of the main tenants of the,
of the,

305
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,410
the total harmonic system is that you 
have an eventual return to where you 

306
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,730
started out at the end.
So there's,

307
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,760
there's always the promise of a return 
at the end and that's the essential 

308
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,740
structure that you see in pop songs as 
well.

309
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,540
So it's,
it's fundamentally a,

310
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:48,550
it's a directional to td logical sort of
structure.

311
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,520
Um,
and that's extremely different from,

312
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,790
from renaissance music,
which basically has a very,

313
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:59,791
very weak degree of directionality.
It doesn't seem to want to particularly 

314
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,090
go anywhere.
It sort of floats and uh,

315
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,930
that's,
that's an interesting thing that,

316
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,790
that music sort of window off in this 
other sort of direction.

317
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,670
Did you have any idea why that 
transformational curd?

318
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,290
Well,
I think it's because there was a,

319
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:19,291
a need for a more dramatically intense 
form of music and that certainly that 

320
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:24,661
certainly took,
took place during the Baroque and of 

321
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:26,791
course that's related to the power and 
cultural influence of the Catholic 

322
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,560
Church and the need to create forms of 
artwork that would be extremely dramatic

323
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:30,370
and expressive.

324
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,970
And in Baroque music you have this 
intensification of musical expression 

325
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,300
that's,
that's quite striking in a sense.

326
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:38,200
You could say that,
that,

327
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,230
that strongly directional thrust that 
you get in music developed even further 

328
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,570
in the classical and then in the 
romantic periods as well,

329
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,720
to the point where it,
it,

330
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,790
it becomes this sort of constant push 
towards ever more cataclysmic forms of 

331
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,460
expression until it actually ruptures 
the fabric of music itself.

332
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:00,100
You,
you no longer can contain this,

333
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,170
this level of extra acidity.
Okay,

334
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:07,171
so let's go back a little bit too.
So lots of the people that are 

335
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:07,171
listening,
I presume,

336
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,220
won't know the,
the

337
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,910
temporal relationship between those 
periods of musical development that you 

338
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,740
just described.
So why don't you go back to the,

339
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,800
to the medieval era and then just lay 
out the periods of time across which 

340
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,900
music developed and then we'll go back 
to that idea of this cataclysmic 

341
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,590
upheaval that sort of shattered the 
structure of music.

342
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:27,880
Say in the 20th century.

343
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,130
Well there's only so far you can go back
because music has only begun to be 

344
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,910
written down in a way that's,
that's reliably retrievable since the 

345
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,051
late 14th century or so.
So if you try to go too much farther 

346
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:45,550
back than that,
you end up with documents that are 

347
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,971
extremely hard to decipher.
We don't really know exactly what these 

348
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:48,971
things sounded like.

349
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:50,010
We've got about six years.
Yeah,

350
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,980
we've got about 600 years.
So roughly speaking,

351
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,250
the renaissance period extends to about 
1600.

352
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,370
So roughly between 1400 and 1600 and the
Baroque is usually said to end with the 

353
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:07,191
death of bar in 1750.
Then you have a kind of no man's land 

354
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:12,260
that lasted 20 or 30 years where there 
was a sort of in between period of,

355
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:17,290
of generalized experimentation,
but there wasn't yet a strongly 

356
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,800
characterized style yet,
and then you have classicism that starts

357
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,750
really towards the,
well in the second half of the,

358
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,870
of the 18th century and romanticism is a
little bit more difficult to pin down,

359
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:31,080
but,
but Beethoven is considered to be one of

360
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:33,690
the earlier exponents of,
uh,

361
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,400
of a,
of a romantic style.

362
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:40,401
He died in 18,
27 so that more or less takes us to the 

363
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:44,151
end of the 19th century.
Then you have something that you could 

364
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:47,450
plausibly call late romanticism,
although that's very difficult to 

365
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,511
define.
And that sort of dovetails with 

366
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:50,511
modernism.

367
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:52,240
So can you set out some of the defining 
features of each of those,

368
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,930
set out the defining features of each of
those parks,

369
00:18:55,931 --> 00:19:00,931
let's say.
And then maybe you can walk us through 

370
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,620
this idea that you expressed about 
increasingly cataclysmic changes and 

371
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:09,310
then that resulting in in sight 20th 
century music.

372
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,260
That takes us back to the avant garde as
well.

373
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,620
The first thing I would say is that 
these sorts of categorizations are are 

374
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,620
generalizations.
I mean you can't,

375
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,930
you can't take 200 years of human 
cultural endeavor and reduce them down 

376
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,460
to a single word and of course these 
things are constantly flowing and,

377
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:26,310
and,
and transforming and,

378
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:28,090
and they're all in there.
Also,

379
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:33,091
all sorts of overlapping.
I'm contrasting movements happening at 

380
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:38,941
any given time,
so this is really just for the sake of 

381
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:38,941
convenience,
but,

382
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:39,160
but if you want us to make a 
generalization,

383
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:40,810
you could say that during the 
renaissance,

384
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:45,811
music was essentially linear.
It was essentially melodic and and 

385
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,850
contrapuntal.
In other words that you would have,

386
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,880
you would have individual voices,
individual lines that would be flowing 

387
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,621
along together,
but music was not yet primarily thought 

388
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:45,520
of in terms of vertical or harmonica 
sonorities.

389
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,150
That really starts to with it,
with the Baroque early in the 17th 

390
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,601
century,
baroque music has a much stronger 

391
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,370
harmonic,
a dimension to it.

392
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,810
It's,
it's.

393
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,570
You could argue that it's harmonically 
somewhat simpler than,

394
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,730
than renaissance music because it's more
codified.

395
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,240
That's when you start getting the first 
treatises on harmony.

396
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:12,070
The first theoretical writings on music 
also isn't the Baroque period.

397
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,790
It's also characterized by the use of 
highly stylized and very strong dance 

398
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:18,520
rhythms

399
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,320
that the classical period is essentially
a simplification of the Baroque style 

400
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,731
and a certain sentence and music became 
strongly divided between what you would 

401
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,990
call foreground and background elements.
In other words,

402
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:03,991
you would have a very prominent melodic 
line and then you would have an 

403
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,520
accompaniment,
but the two are not necessarily of equal

404
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:11,521
importance.
Whereas in the Baroque and the 

405
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:13,411
renaissance,
the voices would have tended to be 

406
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:13,411
basically equal importance.
There's very,

407
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:15,220
there's very little foreground 
background distinction in,

408
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,340
in Baroque and uh,
and pre baroque music.

409
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,250
So the classical style is a 
simplification.

410
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:23,680
It's also a codification of musical 
forums.

411
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:25,660
That's when you start getting the 
symphony,

412
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,980
the string quartet a,
the concerto while the concertos with 

413
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,590
broke for him,
but it starts to take on the 

414
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,120
characteristics of a,
of other classical forms such as the,

415
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,520
the sonata in the classical period.
So you get this,

416
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:42,800
basically this is codification and the 
simplification of the,

417
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,250
of the basic tools of music in the 
classical period.

418
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,640
And in the classical period is,
is quite extraordinary actually,

419
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:50,370
because it's,
it's,

420
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,460
it's,
it was a rather short lived period in 

421
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,910
which for a very brief span of time,
there is a,

422
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:58,930
a,
a,

423
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,010
an overlapping of popular and savant 
styles.

424
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:08,550
So you had,
you had sort of a vernacular dimension 

425
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,180
in the classical period.
You had very simple popular forums and 

426
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:17,431
popular forms of expression and you also
had the absolute highest degree of 

427
00:23:17,431 --> 00:23:19,960
musical science and they were combined.
I'm not in every composer,

428
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:24,961
but certainly the,
the one that comes to mind as having 

429
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:27,721
been the highest manifestation of that 
combination of the different qualities 

430
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:27,721
is Mozart.

431
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,600
That's probably a unique historical 
phenomenon.

432
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:58,080
I mean,
there's,

433
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,130
there,
there aren't very many composers that 

434
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:03,130
can,
that can achieve that.

435
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,400
And in a sense,
you have to be historically lucky that 

436
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,740
the state of the musical language,
when you're alive has to,

437
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,480
has to coincide with your own,
uh,

438
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,820
need to,
uh,

439
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,010
to push the boundaries of your art.
And so that's a,

440
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,750
that's an amazing thing.
And a romanticism,

441
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:20,760
more or less puts an end to that because
it,

442
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,110
it puts a tremendous degree of focus on 
the individual.

443
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,280
It's,
it's an exacerbation of the idea of the 

444
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,280
self and it,
it,

445
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,160
it elevates the subjective emotional 
impulses of the artists to a,

446
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,080
to a very high realm.
And so you get these forms of individual

447
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:45,081
expression that begin to not really jive
with the,

448
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,460
the underlying rules of the art.
And that's when things really get 

449
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:50,460
complicated.

450
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,650
Okay.
So that moves us into the,

451
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,700
into the,
uh,

452
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,890
you've just talked about the classical 
period.

453
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:59,460
The next one that comes along is 
romantic,

454
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,720
right?
Okay.

455
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:05,990
What happens during the romantic period 
and you said Beethoven was nearly an 

456
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,190
early manifestation of that with his 
sort of cataclysmic

457
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,760
starts off writing music that's strongly
influenced by Haydn who's,

458
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:17,761
uh,
who's one of the most important 

459
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:17,761
classical composers.
And by the end of his career,

460
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:22,201
he's doing pieces that basically are,
are destroying these forms from within.

461
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,920
It's very,
very interesting.

462
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:27,130
If you listen to Beethoven works like 
the Hammerklavier Sonata for example,

463
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:32,131
or the late string quartet.
It's basically pulling apart these,

464
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,970
these,
uh,

465
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,730
these,
these forums in it,

466
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,810
in a rather ruthless way.
And,

467
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,270
and,
uh,

468
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,230
just pulverizing them.

469
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,260
There's an analogy between that and what
happens in other fields of endeavor.

470
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,390
You know,
that the philosopher of science,

471
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:12,391
Thomas Kuhn talked about and,
and also the developmental 

472
00:26:12,391 --> 00:26:12,391
psychologists,
piaget,

473
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,400
what's with these revolutions in stages,
you when,

474
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,480
so for Piaget or for science scientists 
were working within,

475
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,740
let's call it an axiomatic theory and 
then make it a create new data into that

476
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:33,811
theory without disrupting the axioms,
but now along now and then some data 

477
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:36,490
would come along that didn't even fit 
within the axioms.

478
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,910
And then that data would generally be 
ignored for a while because no one knew 

479
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,070
what to do with it.
You know?

480
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:47,071
And,
and it isn't reasonable to leap to the 

481
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:47,250
conclusion that if your theory doesn't 
predict something,

482
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:52,251
that it should immediately be scrapped 
because there's always the possibility 

483
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:56,091
that the data itself is wrong,
but now and then something new comes 

484
00:26:56,671 --> 00:26:58,950
along,
that's enough to collapse the science.

485
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,950
In some sense all the way down to its 
unstated assumptions which then have to 

486
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,461
be recast now piaget thought of 
something similar in terms of 

487
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:11,460
developmental stages in children and in 
adults that the same thing happened when

488
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:16,461
we were organizing our internal 
representations of the world and but 

489
00:27:16,461 --> 00:27:20,570
Piaget coon seemed to be a bit of a 
relativist and that he believed that 

490
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,160
paradigm's could be in incommensurate,
that you really couldn't speak between 

491
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,941
them.
It makes them a precursor in some ways 

492
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,221
to to post modernism,
but Piaget's point was that each stage 

493
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:35,760
transition in human cognition which was 
accompanied by,

494
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,360
by the way,
by a descent into chaos of some sort.

495
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,590
As the anomalous data accumulated.
Each stage that emerged was superior to 

496
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,640
the one before it because you could do 
everything you could do in that stage.

497
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:55,670
Plus you could do more and so piaget 
there was actually progress along the 

498
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:00,000
along the stage transformations.
Whereas for coon,

499
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,820
although I think Kuhn is less a emphatic
about that,

500
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:06,960
that many,
many of his readers seem to think.

501
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:10,320
Whereas for cone it was more like 
lateral transformation or something like

502
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:10,650
that.
I mean,

503
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:15,651
it's been a big debate,
but it sounds very much to me like 

504
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:16,350
something similar is happening as 
musical forms develop.

505
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,220
Oh sure.
It would be impossible to make the 

506
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,441
argument though that,
that this is constitutes in any way a 

507
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:25,700
progression or a,
um,

508
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,370
an improvement over time.
You can't really make that argument 

509
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,400
about musical forums because they're 
always checks and balances.

510
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:35,040
There are always pluses and minuses that
are attendant with any,

511
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,470
any novel form of musical expression.

512
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,890
Yeah.
Well that's the good things that seems 

513
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,161
to distinguish art from science in some 
sense is that it isn't obvious that art 

514
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:47,020
is improving.
Right?

515
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,910
Right.
Whereas at least in principle,

516
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:53,911
it seems obvious that science is 
improving in that piaget way is that we 

517
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:57,790
could do everything we could plus more,
but art so maybe aren't really does have

518
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:02,791
that structure that Thomas Kuhn talked 
about where that paradigms are 

519
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:05,290
incommensurate and there's no,
there's no progression where science has

520
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:10,291
the more Eddie and structure where there
is actually something that you can 

521
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:12,340
regard as genuine progress.

522
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:18,450
Well,
what you do have is a constant 

523
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,750
oscillation between two fundamental 
states and music history,

524
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:24,751
which is you have periods of expansion 
periods in which axioms are tested and 

525
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:31,051
rethought and periods of consolidation 
in which you strip away and you simplify

526
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:36,510
and that's a.
that's a permanent feature of music 

527
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:36,510
history.
It's a.

528
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,300
it's a.
it's a very interesting thing when 

529
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:40,300
things start to get a little bit too 
wild,

530
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,190
there tends to be a counter reaction and
a tendency simplification.

531
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:47,310
Certainly that's what happened in the in
the classical with regards to the 

532
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,310
Baroque period.

533
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:51,000
So it's interesting because it kind of 
implies that the entire system overtime 

534
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,010
is oscillating around some sort of 
golden mean or something like that.

535
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:59,310
I mean not that that thing actually 
exists in some sense because it would 

536
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,580
move,
you know,

537
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,120
where the appropriate place is going to 
be dependent on the nature of the 

538
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,171
landscape at that point,
but the case you're making is that 

539
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:11,320
despite that there's some boundaries on 
the movement.

540
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,560
There is so much chaos and which would 
be,

541
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:19,561
I suppose,
too much revolutionary transformation 

542
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:19,660
and I suppose that the degeneration 
there would be,

543
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,340
the experimentation could be so extreme 
that would actually break the boundaries

544
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:26,140
of what people are willing to,
to,

545
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,630
uh,
to accept as music.

546
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,110
There has to be,

547
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,840
be a social contract between the,
between the artist and the,

548
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:36,841
and the public,
unless you're making a totally hermetic 

549
00:30:36,841 --> 00:30:39,481
art,
unless you're making an art that is not 

550
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:39,481
necessarily intended for public 
consumption.

551
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:41,110
So that's a very delicate balancing act 
of course,

552
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:46,111
because artists have the natural 
inclination to explore and audiences 

553
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:50,431
have the natural inclination to stay 
close to things that are familiar to 

554
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,340
them and that are already satisfying to 
them in some manner.

555
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,070
So what do you think that contract is 
exactly?

556
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:59,071
Because obviously the audience also 
doesn't want to stay exactly where they 

557
00:30:59,071 --> 00:30:59,140
are.

558
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:04,250
It's very difficult to speak in general 
terms of audiences because they're made 

559
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,520
up of individuals and individuals have 
wildly different approaches to music and

560
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:08,470
wildly different tastes in music as 
well.

561
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,490
I mean,
one of the,

562
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
one of the extraordinary things about 
music is that it has so many different 

563
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,300
functions simultaneously.
If you were to take all of the different

564
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:19,900
functions that music fulfills and and 
abstract out the music part and then try

565
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:24,901
to understand what phenomenon could 
possibly cover all of those different 

566
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:29,311
functions,
you'd be very hard pressed to think of 

567
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:29,311
anything.
I mean music is,

568
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:29,311
is a,
it's a science,

569
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:31,180
but it's also a form of entertainment.

570
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,460
Okay.
So you were just speaking about that,

571
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,480
the actual function of music and so 
let's,

572
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:41,510
let's pick it up there because that's a 
really interesting issue and the 

573
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,921
function and meaning of music and I 
would really like to hear your thoughts 

574
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:44,921
on that.
So let's,

575
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:45,290
let's go.
Let's go from there.

576
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,370
You can't speak of the function of music
because music has so many different 

577
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,341
functions.
They seem on the surface of it to be 

578
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:54,380
almost completely incompatible.
So you have music that functions as a,

579
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:57,910
as a form of an expression of religious 
devotion,

580
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,300
but you have music as well that whose 
primary focus is to get teenagers to go 

581
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,590
out on dates.
You have a,

582
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,760
you have music that is crassly 
commercial,

583
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,910
you have music that is a meditative and 
sublime.

584
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,870
You have music that represents the 
highest aspirations of mankind,

585
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:18,990
um,
and music that is piped in through 

586
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:18,990
elevators.
I mean,

587
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:19,240
that's just a very,
very partial list.

588
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:21,670
I could go on and on and on.
So again,

589
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:24,070
it's a,
it's an absolutely amazing phenomenon in

590
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:26,650
terms of the sheer number of functions 
that it,

591
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,120
that it covers.
Uh,

592
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,140
it's,
it's also,

593
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:32,560
it's good to dance to a,
it's good for movies.

594
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:35,350
It's a,
in anything you can possibly think of.

595
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,600
There's been some form of music device.
Those

596
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,530
functions is actually a little universe.
I mean the fact that that music seems to

597
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:46,160
be useful in movies is a strange 
phenomena,

598
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:47,360
you know,
because if you go,

599
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,830
if you go see a movie that lacks music,
you,

600
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,920
you actually become aware of quite 
rapidly that it lacks music and it,

601
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,770
it's much more two dimensional in some 
sense that,

602
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,670
I mean,
you could do it,

603
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:01,070
but it's much more two dimensional.
It's much more difficult.

604
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,580
What the music seems to do is to Philly 
in somehow for the,

605
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,960
for the locking context,
it,

606
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:08,840
you know,
it makes it rich and,

607
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,120
and moral Rio,
which is even more surprising and it 

608
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,480
partly does that by exaggerating,
I think the emotions that are being 

609
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,371
portrayed but it,
well obviously if you could say 

610
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:22,400
completely what the music is doing in a 
movie,

611
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:25,810
then you wouldn't need to put the music 
in because you could just incorporate it

612
00:33:25,811 --> 00:33:26,390
into a story.

613
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:31,390
But you talked about elevators,
dancing and movies among many other 

614
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,071
things.
And those three things are 

615
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:37,331
extraordinarily different because 
obviously what's being piped into the 

616
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:39,260
elevator is there to what,
calm,

617
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:44,261
the awkward silence something.
It's something like that with something 

618
00:33:44,261 --> 00:33:45,800
familiar.
Maybe it takes the edge off being locked

619
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:46,960
in an elevator with,
you know,

620
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,280
multiple other primates that you've 
never met.

621
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:54,770
And people make fun of it too because 
it's denatured music in some sense.

622
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,720
But obviously there's a demand and a 
requirement for it and a function.

623
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:00,740
So,
um,

624
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,210
while anyways.
Okay.

625
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:07,211
So we talked about the multi,
multiple contradictory and paradoxical 

626
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,010
rules that music can play.
But let's,

627
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,900
let's go a little deeper and why don't 
you have,

628
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:15,970
why don't you tell us what you think,
what do you think music is doing and why

629
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:19,700
it's so important?
Assuming it is in fact important,

630
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:20,810
it certainly seems to be.

631
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,530
Well,
again,

632
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,840
it's very difficult to talk generally 
about that.

633
00:34:24,841 --> 00:34:28,710
And if you look at non Western cultures 
and the role that music plays in them,

634
00:34:28,711 --> 00:34:29,370
it's,
it's,

635
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,460
it's often extremely different from what
from what we do with it.

636
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,620
So for example,
a south Indian music is,

637
00:34:34,621 --> 00:34:35,190
is,
uh,

638
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,030
is very,
very long and drawn out and it's a,

639
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,430
it's essentially melodic.
There's no harmony in it.

640
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,490
These are extremely long forms and you,
you can't,

641
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,800
you can't listen to them if you only 
have five minutes.

642
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:48,450
It's a,
it's an entire experience.

643
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,090
A Tibetan music is very closely tied up 
with,

644
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,590
with ritual,
for example.

645
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,730
It's a,
it's a way of reinforcing certain order 

646
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,290
of doing things in.
So it's a,

647
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,230
there are all sorts of examples.

648
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,680
I think in more traditional societies 
are more archaic societies.

649
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,220
The music is rarely divorced from the 
surrounding context.

650
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:10,340
It's not divorced from dance.
It's not divorced for masks,

651
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:14,690
it's not divorced from the religious 
context and one of the things you see as

652
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,500
cultural differentiate,
let's say you could say developed,

653
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:21,500
but let's say differentiate is that,
um,

654
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,650
there's a fragmentation of phenomena 
into their,

655
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,360
into their higher resolution 
subcomponents,

656
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,650
you know,
so the language of biology for example,

657
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:35,651
continues to expand as we develop higher
and higher resolution models of the 

658
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:40,061
world.
And as a society has more and more 

659
00:35:40,061 --> 00:35:41,250
dimensions,
it's possible to specialize more in each

660
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:46,251
of the sub dimensions.
And that also both breaks things apart 

661
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:47,400
but also allows for their further 
manifestation.

662
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,450
So we could say as a general rule,
maybe as you go back into the past,

663
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,930
then the number of things that is 
happening simultaneously along with 

664
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,470
music explicitly probably increases.
You know,

665
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,820
I'd been struck by,
Oh,

666
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,090
one of my friends told me about going to
a,

667
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,420
a led Zeppelin concert in Sweden and 
everyone was sitting politely,

668
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,450
you know,
he was from a culture where everybody 

669
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,251
would have been standing up and cheering
and dancing and clapping and dancing 

670
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:16,251
essentially.
Right?

671
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:18,390
Because of the music.
But that was frowned upon there,

672
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:20,550
which is very,
very interesting because it's an,

673
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:25,570
you know,
it's an indication of that kind of 

674
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:25,570
almost artificial fragmentation.
So.

675
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:25,790
Right.

676
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,920
Well I think that,
I think that analysis is absolutely 

677
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:30,920
accurate.
It's,

678
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,050
if you look at Baroque music for 
example,

679
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:35,640
what you have is a generalized it kind 
of stylized version of dense.

680
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:37,390
It's not,
it's not the same as,

681
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:39,450
as music that you would actually dance 
to,

682
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:40,900
but,
but the,

683
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:45,901
the entire broke period really rests 
upon dense rhythms and that,

684
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,650
that goes for pretty much everything 
Bach ever wrote from,

685
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,630
uh,
from the cantatas down to the Fuchs.

686
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,210
I mean,
they're all based on dense rhythms.

687
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:59,211
Fundamentally,
that's a very interesting thing because 

688
00:36:59,211 --> 00:36:59,580
obviously nobody dances to a fugue.
I mean,

689
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:05,090
I suppose you could,
but that's not really its primary 

690
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,791
function.
So very interesting thing happens where 

691
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:11,070
you get music that is,
that is no longer explicitly devotional.

692
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:16,071
That is,
it's not explicitly meant to be 

693
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:16,071
performed as part of a liturgical 
service of some kind,

694
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:18,650
but it's not necessarily meant to be 
dense to either a.

695
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,680
and that's if you,
if you look at music as being a 

696
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,600
phenomenon that's easily existed for 
10,000

697
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:29,601
years,
I mean that's the amount of the span of 

698
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:29,601
time during which that's been the case 
is,

699
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:31,710
is just a drop in the bucket.
This is a very,

700
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:34,890
very recent thing.
The idea that that you would get several

701
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:39,890
hundred or several thousand people to go
and sit quietly in a room while 

702
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,560
someone's playing and just sit there and
listen.

703
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,570
That's,
that's extremely recent.

704
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:44,360
That really only starts to happen in,
in,

705
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,580
in really in the romantic period,
the idea of a,

706
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:52,581
of a concert per se,
where there's nothing else attendant on 

707
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:52,581
the experience of the music.

708
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:54,070
Right?
Well and then pop concerts,

709
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:59,071
rock concerts,
a lot of that additional material has 

710
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,771
been put back in the form of light show 
and sometimes in more dramatic forms 

711
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:05,200
than not.
But the light show I suppose is as close

712
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:09,010
as you can get to representing what 
music is doing in a visual format.

713
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,230
And I mean that was,
that was conscious.

714
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,690
I know that it was,
if I remember correctly,

715
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:18,691
it was Ken Keasy in his,
in his band of merry pranksters that 

716
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:22,200
first started to experiment with 
electronic lighting and that sort of 

717
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,141
thing in California when they were 
experimenting with Lsd back in the 

718
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:28,441
sixties and they were interested in 
synesthesia and I know there were 

719
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:31,591
classical composers who were playing 
with that much earlier and I suppose as 

720
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:33,940
well,
but in the non electronic format,

721
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:38,941
you could chase that back an long way.
The idea of spectacle encompassing 

722
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:38,941
music.

723
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,150
So.
Okay.

724
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:45,151
So,
so let's circle around the musical 

725
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:45,151
element a bit more.
I mean,

726
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:48,130
you've thought a lot about this and you 
also write poetry and I also want to get

727
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:53,131
back to the periods after the romantic 
because we never did finish that 

728
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:53,550
discussion about,
you know,

729
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,670
the cataclysmic restructuring of musical
forms up into the modern period.

730
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:58,690
So,
but let's,

731
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,240
let's,
let's start by pursuing the,

732
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,810
the meaning issue.
Uh,

733
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,680
so you are gripped by music and the 
avant garde and,

734
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,490
and you thought about it for awhile,
like,

735
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,230
and you've laid out some of the,
like the ordering functions of music for

736
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:16,231
example,
but there's a disordering function of 

737
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:16,231
music as well.
So,

738
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:20,730
so give us some more your thoughts about
exactly what music is doing for people 

739
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:20,740
and,
and,

740
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,370
uh,
in a,

741
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:23,260
in a,
in the deepest possible sense.

742
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:29,130
Well,
one of the fundamental aspects of music 

743
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:29,130
now,
if you were to try to define music,

744
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,310
you would,
you would probably have to conclude that

745
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:34,390
it has two essential components.
One is time and when is sound,

746
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:39,870
uh,
it's difficult to give too much of a 

747
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,350
higher resolution definition of music 
than that because it very,

748
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,250
very quickly starts to,
it starts to exclude all sorts of things

749
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:46,600
that are,
that are thought of his music.

750
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,320
But that's,
that's the essential a basis of it.

751
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:56,321
I would say that between the two,
probably the temporal dimension is the 

752
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:57,710
most important.
And fundamentally I would say what music

753
00:39:57,711 --> 00:40:02,711
allows you to do is to experience forms 
of time that we cannot experience in,

754
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:07,190
in so-called real life.
So for example,

755
00:40:07,191 --> 00:40:07,730
in,
in,

756
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:10,820
in music,
you can have a sort of distension of,

757
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:15,850
of actual lift time or a contraction.
You can have multiple things happening 

758
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,870
simultaneously.
Uh,

759
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:22,010
you can have people enter into 
effectively a trance state where there 

760
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,190
are no longer aware of time.
That's an amazing thing.

761
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:26,370
Also,
you know,

762
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,030
a lot of music has that explicit 
function to it.

763
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,010
Well,
the idea,

764
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,660
you know,
music has always struck me as something 

765
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,600
like a four dimensional sculpture that's
manifesting itself in three dimensions.

766
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:42,601
So when I,
when I listened to music and Stereo 

767
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:45,480
listening of course enhances this,
you can see these notes spread out 

768
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,710
spatially,
um,

769
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,840
in the,
in the three dimensions that you're 

770
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:51,840
capable of perceiving from an auditory 
perspective.

771
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,480
And so there are these patterns that 
manifest themselves moment by moment,

772
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,690
but the entire pattern stretches across 
time.

773
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:03,550
And so for me,
and then there's pattern upon pattern as

774
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:08,551
well.
And then there's transforming patterns 

775
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,921
upon transforming patterns.
And to me that's a very close analog to 

776
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:15,001
what the world is like.
And it's in its multiplicity of layers 

777
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:16,960
that are all interacting in.
So far as anything is real.

778
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:21,961
It constitutes a pattern that repeats 
either spatially or temporarily means 

779
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,520
things like smoke,
for example,

780
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:29,730
a cloud of smoke is sort of pseudo real 
in that sense because it doesn't really 

781
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,550
have any borders,
doesn't have any real repetition,

782
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:36,030
but most things,
although it does persist across moments 

783
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,290
of time,
which is a form of a,

784
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,670
of a patterning,
but most things that we interact with do

785
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:42,650
repeat at least to some degree.

786
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:48,310
That's what object permanence is.
The repetition of something across time 

787
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:51,821
and music seems to model the persistence
and the transformation across multiple 

788
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:53,520
levels all at the same time.
And,

789
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:58,730
and what you said about the distinction 
of time is interesting because Murcia 

790
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,060
Eliana,
who's great historian of religions and 

791
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,070
Freud himself both,
both talked about the,

792
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:09,071
um,
the transformation of time and the 

793
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:12,071
transcendence of time in certain states,
a fried noted that dreams were really 

794
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,720
good at compressing time or extending 
time and you know,

795
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:19,721
so people have that experience.
Sometimes they'll hear the alarm go off 

796
00:42:19,721 --> 00:42:23,231
in the morning and instead of waking up,
they'll incorporate the alarm sound into

797
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:26,510
a dream that seems to have gone on way,
way longer.

798
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:30,350
Sometimes hours longer than the alarm 
itself and the Lee ad,

799
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:35,351
it talks about the he,
he concentrated mostly are much on the 

800
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:39,431
dream time of the last of the original 
Australians and they viewed normal time 

801
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:43,940
is sort of ensconced inside of an 
eternal time.

802
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:49,150
That was always present that that seems 
to be something like the time in which 

803
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:51,860
music unfolds,
something like that.

804
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,550
Obviously these are ridiculously 
complicated things so.

805
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,740
Well,
the musical time is,

806
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,950
is a very complicated thing.
I mean if I,

807
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,960
if I listened to a piece of music that's
three minutes long in no way have I 

808
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,040
actually experienced three minutes of 
real duration.

809
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:11,430
I mean that's a.
that's an extraordinary thing and this 

810
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,531
actually allows me to connect to your 
question about the avant garde and 

811
00:43:13,531 --> 00:43:16,550
because one of the things that that 
fascinated me when I was a teenager was 

812
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,250
I would be listening to a,
a piece,

813
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:21,370
a 20th century piece that might be 
extremely short.

814
00:43:21,371 --> 00:43:22,840
It might be two minutes long,
but I would,

815
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,790
I would not be able to comprehend it and
that,

816
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:28,020
that,
that fascinated media.

817
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:33,050
The idea that I would not be able to 
comprehend a piece of music now 

818
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,480
obviously that's that has something to 
do with my personality and not 

819
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,510
everybody's going to be fascinated by a 
piece of music that they.

820
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:39,670
That they find impenetrable,
but in my case I did.

821
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,770
There's also something else to note 
there is that because you're musically 

822
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:45,040
gifted,
it's going.

823
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,200
You're going to have to go a lot closer 
to the edge of what's regarded as let's 

824
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,581
say,
conventional or even the edge of what's 

825
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:55,040
regarded as music before you encounter 
something that's impenetrable.

826
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,500
Whereas for the average listener,
let's say,

827
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,380
which in that category,
I would certainly include myself.

828
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,000
I don't have to go that close to the 
edge before I run into music.

829
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:08,780
That's complicated enough so that I at 
least have to listen to it multiple,

830
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:13,670
multiple times before I understand the 
patterning and the repetition and it's a

831
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:16,760
lovely thing to experience.
When you listen to something complex,

832
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,050
say the fifth or sixth time at pieces of
it start to fail together.

833
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:24,440
I really had that experience with Bach's
well tempered clavier,

834
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:29,441
which I had to listen to.
Jay's maybe 20 times before I would say 

835
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:33,101
I had anything remotely like enjoyment 
as a but and that and that clicking 

836
00:44:33,101 --> 00:44:38,001
together of those patterns also seems to
be beautiful in some sense.

837
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,100
It's like you,
you meet the music with your 

838
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,581
understanding and in that meeting of the
music with your understanding is that 

839
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,770
tremendous revelation of beauty and 
depth and and harmony and all of those 

840
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:55,950
things that that are so good about it.
It's more than that.

841
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,630
It's,
it's life affirming.

842
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,660
That's.
Which is a very strange thing about 

843
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:02,660
music as well and I've noticed that 
psychologically,

844
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,611
like even nihilistic people,
deeply nihilistic people and hopeless 

845
00:45:07,611 --> 00:45:12,441
people still,
they have to be pretty damn depressed 

846
00:45:12,441 --> 00:45:15,831
before music loses its vibrancy and 
savor and and life affirming properties,

847
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:18,600
which is a really magical thing.

848
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:24,450
I would say that being open to the 
possibility that you could enjoy 

849
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,421
something even though perhaps it's 
difficult going the first few times you 

850
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:29,110
listen to it is,
is probably a key aspect.

851
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:34,130
So that brings me back to this contract 
between the composer and the listener.

852
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,860
Like see,
I think what stops a lot of people,

853
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:43,130
and I would again include myself in that
maybe particularly with regards to that 

854
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:47,391
garde art,
is that in order to put in the time and 

855
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:51,330
effort that would be necessary for me to
understand and appreciate something like

856
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,420
the well tempered clavier let's say I 
have to trust that there's actually 

857
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,231
something there and then I'm not just 
having the wool pulled over my eyes and 

858
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:03,521
that I'm some kind of fool.
And the problem with a lot of avant 

859
00:46:03,521 --> 00:46:07,941
garde,
at least the potential problem is that 

860
00:46:07,941 --> 00:46:10,191
it's very difficult to dismiss the 
notion that you're being played for a 

861
00:46:10,191 --> 00:46:12,600
fool by,
by tricksters and jokesters and frauds.

862
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,750
And of course you are more likely to be 
in that situation if you're listening to

863
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:17,910
something new.
So,

864
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,740
so I think part of people's hesitancy 
and,

865
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,580
and,
and,

866
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,720
and unwillingness to throw themselves 
into something that's truly new is,

867
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:32,790
is the suspicion that the emperor has no
clothes and that they're being played 

868
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,071
for a fool.
But you decide how did you know what you

869
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:39,960
should continue to listen to?
So,

870
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:40,320
well

871
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,120
let's pull that apart for a second 
because if you,

872
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:46,510
if you look at things like the 
historical avant garde,

873
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:48,460
in other words,
avant garde movements that took place,

874
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:50,710
let's say a hundred years ago,
just for the sake of argument,

875
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:52,930
it's no longer avant garde.
It's been,

876
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,540
it's been thoroughly picked apart by 
historians.

877
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:56,980
There's been a,
a,

878
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:01,981
a sort of extended,
a critical process that's already taken 

879
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:05,650
place and that's sort of sifted out 
these artifacts and decided what's worth

880
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,480
discussing and what's not worth 
discussing.

881
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,220
So I mean,
one of the,

882
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:14,250
one of the incontrovertible facts of a,
of music history or art history in 

883
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,061
general is that the works that are no 
longer able to communicate something 

884
00:47:18,611 --> 00:47:23,611
vitally important to that addresses a 
present concern tend to fall out of 

885
00:47:24,401 --> 00:47:26,560
favor.
History is merciless,

886
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,390
right?
It's,

887
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,400
it's absolutely merciless.
And I mean think of the tens of 

888
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,060
thousands of closers that were active 
during the baroque period.

889
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,730
We've,
we've,

890
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,810
how many have we retained?
There's maybe a dozen figures that are 

891
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:43,770
sort of still regularly performed and 
discussed and and generally known to the

892
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:44,770
public.
So,

893
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:45,310
I mean,
there's a,

894
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:50,610
there's an absolutely ruthless selection
process that goes on and of course one 

895
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:54,541
of the fundamental difficulties of 
addressing a contemporary or modern 

896
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:57,310
forms of art is that that process of 
selection hasn't taken place yet.

897
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,640
So you as a listener are necessarily 
engaged with that process to a certain 

898
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,090
degree because the,
the,

899
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,530
the,
the,

900
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,010
the process of,
of selection hasn't,

901
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,860
hasn't taken place.
There is an overwhelming likelihood that

902
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:16,861
what you're going to hear might not be 
of the highest standard statistical if 

903
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:22,290
you figure that there are just,
just to throw out a number of hundred 

904
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,470
thousand composers active in the world 
today,

905
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,860
how many of them are geniuses?
How many of them are producing work of 

906
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:28,860
the highest order?
You know,

907
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,310
it's going to be a vanishingly small 
percentage.

908
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,070
So that's not,
that's not to say that,

909
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,680
that none of them are doing extremely 
good work.

910
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:41,130
It's just that if you're coming to that 
world for the first time and you're not 

911
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:41,130
familiar with it,
uh,

912
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,010
and you,
you don't sort of have the,

913
00:48:43,011 --> 00:48:48,011
uh,
the context to be able to navigate 

914
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:48,250
through that space with a reasonable 
degree of certainty that you can sort of

915
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:50,590
sniff out the good from the bad then.
Yes.

916
00:48:50,591 --> 00:48:51,640
It's,
it's difficult.

917
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:52,710
There's no question.
It's a good,

918
00:48:52,711 --> 00:48:57,711
it's a good.
That's a good expansion of the metaphor 

919
00:48:57,711 --> 00:48:59,760
of the avant garde because what that 
means is as an avant garde listeners,

920
00:48:59,761 --> 00:49:01,830
you're more likely to be killed,
so to speak,

921
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:06,860
like the avant garde in a battle.
And it's the same if you're laboring on 

922
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,461
the edge of musical composition,
the probability that you're going to 

923
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:13,371
survive.
They're in a real sense and I mean 

924
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:14,220
practical like day to day if you're 
going to make any money,

925
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:18,000
but also that you're going to survive 
into the future is extraordinarily low.

926
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,770
So this game.
So why play it like I would say,

927
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:23,750
well,
for,

928
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,780
for the typical listener who doesn't 
know anything about baroque music or 

929
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,090
classical music or romantic music,
you know,

930
00:49:30,091 --> 00:49:31,860
who has,
who is afraid of it or,

931
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:37,220
or who's afraid of being made a fool of,
for their ignorance when they first 

932
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:37,220
enter into it,
which is,

933
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,720
which can easily happen in,
which is quite sad.

934
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,310
Why should they go to the,
who should go to the effort of listening

935
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:49,311
to what's truly new and why should they 
do it in Europe you've got overwhelming 

936
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:51,230
musical capacity.
So you know,

937
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,530
it's clear in your case.

938
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:53,620
Well,
first of all,

939
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:54,010
the.
Okay,

940
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:54,720
the,
the,

941
00:49:54,721 --> 00:49:58,000
the sort of career aspects of,
of writing music that as you say,

942
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:02,020
lies is sort of on the edges of what is 
recognizably musical to a broad public.

943
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,330
Well,
is it a higher risk game?

944
00:50:04,331 --> 00:50:09,331
That's an interesting question because 
if I were to say a try to start a rock 

945
00:50:09,331 --> 00:50:10,630
band,
you know,

946
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,600
and uh,
and,

947
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:12,480
and,
and write,

948
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,550
write songs that were in a,
in a conventional format,

949
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,060
you could certainly argue that I would 
have just as much trouble if not more 

950
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,511
establishing myself than if I were 
writing in a form of musical expression 

951
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:26,770
that's more esoteric simply because the,
the,

952
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,800
the,
the crushing amount of competition is 

953
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,631
actually probably a lot greater in that,
in that domain than in much more highly 

954
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:38,450
individualized forms of musical 
expression and incense.

955
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:41,030
So in,
in a way you could argue that it's,

956
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:41,810
it's,
it's,

957
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:48,080
that's,
that's a difficult argument to make 

958
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,140
because it is very difficult in any case
to have a career as a composer,

959
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:53,141
but it's probably somewhat easier to 
carve out a space for yourself if you're

960
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,840
working in a,
in a rather individual musical idiom 

961
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,350
than if you're doing something that the 
overall culture is already completely 

962
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:02,350
central.

963
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:02,350
Right,
right.

964
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:02,610
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

965
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,860
Then what about the listener though?
So,

966
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,600
so I,
I buy your argument,

967
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:11,601
but then the listener,
like if I go back and listen to only 

968
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,920
those composers,
that time has a conserved,

969
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:18,180
which by your own admission are 
composers that in some manner,

970
00:51:18,181 --> 00:51:21,240
some mysterious manner,
still have something to say,

971
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:23,070
which I also don't understand.
It's like,

972
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,670
what does it mean?
That box still has something to say or.

973
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,860
I mean it's the same as shakespeare I 
suppose,

974
00:51:28,861 --> 00:51:31,650
but,
but it isn't obvious what it is.

975
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:34,710
That remains to be sad.
I don't get that.

976
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:39,810
It's got to be something like the 
culture has not fully incorporated all 

977
00:51:41,251 --> 00:51:45,480
of the perceptual genius that that 
person had to offer it.

978
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:50,310
Like Bob hasn't been transformed into 
cliche or into,

979
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,860
into implicit assumption or something 
like that.

980
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,400
But you know,
because I think that one of the things 

981
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,401
that artists do,
visual or auditory is they teach people 

982
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:02,940
to see or hear the.

983
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,320
The impressionists are good example of 
that because obviously their works,

984
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,410
well maybe not obviously,
but their works produced riots when they

985
00:52:10,411 --> 00:52:15,411
were first publicly displayed and it's a
particular way of seeing the world that 

986
00:52:15,661 --> 00:52:17,610
has more to do with light than with 
farm,

987
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:22,500
but for most people it's easy to look at
an impressionist painting.

988
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:27,501
Now it seems,
it seems it's so embedded into our 

989
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:30,360
visual language that there's nothing 
about it that seems shocking.

990
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:35,540
And so I think we've learned that and,
and I guess part of the question is do 

991
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:38,640
we do,
do new composers teach us to,

992
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:43,730
to here,
and once we've learned everything they 

993
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,420
had to say,
do we not need their lesson anymore?

994
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,010
It's got to be something like that.

995
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,440
Right?
Well,

996
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,850
the first thing I would say about that 
is we've used the word avant garde quite

997
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:58,851
a lot.
I actually don't like that term very 

998
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:00,741
much.
And the other thing I would say is that 

999
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:00,750
just because something is unfamiliar,
it doesn't therefore follow that at time

1000
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:02,040
on guard.
Right?

1001
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:07,041
So I mean there are,
there are forms of music that would be 

1002
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:07,860
difficult for,
for a certain listener to assimilate,

1003
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,550
but it might be something that was 
written a hundred and 50 years ago.

1004
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,300
So it might be something that has in a 
certain sense,

1005
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:17,700
being thoroughly absorbed since.
Bye Bye.

1006
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:23,180
Let's say certain listeners who are 
familiar with it or people who are 

1007
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:27,681
familiar with the history of music,
but for someone who's never heard 

1008
00:53:27,681 --> 00:53:28,620
anything like that,
and it takes someone,

1009
00:53:28,621 --> 00:53:31,290
for example,
who is living in a complete indifference

1010
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:31,860
to,
uh,

1011
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,800
to art music in general and has never 
heard Bob.

1012
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,380
I mean if you played them a,
uh,

1013
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,640
you know,
at 20 minute collection of fugues they 

1014
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:41,640
might find the experience completely 
intolerable.

1015
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,110
So I mean,

1016
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,040
yeah,
so,

1017
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:49,130
so one of the things that you're 
suggesting is that the order great 

1018
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:54,101
composers are still sufficiently,
let's call them avant garde for the bulk

1019
00:53:54,351 --> 00:53:58,550
of the population so that there's still 
hunger for,

1020
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,950
for,
for what they were able to achieve.

1021
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:05,000
It still doesn't answer the question of 
why those people in particular.

1022
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:10,080
I mean,
we'd like to think that they were the 

1023
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,080
greatest exponents of their art and me 
and maybe they were,

1024
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:16,090
I'm sure many great exponents have died 
unrecognized and,

1025
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,220
and some ones that are maybe not 
comparatively mediocre have been brought

1026
00:54:22,221 --> 00:54:24,200
forward.
I don't think that happens very often,

1027
00:54:24,201 --> 00:54:25,060
but we would.

1028
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,290
You're,
here's a potential,

1029
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:32,340
a way to answer that question.
I would say that the great composers are

1030
00:54:32,341 --> 00:54:37,341
the ones that fundamentally they own 
their material more thoroughly and in a 

1031
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,880
more deeply personal way than other 
composers and other words is the minimum

1032
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:44,130
of what you might call neutral material 
in their music.

1033
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:45,810
In other words,
material that is essentially,

1034
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,560
that already exists that is almost like 
found material in a sense and that you 

1035
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,391
don't have to work very hard to fashion 
into something resembling a coherent 

1036
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:58,170
piece.
A great composer invents forms.

1037
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:00,480
They invent a language,
the invent a universe.

1038
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,360
Uh,
they take enormous risks and I mean,

1039
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:08,630
these composers that we talk about that 
are familiar names to a very wide swath 

1040
00:55:09,061 --> 00:55:10,080
of the public.
Beethoven,

1041
00:55:10,081 --> 00:55:13,480
for example,
was an absolute avant garde,

1042
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,670
asked in his time.
I mean,

1043
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:15,310
the,
the,

1044
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:15,960
the first,
uh,

1045
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:19,710
performances of a lot of his pieces were
truly shocking and truly upset people.

1046
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,140
Uh,
it's,

1047
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,580
it's,
it's a very relative phenomenon,

1048
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,510
all of this,
right?

1049
00:55:24,511 --> 00:55:25,080
So,
I mean,

1050
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:30,350
Bach was considered to be a composer by 
the end of his life who was writing 

1051
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:33,240
overly thick turgid music that was 
impossible to listen to,

1052
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:37,470
that was sort of tortured and,
and ridiculously complex.

1053
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,760
Uh,
so I mean,

1054
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:43,761
any,
any composer you can think of that that 

1055
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:43,761
is considered today to be among the 
greats as,

1056
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:48,780
as at some point being horribly 
denigrated and humiliated and spoken 

1057
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:51,860
badly of by the public of their time.
So that's a,

1058
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,870
that's a,
that's just a permanent feature of,

1059
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,660
of music history and

1060
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:00,010
what you'd expect to though,
because someone who is,

1061
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:05,040
let's say going in the right direction,
but who is way ahead of everyone else 

1062
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,491
is,
it's very difficult for them to 

1063
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:11,941
communicate what they're doing and it's 
very difficult for them to distinguish 

1064
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:13,360
themselves from the naked emperor.
So.

1065
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:13,810
Right.

1066
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,010
Well,
it Ezra pound has a,

1067
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:21,030
has a great quote.
He says that artists or the or the 

1068
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,030
intensity of mankind,

1069
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,030
right,
right.

1070
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:22,010
Pseudo pods,
you know,

1071
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:22,850
like.
Right,

1072
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:28,410
exactly.
Some of those parts get better off of 

1073
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,770
them.
Don't find anything of any value,

1074
00:56:29,771 --> 00:56:32,440
but now and then everyone moves in that 
direction.

1075
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:39,820
It's akin to the idea that dreams and 
fantasy or are the pseudopods of,

1076
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:45,250
of the mind.
It's the same kind of idea and very 

1077
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:45,700
might be the same idea,
in fact.

1078
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,080
So.
Alright.

1079
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:51,550
So let's go back to,
to your contention that you know of this

1080
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:55,710
explosive transformation that finally 
resulted in,

1081
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:59,320
in the radical transformations of music 
into the 20th century.

1082
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:04,490
Do you suppose those transformations are
any more radical than the proceeding 

1083
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:07,951
transformations had been?
That gets us there faster,

1084
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,090
potentially more quickly.
If you look at the,

1085
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:18,460
the,
the expansion and the development of 

1086
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:18,460
musical language from the,
from the,

1087
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,720
from medieval times onwards.
It happened very,

1088
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:22,900
very slowly for a very long period of 
time for centuries.

1089
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:28,290
And then you could argue that it is more
or less coincides with the industrial 

1090
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:28,750
revolution.
It starts to,

1091
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,840
at that point,
it really starts to accelerate at an 

1092
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:33,840
extraordinary pace.

1093
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:37,490
And so let's take,
let's take that analogy further.

1094
00:57:37,491 --> 00:57:42,491
I mean many,
many things start to accelerate at an 

1095
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:42,491
incredible pace in the industrial 
revolution.

1096
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,900
People get far wealthier and far faster 
than they ever had likely in the history

1097
00:57:47,901 --> 00:57:49,670
of mankind.
So,

1098
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:54,620
and then perhaps that allows for the 
funding of orchestras and the funding of

1099
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:59,621
more full time musicians because you 
have to have a pretty rich society in 

1100
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:02,870
order to have any musicians that are,
that are actually doing that and nothing

1101
00:58:02,871 --> 00:58:05,930
else.
And they have more leisure time as well.

1102
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:07,190
Right,
right,

1103
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:07,730
right,
right.

1104
00:58:07,731 --> 00:58:10,310
So that's all working in a positive 
feedback loop.

1105
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

1106
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,010
Okay.
So,

1107
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,010
so it's happening faster.
All so.

1108
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:18,170
So walk us through the post romantic 
period and tell us what's,

1109
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:23,200
what's happening and maybe we can then 
get into the modern like I mean modern 

1110
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:24,830
contemporary period.
And,

1111
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,230
and we can talk a little bit about your 
attraction to that.

1112
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,960
Well,
in a sense you could say that the 

1113
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:33,960
structure is that had been coalescing 
since the Baroque,

1114
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,980
the forums and the genres and so on 
start to,

1115
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:38,290
they start to break up in the,
in the romantic era,

1116
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:43,291
they become highly personalized.
You get composers that have highly 

1117
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:44,740
individual projects and also very more 
importantly,

1118
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:49,741
you have composers that are starting to 
break away from the patronage system 

1119
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:51,520
from,
from being essentially the servants of,

1120
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:56,521
uh,
of the nobility and start having 

1121
00:58:56,521 --> 00:58:59,190
something akin to an individual career.
And Beethoven is often thought of as 

1122
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:01,930
being the sort of exemplary figure of 
that,

1123
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:06,931
the,
the sort of the one of the first 

1124
00:59:06,931 --> 00:59:08,731
composers and music history to do that,
to write pieces strictly out of his own 

1125
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:14,551
volition as something that he wanted to 
express regardless of whether there was 

1126
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,690
someone necessarily who wanted to pay 
for it or not,

1127
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,390
or even who wanted to listen to it.
So,

1128
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,440
so that's,
that's a very,

1129
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:24,590
very fundamental change of perspective 
when that starts to happen.

1130
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,660
Yeah.
Well that's sort of,

1131
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:30,600
maybe that's the dawn of the idea of the
individual genius that,

1132
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,880
that.
And maybe that rises in,

1133
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:39,210
maybe that rises in a conceptual space 
also as a consequence of the ideas of 

1134
00:59:39,461 --> 00:59:41,320
the enlightenment,
the enlightenment,

1135
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,240
what the enlightenment did,
or the renaissance,

1136
00:59:43,241 --> 00:59:48,241
maybe even more accurately,
the renaissance started to dignify 

1137
00:59:48,241 --> 00:59:50,380
creative individuals with the same 
status that,

1138
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,400
that before,
that sort of canonical data he's had.

1139
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:56,180
And I think you see that transformation 
in visual art in,

1140
00:59:56,230 --> 01:00:00,070
in the medieval period.
The archetypal figures have this very,

1141
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:01,410
um,

1142
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,620
what would you call it,
abstract.

1143
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:06,000
Almost almost,
uh,

1144
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:10,230
almost an like modern animation like 
representation.

1145
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:12,810
And it isn't until the renaissance kicks
in,

1146
01:00:12,811 --> 01:00:16,620
especially in northern Italy where the 
divine

1147
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:23,130
people Christ say,
and Mary start to take on recognizably 

1148
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:27,301
human forms.
They become individuals identifiable 

1149
01:00:27,301 --> 01:00:30,571
individuals.
And I think that's a two way process is 

1150
01:00:30,571 --> 01:00:33,091
that not only is the deity becoming 
identifiably individual instead of 

1151
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:36,670
formulaic and abstractly represented 
almost like a hero cliff,

1152
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:40,390
but the individuals becoming dafydd at 
that point as well.

1153
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:45,840
And that,
and that seems to me to coincide with 

1154
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,910
the idea of the great artist and the 
great independent artists,

1155
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:49,540
which is very,
it's a very strange concept.

1156
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:51,670
And that's gone.
And be also a function of wealth,

1157
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:54,580
the mere fact that that 
conceptualization is even possible,

1158
01:00:55,050 --> 01:01:00,050
you know,
I mean to take her back at the history 

1159
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,751
and you look at maybe the master of the 
undifferentiated artistic and religious 

1160
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:07,100
form might've been something like the 
Shaman,

1161
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,760
but the Sharman was fundamentally a 
healer and that was his,

1162
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:15,820
that was his role.
And I suppose how you could say in a 

1163
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,060
sense how he made his living.
He just used all these cultural tools to

1164
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:18,230
do that.
But,

1165
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:22,940
but his economic base in some sense was 
a lot wider.

1166
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,550
So.
Alright.

1167
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,720
So okay.
So we're in the 20th century and we're.

1168
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:31,750
And we have this plethora of novel 
musical forms and that's happening 

1169
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,770
because there's a lot more musicians and
there's a lot more listeners.

1170
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,920
So the speed takes off.
And I guess another thing that happens 

1171
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,880
is that leaves the typical listener more
and more in the dust.

1172
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:42,380
Well,
again,

1173
01:01:42,381 --> 01:01:45,050
not necessarily.
You have plenty of composers even in the

1174
01:01:45,051 --> 01:01:50,051
romantic period that are writing 
essentially vernacular music that 

1175
01:01:50,051 --> 01:01:50,450
doesn't push the boundaries terribly.
And the ones that we've retained,

1176
01:01:50,451 --> 01:01:52,340
again,
are the ones that contributed the most.

1177
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:57,260
And the ones that deviated the most from
the sort of standard operating procedure

1178
01:01:57,261 --> 01:01:59,180
of the day.
So we simply,

1179
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:04,210
we don't,
we don't retain the ones that were 

1180
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:06,371
average,
the ones that we're operating safely 

1181
01:02:06,371 --> 01:02:10,151
within the bounds of what was,
what was accepted conventionally to be 

1182
01:02:10,151 --> 01:02:10,151
music.
So that's,

1183
01:02:10,151 --> 01:02:11,440
that's the first thing.
So we have a,

1184
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:16,630
a,
a view of history that is extremely 

1185
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:19,990
filtered in that sense.
We have no idea what it was like 

1186
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:19,990
actually to be alive in,
in,

1187
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:19,990
uh,
in 18,

1188
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:21,870
70 and,
and see things from that perspective.

1189
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:22,970
So.
So that's,

1190
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,660
that's the first thing.

1191
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,640
That's a funny thing too,
because even with,

1192
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,760
even with say rock music or any other 
genre,

1193
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:33,540
when you hear a band that was once 
considered creative,

1194
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:38,930
but you hear them 20 years later,
you can't tell that they're creative 

1195
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:40,350
because if the creativity was of any 
reasonable sword,

1196
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:41,610
it's been,
it's been,

1197
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,370
it's become,
I wouldn't say necessarily cliched.

1198
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:49,520
Maybe that's what happens to the artists
that aren't retained is their 

1199
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,001
contributions become cliched because 
everyone else picks it up and you hear 

1200
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:55,230
it implicitly in every other piece of 
music that's being done.

1201
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,480
And so you listen back in the past and 
you think,

1202
01:02:57,481 --> 01:03:02,481
oh,
there's nothing in that that I haven't 

1203
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:03,861
heard before.
And so it seems to me that the Beatles 

1204
01:03:03,861 --> 01:03:05,370
are a good example of that town,
at least for me,

1205
01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:10,371
when I listened to them,
I wouldn't say so much their earlier 

1206
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:10,371
stuff,
although it's got a vitality that,

1207
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,500
that is still somewhat compelling,
but there later,

1208
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:18,390
music still strikes me as sufficiently 
surprising.

1209
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:20,580
It hasn't all been incorporated into 
the,

1210
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,890
into the rock lexicon.
So

1211
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,420
truly,
truly great music has a,

1212
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,420
has a depth and it has a,
uh,

1213
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,510
it has a,
a semantic overload in a sense that,

1214
01:03:31,511 --> 01:03:33,860
that no matter how many times you 
listened to it,

1215
01:03:33,861 --> 01:03:36,610
you can't actually exhaust it.
And that's an extraordinary thing.

1216
01:03:36,611 --> 01:03:40,090
Yeah.
Well,

1217
01:03:40,091 --> 01:03:41,230
how can that be?
I mean,

1218
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:42,900
it,
it leads me to conclude that the,

1219
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:48,090
the peace must contain more than the 
composer knowingly put into it in a 

1220
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:48,340
sense that,
I mean,

1221
01:03:48,341 --> 01:03:49,170
it's,
it's amazing.

1222
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,790
It's an amazing thing for me to think 
that a,

1223
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,640
a container that would have had to write
in less than a week,

1224
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:56,260
you know,
could,

1225
01:03:56,261 --> 01:04:01,261
could,
that I could listen to that hundreds or 

1226
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:01,261
thousands of times and never get to the 
bottom of it.

1227
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:06,400
Yeah.
I mean that he put in his $30,000,

1228
01:04:06,621 --> 01:04:07,550
right?
His musical,

1229
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:12,551
his depth of musical capacity was so 
immense that he could put a lot into a 

1230
01:04:13,011 --> 01:04:18,011
very little space.
But you see the same thing with great 

1231
01:04:18,011 --> 01:04:21,011
visual.
You see the same thing with great art 

1232
01:04:21,011 --> 01:04:21,011
period.
The greater the art,

1233
01:04:21,011 --> 01:04:22,340
the more it's inexhaustible and,
and it seems surprising.

1234
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,430
The counter example of that is 
propaganda I would say.

1235
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,440
And you know,
or,

1236
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:32,450
or,
or the really crassly commercial music 

1237
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,680
which capitalizes on what everyone knows
and takes it that tiny step.

1238
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:37,760
It varies at some tiny step.
So it's playing to the,

1239
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:43,570
it's playing to the almost already sated
crowd and there's a niche in there 

1240
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:45,680
because it's good for people who want to
be pushed very,

1241
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:50,980
a very tiny amount,
but it dies very quickly because 

1242
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,510
everyone can incorporate it's new 
message almost immediately.

1243
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:54,320
But that,
yeah,

1244
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:59,321
that,
that whole notion of inexhaustible and 

1245
01:04:59,321 --> 01:05:01,930
art,
it's an amazing thing and it has 

1246
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:01,930
something to do with the depth.

1247
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:05,830
I mean,
I saw a great representation of the 

1248
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:08,711
Bible at one point,
a visual representation that showed 

1249
01:05:08,711 --> 01:05:11,420
along the bottom was a graph showing 
each different chapter.

1250
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:16,421
So imagine a graph with a line at the 
bottom and there's however many thousand

1251
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,070
chapters there are in the Bible.
Each one represented by a bar,

1252
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:26,160
tiny bar stretching downwards,
and the length of the bar was 

1253
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,120
proportional to how many times that 
chapter or verse,

1254
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:30,100
I think it was chapter,
it doesn't matter.

1255
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:35,220
Was Cross referenced in the book and 
some of those were Crawford Cross 

1256
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:39,441
referenced a tremendous amount,
but then there were curves drawn on top 

1257
01:05:39,441 --> 01:05:43,321
of that,
linking all the cross references 

1258
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:43,321
together.
So you have this amazingly complex,

1259
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:47,640
hyperlinked document where everything in
it refers to everything else and that 

1260
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:52,981
gives it this insane depth.
There's just no way of exhausting it 

1261
01:05:52,981 --> 01:05:55,080
because there's an infinite number of 
routes through it in some sentence.

1262
01:05:55,081 --> 01:05:55,840
And you know,

1263
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:01,340
well that's,
that's certainly true with great works 

1264
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:01,340
of music.
They're like,

1265
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,250
they're like iridescent luminous objects
that,

1266
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,130
that,
that,

1267
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:08,360
that,
that say different things depending on 

1268
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,240
the angle at which you look at them and 
so you know you can,

1269
01:06:09,241 --> 01:06:14,241
you can,
you can listen to a piece of music 10 

1270
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:15,150
times over the course of a week and 
think that you've more or less exhausted

1271
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:17,070
it in terms of what it,
what it can say to you.

1272
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,250
You go back to the exact same piece 10 
years later and you won't.

1273
01:06:20,251 --> 01:06:25,251
You might don't recognize it at all.
You might hear it in a completely 

1274
01:06:25,251 --> 01:06:26,550
different way because you yourself have 
changed in the intervening.

1275
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:31,780
Right?
That's the other thing is the music is 

1276
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,480
the music actually exists in the space 
where you made it and so your additions 

1277
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,131
of life,
what you've listened to your mood and 

1278
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:39,440
also the way you choose to go through 
it,

1279
01:06:39,441 --> 01:06:44,420
especially if it's complex because you 
can concentrate on one instrument or set

1280
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:49,450
of instruments as opposed to another.
Like you can use them as the guide so 

1281
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:52,851
you can concentrate on the baselines or 
you can concentrate on the sounds that 

1282
01:06:52,851 --> 01:06:56,681
are much higher in the register and 
every time you do that with a complex 

1283
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:56,681
piece of music,
it,

1284
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:58,640
it,
it's a different journey.

1285
01:06:58,641 --> 01:07:00,320
That's,
that's one way of thinking about it.

1286
01:07:00,321 --> 01:07:03,320
So that's also extremely interesting.
Okay.

1287
01:07:03,321 --> 01:07:08,321
So you were talking about how sudden 
acceleration of music in the 20th 

1288
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:08,321
century.
So why don't you,

1289
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:09,020
why don't you pick up on that?

1290
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:13,390
Well really I mentioned earlier that 
it's something that starts to take place

1291
01:07:13,391 --> 01:07:15,150
with the industrial revolution and it,
it,

1292
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:16,210
it,
it takes up,

1293
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:20,440
it picks up extraordinary speed at the,
at the beginning of the 20th century.

1294
01:07:20,441 --> 01:07:24,430
And in a sense you could say that the,
the history of music in the 20th century

1295
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:27,100
is not,
is not divorced from,

1296
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,930
from the,
the world wars.

1297
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:34,050
You cannot separate them.
You also cannot underestimate the 

1298
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,040
enormous significance that that had on 
the development of the art.

1299
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:38,950
I mean,
certainly after the Second World War,

1300
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:42,310
there's a generalized sense amongst 
European musicians that,

1301
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:47,290
that fundamentally in an old order had 
been overturned and had,

1302
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,640
had proven to be absolutely rotten and 
that,

1303
01:07:50,641 --> 01:07:51,210
uh,
there was,

1304
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,650
there was,
there was a,

1305
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:57,660
an almost paroxysmal desire to get away 
from that into,

1306
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:01,890
into,
into create entirely new musical worlds.

1307
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:05,100
And that was definitely allied with the,
the,

1308
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,720
this,
this need to,

1309
01:08:06,721 --> 01:08:07,230
um,
to,

1310
01:08:07,231 --> 01:08:09,000
to build a new and better society.

1311
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:14,300
So you can't,
you can't separate those two things and 

1312
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,260
you have to,
you have to try to imagine yourself as a

1313
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,020
20 or 25 year old composer,
you know,

1314
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:23,050
growing up in a,
in a Europe that's been absolutely 

1315
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:23,050
devastated.
And the,

1316
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:27,210
to the extent that there's practically 
nothing left and you're trying to 

1317
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:27,210
rebuild on,
on top of that,

1318
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:28,220
you know.
So that's,

1319
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:33,250
that's,
that's the situation that the composer 

1320
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:36,071
is born in that era we were faced with.
So do you want to pretend as though 

1321
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:41,681
nothing has happened and,
and go back to writing late romantic 

1322
01:08:41,681 --> 01:08:42,050
music or uh,
do you,

1323
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:47,080
you accept that fundamentally something 
enormous has taken place that you can't 

1324
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:52,301
ignore it and if you want to be an 
authentic artist and if you want to 

1325
01:08:52,301 --> 01:08:54,590
manifest the things that you can't help 
but perceive,

1326
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:59,950
then how do you do that and can you do 
that within the confines of a language 

1327
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:00,950
that was associated with the period 
before the war.

1328
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:06,640
So that's a somewhat simpler fittings,
that's a somewhat simplified account of 

1329
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,451
events because certainly there was a,
there was a push towards ever more 

1330
01:09:10,451 --> 01:09:13,810
personal and individual forms of 
expression starting with the late 19th 

1331
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:15,080
century,
but it really accelerates and takes off

1332
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:19,400
to the after the Second World War and a 
number of reasons.

1333
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:21,860
Well,
and also that that's,

1334
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:26,910
it seems to me that it was,
it's that postwar period roughly 

1335
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:30,331
speaking that was what grabbed your 
attention when you were composing your 

1336
01:09:30,331 --> 01:09:32,020
pop songs as well and drew you in 
through that particular rabbit hole.

1337
01:09:32,021 --> 01:09:32,710
So.
Okay,

1338
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:34,630
so back to the post war period.

1339
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:40,050
Right?
So one of the interesting things that 

1340
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:40,230
happened in Europe was that the,
the,

1341
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:45,250
the need to reconstruct these different 
states manifested also through a desire 

1342
01:09:45,311 --> 01:09:48,290
on the parts of certain politicians to,
to,

1343
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:51,880
to show how advanced their societies 
could be through the medium of art.

1344
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:53,470
So in,
in Germany,

1345
01:09:53,471 --> 01:09:56,230
for example,
enormous sums of money were put into,

1346
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,430
uh,
into,

1347
01:09:57,431 --> 01:09:58,620
into music and they,
they,

1348
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:03,630
they developed radio orchestra,
every single region had its own 

1349
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:03,630
orchestra,
very,

1350
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:03,750
very high levels,
uh,

1351
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:04,320
of,
uh,

1352
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:07,900
of an artistic quality as well.
And,

1353
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:12,930
and,
and so one corollary of that was that 

1354
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:13,980
they wanted their music to be absolutely
advanced and,

1355
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:16,540
and absolutely striking.
And,

1356
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,960
and that was a kind of a,
a very,

1357
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:25,650
very strong impulse that began to be 
felt in other European countries as 

1358
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:25,650
well.
And,

1359
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:25,930
and France,
for their part,

1360
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:28,010
had to also show that they were 
investing in,

1361
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:29,980
in contemporary art and contemporary 
music.

1362
01:10:29,981 --> 01:10:34,981
And,
and so there was a very high degree of 

1363
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:36,220
subsidization of the avant garde and the
postwar period.

1364
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:41,550
Now that's not to say that life was easy
for every artist because it most 

1365
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:44,521
definitely was not.
And it was an enormous struggle for 

1366
01:10:44,521 --> 01:10:46,150
composers to produce this kind of work 
and have it be performed,

1367
01:10:46,151 --> 01:10:51,151
but there was certainly a major 
investment on the part of the European 

1368
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:54,610
states in terms of funding this kind of 
musical expression.

1369
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:59,100
So more or less,
they seem to have known instinctively,

1370
01:10:59,101 --> 01:11:04,101
even by your own argument that if they 
were going to rebuild that this was 

1371
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:05,100
going to be part,
an important part,

1372
01:11:05,101 --> 01:11:10,101
maybe a vital part of the rebuilding 
process and you wouldn't think that 

1373
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:13,650
necessarily because you would assume 
that people's attention would be to what

1374
01:11:13,651 --> 01:11:15,960
you might regard as more practical 
concerns.

1375
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:21,320
But of course,
since we don't know what role music is 

1376
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:21,320
playing precisely,
but I'm rolling,

1377
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,570
it seems to be incredibly important.
It's not that easy to figure out exactly

1378
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:29,571
what's practical and what isn't.
Keeping People's morale up is of 

1379
01:11:29,571 --> 01:11:34,030
incredible important or restoring their 
morale as well as incredibly important 

1380
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:34,620
maybe above all else.

1381
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,670
Right?
Right.

1382
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:41,710
Absolutely.
So one of the essential functions of art

1383
01:11:41,711 --> 01:11:44,320
is his spiritual.
Whether people know it or not.

1384
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,050
And so if you want to rebuild your 
culture,

1385
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:49,960
there's no better way to do it.
Then through the medium of art,

1386
01:11:49,961 --> 01:11:51,250
as far as I'm concerned,
I mean it's a.

1387
01:11:51,251 --> 01:11:56,251
it's an absolutely fundamental thing.
It's so fundamental that even in the 

1388
01:11:56,251 --> 01:11:59,620
most in the midst of the most horrific 
experiences a human being can be,

1389
01:11:59,621 --> 01:12:04,621
there is a.
There is a redemptive experience to be 

1390
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:04,621
had in art.
Right?

1391
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:05,460
Right,
right.

1392
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:07,610
Which is really,
really to say something.

1393
01:12:07,611 --> 01:12:12,611
I mean,
it really is to say something because 

1394
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:14,741
there's often you can find people in 
situations often where nothing else 

1395
01:12:14,741 --> 01:12:18,431
could do that.
There can't be matched by any other 

1396
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,180
means and many people have their lives 
saved by art.

1397
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,150
There's no doubt about that and I think 
that's true on an ongoing basis.

1398
01:12:23,151 --> 01:12:28,151
Even with young people.
I mean certainly when they're going 

1399
01:12:28,151 --> 01:12:28,151
through,
they're there,

1400
01:12:28,151 --> 01:12:30,350
late adolescent or even early 
adolescent,

1401
01:12:30,351 --> 01:12:35,351
cataclysmic changes.
Many of them live for music and music is

1402
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:38,810
helping them catalyze a group identity,
but deeper than that,

1403
01:12:38,811 --> 01:12:42,200
it's also providing them with the 
implicit sense that there's meaning,

1404
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:47,470
that the being is meaningful and that 
there's meaning out hand and you can't 

1405
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:49,130
argue with.
The other thing that's so cool,

1406
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:52,370
especially about music is you can't 
argue with its meaning.

1407
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,770
It just manifests themselves.
So it's,

1408
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:58,580
it's outside of the domain of rational.
You can't criticize it.

1409
01:12:58,581 --> 01:13:00,440
You sound like a fool.
It's like,

1410
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:01,550
well,
why are you dancing?

1411
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:02,720
It's like,
well,

1412
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:06,020
that,
that isn't a question,

1413
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:09,680
and also there's no answer to it.
And why are you listening to music?

1414
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:14,980
What's the point?
Is also not a question and there's not 

1415
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:18,071
an answer to it either.
It's self evident and it's almost self 

1416
01:13:18,071 --> 01:13:20,870
evident to everyone,
which is fantastically remarkable.

1417
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:26,630
It is indeed.
So the last thing I would say about that

1418
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:29,490
is that fundamentally the way that,
uh,

1419
01:13:29,491 --> 01:13:31,740
that someone expresses them themselves 
through music,

1420
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:35,430
if it's authentic,
fundamentally it's not a choice,

1421
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:37,380
you know?
So one thing that,

1422
01:13:37,381 --> 01:13:37,660
that,
uh,

1423
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:39,420
that audiences might keep in mind if 
they're,

1424
01:13:39,421 --> 01:13:42,060
if they're about to engage with 
something that's unfamiliar to them,

1425
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,450
is that if it's,
if it's a half decent work of art and if

1426
01:13:45,451 --> 01:13:47,880
the composer is,
is sincere in what they're doing,

1427
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,960
then fundamentally it's something that 
in a sense they have to do.

1428
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:52,530
You know,
there,

1429
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:54,690
there's not a strong element of choice 
involved,

1430
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:00,020
so it's not,
it's not an arbitrary thing to express 

1431
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:00,020
yourself in one way or another.
I mean it's,

1432
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:00,330
it's,
uh,

1433
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:02,620
it's something that,
that you,

1434
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:03,940
you don't get to choose.

1435
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:09,520
I've also noticed like I've had more 
than my fair share of creative clients 

1436
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:12,550
probably I know certainly because 
they're attracted,

1437
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:16,660
for example,
to come and see me by the content of my,

1438
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:19,510
my videos in my lectures and that sort 
of thing.

1439
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,190
And,
and one of the things,

1440
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,140
and I studied creativity in,
in,

1441
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:28,410
in,
in some depth and its relationship to 

1442
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:30,631
personality.
And one of the things that I found that 

1443
01:14:30,631 --> 01:14:32,440
really been struck by is that there is a
trait which is openness,

1444
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:37,620
which is a fundamental trait and for 
people who are high in openness is if 

1445
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:41,281
you imagine the person as a,
as a central trunk with a few branches 

1446
01:14:41,281 --> 01:14:45,920
and the branches are the place where 
that nourishment emerges up into the 

1447
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,370
back of course too.
But there's a,

1448
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,900
there's a pathway of life along those,
of those subdivisions of the trunk.

1449
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,300
Um,
if they're creative,

1450
01:14:55,420 --> 01:15:00,420
that might be the main part of them 
that's alive and if that is manifesting 

1451
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,350
itself,
they just droop and die.

1452
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:06,310
Sometimes they criticize them to death,
some themselves to death rationally or,

1453
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,480
or,
well,

1454
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:08,200
there,
there's,

1455
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:13,310
there's a choice.
They can either pursue their creative 

1456
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:14,240
nature or they can wilt and die that 
that's,

1457
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:19,260
but that's not much of a choice really 
striking to me how fundamental a,

1458
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:24,930
an instinct that is and how,
how unrelenting it is and it manifests 

1459
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:28,870
itself in their increased proclivity to 
fantasize and to dream and to,

1460
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,810
and to find like a,
a,

1461
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,750
a life inside of boxes that's 
predictable,

1462
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:36,730
unbearable,
really unbearable.

1463
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:40,510
Whereas a conventional person,
a conservative person isn't like that at

1464
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:42,490
all.
They find that routine soothing and,

1465
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:47,550
and uh,
and the exercise of that predictable 

1466
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:48,850
duty,
meaningful and sustaining,

1467
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,360
but a creative person that,
that just,

1468
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:53,800
it's just death for them.
Well,

1469
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:55,650
there's plenty of examples of,
of,

1470
01:15:55,740 --> 01:16:00,740
of creative artists who have had to 
endure the most horrible suffering and 

1471
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:06,180
just terrible material circumstances in 
order to pursue a singular creative 

1472
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:06,180
vision.

1473
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:07,960
And I mean,
that's absolutely amazing thing that you

1474
01:16:07,961 --> 01:16:10,330
think that people would voluntarily 
subject themselves to that.

1475
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:15,331
So it,
it makes you wonder is essentially 

1476
01:16:15,331 --> 01:16:15,331
voluntary.
I don't.

1477
01:16:15,331 --> 01:16:16,960
I don't know if it's worse.
It's alternative,

1478
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:21,610
the alternative is worse.
And so they are possessed to some degree

1479
01:16:21,611 --> 01:16:22,690
by genius,
you know,

1480
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:27,691
that's the genie,
it's a major thing to possess a person 

1481
01:16:27,691 --> 01:16:27,691
and,
and it's,

1482
01:16:27,691 --> 01:16:32,370
it's a,
it's a fundamental natural 

1483
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:33,010
manifestation.
So is it voluntary?

1484
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:35,830
You can either cooperate with it or get 
crushed by it.

1485
01:16:35,831 --> 01:16:39,430
I think that's basically the,
that's basically that your choice.

1486
01:16:39,431 --> 01:16:44,380
It's still a choice and you know,
you do interact with your creativity.

1487
01:16:44,381 --> 01:16:46,480
It's not like it just pours out of you.
It's,

1488
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,440
there's,
there's,

1489
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:52,470
there's work that needs to be done.
Even though the sources there in some 

1490
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:53,200
sense,
which is also extremely strange.

1491
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,110
It doesn't just pull her out,
although it does in some people,

1492
01:16:56,111 --> 01:17:01,111
but they all,
they'd have to have developed the 

1493
01:17:01,111 --> 01:17:01,111
expertise necessary for that to occur.

1494
01:17:01,111 --> 01:17:06,000
It still effortful and demanding more to
well it's effortful and demanding and we

1495
01:17:07,031 --> 01:17:08,740
can leave it at that.
So.

1496
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:10,050
Yup.
Yup.

1497
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:13,010
So what was back to the beginning of the
story,

1498
01:17:13,011 --> 01:17:16,610
since we're going to do the right thing 
from a musical perspective,

1499
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:20,450
you talked about being attracted to the 
avant garde,

1500
01:17:20,451 --> 01:17:25,451
poking up through in some sense because 
of your experimentation with integrating

1501
01:17:25,761 --> 01:17:30,761
that into pop songs,
but then that took you down this rabbit 

1502
01:17:30,761 --> 01:17:30,761
hole that,
that propelled you into your career as a

1503
01:17:30,761 --> 01:17:35,711
composer and,
and into moving to Europe and all of 

1504
01:17:35,711 --> 01:17:35,711
that.
So,

1505
01:17:35,711 --> 01:17:39,550
and you said that part of that was that 
you found some of what you were 

1506
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:43,820
listening to incomprehensible and that 
was a mystery to you wanted to pursue.

1507
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:48,821
It was that you see that as a 
manifestation of your musical ability 

1508
01:17:48,821 --> 01:17:53,591
trying to perfect itself.
You found something you admired and 

1509
01:17:53,591 --> 01:17:54,110
couldn't comprehend,
or what was it?

1510
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:56,450
Well,
first of all could,

1511
01:17:57,490 --> 01:18:02,490
could we,
could we exchange the term rabbit hole 

1512
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:04,741
for four gleaming field of light?
That's how I would characterize it.

1513
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,540
I think that's a little bit more 
accurate.

1514
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,160
Um,
well,

1515
01:18:09,161 --> 01:18:10,890
how can I,
how can I explain this?

1516
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,350
There's a dragon with every gaming field
of light,

1517
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,240
you know.
Now,

1518
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,410
one of the things I would say is that 
there are things that I,

1519
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:24,480
I would I would hear and I would 
instinctively know are are deeply 

1520
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:24,550
meaningful.
They are so,

1521
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:29,820
so meaningful that I almost can't begin 
to fathom their depths and you don't 

1522
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:30,610
necessarily understand them 
intellectually.

1523
01:18:30,611 --> 01:18:35,611
You don't understand what how they are 
made or or how they function or what 

1524
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:39,961
their component parts are,
but there's something in it that 

1525
01:18:39,961 --> 01:18:41,080
fundamentally speaks to you on a,
on a very,

1526
01:18:41,081 --> 01:18:44,500
very deep level.
I can't explain why that is.

1527
01:18:44,501 --> 01:18:48,130
I can't explain why certain things that 
I that I've heard or that I heard when I

1528
01:18:48,131 --> 01:18:51,890
was a teenager had that effect on me,
but they were they.

1529
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,840
They were like invitations into a,
into a,

1530
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:58,300
a,
a world of seemingly limitless potential

1531
01:18:58,301 --> 01:19:03,301
that you cannot refuse it.
It's like a form of fascination that 

1532
01:19:03,301 --> 01:19:05,740
grip the grip,
the grip by the mercurial spirit.

1533
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:06,330
You know,
what was that

1534
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,560
curious?
Is this thing that flips around that it 

1535
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:14,441
can't help but attract your attention.
The God mercury and he's an emissary of 

1536
01:19:14,441 --> 01:19:14,890
the gods,
right?

1537
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,700
Yes,
exactly that,

1538
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:19,100
and so if your interest is trapped by 
something like that,

1539
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:24,101
you find it spontaneously meaningful.
It is an invitation so you don't have to

1540
01:19:24,651 --> 01:19:26,900
follow it,
but if you do follow it,

1541
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:30,560
you'll find what you're being invited to
for better or for worse.

1542
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,420
Right,
right.

1543
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,120
Yeah,
it's,

1544
01:19:33,121 --> 01:19:38,121
it's an instinctive sense that this is 
something that is deeply meaningful and 

1545
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:38,900
you and you follow it and it takes you 
places.

1546
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,600
And so that's what happened with me.
I was listening to,

1547
01:19:41,601 --> 01:19:46,601
uh,
the composers have what's called the 

1548
01:19:46,601 --> 01:19:46,601
second Viennese school,
so that's a,

1549
01:19:46,601 --> 01:19:47,960
that's a,
a trio of composers,

1550
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:50,260
Barragan,
Barragan,

1551
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:52,310
uh,
who I was,

1552
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:55,030
it just instinctively fascinated by when
I was a teenager.

1553
01:19:55,060 --> 01:20:00,050
Now they're considered by some people to
be difficult composers to get into.

1554
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:02,990
It really depends on the,
on the work.

1555
01:20:02,991 --> 01:20:05,750
I would say there are pieces that are 
actually quite accessible,

1556
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:08,520
but there was something there that 
absolutely fascinated me.

1557
01:20:08,521 --> 01:20:13,521
And once I had,
once I understood that that world 

1558
01:20:13,521 --> 01:20:17,031
existed,
I found it extremely difficult to go 

1559
01:20:17,031 --> 01:20:18,180
back to what I had been doing 
previously.

1560
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:20,930
Now my music has absolutely nothing in 
common with,

1561
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,180
with theirs.
I mean it's,

1562
01:20:22,181 --> 01:20:23,670
it's stylistically very,
very different,

1563
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:26,850
so I,
it's not a question of wanting to do the

1564
01:20:26,851 --> 01:20:29,220
same thing necessarily,
but it just,

1565
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:34,300
it was a sign that there is a,
an enormous world of exotic knowledge 

1566
01:20:36,151 --> 01:20:38,550
and experience to be had if you only pay
attention.

1567
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:40,980
Well that's a good,
that's a good,

1568
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:42,930
uh,
what would you call it?

1569
01:20:42,931 --> 01:20:46,170
That's a good phrase to think about in 
relationship to life in general.

1570
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:48,780
So,
and it's a good thing for people to know

1571
01:20:48,781 --> 01:20:51,930
because you know,
if you're living a life that's devoid of

1572
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:56,931
sufficient meaning,
there is the probability that there's a 

1573
01:20:56,931 --> 01:20:57,930
bunch of things that you could be paying
attention to that would rectify that.

1574
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:01,410
It's not that simple because you can be 
at states of mind that make that very,

1575
01:21:01,411 --> 01:21:05,340
very difficult,
but it is nice to know that those gaming

1576
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:08,210
fields exist and that you can pursue the
flickers and,

1577
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:10,140
and,
and find out where you're going to go.

1578
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:15,580
All right,
so I'm gonna close this by pointing out 

1579
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,260
to everyone that Sam,
Andrea has a patriotic count,

1580
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:20,240
www.patrion.com
forward slash Samuel.

1581
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:21,660
Andrea,
is that correct?

1582
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:23,550
That's right.
All right,

1583
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:24,510
good.
And so,

1584
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,540
um,
if you're inclined to,

1585
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:28,620
to,
uh,

1586
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:31,600
indicate your support for his work,
at least visit his,

1587
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:36,340
his youtube website as well because Sam 
has been made a lot of videos,

1588
01:21:36,341 --> 01:21:41,341
a number of different videos helping 
guide people through the musical 

1589
01:21:41,341 --> 01:21:45,231
landscape,
the complex musical landscape and which 

1590
01:21:45,231 --> 01:21:45,231
seems to me to be a very useful 
endeavor.

1591
01:21:45,231 --> 01:21:49,700
So anyways,
thanks very much for talking to me and 

1592
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:53,870
with everyone that's listening and uh,
well I suspect we'll do this again in 

1593
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:54,090
the future.

1594
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,630
Yeah,
thank you for the invitation.

1595
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:57,560
I really appreciate it.
